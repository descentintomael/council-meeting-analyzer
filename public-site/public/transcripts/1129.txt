We will call the meeting to order and start with an invocation from Minister Chet Rutledge  from the Chico Church of Christ.  Welcome.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Council.  Will you bow with me, please?  Lord, we praise you for this beautiful day that you created for us,  the great creator, sovereign God who's in tune with everything that's happening  all over planet Earth and beyond.  Thank you.  We're mere children in your sight, yet we have big decisions in front of us.  We seek your guidance in all things, Lord.  Submit to your sovereignty and your greatness this evening.  And we praise you.  We praise you for extending life and your creativity  as we see all around.  We praise you for extending life presently  and giving us the hope of something eternal.  Thank you.  Thank you for your imagination.  Thank you for your vision.  Thank you for bringing us here together tonight  so we can extend our gratitude towards you, Lord.  And we thank you for this great country we live in.  We were reminded of that yesterday.  And we celebrate this amazing place we live in.  We know that there are...  faults and injustices.  Yet we strive to make this land better.  And we seek your guidance to do so.  We're thankful for this community we live in here in Chico.  We're thankful for the citizens here  and the life that continues to beat on and pulse on.  And we praise you for that, Lord.  We praise you for the leaders in our community,  the first responders, especially those who put their lives on the line  every day to help the citizens.  We pray for the citizens in this great community.  We pray for our businesses and our business leaders  and the commerce that is operative here in this Chico community and beyond.  We pray for that extension, Lord, goods and services.  We pray as well for the members of our council this evening.  We pray that a spirit of peace comes upon us tonight  and civility as we interact with one another  and seek your guidance, Lord.  But we pray that you will continue to do so.  We ask wisdom.  We ask for wisdom for our leaders here this evening,  our governing body.  And we pray that your spirit of peace and understanding  guide the council this evening and every evening  as we continue to extend your divine purposes.  In Jesus' name I pray.  Amen.  Amen.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Here we go.  Salute.  Pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible,  with liberty and justice for all ages and ages.  Amen.  All right.  Madam Clerk, can you do the roll?  Council Member Bennett.  Present.  Council Member Morgan.  Present.  Council Member Tandon is absent this evening.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Here.  Council Member Winslow.  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Here.  Mayor Coolidge.  Present.  All right.  And we will move on to our closed session announcement from today.  Is that right?  Yes, it is.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  The City Council met in closed session on the listed agenda items.  No action was taken and direction was given.  That concludes my closing.  I will now move to the closing session report.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  Speaker Card announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the Council on any item listed on the agenda must first complete  a Speaker Card which can be found at the back of the Chamber.  Once completed, please turn into the City Clerk.  To my left, to your right.  Speakers are taken in the order the cards are received.  And once the first speaker begins their comments,  no additional cards will be accepted on that item.  And we ask for no applause on any of the items or booing or anything in that nature.  So we'll move on to the consent.  Consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and can be enacted in one motion.  Are there any Council disqualifications or no votes or does anyone want to pull an item?  I'd like to just be reported as a no vote on item 2.3, please.  All right.  And then I want to pull 2.5.  All right.  Okay.  So we're going to pull 2.5 and we'll take item 2.1 through 2.4 and 2.6 and 7.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We do have two speakers on consent.  So we'll take those first.  Yep.  Our first speaker is James Hutchinson followed by Rob Berry.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  What time did you jump to now?  Pardon me?  What time are we at now?  Okay.  Because I was on the other one that was pulled.  That's why I'm asking.  We take all public comment now.  What?  We take all public comment for consent at this time.  Okay.  And public comments.  Last time I spoke here, I was in the office.  I spoke about something called Trank and fentanyl.  Local paper listing things that went on here at the meeting.  Considered that unimportant.  But on channel 7, a station that cares a little bit about these kind of issues and I've noticed  over the time, brought up that very issue several days later.  Not about what was said here, but what was being said about in the country.  You pointed out the same thing I pointed out.  It's existing.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry.  This is consent agenda.  I'm sorry.  Business from the floor.  I'm sorry.  My number is here.  It threw me when you threw the item off there.  Okay.  So we're doing 2.5?  Yes.  Okay.  My apologies.  Okay.  Tired.  Go ahead.  Okay.  The Home Key Program.  Here's the problem.  It makes it sound, if you just look what's on this agenda, it's a little bit more complicated.  It's like there's no city commitment in the long term.  The program itself has a 30-year commitment for the housing that they're going to do.  You've got $11 million that they're applying for, just applying for.  We're not being told.  We're told in, when we look at the papers from the staff and from what's here on the  agenda, we're being told, hey, you know, we got this property all picked out, but we're  not told what property.  Okay.  We're not told what's going to be done exactly with it.  We have no information, details.  We once again have the Jesus Center coming in.  We have no bidders.  Nobody else who's interested in this program.  You put it out to other people.  I don't see it.  I don't see it here at all.  I didn't see it in the staff report.  And I read it carefully.  I'm trying to figure out what the heck you're, why you're leaving so much out and not telling  us what's going on.  And that's something I brought up before, transparency.  I'm wondering with this council, why you're hiding these things.  You make deals with the Jesus Center in the back room.  You made a deal with the Jesus Center to change the name of the program.  You know, what was the point of that?  I talked to several people that were living out on the street.  Why in the hell aren't you in one of these programs?  I asked them that straight out.  Seven different people, District 6 and 7.  Okay.  And these are people who are still out there living in their own little camps.  They're still in those two districts.  Those districts have been served.  And guess what they said?  I'm not a Christian.  And this is only about Christians.  And they won't do anything for me because I'm not a Christian.  And when you put that in their face, they're going to say no, they're not going to do these  programs.  They're not going to get involved with it.  Thank you.  Rob Berry.  Good evening.  I'm speaking on item 2.5.  The grant application.  So Chico has become the home of a growing homeless industry.  I have something I've spoken about and written about for many years now.  It's largely, it's becoming one of the largest industries in Chico.  And it is largely unregulated, certainly by you.  And there is no limiting principle.  So as long as the state is willing to grant money to Chico.  The homeless industry will continue to grow.  Without any regard to what services are provided and so forth.  Now this has nothing to do with the merits of any particular project or any particular  nonprofit.  But so far, this council has exercised very little oversight or control of an industry,  which is continues to grow.  And your application now is standing to grow it even further.  Thank you.  I'm sure that you guys have not read the details of the application.  But let me make a couple of observations just from reading what was in the staff report.  For one thing, the presumption is that no general fund money is going to be allocated.  But it does require the city to accept an obligation of $250,000 a year.  And there absolutely is no obligation.  And there is no regulation or incentive on the part of the nonprofit to meet their operational  costs with their own operations.  If they make a mistake or something unexpected happens, the city of Chico is going to be  on the hook.  The second thing is that, as I said to you in my letter, the state of California is  happy for Chico or any other city to absorb much of the homeless population as they're  willing to absorb.  Okay.  And you know from your experience with the shelter crisis that the state doesn't just  sit on its hands once you adopt a proposal like the shelter crisis is a good example.  When you accepted the shelter crisis, the statute said one thing.  And after you've accepted it, they changed the statute to require you to do two annual  reports, which requires you to be even more deeply embedded in the homeless industry.  In my opinion, you made a huge mistake.  When you became an agent of the homeless industry through the Warren lawsuit.  And now you're deepening that commitment to the industry through a grant application,  which obligates you to do things which I suspect none of you fully understand.  So I caution you to be very careful about partnering with the state or nonprofits unless  you have some basis to understand what the performance is.  Do we really need another low barrier shelter?  Do we really need the state?  Do we need the state to dictate how to handle the homeless without any oversight from city  government?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Who's our last speaker?  All right.  How do you prefer we take these?  Well, you can, you typically always move to approve what's remaining on the consent agenda.  And I understand that there's a, Council Member Winslow voted no on item 2.3 and then item  2.5 was removed.  Right.  So if there's.  So we'll take 2.5 after.  Right.  All right.  So we'll do it for the rest.  The rest of the consent agenda.  Okay.  Motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Do we have a second?  Second.  All right.  Second from Council Member Winslow.  Okay.  Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay.  So that's a motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds and seconded by Council Member Winslow to approve  the consent agenda as read, which included ordinance of the City Council of the City  of Chico amending the zoning classification from RS-20-20.  Suburban residential, 20,000 square foot minimum lot size to R-1, low density residential  identified as APN 007-240034.  PR GoSol investments, LSC, RZ 21-01.  It also included ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico, California amending  chapters 5.42, 19.75 and 5R.42 of the Chico Municipal Code to make minor updates to commercial  cannabis permit process requirements.  And authorizing the Chico Police Department to utilize third party background check vendors  when deemed necessary.  The remaining ordinance is the ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending  certain sections of Title II of the Chico Municipal Code designating the Architectural  Review and Historic Preservation Board a subcommittee of the Planning Commission.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Council Member Williams.  Council Member Harris.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries seven with, excuse me, six with one absence.  Thanks for reading all this.  That's okay.  All right.  Item 2.5.  So I just had a question for staff on 2.5.  Obviously this is, we are just applying to see if we get the grant.  If we do get the grant and we find out that there's something in here that just isn't  workable or it is putting the city on the hook, we don't have to build or we don't have to  continue forward if we learn something.  Is that something else correct?  That is correct.  Okay.  So what's before you tonight is authorization to apply, as you pointed out.  I would fully expect most of these funds will go to Southern California and the Bay Area.  But if we were awarded anything, we would first receive a notice of award.  Next thing we would get is an agreement to actually get the award.  So there's our inflection point to accept it or not accept it.  And by then, and some of the speaker's points are exactly correct, there are a lot of details  that have not been worked out.  The problem we're facing, unfortunately, is shelter capacity is pretty slim.  So we are looking for any kind of alternatives we can for next steps for people at the, whatever  we want to call it, Pallet Shelter, Genesis Shelter.  So that we can continue enforcing.  Because, obviously, if that site is at capacity, our ability to do additional enforcements  would be severely restrained.  I think that, yeah, I think that pretty well answered your question.  Yeah.  That was basically, I am going to support applying for it, but I just wanted to make  sure that we had that ability and that I'm weary, we don't even know what the actual  cost is.  I think that's the basis of what the Genesis is costing us to run right now.  So I'm leery to take on more budgetary commitments, but I also understand where we're at.  So that was my questions and thank you.  We have further questions.  I just want to thank Vice Mayor Reynolds, those who are my concerns as well.  You eloquently posed them, so I'll not say anything more.  So I have a question.  So do we expect to have it back before Council?  You said there will be an agreement approved.  Does that agreement?  If we're even awarded.  Yeah.  But if we are awarded, will it come before Council?  Yes.  Yes.  Because we would put together some sort of a project.  We have a concept in mind, but there's a lot of work to do to get beyond just a concept.  Okay.  Yeah.  I just want to make sure we've got that on the record.  So good to do.  All right.  Do we have a motion?  Move to approve.  So moved.  All right.  Motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Second from Council Member Minoverby.  I'm just...  When you're ready.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries six with one absence.  All right.  Item three is public comments, which in the past has been called business from the floor,  but because we did a nice little Council training, we learned that, in fact, it should not be  business from the floor.  It is not business necessarily.  It is public comment.  So we are addressing it exactly as it should be addressed.  So please make a note that it is now addressed as public comments as item three.  And that is where members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter  not already listed on the agenda.  The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on a request made under this section  of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have four.  All right.  Three minutes each.  Okay.  James Hutchinson followed by William Monroe.  And if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle, that would be great if I have  called your name.  Thank you.  Fentanyl, Trank, carfentanil.  You know what carfentanil is, right?  You all know that one.  Ten times more deadlier than fentanyl.  Fifty times actually more addictive than fentanyl.  If you watch just media shows, watch movies, if you watched Whoopi Goldberg as a detective,  she brought up fentanyl long before you ever heard about it out here.  And why is that?  Fentanyl is an FDA approved drug.  You all know that, of course.  You all know that carfentanil is the more deadly version designed for animals.  For animals such as elephants.  Trank is another drug.  Trank is a drug that's designed for horse tranquilizer.  Combine the two, fentanyl and Trank, what do you got?  Deadly drug.  What do you got in the media out here?  Talking about it?  You people talking about it?  You looking on the task force?  Right now out there, Trank is not here.  Channel 7 report I just mentioned briefly earlier pointed that out.  It's not a drug.  It's not a combination that's hit here yet.  It's a cocktail.  And it's a deadly cocktail because you can take your little Norcan can, spray it, and  guess what?  The Trank will get them rather than the carpet.  And that is the problem.  You don't have a solution sitting out there you thought you had.  And the biggest problem with fentanyl, I first time ever talked about it here.  I told you about it.  The difference between demand and supply.  The real question here is what's the demand?  And the demand is the addictive qualities.  There's no demand for the idea of, hey, I want to go out and try fentanyl.  That's why they mix it with other drugs because people even addict addicts know better than  to deal with it if they're told.  But if they're not told, they become addicted.  They become readily and seriously addicted.  And now what's the problem?  Sure, you can save their life if you're lucky.  If they're not mixing it with another more deadly drug.  But the reality is addiction, addiction, addiction.  That's how they make their money.  That's what this is all about.  This is about addiction, and addiction leads to money.  And they're more than happy to let you go around telling people, oh, we can save your lives.  You can't.  You can't in all cases.  You need to get a program that gets people to do the real serious thing.  That's called 911 First.  And then you can try your can and hope that they're not mixed with another more deadly drug.  When the car fentanyl starts hitting the shores and start hitting this area, it's too late.  You've lost.  It's over.  Finished.  If you're not going to act in advance, forget it.  Thank you.  William Monroe followed by Ruth Sarnoff.  I didn't hear an action step there.  Okay.  I just am here to thank you.  I want to thank Mayor Coolidge for your proclamation of June as Pride Month.  Thank you so much.  It's an important recognition to make for this rather large percentage of the population who have been neglected and put down for centuries.  And are well deserving of a Pride Month declaration.  Hopefully next year it can be maybe not on the 26th of June, but on the 1st of June.  That would be nice.  Well, thank you so much.  And to the whole council for your support for this.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ruth Sarnoff followed by Sasha Onya.  Welcome back, Ruth.  We've missed you.  Good to see you here tonight.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, you don't read my emails, so I have to, I'm going to bring something in writing to you.  And there will be one for each of you.  My daughter has some posters here somewhere.  I don't know where she is.  She's at the back of the room with it.  No.  Oh, you can't read that all the way back there.  Oh, we can read it.  We can read it.  Okay.  Go ahead.  This was a cover to be able to bring some posters here and to participate.  Life has been very difficult in this last period.  So I'm just going to read you the posters.  And the titles.  And then I'm going to give you enough to everybody here to have a copy that wants one.  And that's my speech.  And I've already lost half of my time, unfortunately.  You should give extra time, by the way.  In some meetings, if you're Spanish speaking or you have an impediment or you're 91 years old,  then you get a little extra time.  That might work better in here.  And for those who don't know, I'm going to read you a little bit of my speech.  So if you were to watch the drive that I was given by Ms. Presson, you would know that  the police department chaired all of those meetings, and everybody else was pigeonholed.  They hardly knew what was going on.  So anyway, I'm going to read it.  And if you cut me off, maybe I'll throw all the papers up in the world there, and then  you don't have to pick them all up.  Okay.  The text of posters will be side one and side two, except for one-sided, most are two-sided, and I also have a banner.  Diesel smoke pollutes water.  Diesel trains, trucks, and barges in extreme heat and fog is a deadly combo.  Close down Diablo Canyon's Twin Towers nuclear facility now.  Also, San Onofre's nuclear facility in Southern California in the USA.  Durban, South Africa, 2001.  World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance.  That was in Durban, South Africa, and that was from 31st of August to the 7th of September of 2001.  And now, in 2023, we have kind of the same thing going on here.  We have racist, militarized police facing ongoing.  We have barbed wire and stuff down at the border.  And it's the border where the U.S. and Mexico together, and we have a treaty or understanding between them to go after people.  So Arizona is the nice hot desert on the other side.  All right.  Okay?  Thank you.  And please don't throw your papers in the air.  And maybe I'll get arrested tonight.  Yeah.  I'm going to keep reading.  Ruth, that's time.  I have another banner.  It's cold.  I know.  Water is light.  We've let you go over a little bit.  And I've got cold flowers in it.  And we're out of water.  And people are on the street.  And I was so happy to have you back, too.  It was announced today.  Thank you, Ruth.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And if you cut me out of this one, I'm going to watch you.  We gave you some extra time.  If you cut me out.  Ruth, thank you.  By the way, you're completely exposed.  You're a lawyer.  Ruth.  Ruth.  Okay.  Lawyers have already found what you're using.  You're out of order now.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We're not going to go there.  Thank you, though.  All right.  Who's our next speaker?  Our next speaker is Sasha, who's helping her.  You're interrupting your daughter's time.  Ruth, thank you.  Good.  You won't have to because we're very close to the grid going.  All right.  Go ahead.  You're not listening to anything anybody tells you.  Don't apologize.  For me?  Don't you?  Thank you so much.  I just wanted to say there's a great movie playing at the Cineplex.  What is it called?  Cineplex?  Cineplex.  What do we call it?  Tinseltown.  I wanted to say Tinseltown.  I don't get out enough.  So a great movie called The Sound of Freedom.  And if anyone hasn't seen it,  I encourage you to see this movie.  It is a true story.  It's fantastic.  And it talks about what's happening in the world of human trafficking,  and specifically children who are trafficked.  And the trafficking is happening at an exponential growth rate.  It is soon to overtake the drug,  the amount of drugs going on worldwide.  That is a huge amount of money on trafficking people.  And I just thought that this movie did one of the best jobs  at really explaining what's happening and to what degree.  And if it's happening,  one of the main things that they did say was that in the movie,  which is based on a true story of a former Department of Homeland Security,  um,  um,  um,  a person,  and he's,  he's saying very clearly that what's going on now is,  is,  is that the United States is the consumer and that the Mexican,  the kids coming in through Mexico are coming in for the consumers in the United States.  So the amount of pedophilia going on in this country is astronomical.  I never really see it in any of the newspapers.  How can it be getting ready to eclipse the drug?  The drug trade,  the illicit drug trade,  and it's never in the paper.  How is that possible?  This is a mind blowing thing.  The fact that it's children is even more mind blowing.  Why is nobody talking about this?  That means that in every single town in this state,  there's a huge amount of,  um,  trafficked pornography or child traffic children at risk.  So I just,  I guess the movie is,  really kind of,  it shocked me that this could be so widespread and it's not in the paper.  I read the paper all the time.  I don't see anything in there.  So I'd like to know when we might have a conversation in this town because it's got to be happening here too.  So that's it.  Um,  I encourage everybody to see the movie again.  It's called,  um,  but you remember sound of freedom.  Thank you.  What's the sound of freedom?  And it was,  again,  it shook me up pretty good.  So,  uh,  I recommend it for everyone in town.  Maybe not the kids.  Thank you.  All right.  Uh,  public hearings.  We have none moving on to the regular agenda.  I have a 5.1 consideration of a resolution approving transfer of APN 018 52002 to research associates.  And then we have a report from Mr.  Sorenson.  Thank you.  In October of 2018,  city council approved settlement entitlements for the stone gate development and that approval required,  a 132 acre conservation preserve be created.  Final page of your staff report has a map of the area that we're referring to.  The subject 15 acre parcel is the Dome Hill Schmidt Bauer preserve in the upper right hand corner of the map,  which is currently under city ownership.  The resolution before you allows the city to transfer the 15 acre parcel to Bruce Road Associates so that it can be consolidated with other lands to form the 132 acre conservation preserve.  So the recommendation is to approve the resolution before you. I'm happy to take any questions.  And Scott Berkey, who is a representative of the Stonegate development, is also in the audience, should you have any questions.  All right, questions? Seeing none, do we have any speakers?  We have one, James Hutchinson.  All right.  I want to thank the staff for the report. It was one of the better ones I've read in terms of being concise about some of the history and some of what's going to go on.  But it's like any staff report, you have to read it carefully and it said the devil's in the details.  And that's where the devil is on this one.  When you look at that report, you realize they're going to have to hire, once you transfer it to them,  they have a big interest in this.  What happens with it.  It's true, they're bound by laws, they're bound by agreements to conserve this land.  But who's managing it?  Take a look at that staff report.  Who is going to be managing that?  It will no longer be the City of Chico or the representative of Chico or anything like that.  It will be Bruce Road Associates.  And they say that they're negotiating with somebody right now.  If you read the staff report, you'll see that they're negotiating with somebody.  Very careful, look it over.  I kept looking for the name of who it is that's going to be managing.  We're not getting that.  That's a transparency problem again.  There's a devil in the details.  Who is managing it?  It's not here.  Perhaps they're willing to present it.  I realize they don't have to answer us out here.  But I think it should be.  Thank you.  All right. Discussion?  Can I just ask that question?  Do we have a clear idea of who's going to manage it?  Scott, if you want to know, and that's really not under the purview of the City,  that would be under the purview of the resource agencies.  I'm happy to answer the question more directly, though.  Scott Berkey, Land Use Counsel for Bruce Road Associates, LP.  Worked pretty hard on the Stone Gate project, so glad to be able to bring this item to you tonight.  The manager of the preserve will be probably an entity named the California Waterfowl Association.  They are an entity that has been approved by the resource agencies, CDFW,  the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in particular, and others.  And we've been working very closely with them in order to make this happen.  They do that management pursuant to a management plan,  and I think that is referenced in the staff report.  If I recall correctly, it's all very detailed,  and California Waterfowl Association, they're a good organization,  and we're proud to be able to work with them.  Would this be the first conservation trust that they're managing in Chico?  In Chico, I think it might be the first one that they're managing in Chico.  Yeah.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  All right.  I understand the motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Second from Councilmember Van Overbeek.  Okay.  Councilmember Bennett?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  All right.  Item 5.2.  The City of Chico Budget Appendix B-3.  An report from Chelsea Peebles, Director of Human Resources and Risk Management.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Council.  Before you tonight, we have a fairly simple proposition coming from our Public Works Engineering Department.  With the onboarding of Director Ottoboni  and our Deputy Director Gianco, they've done a thorough assessment of the department and the needs of the department.  And so they've come forward with the request to remove one FTE of a right-of-way agent, which is a management-level position,  and replace that with one FTE of associate planner,  which is a lower-level position.  This would result in savings to this city of approximately $25,000 per year.  I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.  All right.  Question?  Thank you.  No speakers?  No speakers.  All right.  I'll entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, second from Councilmember Winslow.  Okay.  Councilmember Bennett?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  All right.  Item 5.3, consideration of approval of supplemental appropriate budget modifications.  Report from Barbara Martin, Administrative Services Director.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of Council.  Tonight before you is supplemental appropriation, doing some various cleanup and activity adjustments.  We are doing some alignment with general fund revenue, sewer revenue, and airport revenue  projections.  And then also our roads fund for current projections with from BCAG for the regional surface transportation  program, RSTP exchange program revenue.  That is in the supplemental for you.  And then when we originally consolidated the streets and roads activities into one fund,  into 307, we moved all of the budgeted activities for the transportation fund to 307.  And then we moved all of the transportation funds into that fund.  It has now come to light that some of those activities aren't appropriate in that fund,  so we are now moving them back to fund 212, which is the transportation fund.  That's some transit service division and transportation planning and transportation depot divisions  that are moving back into that fund.  And then finally, there is a consolidation of some project costs for various projects  related to the computer-aided dispatch project.  Over time, that's been done.  That's been a long ongoing project, and there's been some various projects that we have established  for that purpose, and we're consolidating them into one with the remaining budget there.  And then also asking for an additional approximately $50,000 for some additional modules and features  that are recommended for that new system.  And I will answer any additional questions you may have.  Question?  No.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Speakers?  We have none.  Thank you.  resulted in...  resulted in...  resulted in... !  resulted in... ! Motion from Councilmember Van Overbeek. A second from Vice Mayor Ranz. Councilmember Bennett. Councilmember Bennett.

All right. Item 5.4, consideration of approval of supplemental alteration.  Number 2023, FD001.  And we have a report from Fire Chief Steve Sandrich.  Sure.  Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council Members, good evening.  I'm here today on behalf of the Fire Department asking for approval of a supplemental appropriation for two specific items.  I'll try to make this as brief as possible, leave questions for each one.  The first request is for the tablet command.  It's a program necessary for us to get and make the current CAD system,  the computer-aided dispatching system,  that we have just implemented has been very problematic from a Fire Department standpoint.  And we were anticipating this doing our due diligence before we made the decision to go towards RIMS  and spoke to five departments, the five biggest departments that had RIMS,  and we got the same information from each department that it was problematic from a Fire Department standpoint  as it was a police department-based CAD system.  Okay.  And then they started adding in Fire Department to help make it more applicable to both sides of the house.  Of those five departments, three of them utilize tablet command as an interface over the CAD system  to make it more functional for the Fire Departments themselves.  We wanted to give it some time prior to asking for this request  because we wanted to see if the upgrades that they had indicated they would be making would be sufficient.  Unfortunately, at this point, they aren't.  And so we're asking for tablet command.  We're having issues related to the CAD system right now on unit tracking and statusing adequately and accurately enough,  real-time unit routing and mapping to calls,  reliable mobile command terminal functionality quite frequently, early on especially,  but still to this day we have problems with MCTs locking up and then having to reboot them  or having to reboot.  We're trying to get them to reboot them on a regular basis to avoid that.  Usable layers, especially hydrants and addresses,  and then functionality of its mobile version,  which would allow for greater use with other products such as iPhones and tablets.  The benefits of the command tablet program is that it will allow us to integrate with real-time dispatching  so we get that information that flows directly through the program,  gives us better access to informational layers,  more accurate routers, us better access to informational layers, more accurate routing and AVL resource tracking, incident command and situational awareness tool that allows us to look at all the resources and actually be able to move them into the positions that they are on the fire ground  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  That includes year one implementation and then the maintenance fee for that year.  And then year two will be 67,000.  Years two and three is 67,300 or $33,650 per year maintenance fee.  Then from there on, IS will come in and be able to budget for in future years.  For any of the technical questions you may have,  Josh is in the audience from IS and he can answer those questions if I'm unable to do so.  So I'll stop here to see if there are any questions relative to the TAB command.  All right.  Move on to the second request.  Second request is funding to put into place a cancer screening program  that is called the Gallery Grail Screening Test.  And it takes...  Tests for 50 different types of cancers using a DNA,  a new process for DNA recognition of certain markers.  And those markers are inherent in 50 plus different cancers.  From a firefighter standpoint, back in 2010,  NIOSH did the most comprehensive study on firefighter cancer.  And they determined that firefighters have a 9% higher risk of being diagnosed with cancer.  And surprisingly, 14% higher than the general population of dying from cancer.  Specific to firefighters as a whole,  what they found is that we have 11 different cancer types  that are significantly higher than that of the general population,  with two of them being 100% more likely of obtaining those cancers than the population.  And that's...  Malignant mesothelioma and testicular cancer.  And then esophageal is at 62% higher.  And then...  I'm not even going to try the last one, so 53%.  And then the rest go down from there.  There are only two that this particular test does not recognize,  and that's the multiple myeloma and brain tumors.  And then the rest go down from there.  And then the rest go down from there.  With that being said,  we've taken a lot of efforts on a national level in the industry  to really be proactive operationally  to minimize the impact and exposure to carcinogens.  So fire departments, including our own,  have taken efforts to make sure that we have operational things in place,  such as having two pairs of bunker gear.  So,  crews can swap them out and clean the old ones,  and still have a pair or a set of bunker gear  that will allow them to continue to operate.  Keeping bunker gear away from living space  and in a well-ventilated area within the firehouse.  Decontamination by cleaning them on a regular basis  and immediately after a structure fire.  And we'll continue...  We'll continue to evaluate different efforts  to continue to make that happen.  The one area, however, that we've really struggled with,  and that's true of anybody that has concerns about cancer,  is a viable multiple variable test  on a number of different cancers that can be detected.  So this particular test is relatively new  and has had extremely good results thus far.  It's still in the research,  realm.  Thus, the FDA has not yet approved it,  but it has proven so far to be fairly accurate  and is by far the best test we have available to us.  Right now, we only have two tests  that firefighters have to pay out-of-pocket for.  Prostate, for prostate cancer,  and ovarian,  and peritoneal,  and fallopian cancer.  And then other than that,  there's no other tests that we have available.  There's only two tests that we do in-house.  This would give us an in-house ability  to test for up to 50 different cancers,  as I've said.  And of those,  nine of them are in the top 11  of what we're susceptible to.  With respect to the general population,  this test actually,  for both men and women,  capture 10 of 10 for male,  top cancers for males,  and 8 of 10 for,  for the general population for females.  So it has some applicability, potentially,  for the broader community  or the broader city,  the city staff,  if it were to prove useful.  So why are we looking to get funding for this?  We know that there are ramifications,  so the justifications that I'm using  to ask for this supplemental,  is that we don't have a consistent testing process,  certainly not as broad or as deep as this one is.  It gives us an opportunity to get early detection  of firefighter cancer and treat it aggressively,  and therefore we can potentially preserve careers,  ensure the impacts on family and the personnel  that's involved are limited,  and give our firefighters peace of mind  that they have an opportunity to catch it early.  From a city standpoint,  there are long-term work comp staffing issues.  And as you may be aware,  we've had three long-term cancer-related work comp cases,  two of which led to line of duty deaths.  Captain Joe Duran in September 12th of 2018,  and Captain Steve Andrews in May of 21.  And we have a third one that's been out coming up on a year,  and we don't know  if he'll return or not, and we're hopeful he does,  but if he doesn't, it would certainly speak  to the necessity of trying to get ahead of this,  so we don't have any additional problems going forward.  The potential work comp claims,  this is a minimal amount of money  that the city pays out in one form or another,  either through direct costs or indirect costs,  averages about $340,000 per claim.  And that doesn't include the cost  of increased overall premiums  when we have a significant number  of long-term work comp leaves of absence.  So with that being said,  I will entertain any questions that you may have.  Questions?  Chief, so the research I've done,  I have some family members involved in DNA-related research,  and this is very exciting technology, and it works.  And my main question is the commitment  that we're making under this program,  because at some point this is gonna be approved by the FDA,  and insurance companies are gonna reimburse,  because obviously the sooner they catch cancers,  the less expensive it is for them to deal with it.  So they have every incentive to approve it.  So my question for you is, this is a 70,000 dollar program,  and it's a seven-year agreement.  If in year three, Blue Cross comes back and says,  okay, we're gonna approve,  can we get out of the agreement with Grail  and have the insurance company pick it up?  This would be a year-by-year thing.  So they've committed to us $640 per firefighter,  and then to extend that to family members,  retirees, and so forth.  So they've committed to that.  I couldn't tell you if it's gonna be seven to eight years.  Well, actually, if you're, what you,  I think you've answered the question.  You said we can renew it every year.  To my knowledge, we do.  Great, thank you.  And I wanna be cautious, also indicate that  we're not screening every firefighter.  They have to meet certain criteria.  One is they have to have five years of firefighting,  professional firefighting experience,  either in the wild land or in the municipal environment,  and they have to be 40 years or older.  So it's not going to hit every firefighter immediately,  and as time goes on,  because we'll have a wave of people that come in  that don't have that timeframe working for them.  And we'll make this also available to retirees  and some of our volunteers  who've had significant exposures as well,  that they may wanna get ahead of it on their own.  So I think there's a lot of benefit to doing this.  Part of the reason we're asking for the supplemental  is right now it is not covered,  at least it's not as black and white  as being covered under our current insurance.  And we've actually gotten two different determinations.  Today, I was able to confirm that it requires a physician  to make the request for the test.  And then that goes up through to Anthem  for it to be put into medical, made a medical necessity.  And the authority board that oversees that  then makes a determination whether it's an approved  or a denied.  night. And so it would create a lot of dysfunction if we had different doctors assessing it either  within Anthem or with their private provider. So this allows all our firefighters who are  eligible to get it and it just makes it standardized. And it really becomes a benefit  to the city itself if we're able to get ahead of it. All right. Other questions?  All right. Thank you. Speakers? Yes, we have two. James Hutchinson followed by Mike Healy.  I've worked in computers. I've worked in medical lasers. I have some background in some of the  areas you're talking about now. I've worked in  computers in the early 70s through the end of the 90s working for a laser company that was  developing one of the first tattoo removal lasers. I've also hacked computers, an international  company. I did so to protect some people and it turned out I was right. The company had done some  little unorthodox things they should not have been doing. But on this particular issue, I really  thought it was a good idea to do this. I think it's a good idea to do this. I think it's a good  idea, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank  you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank  you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank  you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank  you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank  you, thank  you, thank  thank  thank , thank  The report from the fire department said essentially that a major test was underway in England right now  in order to confirm the viability of this system with thousands of people participating in it.  And it hadn't been completed yet.  Okay.  FDA has not completed approval of the system.  In short, you're rolling the dice.  Yeah, it may work.  It may work perfectly.  And then again, we recently had a woman who had a wonderful little blood test tube  who claimed to be able to predict all kinds of things from it.  We rated her worth billions of dollars until we found out that the data was fraudulent  and that, in fact, the system didn't work.  And she's spending considerable time in jail now.  It's sad, but I think you really need to think about it for a minute.  Are you going to roll the dice?  Yeah, you might.  If you're lucky, you might save a life or two, and that would be great.  I've never opposed anything that the fire department has thrown out here  because I've been very pleased with what I see, very happy with it.  But I'm very concerned that you're playing with something that hasn't reached a conclusion yet.  You're playing with something that's still being tested, still hasn't absolutely been proven.  It's shown some reliability in some of the more common cancers,  but it hasn't shown an overall ability that it claims that it can do.  In the long run, I think you should be a little bit hesitant and look at this a little more.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mike Healy.  Evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmembers, and all attendants.  I'm representing the Chico Firefighters Local 2734 IAFF Chapter.  To bring further context, Chief spoke about the gallery testing issue.  Occupational cancer is in.  Unfortunately, an inherent risk in our occupation,  and one that we accept, among others, for the privilege to serve the Chico community.  Although new evidence identifying the occupational hazards of cancer in our workplace are emerging every day,  this is not a new issue.  In 2007, the International Association of Research on Cancer identified the carcinogens  and the occupational hazards in our workplace as harmful to human life.  According to the International Association of Firefighters,  cancer caused two-thirds. Association of Firefighters, cancer caused two-thirds of line-of-duty deaths of career U.S. firefighters between 2002 and 2019 in the United States. In 2019 alone three-quarters of the names added to the International Association of Firefighters memorial wall of honor for fallen  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  resulted in  due to occupational cancer.  I chief mentioned fire captain Steve Andrews.  Captain Andrews passing from occupational cancer  was preceded by another of our own fire captain,  Joey Duran in 2018.  In addition to the two members of our department  who have passed away from occupational cancer,  we currently have a third member who is battling cancer  contracted through his years of dedicated service  to our community.  Our department has been aggressive  in addressing these challenges  and has implemented measures to reduce cancer exposure  through education, equipment,  and training on proper decontamination procedures  following incidents.  However, some sources of carcinogens and risk factors,  including diesel exhaust, sleep disturbances,  and even the equipment we wear to protect ourselves  during fires are all hazards we cannot control for.  This is why early detection is so critical.  The gallery testing program  would provide early detection capabilities  for over 50 types of cancer  including those that are most common to firefighters.  Earlier detection would ultimately lean  to bore successful treatment outcomes  and provide peace of mind to our members.  Chico Firefighters Local 2734  asked for your support of this program  which will greatly benefit our organization.  And I thank you for your time and consideration.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr. Our last speaker.  Discussion?  Motion.  I would like to respond to a point that Mr. Hutchinson made  about the efficacy of the technology  and just briefly explain how it works,  which is why I have so much confidence in it.  So we each have a unique DNA signature.  Every one of us does.  And what this technology does, when you have cancer,  it means that the DNA has been altered.  And that has a different signature than your normal DNA.  And each form of cancer has a different DNA.  It's a different signature.  We have the technology now to very precisely  take apart DNA and look at,  identify the DNA that's specific to each person  as well as the DNA for these diseases.  And so the technology underlying this is sound  and the equipment to do the diagnostics  is very well developed.  So I don't have doubts about that.  I'm looking forward to seeing the efficacy of this approach.  Anyone else?  Was that a motion to move to approve?  Okay.  All right, motion from council member Vanden Overbeek.  Second from council member Winslow.  Okay.  Council member Bennet.  Yes.  Council member Morgan.  Yes.  Council member Tandon.  Oh, sorry she's absent.  Council member Vanden Overbeek.  Yes.  Council member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  All right, item 5.5 Brown Act  and hybrid meeting participation.  This is an information only item.  We have a verbal report from city attorney Vincent Yu.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, honorable council.  I'm going to talk with you today about the updates  to the Brown Act pursuant to assembly bill 2449  and formerly assembly bill 36, 361, which is now expired.  As you know, the California Brown Act,  also known as government code section 54950 at SEC,  requires your meetings to be open and public,  available to members of the community to attend.  Your meetings are to be noticed on a 72-hour basis.  If it's a special meeting, it's a 24-hour basis.  And if you're going to conduct your business,  it's to be within the city jurisdiction of Chico.  And specifically, what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic is  a state of emergency was declared by the state  of California, specifically the governor, and it allowed  for remote participation in public meetings.  That state of emergency has now changed.  It's been rescinded and lifted.  And many public agencies such as Chico have gone back  to meeting in person.  With respect to the old way that members of the city council,  who could attend meetings pursuant to the Brown Act remotely,  so this is the Brown Act, the old version,  you were allowed to attend remotely, say,  if you were on vacation or you were outside of the jurisdiction  of the city of Chico.  The way that you would do that is you would provide 72-hour  notice of your location on the agenda.  You would post on the location of where you are  that you were meeting, and you would have to provide access  to that location to the public to provide comment  to the public meeting that you were attending remotely.  Those changes, that's the old way of doing business pursuant  to the Brown Act.  Some of those ways have now changed in light  of the recent pandemic.  I'm going to highlight now some of the changes in the law  that is in effect to date.  As I mentioned, since Chico rescinded its state of emergency  on October 4, 2022, the AB 361 Assembly Bill,  it's the Resolution Bill,  it's the AB 361, no longer applies to the city of Chico.  In communities throughout the state of California  where that was not rescinded and public agencies continue  to adopt a resolution saying, you know,  for whatever reason we're continuing to meet remotely,  the elements of AB 361 applied and continue to apply  until January 1, 2024.  But again, Chico is not in those circumstances  because the state of California is not in the state of California  and the state of Chico.  So, in October 4, 2022, it took action  to rescind its state of emergency.  Now, I'll go over the Assembly Bill 2449  to address your remote participation requirements  under that law as revised.  That law is the Brown Act.  So, a quorum must be located in the jurisdiction of the city  of Chico in order to consider a member's remittance  to remote participation in anticipation  of an upcoming meeting.  When that member wants to participate,  that member should provide notice to the city clerk about his  or her desire to participate remotely.  The way of what the council or the quorum must do  at the meeting where it's all located in the same location,  and so for purposes of shorthand,  I'll just say a quorum is present  in the city council chamber.  but it's considering the remote participation of one  of its council members for one  of the identified reasons set forth in that Assembly Bill.  I'll go over those reasons in a moment.  The city council must take action that it's going to accept  that member's participation in the meeting remotely  at the meeting that's about to take place.  Now, there may be some circumstances  where the council member may not be able to provide notice  in 72 hours advance.  And that's not necessarily the case.  an advance notice to the clerk or the council that he  or she wishes to participate remotely.  One example would be, let's say that the council member under,  experienced some sort of emergency  and they were hospitalized.  And that emergency happened 24 hours before the meeting occurred.  Well, in that instance, of course,  you couldn't provide the 72-hour notice to the city clerk  and to the council members.  It couldn't be posted on the agenda,  and you wouldn't have the opportunity to take up that out,  until the actual meeting itself.  Nevertheless, you're allowed to take up that item and say,  council member X has notified us that he or she is incapacitated  and needs to participate remotely because of that emergency.  You would consider that item, and then you would take action  on it to allow or not allow that participation remotely.  Now, with respect to the types of just cause that are set forth  in the Assembly Bill, we will be looking at,  you know, the  Here are some of them.  It's an inexhaustive list, but child care purposes are one  of the reasons that are provided for council members  or members of public agencies to meet remotely pursuant  to this Assembly Bill.  Contagious illness, so if you have something that you can pass  on to other people, that can be a reason as well.  You have a physical or mental disability.  Now, I'll be very candid with you.  Us attorneys, we're debating that mental disability part  because that's also a disqualifying factor  under different portions of the government code,  and probably under your council rules, where if you're,  if for whatever reason, because of mental disability,  you're not able to carry out the functions of your job,  then you may not be able to participate in the meeting.  So, however, it's listed in the Assembly Bill,  so I'm letting you know about it.  Is there room for some cleanup of this Assembly Bill?  No doubt there is.  Also, travel while on official business.  Say you're traveling somewhere else on official Chico business,  but you're not here in the city of Chico,  that would be another example of a just cause reason you could,  you know, request to participate remotely.  Now, you can only utilize this section.  This is not the old version of the Brown Act,  but this is the new version twice a year.  And that you, again, you want to provide a general description  to the city clerk and your colleagues  about why you must appear remotely.  Some of the other requirements for the emergency circumstances,  I mentioned family emergency, physical emergency,  and the other requirements for the emergency circumstances,  and it requires that you also request you provide a general  circumstance, I covered that.  But you also need to let the city clerk know  and the council know if you have a member who's a member  of your family or someone who's over 18 present with you  at your location while you're participating remotely.  Say you're in a hotel room and it's your son or daughter  and they're over 18 years old, you need to let the city clerk  know and the city council know that that person is present.  What you don't need to do, as you had to do  in the prior Brown Act version, is you don't need to place notice  on your door that members may participate or, you know,  council member X is participating  in this meeting remotely at that location.  You don't have to provide that location on the agenda  and you don't have to let the public participate  from that location as to where you are.  In addition, you are to participate through both audio  and visual technology.  No, you're not.  You're resulted, not only by the phone,  and you may only participate for three consecutive months,  or 20 percent, of the regular meetings for the local agency  within the calendar year, or more  than two meetings if the legislative body regularly  meets, greater than 10 times per year.  Now, as I mentioned, there's, there's room  for some clean-up legislation,  we anticipate that that will happen,  there's some areas here that are just not very clear,  one thing that we, that I've learned, personally,  just through experience, is,  if you are having this meeting and one of you all is attending remotely and somehow there's a  technological failure, then the action cannot continue to go forward while that technological  failure is pending or is taking place. Because the idea is that the members of the public who are  maybe tuning in remotely or tuning in are actually here in person, because of that technological  failure, you have to actually stop that action, see if you can fix things. If you can't fix things,  you have to essentially move that item to the next regular meeting, regularly adjourned meeting  for further action. So that constitutes a highlight of an evolving, the ever-evolving  Brown Act and the public meeting participation requirements. Again, I want to stress that  under the old version, you needed to post somewhere on your, wherever you were, hotel room, apartment,  cabin.  You know, that you're attending this meeting. You needed to provide public access to that location.  The public needed to be given an opportunity to speak from that location where you are. Probably  not the most ideal thing to do. And then under the new requirements, you're not required to do that  anymore. You can do so, you can participate remotely, but you have to get a quorum located in  the subject matter jurisdiction of Chico. Essentially, that's a quorum of you all to take up the item  to say,  Council Member X can participate in this meeting remotely as noticed on the agenda, and we're going to go on to the regular agenda as follows.  That concludes my update. If you have any questions, I'm happy to try to answer them.  All right. Questions?  Thank you very much.  Always interesting.  All right. We'll move on to reports and communications. City managers report, Mr. Scherzer.  No reports.  All right. Council Member.  Requests presented to AP and B 1010. Council members can make verbally requests and item B agendas at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority vote of the council is needed for staff to advise. Do we have any requests?  Mayor Coolidge.  I don't have a council member request. However, we did have one speaker on the Brown Act.  Oh, mine says informational.  Well, it is, but it is on the regular agenda, so we would take speakers.  Okay.  So that's James Hutchinson.  All right. Come on down.  Yeah, we'll have to redo the city manager report too.  I'll do my best to keep it short.  One of the big concerns I have when I look at the Brown Act is that essentially right now as it is, I'm more concerned about  individual people out in this community that can't participate in the discussion that goes on here than I am so much what goes on in terms of council members being able to vote or not.  I think there's very few issues that have come here where or cases where we needed to have a particular input from council members.  But outside of here, when El Monte, for instance, was brought up for...  I think there's very few issues that have come here where we needed to have a particular input from council members.  I met a woman the next day.  I was out cleaning on Forest Avenue, picking up garbage along there.  And she walks out to her car after I had talked about the issue and said, you know, I wanted to be there.  I wanted to be there real bad because we've lived here for years.  We wanted to participate in this, but my husband was sick.  I couldn't leave him.  There's nothing I could do.  Isn't there some way I can communicate?  Be honest.  I go, yeah, you could have written him in advance.  She said, I didn't know until almost the last.  So she didn't have time to really get to you people and say something.  But what she had was very important because her family had lived in that area for over 20...  She had lived there over 20 years.  Family had...  We'll date it even further back than that.  And the stories of what goes on there, what you would have been dealing with by annexing this on to problems.  If you'd heard it from her...  I think you would have...  You wouldn't have been swayed.  You still would have annexed on.  But I think you would have been quite impressed with her grasp of the issues was.  And she couldn't get to you.  She couldn't get a message to you.  She watched it on TV.  And she saw my presentation.  She recognized me.  It made me feel good because she said, yeah, you were right.  Thank you.  It's the only person that ever came up to me and said, yeah, you were right after meeting.  No, it's not true.  There's a number of people.  In fact, I talked to seven different people after that.  At their event, six of them agreed with me.  One of them didn't.  And all of them lived there in that area.  I walked that area.  It's not far from where I live.  And easy to talk to them.  They're very nice people along that area.  So I'm concerned about the Brown Act.  I'm concerned more about reaching out beyond here and getting people involved that have something to give.  I'm concerned about giving important issues to them, important issues to you, and giving them a chance to get their message here in person.  Because it's a whole thing.  You know, well, we tried on it.  I understand what the new Brown Act is.  It does need a lot of work.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  So no City Manager's report tonight.  Councilmember requests?  No Councilmember requests.  So with that, we will adjourn.  Thank you very much.  See you in August.  Thank you.  Thank you.
