 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We'll start with our invocation by Chaplain Mary Ann Hawkins. Let's pray. God, you are mighty and powerful, even when we are weak. You are compassionate and merciful when we are unfeeling or uncaring. We give you thanks tonight for our city council, our mayor, our police chief, and all of those who are diligently seeking the best for our city. We humbly ask for your continued protection against fire and flood. Thank you for all those who serve in the fire department and search and rescue. We pray for your comfort for those across our land who are suffering from such devastation. We pray especially for those impacted by the flooding in Kerrville, Texas. Grant them your peace. As the council debates the items on the agenda, we pray for your understanding and wisdom. We will give you thanks and praise for hearing our prayer. Amen. Thank you. Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. Salute and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Councilmember Winslow is gone. Vice Mayor Bennett? Here. Mayor Reynolds? Here. Speaker Card Announcement. Anyone wishing to address the council on any matters listed on the agenda? On the agenda, should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the chambers. Once completed, turn your card into the city clerk and the speakers are taken in the order they are received. Once the first speakers begin, no additional cards will be taken. Persons demonstrating rude, boisterous speaking on matters outside the jurisdiction of the City Council or engaging in otherwise disruptive behavior will be called to order. If such conduct continues, I may call a recess requesting removal of such persons from the council chamber, adjourn the meeting, and or take up the meeting.

Closed session announcement city attorney john lamb. thank you mayor and city council earlier this evening the by staff and the city council recessed in closed session. All council members were present with exceptions of council member winslow who was absent for all items in closed session 2.1 through 2.4. Council member van overbeck recused himself for item 2.4 due to living within 500 feet of the project area boundaries. With respect to item 2.1 the city council was briefed by staff direction was provided no final action was taken there. 2.3 council was briefed direction was provided no final action and 2.4 council was also briefed no final action was taken on that. That concludes my report. thank you. Consent agenda all matters on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and can therefore be enacted with one motion. Do we have any disqualifications on consent agenda? I' m going to disqualify myself from 2.4. I' I' d like to pull item 2.3 off the consent agenda. any further? do we have any speakers for consent? we have two. first one is samuel barber followed by grace marvin. hello. m going to ask about the! I think it' s pretty well documented at this point it' s an objective failure. It hasn' t really led to less drug problems. We see people right on the lawn out here struggling with addiction. I think we could probably look a little outside of the box. Probably some like city funded mental health services. Things that help get people into city jobs. Just other options other than continuing to punish s great when you find someone that sells drugs. I' m not promoting people to illegally sell drugs. But as soon as you find one person there' s another person popping up. It doesn' t really seem to be stopping or decreasing in frequency. I would just appreciate if the council maybe put some thought and effort into some other ideas outside of just punishment and jail. thanks. our next speaker is grace marvin. public comments? okay. good evening. yes. I' m sure that everyone here is very upset about the killing at the campground at cohasset and eaton today. and I hope this is a lesson to all of us that we need to have a much better managed campgrounds. but very humane and caring. and to use the traveling shelters that charles with hoon has and that even some churches have agreed to put up. and we are going to have to so that we can do a better job of taking care of our fellow citizens. thank you. she is our last speaker. all right. I will consider a motion on everything except for 2.3. move to approve. I' ll second it. okay. all right. and that was a motion and a second to we will move to consent for further discussion. and with councilmember o'brien being disqualified on item 2.4. councilmember goldstein. aye. councilmember holly. yes. councilmember o'brien. yes. councilmember van overbeck. yes. vice mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. sure. I would be happy to. I feel that not all the factors were properly communicated to council. I don't believe that we had enough time to discuss all of these things. firstly, I understand it is my understanding and staff correct me if I am wrong that we had already been in negotiations with aero flight and they had signed paperwork and send it back to the city in order to move forward with that process. So I feel like in either scenario we will be going back on our word. And secondly some evidence that was brought forward from the appellant. thank you Mr. Spell I don' t believe was justified for example having evidence of the city cashing checks while he was currently occupying the hangar and had been a long-term tenant and should have understood when you occupy a hangar even if you don' t have a signed lease you should be paying the thank you for more discussion. any other questions? council member goldstein. I will share my thoughts on that this was a really hard contentious decision I felt we were weighing on one hand the city' s word to one person and therefore our perception of being trustworthy with our word to people who want to do business with us. increase our reliability to another company and putting the airport to the highest and best use which is also part of our obligation to our taxpayers. So I am conflicted on this one I also feel there may have been a bit of there was perhaps a perception that the appellant was working with this other country other company to work out some kind of agreement and then we were told afterwards that that had not happened. And so I' m not sure I had all of the most accurate information at that meeting. all right. thank you madam mayor. It sounds like councilwoman holly is suggesting that we reconsider this. yes. I think it would be that happens and council member requests at the end. this is mayor council if I may as you recall the last council meeting there was considerable discussion during the public hearing direction was provided to take a tentative vote and direct staff to bring back a resolution consistent with that vote. so what we have done tonight is brought forward that resolution. we are not here to open the public hearing again. I think council has the option of not approving tonight' s resolution and directing staff to bring this item back so that way all the facts that are now being discussed can be brought back within that framework so that it' s part of the administrative record. I have some concerns about discussing evidence here outside of that public hearing. okay. thank you john. can I ask a follow-up? m going to ask a follow-up question this might be for Mr. Sorensen. If we were to bring this back to council do you believe that aero flight would be open to renegotiating leasing that space or is that past due? is it just too late? I think we' ve concluded negotiations they did go through the process obtained airport commission approval. they are still agreement and their operations in chico. they have already signed the agreement. the decision from last city council meeting has not negated their interest? no. okay. it sounds like the process if we were to reconsider this would be to at the end of the meeting request that it be brought back? no. we' re voting on this resolution either yes or no and then we can have debbie or the city attorney. let me pose a question. we' ve encountered this situation in the past I think more in land use decisions where we get to this phase and the item before you is a resolution to uphold the appeal. is that a resolution that if that resolution passes then the decision of the airport commission to approve the lease with aero flight has been reversed. if it does not pass then the airport commission' s approval of the lease with aero flight would stand. I don' t know if you want to add to I would only say that I think that needs to be clear in the record that it would stand in that situation. yes that' s correct. if the council here were not to approve this particular resolution and indicate that it' s not adopting a resolution to begin with then the decision of the airport commission would stand. does anybody else? is that clear on everybody up the yes vote is to adopt the resolution and no vote is to not adopt the resolution and then the airport commission finding stands. what I thought I heard the city attorney say was a no vote would mean that it would go back to staff for an alternative no? okay I misunderstood thank you. so yes is a resolution upholding Mr. Speltz' recommendation. that was made with aero flight. ready for a motion? I would invite any of my colleagues to give further input if they have any questions of why I hold this opinion. I stated pretty clearly last time how I felt on it I think you and I are on the same page we need to do the highest and best use and aero flight from my understanding maybe commission to use it and staff it and use it for furthering and growing the airport and I think that' s super important for us right now. do you have anything? that' s correct they do intend to maintain full use of the space if they were to occupy it. thank you. any further discussion? open to further comments on this. see if member holly had more to add. that' s all my reasoning I don' t believe this resolution is consistent with the priorities of the council or the best use of our community. I' d make a motion to not adopt the resolution for the speltz airport commission hangar finding. is that worded correctly? motion to not adopt. second. point of order is that the council is not going to vote on this resolution yes or no? isn' t that how the process works? I think the initial vote is to vote on this resolution as recommended in the sense that that was the direction from the council at the last meeting was to bring this back. I think the council should make a decision on this resolution and then decide after that how to go forward. we' ll vote on 2.3. there' s a motion and a second to adopt the resolution as stated which would. I think we need another. I think the motion is to on 2.3. it' s to adopt it. if you vote yes you' re adopting it if you vote no we are not adopting it. that is correct. I think we need the motion I heard was not to adopt. sorry. strike that. change that to adopt the resolution that' s on the agenda and then we would go to the voting. is that? councilmember goldstein. yes. the motion on the floor is to adopt the resolution. no vote or yes. okay. so I' m going to vote no. councilmember holly. no. councilmember o'brien. yes. councilmember van overbeck. yes. vice mayor bennett. no. okay. I thought she had said. sorry. 2.4. I got you all confused down there. I' m sorry. it' s my fault. I have a checkmark in for councilmember winslow. who is absent. it fails. the motion to adopt the resolution upholding the appeal and overturning the airport commission action did not pass. all right. thank you. thank you. do we need to do anything further? at this time if there' s subsequent motions on it. it will come back on a future agenda. yes. okay. perfect. public comment. members from the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda and are within the jurisdiction's authority. the council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. how many speakers do we have? we have 13. and I' okay. I' ll call the first two. the first two speakers and if you could go ahead and line up in the aisle. catherine coddle followed by michelle cooper. shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift Okay, yeah. Okay, can everybody hear me? Perfect. Thank you. Okay. So I'm here to speak on the Peterson Drive road closure. I'm not in favor of it, and I'm very displeased. And I'm asking for reconsideration. Anyone can become permanently disabled. Disabled. Mitigation of damage to the park can be done by putting in speed bumps. Many people, like me, have limited mobility. The way we get around is by use of our vehicles or use of a mobility device, sometimes with a cane, sometimes it's a walker. So my question is, well, I have a couple of questions, but what's your plan? Okay. If this continues to be closed, what's your plan when someone else who has a mobility issue, limited mobility, decides they want to experience the park? In the words of Councilman Overbeek, you were quoted as saying, it's all about the experience, not so much about safety. So if someone with a mobility issue wants to experience the park, realizes that it's not so much about safety, in a council member's words, what happens when they fall? What happens? What happens if they decide to sue? What happens if when they're suing, they come back and say, well, there are four options. They voted for the most expensive one and the one that would cut out the use of my vehicle, which is how I would be able to safely continue to navigate the park, absent that vote. What's the council's plan? Because we're a litigious society, unfortunately. It's very possible someone would do that. I also noted that... Okay. Council member Winslow was quoted as saying, the park is a key thing for all the people in the community. I agree. All the people in the community include people like me of all ages who have limited mobility, for one reason or another. Sometimes it's because of age. Sometimes it's because of physical disability. I have cerebral palsy on my right side. Fortunately, I don't have it on my left. So in a way, I have a foot in both worlds. So again, what's the plan? I asked for reconsideration of this. I remember when the other side of the park was closed, much reasons like this were given. And I thought at the time, okay, well, at least one side of the park is open. That's fair. I can see it being closed on one side as long as we can access the other side. That's reasonable. Closing both sides is not. It's not at all. and too many, I mean, many of us access that park and have done so for years and would like to continue doing so. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. Michelle Cooper, followed by Ann, by Kirk Kaufman. Get my driving glasses on. Okay. Okay. Hi. Good evening. So yesterday there was a shooting at the home. Less than a mile from my home. A shooting. Yet the police department didn't think that local residents needed to know that a suspect was at large in our neighborhood. Let's call this what it is. A consistent threat to the safety of the law-abiding tax-paying families who live here. That camp has long been a site of dog attacks, stabbings, fires, overdoses, you name it. It's been there. Meanwhile, the city hides behind the Warren settlement as an excuse not to act. While our tax dollars bleed away on endless cleanups only for piles of trash to return within days. It's a disgusting blight on our city and it is the people that are getting hurt. We are only one tragedy away from a lawsuit that will cost the city far more than any settlement it fears breaking. The city has a duty to protect its residents from known ongoing threats and right now it is failing. While all of this money and energy is poured into managing this encampment the simplest request from residents go ignored. I have been trying to get a tree replaced for over a year. It took nearly nine months for them to come out and finally remove the tree but I'm still left with a stump that is waiting for removal and the sidewalk that is now in disrepair because of the roots of the tree is still there for a hazard for anybody to trip over. How long does the city intend to leave dead trees and broken sidewalks for people to trip on? How long does the city intend to leave residents in fear living in near crime ridden camps while telling us there is nothing that can be done? We pay taxes, we follow the laws, we are the people keeping this city running and we deserve the same attention and protection that the city bends over backwards to provide to those who refuse services, break the law and endanger others. The city is a place where we are It is time for this city to do better. We need real solutions, not excuses. We need somebody is going to be harmed and criminals that are allowed to inhabit these sites without consequences are the cause. We need our sidewalk repaired, our neighborhoods cleaned up, we need to feel safe in our own homes and on our own streets. Enough is enough. I am asking that this city take action, protect its residents, and restore order before the next tragedy occurs. Thank you. thank you. And by Kirk Kaufman followed by Matthew Willey. good evening. I am here speaking on behalf of the Chico safe streets coalition. We would like to thank you very much for prioritizing bicycle and pedestrian safety in lower bidwell park. We feel very strongly that for the safety of pedestrians and bicycles and the safety of the city and the city of south park, we need to continue to have the right of way at any driveway that crosses it. That is the current status quo. Pedestrians and bicyclists far outnumber motorists. South park drive is a major commuter route for bicyclists. Forcing them to stop at each driveway if there are three of them is unreasonable. Furthermore, the distance between woodland avenue and south park drive is very much a barrier and is very short. So a pedestrian who starts across a driveway might see a totally clear driveway and a car could pull off of woodland avenue and go into that driveway and hit them before they get to the other side. Also, south park drive should remain free of gates. Especially maze gates. So I have a visual here. Maze gates are gates that come this is an aerial view of the road. They come from either side they go almost all the way across the road and to go through the gate you have to make this intricate zigzag pattern. Okay, that is fine for somebody in great shape on an ordinary bicycle but it is not fine for people on tandems, people carrying children on the back of their bike, especially cargo bikes, adaptive hand cycles, bicycles of any type that is not standard. So these gates are dangerous. We have members who have been injured by them. They are very difficult to navigate and the National Association of City Traffic Officials specifically states that they should not be used. Yet at your June 17th meeting, Brendan Odoboni implied that the right of way was going to go to the driveways and that there were going to be maze gates on either side of each driveway. I just am asking you to please make sure that does not happen. It would not facilitate the use of the park by bicyclists and pedestrians. So, thank you very much. Thank you. So Matthew Willey followed by Sam Barber. Good evening. I have been a Chico resident since 2018 but this is my first time addressing you all. My five year old son and I use Bidwell Park every day as both cyclists and pedestrians. He bikes to school through the park and I almost exclusively bike when traveling within the city. Bidwell Park is my main east-west route through town and I wanted to come here tonight to say thank you so much to the City Council for prioritizing pedestrians and the city. San Diego for providing pedestrian and cyclist safety by voting to close the one mile portion of South Park Drive to cars. My son has been biking in the park and to Caper Acres since he was two years old and providing him with a spacious car free path between downtown and Lower Park greatly improves our safety whether that be on our long tail cargo bike or on our individual bikes. And I can tell you that a two year old biking does not have a lot of safety awareness. So it was extremely helpful to have a safe place where he could cycle in Bidwell Park. So I'm very grateful for that and support expanding that availability. Additionally my understanding is that there will now be several driveways that will cross South Park Drive to give motor vehicle access to the parking lots at Caper Acres and One Mile Pool. As a frequent user of both of these facilities I certainly understand the need to provide parking but I would ask that the intersections of the driveways and the shared use path give right of way to the parking lot to pedestrians and cyclists in a way that does not restrict large or long bikes. As I mentioned I use a long tail cargo bike as one way to transport my son around town as well as to grocery shop. I also ride a tandem recumbent bike in the park with my mother who is here tonight and has balance issues due to Parkinson's disease which means she can't ride her own bike. Both the cargo bike and the tandem are extremely difficult to navigate around so called maze gates. In fact there are bike paths that I specifically avoid in town and I have to stop and physically lift my bike around a maze gate. My understanding is there would be seven of them to do. So I would ask that you please do not install any more maze gates in either South Park Drive or anywhere else in the city. In regards to South Park Drive for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, pets and children all of which there are many of in that area I think it is important to ensure that cars are traveling at a safe speed when entering and exiting the parking lots at One Mile Pool. I think that is a win-win to put vehicle stop signs at the intersections of the shared use path and give pedestrians and cyclists right of way and also wide routes of travel. In other words, no maze gates. Thank you. Thank you. Sam Barber followed by Laura Berry. Hello. I just wanted to rebuke some of the statements made by council members at the June 17th meeting in regards to policing. Specifically, numbers cited by council member Van Overbeek that were also echoed by Representative O'Brien whom is also an ex-police chief. The statement was that most cities the size of Chico have 1.6 police sworn in police per 1,000 citizens and therefore police funding in Chico is not the problem and is understaffed. There was kind of an insinuation that we should be attempting to fund them even more than we already do which is about half of our annual budget and 60% of the Measure H funding. So I compiled data from all the police department websites, apartments.com and the United States Census Bureau and I used that to get all the information I'm going to talk about here. So I took the 12 closest cities in population. I didn't include certain cities that had police from Sacramento or San Diego. They didn't have their own police departments. But I found that only three of them out of the 12 had 1.6 or greater police per 1,000 citizens. Four if I'm including Vista which had 1.5. So that's roughly a third or 25% if I'm not including Vista of the cities similar size to Chico that have that number. It's important in my mind that our city leaders accurately represent data and information when speaking to the public. This is a somewhat misinformed statement or potentially a politically motivated statement in an attempt to bolster and normalize the stance of half our budget going towards the police as they continue to fail to protect the city of Chico and providing true safety to all citizens. Not just those financially well off. There were no ties according to the data of cities having a higher number of police, having greater affordability as it relates to the rent of a studio of a one bedroom apartment. So the idea that somehow just getting to that 1.6 number is going to fix these issues or is going to prevent homelessness from happening. I just see no correlation in the data to really support that idea that I would appreciate if the council could maybe look a little outside of the box when we are addressing these issues like homelessness beyond just more punishment. It's fiscally irresponsible, it's morally reprehensible, it costs about $132,000 a year to put someone in prison. That comes out of our tax dollars. There's better options. We could be giving them homes, we could be providing them with mental health care and things of that nature. I would much rather our money go towards that. I also noticed on the website that I saw on the cops Facebook that they had time to send about seven officers to do a little photo op at the park which to me that doesn't really scream that they are underfunded. That's about it. The other last thing I want to say is again there's a modern day holocaust and genocide going on. My taxes are going to that. I would really appreciate if you would acknowledge and condemn the crime. I would really appreciate if you Good evening. I wanted to talk about the plans to close South Park Drive to traffic and to create some additional driveways into the park. I live on the corner of Linden and Woodland directly across the street from the road that passes Sycamore Field. And so I'm going to talk about the plans that I'm going to talk about So this plan that you guys currently had voted on previously, it would just significantly increase traffic like in front. It would be directly right in front of my door. And it would be still confusing because Linden and that road do not line up. So there would be multiple turns that people would need to make to go into the park. Which I feel would make it even more confusing. And so I'm hoping that the commission or the council will reconsider option 2 and explore alternative solutions that would meet the park's access goals without negatively impacting the neighborhood safety and quality of life. Thanks. Thank you. turn on your phones and other nefarious devices on mute, that would be great. Thank you. So Julian Zinner followed by Charles Withoon. Good evening, city council and staff. The plan for South Forth Drive indicates three pairs of maze gates where cars enter the park from Woodland Avenue. These gates are dangerous for senior citizens and lead to injuries. The plan for the park is to make it safe for the public. I can attest to having trouble with them on the airport path. The urban bike design guide of the National Association of City Traffic Officials states do not use maze gates. A simple stop sign for cars would be more effective for bike and pedestrian safety. For the past 25 years I've biked Lower Park extensively and have never encountered a problem between cars and bikes and pedestrians. I'm not a pedestrian. I have a heart. I urge you and your staff to more adequately do your homework and consult experts. Recently, you committed to spending tens of thousands of dollars on a yearly blood test to detect early asymptomatic cancer among our toxic smoke exposed firefighters. The test gallery has not been approved by the F.D.A. or recommended by the American Cancer Society. Bayesian and conditional probability analysis shows that out of 10 positive tests, only one would be a true positive. Investors are already grumbling and considering suing the company. Another example, staff and developers insist Chico will grow by 1% per year into the future, by 20,000 by 2040. The U.S. Census Bureau, however, predicts only a half a percent growth nationwide until 2050, then falling to less than one-tenth of 1%. We certainly can limit ourselves to infill within the city limits to fulfill our housing needs. Thank you for slowing down and doing more adequate preparation before making important final decisions. Thank you. Thank you. Charles Withoon, followed by Lori Monroe. Good evening, council staff. Thank you very much. In the last 30 months, Chico, California, shelter for all, counting last night, has logged in 63 deaths outside or of homeless people in our area. That rate is unprecedented to my experience, and in the words of Pulitzer Prize-winning researcher, author, and professor Matthew Desmond on poverty in America, he said, It's a shame because... we possess the means to mitigate it more effectively, and we don't. Northstate's shelter team has two proposals on the City's Desk to more effectively mitigate our shelter crisis, one since February that cost the City virtually nothing. Northstate's shelter team is offering to pay the entire bill. We just need City's use permit and an agreement to be able to go ahead with one of the two churches that said they'd let us put our tiny homes with one of the two churches that said they'd let us put our tiny homes parking lot. Our safe spot community is modeled after 14 successful programs by the same name in Eugene. They've got 14 of these safe spot communities in Eugene for over 10 years that have gotten hundreds of people off the street. On average, people graduate out of these places in six months to two years into a positive placement. Other cities that have similar programs are Livermore, Castro Valley, El Cajon, Walnut Creek, San Jose, San Diego, and Fresno, among many more. Our proposal could have four unsheltered little old ladies in a safe place to sleep at night in a matter of days. Once successful, this plan could be done 10 times in Chico, getting 40 people off the street at virtually no cost to the city. I encourage the council to consider North State Shelter Team's safe spot community proposal. We'll be talking about it tomorrow, I suppose, or soon at the ad hoc committee, and hopefully we can move forward on this soon. Thank you. Thank you. Lori Monroe, followed by Clark Edgeworth. Thank you, City Council. I wanted to just come up and start with a couple of questions. I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking for a while now. I think it's important to sort of restate what Charles just said. I didn't realize I was following him. But I think North State Shelter Team has several well-thought-out plans and ideas, one of which is to give more management to the alternate campsite, which I think we'll all agree tonight, after yesterday's tragedy, is needed somehow. And some of the ideas that North State Shelter Team has suggested may be worthwhile for the city to implement. And in addition, the tiny homes that would go onto church lots, which can happen without much cost to the city, would be really helpful. And each tiny home would get one person off the streets. It's not the solution that fixes everything, but it fixes something for that one person. And then the other thing I wanted to mention was just as a frequent City Council observer, I wanted to say that I noticed that the City Council has reversed the decisions and the recommendations of both the airport commission and the bidwell park. And I think that's a really important thing to note. I'm not exactly sure where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where exactly where Thank you. Thank you, Clark Edgeworth, followed by Anna Rose Hyben. Thank you. And before I get to my main point, I wanted to say God bless the Chico Police Department for the great work that they do and the way they put their lives on the line every day. Anyway, I'm here because I am at a loss as to what life has handed me. I live at the Creekside Place. It's a senior development. I didn't know that when I applied there. It's a lovely place. There's about 120 people who live there. And there has been, starting about six months ago, we got a visit from people from VLO and CARD. That's a bicycle organization. Spent a very significant amount of my life on a bicycle. The point where my wife used to say, when we get in the fight, why don't you get on the bicycle and ride off in the hills and never come back? That kind of thing. Very much friendly bicycles and CARD, which is the Chico Area Recreation District. However, when they came to us about six months ago, it was, we're going to do this. And isn't it wonderful? Well, I have had severe health problems. People came to me and said, hey, you're elected. You've got to help us do this. And it is only recently, in the past couple of months, my health's improved to where I can do whatever it is I need to do. However, I found out that the Planning Commission meeting was the last meeting, evidently, before any kind of government council. And that we had... We had ten days to appeal. I didn't even know there was an appeal process. So, we have a whole bunch of people that lost their view, lost their little piece of nature. We made a point of moving to places like Paradise and Forbes Town. And I lived in my home for 17 years. I've never lived in an apartment before. I'm very grateful for the roof over my head, which I've worked very hard for. But... This... If there's anybody in the City Council that is friendly to the idea of stopping this thing, which I've had three different people on solicitors use the word abomination. And every press release I've seen on this cute little white park, they mention beer. And it's adjacent to a junior high. I get... And the environmental concern. I have watched for 35 years. While the habitat adjacent to the... Adjacent to the foothills that is exclusive habitat. That's time. Thank you, Clark. Two waiting birds. Thank you. I think you're ignoring your own speeches. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My appeal is to somebody. My name is Clark Edgeworth. That's time. Thank you. Thank you, Clark. Thank you. And I would like to know... You're welcome to send an email and anybody can get back with you. Thank you. So Anna Rose Haibin followed by Ryan Incarnacina. I apologize. I think I massacred it. Good evening. My name is Anna Rose Haibin. I am here to, like a couple other people, speak about the! You know, shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift because as has been mentioned, this has been a program that has been really successful in other places and could be brought here to Chico to help alleviate some of the issues that I think we all can agree are really pressing on the community here. And so I just kind of reaffirm some of the things that some of the other speakers have said and really urge and ask you all to look into one of those two proposals more and to do something. On that front. Thank you. Thank you. Ryan in Carson. I'm not going to try it again. I apologize. There you go. Sorry. Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm also here echoing some of the other sentiments about North State Shelter Team's safe spot community proposal. I think everyone can agree. This is homelessness. This is. This is a major issue that's pressing and the fact that it's going to cost the city virtually nothing to have a few people that will have much better outcomes statistically than shelters I think is invaluable. It's a program that could be scaled up in the future as other cities have done. So I just really would ask you guys to consider that proposal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Richard Roth is our last speaker. I just want to say how delighted I was to discover how nice the bike path is along the Esplanade. I have an electric bike, and I use that regularly now. The one exception, of course, is 3rd Avenue, which throws bicyclists into traffic. I don't know how it got designed that way or whatever, but it's the one intersection in that whole stretch where there's a real problem for kids on bikes, pedestrians, wheelchair access there. It really needs to be fixed, corrected, not maybe just patched over, but fixed, I hope. The other thing is the maze gates. I have always hated them. I have a cargo bike. Sometimes I have a trailer. But looking at it, many of these maze gates force people to go around the maze gates between rocks, poles, other things, because they're just too much of a hazard to get around. So I really encourage the... No further use of installation of maze gates anywhere, and perhaps the removal of the existing ones. Come up with something much more safe and convenient. And then, of course, I'm very much in favor of the pedestrian bicycle priorities for the bike path through the parks, of course. Thank you. Thank you. He's our last speaker. All right. Thank you. 4.1, hearing of ordinance of the abandonment, easy for you to say, vacation portions of West 1st Street. And we have Mr. Ottomani. Yes. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council members. Item 4.1 is the hearing ordering the formal abandonment and vacation of the right-of-way on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd streets. This is to accommodate the future construction of the Chico State Forensics Building. So this is in follow-up from the adopted resolution 29-25 at the June 3rd City Council meeting with the intent to abandon. So recommendation is that the City Council adopt the resolution ordering the abandonment of that right-of-way. That concludes my report. All right. We will open the public hearing. Thank you. Any speakers on this item? We do not. Okay. Any council members that would like to discuss or ask questions? No. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. All right. We have a motion and a second.

Yes. 4.2 is the hearing to create the Chico Maintenance District or CMDA54, which is in support of the Habitat for Humanity Project and is the funding mechanism for ongoing maintenance typical of subdivisions. So that concludes my report and I'm available for any questions. All right. We have a motion to shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift Yes, mayor Reynolds. I carry six zero with one absence All right 5.1 consideration of a resolution to rescind resolution this 7-25 City manager sorensen. Thank you This relates to the downtown Chico property based improvement district otherwise known as the P bid in February of 2025 the P bid proposed a budget that sought a 5% increase in March of 2025 the council approved a Approved the P bid 5% increase by way of a resolution Since then the P bid has reevaluated their financial position and their operational expenses and decided that they do not need to go forward with the 5% increase So the resolution before you would rescind the previously approved 5% increase All right, do we have any speakers we Do not all right any council members would like to speak No All right entertain motion To approve second Okay councilmember Goldstein I Councilmember Holly. Yes councilmember O'Brien. Yes councilmember van overbeck. Yes Vice mayor Bennett. Yes mayor Reynolds. I carry six zero with one absence All right 5.2 internal Affairs Committee report approval and action count chair O'Brien and we're gonna go a first and then the second will take this in two separate ones just so Council knows all right. Thank you mayor. So council rightly so wanted to provide a boost to our downtown This really involves a variety of efforts Which included parking and specifically exploring free parking and I thought that was a direction the discussion was going to go however, After hearing from our downtown representatives It was clear like to all of us on the committee at the overarching recommendation from them and our overarching Recommendation to Council was to improve the overall parking experience which did not include Free parking which is a little bit of a surprise to me So the recommended recommendations that we did identify We're gonna increase educational outreach efforts regarding the parking Kiosks parking pass program and parking mobile app and I will tell you as someone who criticized the parking kiosks for several weeks and months particularly as I campaigned I've come around particularly after Using the mobile app. It is quite simple and easy. I think anyone can use it and it's really really simple with some additions to I think to our infrastructure but really made the parking experience Easy for me and I think for many others Number two is creating a clear consistent color coordinated parking signage Adding additional directions on parking kiosks again to make it clearer and easier for everyone Update and sink the parking portal and website to create a single source for downtown vendor data entry and current updated park information Including educational resources to help people again to make this simpler for them the research the feasibility of tiered parking rates and five collaborate with the police department the parking enforcement specialist specifically to reduce the cycle time for enforcement in the premium zones to discourage parking violations and then we recommend a follow-up in six months to determine the success or lack thereof of those efforts and that was our recommendation. I don' t know vice mayor bennett if you have any further comments. I think you summed it up quite well thank you. perfect. council member bennett. I think the recommendations are good I have a couple of things I want to add are very good. Regarding the kiosks. The user interface and there's a narrative that's going out there that our kiosks are so difficult to use. They're not. However the user interface was called out as a problem I think we had a meeting here two and a half years ago about the kiosks when they were first put in. I went up to reading and looked at their system and it's not as easy to understand. I made videos of using the reading system and using our system. And I don' t think you guys had a chance to resolve that but maybe brendan if you had a conversation with the vendor about that. absolutely. You provided great information and the video and photographs of the user interface and through that we were able to work with our vendor to look at modifying the interface on the screen of the kiosk to reduce the number of words, the background that can kind of get lost in some of the shade and sun to make it more of a stark difference with the lettering and the background. And so we've worked on that. I think we have a feasible way forward with that as well. Similar to the writing. Again by reducing it and making it more simplified and a step by step process on the screens. So the second point is I absolutely agree the parking the signage downtown I think we've had accumulated signage over the years and it's there's sort of a hodgepodge and we need to go back and make that consistent and clearer. And then the last thing is the and this is a question for the chief. Have they changed the way they're doing enforcement in the premiums in the two hour zone to cycle through there more quickly or is everybody still doing everything? I'm talking about the parking enforcement people. I think I know what you're talking about. So we have separated those two. Great. And they are going their separate routes as opposed to being doubled up in a vehicle. So yes that's been going on for a few weeks now. And have you seen an increase in the number of violations for people exceeding the two hours? I couldn't answer that with that I'm just going to go back to the stats for you. It's great you made the change. Thank you. it sounds like these are all fairly easy things. Do we need to take action on this and is there a budgetary amount tied to it or this seems pretty straightforward? We need a motion to approve. Yes we do have one speaker on from Oregon wanted to speak on the one hour free parking. If Jesse didn't speak on parking it wouldn't be a complete. We are so glad to have you. Hello. I was going to introduce myself again but I guess everybody remembers I have been a parking professional for 25 years and currently do the parking services for the university. I love the recommendation so I just They have been able to assist you with the signs. They have faced this problem before, they have recommendations they are going to give them to you, you could even get assistance with printing and replacing signs. Second, I suggest that your current QR codes lead to the city site rather than to the vendor site. If you are a vendor site where it talks about payment, then you can give instructions and link to the payment, make it easier for people who are having trouble. I think that expanded enforcement is great. One of the suggestions that I make is to get an e-bike with an LPR trailer for downtown. Everybody loves seeing them. I have been seeing them at universities and downtowns. They save on energy. The EV that you are carrying, the EV that you are currently using is heavier so it takes more energy and it would be great to have more consistent enforcement with an LPR trailer and an e-bike. Also, tiers. You currently have two tiers, you probably should have three tiers. You should have an economy, especially for people who are working downtown, a standard and then a premium. The premium should be focused on turnover. So the places where you need open downtown businesses quickly, that is a more cost-effective solution than a time zone. And the final thing I really want to advocate for is since we want to increase foot traffic in downtown businesses and since foot traffic generally equals sales, I would really urge you to offer validations by the businesses. So what that would look like is parking but go into a downtown business and they will validate for one additional hour for you. That is used all over the place. I have used that in my parking operations and that would drive foot traffic into the businesses. There is logistical problems to get it set up but if you are willing to invest in driving business to downtown, that is a great way to do it. And that is my time. change the time and it kept giving him more time but that is because we love to hear from him. Thank you, Jesse. That is crazy. We will charge you a premium for that. He was our only speaker. Now we can consider a motion on A of 5.2. Move to approve. Would you like to speak? I will take the floor. thank you Mr. Horgan. Thank you. This is the signage discussion took place at the dcba office, one of the meetings. And tour butte county has already spent about a quarter of a million dollars to come up with signage that they are proposing for butte county when butte county looks at some signage changes. I would encourage when it comes time to take a look at what we I think we need to look at what butte county is going to be doing or at least proposes to be doing so we have some consistency and it would flow better. I wanted to bring that up. I think the suggestion of having the vendor pay for them was an excellent one. I like that one as well. I saw you taking copious notes. I would add in response to one of the comments that jesse made. We are having the download of the app and information for parking on a city website. We did purchase the domain name park chico.com. Rather than having downloading the app directly from kiosks and information, the intent is to house that at this domain that will be on our website. Then we can share that with the dcba so it will bring interested parties to the park chico domain essentially and then have downtown any other council members? did I miss anybody? I think those are all common sense things we can do that really are not going to cost much and improve the overall experience of parking in our city and particularly downtown which is very important. We have heard that loud and clear. I think that is a positive thing we can do. I think we are moving forward and accepting the IAC recommendations on this item. second? second. my quick comment. I am glad we are discussing this. I think the idea of assessing how to tear the parking rates and basically make it easier for people to park would be awesome. I am glad we are ideally moving forward on this shift. shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift the speed survey recommendations councilmember o'brien. thank you mayor again. First of all I want to commend city staff director adeboni for providing those presentations at the icn these two issues thank you and your staff. Really I think the speed surveys in general we accepted those and accept the survey with answer that with three exceptions at least as far as determining the speed limit could be lower we agreed to look at that. That was road between magro that was one and two was park avenue between humboldt avenue and east 20 and west east avenue between highway 99 and esplanade essentially accepting the survey as presented with a number of questions. I would like us as part of this to consider whether we should raise the speed limit on highway 32 between where it crosses 99 up to I think it's forest. Yeah. Not forest. Yeah. The next intersection past forest. Help me with that one. That's Caltrans. Yeah. That is Caltrans right away and shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift that's fine okay can i add one potential that we add on here and ask if we do approve this can we look at um valambrogia there are i don't remember the exact number but it's something like 17 crosswalks that go across valambrogia and people because it's one of the only east west travels besides east avenue and i know we've had this conversation before but there's a few neighbors in there that are pretty uptight about how fast people go down valambrogia and we have a lot of crossing and kids and people going in and out of the park there so i would just add if we could make sure that that is set at their right yeah i think um what might best integrate that into our current workload is we are initiating a feasibility study for the redesign of valambrogia as it's included in the 10-year roadway cip and so uh the due to the uniqueness of the roadway cip we're going to be able to integrate that into our current workload which is a lot of different things we're initiating a feasibility study to kind of gather all that public input and then look at it holistically and so i just maybe recommend that we include that as part of that okay that's fine as long as it's being taken care of somewhere and this wasn't the only bite of the apple so all right consider a motion. i' ll make a motion to approve the iac recommendation and will respect the adding of valambroza survey done by our city staff i appreciate the work of the iac and we'll second okay so i i thought director adeboni was going to it'll be on the okay on the other item okay so the valambroza is going to come later in a different study feasibility studies okay perfect but appreciate the consideration council member goldstein are there no speakers sorry if i missed that. no there wasn't. then i. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. vice mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. aye. carry 6-0 with one absence. specific annual adjustments to i believe it was the storm drainage facility fee and transportation facility fees as indicated by the highway construction cost index that we were using. construction costs were going up so i don't want to beat a dead horse too much but since i disagreed with the finance committee's decision to not raise the cost of the highway development impact fees more than 3% as costs were drastically increasing i thought it would be hypocritical of me to not also support annual adjustments to decreases in those same exact cost indexes i know that we don't anticipate construction costs to decrease anytime soon but i would be a fool to think that they won't ever in the future and i think it only makes sense to make development impact fees good for the city and the city of new York where shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift! shift the city manager? yes that' s accurate however there is a smoothing effect where in the subsequent year after it went down if it were to go up which is typically the pattern it doesn' t go down as often as it goes up the fact that it went down in the previous year is taken under consideration so it dampens the rise back up so it gets back up again. is considered just not in real time? it' s like rolling three years or five years? three I think it is. three okay thank you. this is a bit more of a pedantic item. we knew we were getting into that when we ran for city council. I' m unfamiliar with this so I' m wondering if construction costs drop would our diffs just not change? correct in a given year but as I said the fact that that drop did occur in one year dampens the effect the next year so it does influence the outcome there' s just a slight delay and it' s not as though in the end we benefit so I' m kind of agnostic as to how we do it. the only other note is that it would be interesting to go back and look to see when they adopted this methodology what the thinking was or it could be painful I don' t know. it could set us up for then when it does go back up a sharper increase because again the current methodology smooths things out over time. vice mayor bennett. thank you Mr. any other comments? my suggestion is for this to go back to the finance committee let' s take a good look at it. I called the director of administrative services on vacation she won' t be back until next week so I think we need to get together and talk about this and truly understand all of the aspects it might be some unintended! unintended consequences perhaps let' s take a good look at it. if that' s a motion I would second that. I have another question. council member? council member holly what do you see as the main benefits of doing this with this benefit the city paying less for its projects in a time where there' s less happening or I' m trying to picture how this would benefit our city? it' s hard to put an objective pin on it that' s why this is more of a getting lost in the semantics item but I just spoke with a couple members of cba and they felt that it was hypocritical to have the city increase fees with the index premiums. increase the fees but not decrease them with the index. I understand your intent I think that' s very admirable. I don' t think it' s a necessary discussion but I think it does need to go back to finance to vet this out and make sure we' re making a sound decision. On the principle of it yes I would concur with that. I agree with my colleague Mr. bennett let' s take it back and dig into it and see if we can get it back so the motion would be to take this back to the finance committee and take a look at it please. got it. we have a motion and a second from council member holly. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. vice mayor bennett. yes. council member bennett. yes. I would try. I might give him six minutes but I' ll catch him. reports and communications the following reports and communications are provided for the council's information no action can be taken on items under this section unless council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. city manager's report. and financial report is information only. council member requests pursuant to ap and p 1010 council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be a majority vote of council is needed in order for staff to agendize. does anybody have any requests? council member van overbeck. so our last meeting which was june 17th item was to be approved by the council. and the item 5.1 was the design of south park drive. and the council voted to approve option 2. and since then like I' m sure many of you I' ve received a tidal wave of input from my constituents. I have people I' ve known for 50 years that are questioning my whether I' m slipping into senility or not. input on that decision. at any rate I would like to reconsider I want to propose that we reconsider that at the next meeting. item 5.1. all right. so I want to applaud council member van overbeck for taking that position. it' s not always easy looking at something and telling everyone we need to take another look at that. I applaud your courage for that. and I' m going to support that. thank you for doing that. all right. motion and a second to reconsider. who made the second? I will make the second. okay. thank you. council member goldstein. always interested in discussing more even if I think for now we' ve been going in the right direction. let' s listen to the public. yes. thank you. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member vice mayor bennett. absolutely. mayor reynolds. aye. carries 6-0-1 and it will come back at the meeting in august which is our third tuesday next month. all right. any other council member requests? no? okay. then I will adjourn us to tuesday august 19th at 6 o'clock here on the county council. thank you. shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift Thank you. Thank you.
