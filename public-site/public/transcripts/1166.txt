Thank you for explaining the process to me.  All right.  Second.  So we have a substitute motion and a second of the substitute motion.  Madam Clerk, on the substitute motion.  Okay.  I'm still going to pull that discussion.  You can have the discussion, absolutely.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Well, so to start, so this is a preferential parking district,  which is to say that only that there's limited parking between night hours  on the stretch of Vallenberg Court, which is by one mile.  Normally when we manage parking, like for downtown,  when we have a difficulty with too many people parking in place,  we require that people pay.  So in downtown, if you leave your car overnight,  you have to go back there in the morning.  This is the opposite because it's not a parking problem.  You want people, what they're asking people to do is to go back to their car at night  and not be able to leave it there overnight.  As was stated in the meeting by some of the petitioners that supported limiting parking in this area,  it's not a parking problem they're looking to solve.  The issue is that they have people sleeping in their cars overnight.  So they're looking for a parking solution to what is essentially not a parking problem.  The problem is that we don't have anywhere within the city of Chico  that people can park overnight and sleep in their cars,  so they do it in the most convenient and what feels like the safest place right next to the park.  Let's not say there are some issues there with it,  but in my view, part of this is for the peaceful enjoyment of the city  and making sure that parking isn't taken up in the morning is what's stated as a purpose for this.  But part of that peaceable enjoyment of the city for me is being able to go one place,  end up in a neighborhood, and then go back to my home.  For me, that's what's important. and the reasons why people don't go back to their cars at night we don't always want them to feel the pressure to go and move their car for at night and that's part of the  and not receive a ticket after 10 PM. Also, you know what happens here, this is already the issue we're facing so part of that stretch already has those parking limitations from 10 PM to 6 PM and so what people do is they park right outside of that boundary  do is they park right outside of that boundary.  And that's where we're experiencing a lot of the issues, and that's  what people brought up, and that's what we're looking to extend to this area  too. So what happens next is people  go a little bit further out of the area.  And so this was brought  up as an issue at the internal affairs  meeting, and our honorable chair  and vice mayor, what the recommendation was, which  isn't seen in the staff report, is  that we explore limiting parking  everywhere around the park,  all the way up there. So if you have,  all you have is a hammer, then the whole world  can be bludgeoned. But  it comes at a cost. And the fiscal  impact here is not properly stated.  It says that the cost will be installing some signs  that say what this time is. But what this means  is we're making a commitment that Chico police  officers are going to respond after 10 p.m. to  somebody who parked the car and is swimming,  has walked somewhere else, has walked downtown,  and they want to go and ticket them.  It does not come with no cost to have  that obligation on officers. They are expected  to respond to that. You can have one resident  here, and there are only like, there's a handful  that live on the whole drive there.  They have off-street parking primarily, because  this is not a parking problem.  And one person  can, every night at 10 p.m.,  call, and Chico police officers are  going to be expected to stop whatever they're doing  and go and respond to that to ticket somebody for leaving  the car there. It doesn't come free. We can't  be like clamoring for additional police  officers and then describe it as zero fiscal  impact to be adding this additional burden to  officers there. We already had  somebody at the internal affairs meeting who  was suggesting that we extend this to Woodland Avenue,  to 7th Street, and from the !on. So that's what the slippery slope  that I'm describing is. If we respond to  citizens' petitions to limit parking  because they don't like the people that are parking there,  people are just going to be parking somewhere else, and we're going to be looking at  doing this more and more and more and more places.  So I think that's a bad road to go down.  I think it is costly.  It's not reasonable or fairly applied  rulemaking. It's not a responsible commitment  to public resources, and I think we ought to reject it  in favor of solutions that actually fit the problem,  which is that we don't have anywhere that people can  sleep outside.  So I would, yeah,  move that we,  I'll substitute substitute motion now,  because I can do that, and  say that we should send this back to staff  and request that they come up with some solutions  to actually fit the problem.  All right, and we'll see it again.  So we have a substitute to the substitute?  Is there a second to it?  Substitute to  the substitute dies for lack of a second.  Correct. Go back to the substitute motion.  I would just like to correct the record.  I don't know. There may have been somebody  in the meeting that suggested  taking all of the parking  along the park away, but that was not  Vice Mayor Reynolds, and I do not believe  it was. I thought I made a motion.  I may have been incorrect there. I apologize. Thank you.  Well, I would  add, even though I wasn't at that meeting,  that we eliminate  parking at night in all kinds of places.  I know with trucks and large  tractor trailers, we do that in various  neighborhoods where they park overnight to  eliminate noise and  other areas generating sound  at night around residential and commercial  districts.  Some communities do this throughout the state.  All right. Anything else?  I would just add that I bet that we have a  great dispatch department that would probably  prioritize the majority of the city  of Chico over dispatching our valuable  police officers to have this be their priority  in the evening. So I have confidence  in their ability to manage  this.  Yeah,  the idea that it's going to put a burden on the  police force is nonsense.  This is  a  this is  a street that's a beautiful  residential street  that's being trashed by those people  camping there, parking there.  And it is a parking problem.  And yeah, the problem is the people who are  parking there, but creating  a preferential parking  zone is  perfectly appropriate  for this situation.  All right.  Council Member Bennett? Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  I'm sorry, you should restate the...  The motion is to approve  the TRA.  Yes.  Or the amendment to the resolution.  Yes, I approve.  Okay. Council Member Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  It carries 5-1  with one absence.  All right.  We'll move on to public comments.  So members of the public may address  the council on this time of any matter  not already listed on the agenda within the  jurisdiction.  The council cannot take any action  at this meeting on requests made under this section  of the agenda. Again,  throughout the meeting, no applause, no  cheering, no booing, as we don't  want anybody to feel as though their rights are  not being respected to speak  freely. So how many speakers do we have for  public comment? We have two. All right.  Let's do three minutes. First speaker is  Nicole Nava, followed by Curtis Anderson.  And if you can go ahead and line up  in the middle aisle.  Good evening, council.  I am a  right in here on the topic of homelessness.  And the prior discussion  is very interesting because part of that  is the issue that  I'm experiencing on my street  and in other areas of Chico.  It is  very frustrating that we are all  still stuck under an agreement  that we have three more years  on with, to me,  no end in sight because of judicial  preferential  treatment, in my opinion,  of a population that is not working on  wellness. We cannot compel people, as I've  said before, and it is creating a huge  problem throughout our city. I feel like  the vast majority of folks sitting in  these chairs up here agree and are doing  their level best, but are challenged  because of these situations. And it's  frustrating trying to help people  appreciate what we're up against here.  And I think we're all waiting for SCOTUS  to rule on something, and it may not go well.  So here's the deal for the person that is concerned about it's not a parking issue.  We, as neighbors,  you're saying that they feel safe  near the park. Well,  I live adjacent to the park  and I don't feel safe.  So I just find that a little bit comical.  They just  recently, we consistently  have a huge RV that comes in parks  and he kind of plays tag team with another  RV friend of his. It appears  they're dealing drugs out of the park.  And we have a lot of the RV. It is very  suspicious activity that happens  consistently that is congruent with  drug use. There is trash left  consistently when that person exits and  when they pull away, and then they're  gone for the couple days, and then they  come back and it begins again. We have  single females that are adjacent to that  that feel extremely uncomfortable. There  have been males that are sleeping  literally against the house, literally  against it, with all the trash in the  things. It's a fire hazard. There are public health hazards. We have Comanche Creek, Windchime,  Tigert, and other places, the Triangle that are being repopulated. We were assured that we could  quickly clear when it's been reoccupied. I get you guys are, again, constrained by judiciary  concerns, but we have got to start talking about an exit strategy because I don't feel like people  feel like they want to support our taxpayer dollars, continuing to lift up a smaller  population wreaking havoc. It is going to continue, and we have to figure out at what point are we  going to stop since we cannot compel treatment. I know you're working toward a managed campground.  I am totally objecting to that because we see you coming. We know what that means, and it means  forever on the hook because people don't want to go and work on themselves. It is shameful. It is  toxic compassion.  I hope that some people examine their position. Thank you.  Ms. Nava, one quick question.  Sure.  Where did you hear about us working on a managed campground?  You. You've said it multiple times on your post that you agree with Charles Within.  We're not doing that.  Thanks.  If he's trying to infer something, he's absolutely wrong.  We're not using a backup for you.  So our last speaker is Curtis Anderson.  For me. was February 20th discussing problems that my neighbors problems that my neighbors and I are having on Riverbend Lane  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  the council with some pictures of the problems  that we're having. After the meeting,  Councillor Bennett and Eric  reached, we talked  afterwards, and soon afterwards  there was enforcement and cleaned out the  channel, and we didn't have any problems.  But within days of  enforcement happening, the people come  back in, and  it just continues to get more.  And to the present day, there's currently  large tents,  there's people passed  out in the morning when I walk my dog  on the bike path along Mission  Ranch. Recently, somebody's  moved next to our neighborhood in River Bend,  and they're unhooking  our hoses, using our water  without our permission.  I feel for them. The weather  is hot, but I think that they've  all been, most of  them, when there's enforcement, have been offered  opportunities to do something,  and they don't take it. And it's  just frustrating to me that  time and time again, the city  has to spend the time, and we  have to deal with the repercussions  of these people living in the channel.  I mentioned last time that  my neighbor had somebody  break into their garage while they were there,  so no one came. They didn't  come here in time to do a  public comment, but those are my neighbors  that had somebody go into their garage  that my wife had to come and kick out.  So I guess I just, again,  I'm going to respond.  I'm going to respectfully request  the city take enforcement in  lindow channel from esplanade  down to the railroad tracks and  do so in a continuous and  consistent matter. Thank you very  much.  thank you. He's our last  speaker.  thank you very much. We'll move  on to public hearing. Hearing to consider the final annual  engineers report and levy and collection of the !  Thank you.  close the presentation and  we'll let the council.  any questions?  that was our  first presentation ever.  you're correct.  turning over a new leaf.  will you detail out every  single specific thing that  covered? no. if you want a power point, we can  definitely load one up.  I'll let you know.  all right.  we'll open the public hearing.  any speakers?  we have none.  surprise. surprise. close the public hearing.  entertain a motion.  no.  move to approve.  second.  all right. so we have a motion from  council member winslow. second from vice mayor rounds. and that's a resolution of the city council. the city of chico approving the final engineers report and ordering the levy and collection of assessments for the houston  transit.  council member  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

Code Amendment 24-01.  General Plan.  Text Amendment 24-03.  General Plan.  Amendment Reason 24-01.  Chico not accompanied.  Welcome.  And we have a report from Senior Planner Kelly Murphy.  Thank you.  Good evening.  I'll have a few more words for you on this one.  All right.  So the proposed amendments today represent Phase 1 of a planned multi-phase code amendment  program and are referred to as the Residential Readiness Program as the majority.  The majority of amendments are intended to streamline existing processes, reduce barriers  for residential development, and facilitate housing production.  The proposed code amendments are broken up into three main categories for the Council's  consideration, including implementation of housing element actions, response to Council  direction, and cleanups for consistency with state law.  Last September, the City Council adopted the 2022 housing element.  Shortly thereafter, HCD certified that the housing element should be !  The first phase of Title 19 amendments focuses on residential readiness and implements actions  under housing element Goals 3, 4, 5, and 8.  I'm going to briefly touch on the actions being implemented under each goal and provide  the relevant state legislative context.  So three housing element actions under Goal 3, as well as three housing element actions  under Goal 4, have been implemented as described in the staff report.  The background for these actions is the California Density Bonus Law, which allows developers  to request density bonuses and concessions on the percentage of affordable units proposed  as part of a project.  Recent legislation, AB 2345, amended state law, expanding the density bonus and incentives  for projects meeting specific affordability thresholds.  The study of Chico's density bonus provision is provided in Chapter 1962, which has been  updated.  The state law has also updated the Density Bonus Law.  Two actions have been implemented under Goal 5, relating to fair housing access for persons  with disabilities.  These housing element actions were prompted by state housing element law, which requires  the City to provide a process for granting reasonable accommodation requests for persons  with disabilities.  The City's reasonable accommodation procedures are established in Section 1960.130 and have  been amended under Goal 6.  The state law has also amended the Density Bonus Law, which requires the City to provide  greater transparency and objectivity for reasonable accommodation requests through a ministerial  process.  Finally, we have two actions under Goal 8, which relate to emergency shelters and respond  to state housing element law as amended by AB 2339, requiring local governments to determine  whether there is adequate capacity in zoning districts where emergency shelters are permitted  by right.  The recent housing element update determined that the state's ability to provide housing  elements to the state's residents is not in compliance with state law.  The IOMU, or Industrial Office Mixed Use Zone, was selected based on its ample acreage to  accommodate emergency shelters.  Residential uses are permitted in the IOMU zone, and areas zoned IOMU are located near  services and amenities along both the Highway 32 corridor and Park Avenue.  State law also requires local governments to determine the area's use for residential  The IOMU's proposed amendments ensure that emergency shelter parking requirements do  not exceed the amount of spaces required only for staff, necessitating an amendment to  the parking table in Chapter 1970.  Moving on from the housing element actions, we'll now go over the code amendments which  respond to recent council direction, including opportunities to streamline the review process  for projects requiring architectural review, eliminating parking requirements for residential  development, and reducing the number of parking spaces required for residential development.  The IOMU's proposed amendments include the implementation of the  special restrictions on the sale and service of alcohol by council resolution, and implementing  minor cleanups to the regulations for commercial cannabis uses.  Several efficiencies have been directed by council, which have been implemented and require  amendments to Title 19, including determination of additional project types that may be classified  as minor projects and approved at the director level, as well as the implementation of the  The IOMU's proposed amendments include the development of separate design review findings  for residential versus non-residential projects.  Projects requiring site plan and architectural design review are defined in the code as either  major or minor.  Minor projects are those which, because of their limited size and scope, have reduced  aesthetic implications.  Planning staff met with the Chico Builders Association on multiple occasions to discuss  additional project types that could be classified as minor, and amendments to the code are proposed.  The IOMU's proposed amendments include the following project types as minor.  Duplexes and triplexes that meet all applicable development standards, commercial projects  not located on an arterial or within 300 feet of a residential use, as well as residential  projects within a master plan area which have adopted design guidelines.  Consistent with the evolving state legislation, staff has prepared objective design review  findings for residential projects, which will allow projects meeting specific design requirements.

For consistency with state law,  amendments have been made to remove the use permit requirement  for single-family and multifamily housing land uses  in the OR, or office residential zone,  as well as allow multifamily housing by right in the IOMU zone.  Staff also received direction from the council  to address parking requirements in the downtown area  to support smaller residential projects  above commercial uses on the ground floor.  And to identify geographic boundaries  where parking requirements may be waived  for residential projects  and establish a threshold for what may be considered  a smaller project based on the number of new units created.  The recommended amendments to Chapter 1970  would provide more flexibility for residential uses  in the downtown parking area.  As proposed, no new parking would be required  for projects creating fewer than 20 new units.  For the purpose of this project,  Reduced parking benefits would also be extended  to projects creating more than 20 units,  requiring parking to be provided at a rate consistent  with what we require for multifamily housing  in a corridor opportunity site,  which represents the lowest residential parking requirement  in our code.  The proposed amendments are consistent  with action DT721 of the downtown element,  which calls for eliminating and reducing parking requirements  in the downtown zoning districts,  as well as housing element action 427  to support higher density development in downtown,  as well as housing element 427  to promote housing construction by reducing  and allowing flexibility in minimum parking requirements.  The last two council directives  involved special restrictions on the sale and service of alcohol.  So to make future changes easier,  council directed staff to amend the code  so that certain restrictions placed on the sale and service of alcohol  may be reduced.  to be set forth by council resolution  and not by ordinance.  Adoption of council resolution  would eliminate the prohibition of alcohol sales and service  during certain times on graduation  and labor day weekends.  And finally, the last council direction  involved minor cleanups  to our regulations for commercial cannabis.  The council  just directed, I believe,  two minor amendments to the definitions  which ensure consistency with state cannabis license type definitions.  the  Lastly, the site summarizes the  four official planning director  interpretations that would be  codified and corresponding  amendments to table L U 2 of the  general plan are proposed for  consistency with the changes I  just went over. Specifically to  clarify that all residential and  commercial zoning districts within  the corridor opportunities site  zoning overlay may benefit from  higher allowable residential  densities.  As for the final component of  this report, staff has identified  an amendment to the city's land  use diagram and zoning map  involving five parcels  historically owned and operated by  the Chico Nut Company. The site  has a net area of approximately  10 acres and represents an  opportunity for the adaptive reuse  of a large industrial site.  The proposed amendment is  consistent with the avenue's  neighborhood plan to leverage  economic opportunities and  development within the Chico Nut  site. The Chico Nut site  represents a potential gateway and  presents a significant concentration  of land available for residential  and retail development or  redevelopment. Designating the  properties as commercial mixed  use would encourage the integration  of retail and service commercial  uses with office and or residential.  Rezoning the site to CC or  community commercial would allow for  the use of a variety of uses to  be implemented. No development  plans have been proposed at this  time and the plan development  overlay will require that any  future development proposal be  considered by the planning commission.  The plan development overlay also  provides more flexibility in  development standards such as  building height and setbacks to  allow for the potential reuse of  existing structures.  On May 16th the planning commission  forwarded recommendations of approval  to the city council on the proposed  amendments subject to the following  minor revisions which are supported by  staff. The commission also forwarded  a unanimous recommendation of approval  on the proposed general plan amendment  and rezone for the Chico Nut company.  The amendments do not propose any  construction, demolition or other  activity that has the potential for  causing a significant effect on the  environment and are therefore exempt  from sequestration. The plan also  pursuant to section 15061B3. As I  mentioned any future development  projects would be reviewed on an  individual basis for compliance with  sequa. With that the community  development director recommends the  city council adopt the proposed  amendments by introducing ordinances  under attachments A and E and  approved resolutions as shown in  attachments B, C and D. Thank you  for your time.  Mr. Brown.  Mr. Brown.  that was an extensive read.  I'm glad I went through it. I did have  some questions and a few concerns but  I talked to director v yesterday. He  clarified everything that I needed  clarification. I'm happy with it. Thank  you for all your hard work.  Thank you very much.  Any other questions?  Council member Wenzel.  This really had some of everything in  it. Like housing, weed, the  alcohol, reverse vending machines.  That's for recycling.  I have some questions just on housing  honestly with all due respect.  There's two things that I wanted to  focus on a little bit. One is there  are some changes to the requirements  permit requirements for residential  care homes otherwise known as board  and care facilities. I wondered if you  could just run through that really  quick. Do you have that on hand?  We are eliminating the use permit  requirements for residential care  homes six or fewer. We are  having some changes in the  in the office residential use. I  believe the intent was to reduce the  barriers for residential related  projects.  Recently the board of  supervisors saw something similar  because Buchanan behavioral health  expressed they had a large need for  these residential care facilities. It's  really hard to get them approved. They  don't allow seven or more in the zoning  districts that exist in the county.  Likewise we require a use permit for  available.  And so, yeah, one thing that  I think wasn't mentioned here. So this  residential readiness, this is phase one.  So can you touch on phase two for  us and where we're going?  I don't have a number of how many more  housing element actions that are  directly related to planning we'll be  bringing forward in phase two.  But the idea was that these  were more of the state  mandated, tell us what we have to do  to update our code  for consistency and  the second phase we'll get into more  amendments that I think will require more  collaboration across different agencies  and perhaps engage  public comment more.  You can expect that probably  towards the end of the year.  I also include  some of the things that I think  this council is interested in that  also might support our  pro-housing effort, which is  expanding our corridor opportunity  areas,  things like that that we've also  committed to as part of the housing element.  The reason I asked is just to say I think that we ought to look at the residential care homes and what barriers we still have on them, especially given that behavioral health has this mandate now to spend a third of their funds from the mental health services act on housing, which they have been very clear that they don't have the capacity currently to do. So we can assist them by having that discussion at a future time. And one more thing that I just wanted to shine a light on before we go to public comment is that we have a lot of  questions about the change to the  industrial office mixed use zoning, allowing housing by right.  So the housing element action says  allow multifamily housing by right, but when I  read it in here, it says  allow 14 to 35 dwelling  units an acre. It's a lot more than you could before  if the units are deed, if  15% of the units are deed restricted  housing affordable to low income households  at or below 80% of the area median  income. So otherwise, if it's a  full market rate project, then you  don't get that density bonus. That's what I'm understanding.  Yeah, that's correct. A portion.  that at least 15% would have to be  dedicated for I believe up to 80%  am I.  yeah. We will have some more  discussion about that in a bit.  Is this a question or a discussion?  That was just to have her clarify  the information for us.  let' s do questions.  more questions? I' ve got one.  why are we limiting or I guess  planning commission did it but from notification from 500 to 500?  300 feet.  what was the thought process behind that?  our  noticing boundary has changed over time  and it vacillates.  all it takes is one project that blows up  and a council will say why weren' t they noticed  another 100 feet away or 200 feet away?  three or four years later why is the noticing so wide?  and so I think what planning commission was saying is the 500 feet is adequate.  We have a community that likes to  know what' s happening in their community and the additional cost is minimal.  We supported that and said we don' t need to touch that.  so they' ll all be 500 feet?  not all.  There' s some new regulations we did for minor land divisions and subdivisions but for larger projects that use permits the like where people are usually interested in things like residential care homes that might be coming into their community or their neighborhood.  We' re keeping the 500 feet.  Okay.  That makes sense.  More questions?  No.  Okay.  Thank you.  Open the public hearing.  Do we have any speakers?  We do not.  We will close the public hearing.  Okay.  Mr. Winslow.  I think it would be nice to get a head nod that we' ll discuss residential care homes in the future phases of residential readiness.  I think there' s a lot of value in that.  I don' t know if I' m getting it in the right way.  I think you' ve got a no shake or got a yes shake.  But yeah.  Okay.  I thought it was past use.  On the industrial office mixed use.  I think this is one of the most substantial changes that came out of the housing.  It required that we up zone substantially these areas.  There' re only three of them.  I' m just going to name them.  There' s fair street.  That area we call the wedge between south park avenue and fair street.  There' s a corner of south campus neighborhood that has this zoning.  And then some of north avenue.  It doesn' t really exist anywhere else.  So it' s like these areas we looked at.  They have good proximity to services.  This is why those were areas that are identified for allowing this.  So if you don' t have any.  If you don' t have a few affordable units on here.  You will not be able to build high density.  You won' t be able to build multi-family housing essentially.  There' s some specific requirements on it that existed before.  And we saw virtually none of these projects happen.  If you do have affordable housing as it is.  The state gives you a 50% density bonus already.  So you' re already looking at substantially being able to raise the amount.  So I think that' s a good thing.  I' m well generally I support affordable housing.  Incorporating affordable housing.  I' ve never seen a project in Chico that has just a few units of subsidized housing.  With the rest of the market rate.  It' s just generally not done.  If you' re doing an affordable project.  You use it' s all subsidized.  You get the government money.  And you build it based on that.  And I think that' s still likely to happen in these places.  But also the fair street area in particular to focus on.  Is next to a historically disadvantaged neighborhood.  It is an industrial area.  It lacks in infrastructure.  There' s a lot of construction.  There are opportunities with development to punch through streets.  To improve circulation.  There are significant external benefits to having any kind of multi-family development happen there.  And because there' s already a concentration of low income people in that area of town.  I think there are benefits for long term look of fair housing.  To not promote and require that it be a concentration of affordable housing in the future.  And that affordable housing be spread out more widely throughout the community.  So with all that in mind.  I think I' d prefer to suspend.  I think I' d prefer to strike that language.  And just allow 14 to 35 units per acre in general.  And not require that there be 15% of the units deed restricted.  I' ll make a motion to approve all of these.  With just that caveat.  That in this language.  Industrial office mixed use allows 14 to 35 units per gross acre.  We strike the following.  When at least 15% of the units are deed restricted housing.  Affordable to low income households.  At or below 80% of area median income.  I believe we' ve got a question.  Because we have to get in line with state law.  Was that part of that?  Just to provide a little context.  We included in our vacant land inventory.  For HCD if you remember we had our RHNA numbers.  And there' s different categories from above moderate, moderate, low, and very low.  We worked with HCD closely to include certain vacant land.  That was designated zoned IOMU.  On that inventory.  Mostly in the category of meeting the affordability component.  The very low and low.  And so the goal then was to have a vacant land inventory.  consideration is we don'  t want to I'  m all about the free  market but the goal is to keep  that land as a resource to meet  those goals of the very low or  affordable housing so that'  s why we want to make  sure there'  s a component of it that was  going to be affordable. Hcd was  comfortable with that and that'  s what we brought forward. My  concern would be the value of  have the land for iomu is  probably lower than you might  find for r3 and r4 and rmu and  so there may be a run for once  I believe in the free market but  there might be a run on this  cheaper land to make it  multifamily and we'  d also then lose out on  having this vacant land that  we'  re using hopefully to create  affordable housing. That'  s my only concern. I didn'  t want to make that  available.  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? !  ?  the affordable component?  no we won'  t be inconsistent with  state law however as that land  starts to get absorbed we may  have to go out and find more  vacant land to share with hcd  because as it comes off we have  to prove we have more so that'  s my concern the ledger.  we have a motion or a second?  second.  just to elaborate for a second  because I understand that we  had this conversation earlier by  the way staff and I and that  this land could be sucked up for  too many market rate projects  and we would lose out on those  opportunities there and I think  that can be a real concern it  would be a really good problem  for us to have that we had too  many apartment projects planned  and redeveloping old industrial  areas that have really good  access to services I don'  t know that we'  re right in that  situation I also am perfectly  comfortable with us in the  future.  I think we need to be  whole to identify more sites for  affordable housing and I think  we should just promote high  density development hcd in our  housing element uses density as  a proxy for affordability  because you naturally have lower  costs for production and you  end up with more affordable  housing naturally just by  allowing higher density and  that'  s what I think we  should be focusing on more than  looking for deed restricted  affordable housing and  conditioning it I'  m worried  that we will get non-residential  projects or very low density  residential projects in those  areas.  we have a motion and a second  any further comment.  all right.  That includes an ordinance in  city council and city of chico  approving code amendment.  I have to read the ordinances.  are you going to take the  motion before you take public  input on this item.  I thought we already called  it.  I'  m sorry.  I'  m sorry.  I was looking at the next one.  no.  no.  we have 14 speakers.  you are good.  don'  don'  don't jump ahead.  you are good.  I will read the right one.  I promise.  I will read the right one.  ordinance of the city council  and city of chico approving  code amendment 24-01 amendment  title 19 of the chico  municipal code to support  residential readiness city of  chico and also an ordinance in  the city council and city of  chico approving rezoned 24-01.  madame mcclernand you are  ready.  okay.  that includes the language that  was council member winslow asked  to be straightforward.  Thank you.  So when you think about what makes this a special place, there are three things.  It's the campus, and it's the park, and it's the downtown.  And Bidwell Park is a truly magical place.  I think we all agree.  Dealing with cars is a huge issue right now, and it's part of a larger effort to revitalize the park.  So right now, and the reason we have to deal with this now is, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Autobani,  but next year, 2025, we're going to repave Peterson and South Park Drive?  Definitely Peterson Memorial.  South Park Drive may have some other constraints environmentally, so it might be a year behind it.  Okay, so in the next year or two, but we need to start the planning process right now is the point.  So 10 years ago, the Chico Parks Division,  I don't know how they got the number, but they said there was a million visitor days annually in the park.  This was 10 years ago, and we have 15% more people living here.  So when you do the math on that, that says on a busy weekend when the weather's nice,  we're going to have 10,000 daily visitors in the park.  And that's the whole park.  That's a golf course, upper park, lower park.  So dealing with how cars conflict with pedestrians and cyclists on Peterson,  and South Park, which are the principal hiking, biking trails in Lower Park, is critical.  So, again, as part of a larger effort, in 2023,  consulting firm named Headway Transportation did an evaluation of Lower Park.  They had some extremely good recommendations, including increasing parking,  aligning the pedestrian access with existing crosswalks,  allowing to walk through the park, and allowing to walk through the park.  They also had recommendations on two-way bike traffic on Peterson and South Park,  and wayfinding signs and some others.  So what I propose is, what I would like to ask the council to consider is closing  Peterson Memorial Drive and South Park Drive to motorized vehicles on national holidays,  Saturdays and Sundays, so it will be open during the week.  And to have the staff report back to council with a suggested road configuration plan  that includes consideration of the recommendations,  and the recommendations made by Headway Transportation in their March 27-23 report to the Butte Park and Playground Commission.  There are some details to work out.  For example, I'm not proposing that we close South Park Drive between the entrance and Caper Acres to cars,  because I think with all the ball fields and stuff, we need to have automobile access for that.  And so, I think that we need to have a lot of information on that.  So I pass it back to you, Mr. Mayor.  All right.  Questions from Mr. Randover?  All right.  How many speakers?  Can I ask a question?  Actually, Mr. Auduboni, I feel like this was mentioned sometime,  but you said, I think, there wouldn't be a design difference in whether we close it off to cars.  Like, you would still keep the same width for the road and everything?  It's a striping issue?  On Peterson Memorial Drive, yeah, the width would stay the same.  So we are doing design right now.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me. [inaudible]  For me. ! The ! The ! The  integrates other environmental constraints and processes that we have  to go through that would not allow us to achieve construction by next year so  that would kind of fall behind there so we'd probably be looking at if we didn't  take this any action here like bikes in one area and cars and people walking  another separated facilities within the pavement yeah yeah so they have  delineated spaces to be yeah one more thing just because a lot of this  revolves around parking and access I mean that the concerns that come up from  people and some of that is like people are comfortable parking on the north  side because Valambroza has this dirt you know it's an unpaid shoulder we are  gonna reconstruct Valambroza in the next few years right do you have a timetable  on that forget off the top of my head but yeah that was in the 10-year plan  adopted by Council back in October so we actually are in the process of putting  out an RFP for design the design of Valambroza will be a little more complex  we wanted to allow for adequate time so by the time  we get to the end of the year we're going to be able to get to the end of the year  we get to that in the 10-year plan we have the design completed and we're ready to  construct okay maybe an error question but do we have somewhere on the books  like in a map like a map of all the parking in Bidwell Park or some kind of  like look at where there's existing parking available at what point in the  park there I don't believe there's a delineation or an inventory of parking  spots in Lower Park there's kind of an estimate for Upper Park I believe it's  471  but there I don't believe we have one for Lower Park because a lot of folks do  park on the shoulders of both Peterson and South Park Drive but we do have  detailed maps as far as that show the picnic sites and reservation sites and  a lot of the features yeah great thank you all right so we have 15 speakers on  this item and I'm gonna call the first two names and if you could go ahead and  line up in the middle aisle we'll be able to get through two minutes okay so  the first two speakers will be Margaret Blake followed by Nicole Nava  For 16 years  For 16 years  For 16 years  For 16 years  For 16 years  For 16 years The ! The !  impact chico should be proactive not reactive a kid will get hit by a car in that park i go to  open time today i have raised three kids who all learn to ride their bike in that park and have  had way too many close encounters luckily they're old enough now they know bike safety but i'm  concerned for another small child in this community getting hit by a car the master plan in the park  is great it's so wonderful to read about this beautiful gem that we have um protecting the  natural resources nowhere in there that i see joyriding smoking pot on lunch breaks throwing  cigarettes out windows speeding through a park in a car that was not mentioned so um i highly  encourage not only to shut it on holidays and weekends i think that the south park road which  adopted that plan that was 15 20 years ago shutting south park completely to allow the kids to commute  to school on bikes allow community community members to safely walk and bicycle through the  park without the risk of getting hit  by a car i encourage the city to or challenge the city to maybe find a better solution for people  that have access issues so that they can park and get into picnic spots kind of refocusing some of  the areas right now they're kind of open spaces that people can park and get access to the river  and the creek without driving through it because i think it could be a huge safety issue at some  point the population of the city's boomed and it went from a few you know people taking a sunday  break to a few days ago and people speeding through that on a regular basis so um i encourage  it to be shopping thank you thank you nicole nava followed by john sinigan  good evening again um i strenuously object to a closure of the park on the weekends and the  holidays to vehicles um anecdotally i have been in chico almost my entire life i worked in service to  the elderly and assisted care facility which i very much enjoyed and would take into account as well as  the residents of the park so i think it's important to be able to take the residents on drives through  the park we kind of had a tradition of lunch and driving through same with my great-aunt  these are folks who otherwise would not have been able to enjoy other areas of the park  i understand that people are talking about having bump outs or whatever to have them directed to  very specific picnic sites or areas within the park i think that's very directive and  doesn't give people the autonomy that they have to get to these various spaces in a vehicle  um it leaves out moms and dads who have multiple kids pets picnic all those the equipment you're  trying to haul around um i feel like we keep going to this only bike and walk community and we're  like not looking at as accessibility issues for people who are disabled elderly etc and i think  it's just a disturbing trend the weekends and holidays are the highest usage so you're basically  going sorry for you guys  I've lived here, like I said, forever, and I asked if there was an accident, any serious thing.  Staff had said no, not that they were aware of.  I've actually almost been hit multiple times more by bicycles repeatedly.  They haul, you know what, through the park and oftentimes don't call out on your left, on your right,  all the polite things that people, we try to do as a community.  So there are people that are on where I live and also friends, neighbors who ask me to speak and say,  you know what, no, we enjoy driving through the park.  I think at any age people enjoy moving through it and being able to see the beauty of our park.  I would hate to see it restricted to just people that are bipedal.  Thank you.  Thank you.  John Finnegan followed by Katie Hawley.  And if you could go ahead and line up in the middle.  That would be great.  Thank you.  Hi.  I do understand the challenges of closing the park to vehicular traffic.  But I asked the council, you know, I'm supportive of the proposal and asked the council to consider  the number of people that are walking, pushing strollers, riding bikes, riding skateboards,  riding scooters through the park on a heavily traveled day is amazing.  I don't think there's none.  I think there's a lot of park in the state of California that has heavy traffic that Bidwell experiences in those days.  And it just seems to me that it's inconsistent to have vehicular traffic moving down at a regular pace on these heavily trafficked days  with that many pedestrians and bikers out there.  Speaking personally, I've got five grandchildren that I'm in the park with on a regular basis, all of some of them.  Most of them have learned how to ride bikes.  How to get around on that.  And it's a place where parents go when the children are first, you know, getting on the bikes, moving around on the bikes,  and enjoying them, not on the streets, into the park.  With the cars coming down on a regular basis, it just makes it tough.  So the issue of just safety is a concern.  Just the common issue of heavily pedestrian usage on a weekend with cars coming on a regular basis.  Just seems to me that it's a problem.  It seems inconsistent to me.  So for that reason, I'm supportive of the closure on the heavily trafficked days.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Katie Hawley, followed by Eric Booth.  I'd like to thank Councilmember VanEverbeck for putting this on the agenda.  Any attempt to help the citizens' well-being and safety should not go without appreciation.  It should also be noted that our engineers have presented us with a number of questions.  We've been asked with a lot of amazing solutions to issues that have been talked about today already,  such as ADA compatibility.  A lot of people do use handbikes.  People push strollers.  These are things that are oftentimes low to the ground that people in a limited truck, for example, would not be able to see.  So having these crossings where children on bikes are going through with vehicles is a recipe for disaster.  And it's always better to get ahead of the times.  Because we have to have a ball before waiting for a disaster to happen.  So I am heavily in favor of this.  And it's important to note that it is very financially sound for the city to minimize the amount of traffic on these roads through Lower Park,  specifically because it will minimize the damage that these roads get.  And therefore, we will have to relieve it less and less often, saving the city money.  Thank you.  booth, followed by Samuel Steedman.  Good evening, counselors.  I'm just going to keep it short for you guys.  I just want to emphasize a couple reasons  why I think closing Bidwell  Park's car is a fantastic idea.  The first is road  maintenance starts to get  more expensive once you  start including vehicles in the mix.  Vehicles are only getting bigger  and heavier with trucks  getting bigger and used.  The second  being the enjoyment of our  historical park with less  pollution both from vehicles and  noise. And the third being  encouraging alternate modes of transportation  to reduce traffic in the city.  Thank you for your efforts,  Dr. Parks.  Thank you. Samuel Steedman,  followed by Ann Byker-Kaufman.  Yeah, I think  it would be wonderful to have less  traffic in the park. I've been doing that  probably my entire life.  It's wonderful to have a space where  there are less cars usually in general.  Having no cars would be  a decent benefit. Not to mention, if you're  actually trying to get somewhere in the park, it's nice to get on the  side roads and park off.  I tend to drive there on hot days  in my car and then want to run  in the park, but I don't go through the park  to find a spot to run from necessarily.  It's not necessarily the quickest way to get there.  Maybe it'd be easier  with the money we'd be saving without  not spending, recovering from  cars on the road.  To actually make the park  more accessible for those that are differently  able to access it.  I think there's options, but thank you.  Thank you. Ann Byker-Kaufman,  followed by Whitney Garcia.  I would also like to thank Tom  and Overbeek for proposing  closing  Saturday, Sunday, and Palm Beach.  It's a great idea.  And  one thing,  that I thought might be added,  is to put in traffic calming  to keep the speeds to about  10 miles an hour or less,  so that Monday through Friday,  people can also enjoy the park  without worrying about speeding vehicles  going to the park.  The other thing I'd like to add is that  I think it would be a good idea,  as these park roads get more and more busy, to have a lot of people going to the park.  I think it would be a good idea to get repaved  to add some more accessible parking spots,  add places in between where we currently have parking lots,  where there's more empty spots,  and there's a nice paved path  that can get people with disabilities  into the park to particularly nice spots.  And another thing to think about is  to define what is meant by  a safe road for vehicles,  and to be sure that mobility scooters  and electric wheelchairs  and adaptive hand cycles  with throttles on them  would still be allowed.  And again, just thanks so much for proposing this.  I think it's a great idea.  Thank you.  Whitney Garcia, followed by Catherine Cottle.  Thank you. My name is Whitney, and I'm the co-manager of ChicoVelo.  And our mission is to promote  bicycling and transportation in our community.  who are engaged in education and health  through public education, advocacy, and community stewardship.  Just to reiterate, thank you very much  for putting this consideration on the agenda.  We fully support the request to close  Peterson Memorial Drive and South Park Drive  to vehicular traffic on weekends and holidays.  This closure would increase safety,  make a quieter and more enjoyable route  through Lower Park.  It would also reduce the maintenance needs  created by heavy vehicle use.  It would also add economic safety  and economic value to our downtown community  and continue to elevate Chico as a destination for visitors.  We urge Council to direct staff  to ensure accessibility into the park  for the disabled communities  by going above and beyond ADA requirements.  We urge you to ensure all citizens feel welcome  and included in enjoying this amazing community amenity  that is Lower Park.  While we fully support this closure of Lower Park  to roads and vehicles on weekends and holidays,  we hope that at a future time  a permanent closure of vulnerable  park roads to vehicles will happen.  Thank you.  Catherine Cuttle Mary Wall ! The ! The !  Mary Wall  Mary Wall  Mary Wall  Mary Wall  Mary Wall ! The ! ! The ! The ! The  like me who have, I have cerebral palsy, other people who have mobility issues, older people  who have mobility issues, children who have mobility issues, and their families who must  get them through.  Or someone, is anyone envisioning perhaps I have my car, I take my truck, I get out,  I use this, then I attach my cooler to the back of it, and my husband walks along with  me who also has mobility issues.  I think there's some things that just haven't been thought of.  But if you're talking about making AV accessible, that would be wonderful.  Or have you considered perhaps, because reasonably speaking, there are people who are responsible  car drivers, there are responsible bikers, there are people who are irresponsible, driving  too fast in the car, driving too fast in the park with cars and bicycles.  So how about if bicycles go on the park only on the park where they are now, where cars  are already blocked, has anyone considered that?  And perhaps only cars on the side that you're considering blocked.  So if you're talking to people like me, that may sound good on my issue, but I'm not sure  that anyone has spent a lot of time thinking about the ADA undergird of this.  And I urge some thought on that because we're all getting older.  I mean, I have to do policy.  But if you get older, you don't have the same mobility.  It's just a fact of life.  Anyone can become disabled at any moment, at any time of their life, through an accident.  So please get consideration.  I urge you to get consideration to ADA accessibility by all people, regardless of their mobility issues.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Larry Wall, followed by Francis M. Colburn.  Good evening, Mayor Freelance, council, staff.  We all pay taxes in this community, and I think in order to make it fair for all, everybody  should have equal access.  Equal opportunity to all the amenities here in Chico.  Persons of a certain age, at a certain physical capacity, including myself, would like to  stop by and get an ice cream cone, take the leech and take a ride through South Park,  and then through Peterson Drive on a Sunday afternoon.  Two things that find our life.  And more importantly, families, working families, will not be able to access the park during  Saturday and Sunday at this rate.  Morning.  Here they go.  When they want to haul up the kids and the dog and, well, not the dog at home, but haul  up the kids and grab the neighbor and come down to have a picnic and let the kids land  free.  Won't be able to be done.  So I would suggest an alternative, and that would be to close the portion of the park  on Saturdays and Fridays, or Sundays and Mondays.  That way everybody gets a shot.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. ! ! The !  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. ! The !  to be done as a paratransit driver.  In doing that, we have taken many people in their wheelchairs to the park.  They go to meet their families, or they just want to go and sit.  I would feel horrendous sadness for these people that would be unable to do that.  How many of them can walk from the beginning of the park  and to get to the creek or the barbecue area?  People need access.  These are people that just have no other way to get to that area.  People have to drive their cars with them.  I read Annie Benwell's grants of park land to the city.  No alcohol land is to be used as a public park.  Preserve the trees, shrubs, and vines.  No hunting and no public.  Picnics on Sunday.  It says here that the city accepted the grant,  and it was for the benefit of all its citizens.  And if you disregard the needs of those that are disabled  or unable to get to where they're going,  to the park, the beautiful park that we all brag about,  you know, why are we discounting them?  They are.  They are part of us.  They are part of Chico.  They've been here for probably since birth.  Some of them.  We can't discount them.  It's part of what Annie Benwell wanted.  Every citizen.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Susan Sparkle, followed by Jeff Glatz.  Hello, Thomas.  Thank you so much for coming.  I do want to say that it's true that she did want us to be able to,  to drive to the park, and no alcohol was allowed,  and no camping was allowed, and all of these things that are happening.  And I mean, I've been here since 1984, and one of the things that I love about Chico  was being able to drive to that beautiful park, and seeing the cork trees,  and the redwood trees, and I mean, it was just gorgeous.  And to deprive people to drive through, to show family members that are coming through Chico  back to their homes.  And that, you know, opportunity is just horrendous.  And I know that Annie Benwell did want us not to drink, not to camp there, because it  would ruin the pinky of it all.  And it is.  And I love it here, and I would never change a thing.  And if we want to do anything to help the park, I think adding more speed bumps so that  people can't go driving fast.  You know, I ride my bicycle on the park, through the park.  And, you know, people do respect us going through the park.  I've never gotten up, drove my kids, you know, through the park.  And I've never been, you know, hit or anything like that.  It was never like that.  And I don't understand how people are saying that, because I just don't get it.  But, you know, I love it.  And I would want to change a thing.  Add more speed bumps.  That's my suggestion.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jeff Glatz, followed by Bryce Goldstein.  Mr. Mayor, Councilman, thank you guys for having me here.  I just wanted to add a little color on this from what we've been talking about at the  Commission level on this, because I do believe, and I think everyone now agrees, and I thank  you so much for bringing this, by the way, to your guys' attention.  A solution does need to be adopted on this issue.  I am personally reluctant to think about closing the roads at this time, because a solution  is creating more access for the people.  There is a belief that the public should be able to access the park.  I think we've been talking about it with Brendan in his office, and we've already been discussing  this, because I believe we were initially going to pave the roads until 4 and now it's  been pushed to 5, so things are getting pushed a little bit.  But there is process.  It seems that an entire separation of pedestrians and vehicles and bikes needs to be created.  That's kind of the answer to everyone's problems.  And that hasn't been set up yet.  Closing down the roads on the weekends to all the families and coming families, that's  not going to be the solution.  And I think the problem is that the public has to be able to enjoy the picnic tables.  It's probably a little premature until safe areas will be developed for them to park their  cars or wheelchairs and have access to get to the picnic areas.  So I think this is great that we're talking about it.  If you guys do it, it's fine, I guess.  But I'm just reluctant to restrict access to the people of Chicago.  And I think it's the start of a conversation that needs to be now prioritized.  I wouldn't necessarily be waiting until 2025 to take care of this, because now it's an  issue that everyone agrees.  It needs to be worked on.  Having said that, when you look at the pedestrians versus bikes versus cars, the complaints I  hear more often are actually bikes.  So you can't just say the cars are the safety issue in the park.  That's why I believe separation has to happen between pedestrians and both of those.  There are two currently, there's two rough paths north of Peterson right now.  They just aren't used.  That's what we're talking about.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  For me personally, I don't know what's going on.  taller. We have trucks that are nearly my height at the front. You can't see a  small child in front of you if one runs out and you're not paying attention. Of course people  should be paying attention. So that's one reason that it concerns me having cars  allowed in certain areas of the park and also cars are pollutants and there's  particulate matter from tires and they're getting heavier too so that when  collisions happen or you know when pavement is disrupted these issues are  being amplified. So I talked to community members who shared a perspective that I  hadn't thought of because it's not my experience that some people who  experience disabilities don't really have that alternative to enjoying their  park without being driven in a car as people mentioned here. There are also  people with disabilities or low-income people who don't have access to cars and  we need to consider them  as well.  And that a lot of people are using the park as their way to get to work or their main  place to bring their family to recreate. So we need to consider everybody  regardless of what their mode of transportation is and that we also include people who have disabilities.  So I think there are compromises like closing the park for certain days like  is proposed, allowing paratransit as somebody mentioned here and I think this  needs to be a conversation with people of all abilities.  I think that we could establish a committee of the parks commission on accessibility or some other city funded committee to discuss this with people of different perspectives and abilities.  So in summary this is worth pursuing. I'm happy to see it talked about and we have to take the time to plan it well for everybody. Thank you.  Thank you. And our last speaker is Kirk Mumford.  Thanks for a good night.  Thank you.  Thank you.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  through a park like this.  And now we've got a little road.  They talk about modifying it.  They're supposed to pave it.  I thought it was this year,  but I guess it's next year or the year after.  Notice that to bring the road up to code  so that it would accept cars,  that it meets Caltrans standards,  you'd have to plow up the whole road  and put down an underlayment.  I mean, it's just asphalt over dirt right now.  I think that's pretty much what it is.  And to maintain it is just terrible  because it's not made to take heavy cars all the time.  Anyway, I'm glad that you're restricting the flow  a little bit,  at least on holidays and weekends.  And as far as accessibility goes,  I don't know exactly what is planned.  I mean, I didn't see the consultant's report  on the road.  So I don't know what's planned.  But on 8th Avenue, you have some bulb outs  and so on in those parking places.  Now, if you're going to do the same thing  on Val Ambrosia, that's good  because you need people to be able to park there  and unload and they need sidewalks  and they need better access.  There's lots of access points into the park  along Peterson Drive,  but they need to be improved  and some of the bridges need to be changed.  So that people can get over them.  They got too much slant.  That's time.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Last speaker.  All right.  Comment.  Mr. Van Overbeek.  I want to thank and acknowledge Mr. Mumford  for being instrumental  in getting Old Humboldt Road repaved.  I've been a couple of wheels on a bike  going up and down that road.  So thank you very much.  There are a couple of people who referenced Annie Bidwell.  I would like to point out that when she gave this land  to the city in 1905,  there was not a single automobile in Chico.  So the idea that Annie Bidwell wanted people to drive  in the park, I mean, they were driving horses and buggies, right?  The other point is on the concern, valid concern  about handicapped accessibility, part of the headway plan,  the  park was built in the 1880s.  So the idea that the park was built in the 1880s  deals with more ADA compliant accessibility of the park  and also increased entry points along the sides of the park  so that those picnic tables would be accessible.  So I mean, there's never more than 75 or 100 yards  between either Fallon Brozia or A Street or Woodland  and those picnic tables.  So if you had access from the sides,  you could easily walk in and drag your cooler.  All the coolers have wheels now.  So I get the concerns that people have.  Most of those are dealt with in the headway recommendations,  which I think we should adopt them.  Thank you.  All right.  Mr. Brown.  So we, as often happens, we have a lot of people  ve got at least the  responses I received about this.  Half the people want to close.  Half the people are concerned  about mobility.  And they want the park road to  stay open.  And I sympathize with those  people with mobility problems.  I'  m going to be there  probably shortly.  So the thought of closing the park, the Peterson Memorial, on  winter.  For me.  For me. ! The ! The ! The !  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me.  For me. The !  !  ! The ! The The !  ! The !  I want to listen to my colleagues and hear what everybody has to say,  and then we will be making a decision.  And I want to thank Tom for bringing this forward.  Mr. Martin.  I kind of expected Tom to make a motion, but he didn't.  So I will say this after hearing public comment,  and I talked to Tom about this before.  I'm not opposed to closing the park on some days.  This has come up in some manner or form every four years that I've been up here.  I think that we have to understand that we're not going to get it perfect the first time,  so it should be some amount of time, six months, eight months, whatever.  Well, at least six months, so I don't have to listen to it again.  But it comes back, and we see, is this working?  I don't know that both weekend days is smart.  It might have been Mr. Wall.  It might have been somebody else that maybe said Sunday, Monday.  I think we need some flexibility,  and I think the community needs to be able to do that.  I think the community needs to understand that anything we do is temporary.  I want to see how it works, and the idea is to make it better for everybody.  But this is not going to be a permanent thing.  We're not rewriting the Ten Commandments when it comes to the park.  And knowing that and see how it works, and if it can be made better, we make it better.  And compromise is what politics is supposed to be about.  I'm not going to make the motion because it wasn't my idea,  but I think a motion that I would support would include those issues.  Are you ready for me to make a motion, Mr. Mayor?  No.  Okay, I didn't think so.  I have something to say, too.  Do you want me to go ahead of you, Mr. Mayor?  Yeah, the first time I heard about this in this recent iteration, at least,  was in the Mayor's State of the City address recently.  So I feel like you should say something first,  and I'll fill in if you don't say anything that I already thought of.  Well, it was mentioned there, and I thank Mr. Van Overbeek for bringing it forward.  It was actually an idea that was originally brought up by Tom Nickel,  who was on city council and as a parks commissioner.  So it was his idea.  He passed that along to me before he passed away.  I actually, my thought on it, and Mr. Van Overbeek really, you know,  had the gumption to take it and run with it, and I think it was smart.  But what I've said to most people is, if in fact you go there on a Saturday and Sunday  and you're with your kid and you're walking around it, you'd support closing it, without a doubt.  It's only a matter of time before someone's hit.  I'm surprised.  It doesn't happen every weekend.  To me, it's ridiculous that it was ever open.  This town has, something I mentioned, the state of the city is, you know, 25 years ago, this town had 59,000 people.  We have 107,000 now.  50 years ago, this town had 19,000 people.  So, you know, if you look at it, it's inevitable that this road has to be closed at some point  because we have so many people in the park.  So, I think it's just a matter of time before it becomes something where something tragic happens.  I'd like to avoid that.  So, I'll support any motion that entails closing it for a portion or thereof.  All right.  Are you ready for a motion now, Mr. Mayor?  Let me just, there's some comments out there.  Just, I mean, Mr. Bright, I agree with the sentiments of that there's a lot of value to having a park without cars driving through it.  And, yes.  If there was not a road there right now, it would be a ridiculous suggestion to say that we would put one there.  There are roads on both sides.  They could definitely use improvement.  And I think it's great that we're going to have it.  One thing that strikes me is that people feel like they need a car to experience Bidwell Park.  And I think that's terribly sad because it's not the same experience driving through a park as it is being able to walk around and experience trails and such.  And we have some limits to accessibility.  And I think that we're approaching with these reconstructions and this Measure H funds that we have,  the opportunity to...  really exceed what has been possible before.  So it is nobody's experience that the only way for you to access Bidwell Park is to have like a whole vehicle to get through there with.  I will say that San Francisco recently went through a very similar thing with Golden Gate Park.  And you can look at online at what they did to try to meet these accessibility concerns.  Because they had a lot of the same people saying similar things.  And expanding paratransit service within there is one of those.  To make sure that people can get access to it.  The paratransit is allowed on the road that they closed.  And then, you know, if you're driving through a park, you're going to have to go through a lot of different things.  For example, if you're driving on a small road. ! The ! The ! The ! The ! The ! The ! The !  ! The The  whether you don't notably a lot of disabilities and especially age-related ones mean that you  can't drive a car anymore and people we still want people to be able to get around we want people to  be able to have fun and be relaxed with kids and kids still learn how to ride bikes and stuff like  that and i think that we should should include i would recommend whatever motion comes out that we  we look at going above and beyond ada compliance to make sure that everybody can access and enjoy  bidwell park without entering with a car i'm just going to put a couple things on the record i do  in some respects absolutely support closing bidwell park and making it accessible i'm probably  going to be a no on this because of the way that it's happening the way we're going about it we  started back in september of 22 with headway transportation going you know giving a report  and bringing it back to the bidwell parks and playground commission and then nothing ever came  back to us so we're in my mind we're putting the cart in front of the horse by closing something  because we never even discussed  you know the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the  the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the  the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the  the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the  the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the  the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the  the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the  people that don't have accessibility to cars, but we want them to take paratransit,  but they've got to pay $7.50 a ride to go take it.  I don't know.  I think we're just going about it in the wrong way.  Although I do absolutely support closing the road,  I've driven the road every day to go to elementary school, junior high, high school, and to work.  So it's not a matter of that.  I'm just not happy, excited about the process in which we're doing it.  So to your comments, until we decide how to handle cars,  we really can't do the rest of it because accessibility,  it's all impacted by what we do with how we handle cars.  So I'm going to make a motion,  and my motion is that, and I'm going to change the order of it in deference to you,  is that we ask the staff to...  to come back to us with recommendations,  how they want to deal with the recommendations from the headway transportation survey  that was done in 23...  done in 22, but the report was in 23.  And secondly, in the context of closing Peterson and South Park  drive-and-motorized vehicles on national holidays, Saturdays and Sundays.  Did you get that?  Debbie?  Go ahead.  I'll second.  What was the last part of the end of the...  Saturdays and Sundays.  National holidays, Saturdays and Sundays.  Saturday and Sunday.  Before the report, before the staff comes back?  No, this is all part of one...  It's all one thing.  It's how do we revitalize the park.  So I think we have this set of recommendations from the consultant,  which are...  I think they're good, but the top-level issue is how do we deal with cars?  What do we do with cars?  And that drives everything else.  So this would give staff direction in the context of closing the park  on the weekends to motorize vehicles on holidays  to then come back with what we do with the headway report.  The mayor's comment...  He said that it's a matter of time before something happens  because the traffic on the weekends is exactly right.  I'm sorry, Tom.  So my clarification question is,  are you saying close on Saturday and Sunday  regardless of what comes back from staff or wait for staff?  No, I think it's a decision we have to make.  And then we...  And then...  My question is, what did your motion say?  The motion says that...  And the order was that the staff,  combined...  So the staff can come back to us with how they want to implement the headway report.  And secondly, in the context of closing the Peterson-Mortal Drive  and South Park Drive to vehicular traffic on national holidays and weekends.  Can I ask to make a friendly amendment?  Sure.  Would you let staff consider different days?  Yeah, the problem...  So the reason for the weekends is that's when the traffic is.  So the problem...  What we're trying to avoid...  We're trying to avoid is conflicts between cars and bikes and people.  So I don't like to disagree with my friend, Mr. Wall.  But it's not as big a problem on Mondays or Fridays.  It's the weekends.  And when it's really heavily traffic.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  I have a motion and a second.  Okay.  I have another friendly amendment.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Meaning that we...  Revisit in six months.  Sure.  I can support it.  Thank you.  Okay.  That means you have to come.  Council Member Bennett.  I will support it because it has a time frame.  Otherwise...  I would not support it.  So I'm going to say yes.  Okay.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  No.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  It carries 5-1 with one absence.  All right.  With that, we're going to take short break.  Thank you. ! The ! The ! The ! The ! The !  For council members.  For council members.  For council members.  For council members.  For council members.  For council members.  For council members.  For council members.  For council members.  For council members.  For council members.  We'll note your tardy detentions after council.  Item 5.2 consideration of my request.  I'll make this short and sweet.  The attachment denotes.  If you look at the attachment it shows maps of the areas.  I'  m going to kick this in a second to our city manager  because he knows better than I do about these particular areas  and their easements and things along those lines.  Chico state president, new president approached me  and we had some conversation about this.  They'd love to take over these areas, beautify them,  change them, take down the fence in between the university  and the city.  bike path and make it a more  welcoming part of the campus.  Actually have more patrols in the  area as well.  These are areas that have  plagued us obviously not the  highway 32 pedestrian crossing  because it'  s fairly new.  It'  s just dirt on the  sides that could use some  beautification and the university  certainly willing to do it and it  would be a nice entrance for them  over there on highway 32.  That'  s the extent of it.  Mr. City manager anything to add?  to add to what you just started  with we did have some discussions with chico state  about a year and a half ago.  At that point in time they'  re interested in  taking over the security cameras on the bike path.  We freely said yes, have at it.  I think we said the same about the bike path but they weren'  t quite ready yet.  They were undergoing a change of leadership so this is great to  hear.  I think we have a lot of work to do.  I think we have a lot of work to do.  We think the section that  parallels the railroad tracks  would be as things go with union  pacific relatively easy.  It'  s an easement.  It'  s not our property.  We think we could have chico  state institute an easement and  then we relinquish ours.  I think that would be fairly easy  and painless.  Then the section that goes from  the railroad tracks to nord is  actually a piece of city right  away.  That could be easily handled by  a grant of license where we just  license the entire area to chico  state to operate and maintain and  provide security.  Any questions?  I think this is great.  I appreciate you bringing this  up.  I look forward to this happening.  My own thought is because of the  security camera thing and them  managing the security cameras  which as I understand currently  you would have to climb up there  to take out an SD card.  They need to be replaced.  Yes.  We have some good technology  going in.  I wonder if in doing this in the  way that we do it that we might  be able to even if we don'  t grant them more bike path that  we would be able to expand the  security cameras to more of the  areas that are frequently dark  but heavily trafficked by  students and other folks in that  area.  To do it right and that was one  of their stumbling blocks with  our department is they really  need to be able to do it.  have that we need to run  broadband most likely fiber down  that distance.  So this is some  infrastructural needs for that?  I would just wonder if we can  consider if that could be  expanded some other areas in  vicinity.  Maybe that wouldn'  t be under their control  given their budgetary  constraints which seems to be  not as rough as ours for this  kind of thing anyway.  All right.  Madam  clerk?  How many  speakers?  Two.  All  right.  Three  minutes.  Thank  Curtis Anderson, followed by Kirk Mumford.  Hi, Curtis Anderson.  I didn't know what this was specifically about,  so I just wanted to get my name in there.  I use this bike path twice a week  to get from Riverbend to Azad's Martial Arts Studio,  and this is by far the most efficient,  best, fastest way to get through Chico.  So I'm happy to hear that it would be like  you're looking at improving it through Chico State.  I guess I would just recommend  that there be some provision.  If at some point they don't want the path  or something like that,  that it reverts back to the city easement.  And then also my concern would be just like,  is the city still going to maintain?  I'm assuming that you're talking about  from West Sacramento to the campus.  And so what's going to happen is that  bike paths are going to be maintained north of there  because they basically come in north of 8th Street.  So I use that whole corridor,  and I just like it to be,  I understand there's a lot of struggles  with the homeless and cutting fence and all that stuff,  but it is by far the most efficient,  one of the most efficient bike paths we have in Chico,  and I love it.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Kirk Mumford?  I think you're right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Then that is it.  All right.  So I'll just start with answering his questions.  No, it's not going to be anything north of home affected.  All right.  Discussion?  I think it's a great idea.  I think we should move to,  oh, sorry.  Make a motion unless.  No, I think it's a great idea to move to direct staff.  It's your item.  Sorry, but direct staff to work with CSU to  make a motion.  We need to get this done.  I'll second.  All right.  Further discussion?  Of course, ensuring it comes back to us.  All right.  Madam Clerk?  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Mayor Winslow?  Carry 6-0 with one absence.  thank you.  thank you.  item 5.3 resolution to adopt  the fiscal year 2024-25 proposed  annual budget discussion  continue from the marathon may  21st meeting and we toss this  over to city manager.  thank you as you pointed  out this is a continuation so I  don'  t really have a lot to  add other than what'  s on the staff  report council expressed an  interest to further discuss the  five items you see listed on  your staff report and gauge your  interest in funding them in some  manner by some means.  can you bring us more money?  we did receive an extra  2.08 million in fire victim  trust funds last tuesday.  thank you.  last tuesday.  last tuesday.  last tuesday.  last tuesday.  last tuesday.  that is one option those were  not allocated in the prior budget  or this budget because we weren'  t certain as to the amount or  the time we would receive those  funds.  I should ask more options?  all right.  I think if council is okay with  we'  ll take these items one by one  individual motions and then see  where that gets us.  so with that being said we need  to discuss each of them first.  so any particular one anyone  wants to take first?  ms bennett go ahead.  so I want to give a little bit  of history on this is in regards  to funding of mr.  gusselstetten.  I was speaking to him.  he was a member of the  with extra money to reduce the  fire fuel in window channel  which I think is a very  important process we should go  through and specifically target  those areas close to the  residences which is the most  sensitive.  back in 22 fema provided a grant  of $188,000 with matching funds  of $63,000 for a total of 251.  of that amount I know there was  some fuel fire fuel reduction  performed earlier this year and  there is approximately $80,000  left which is going to go towards  goat grazing this year and goat  grazing twice next year.  so I'  m proposing and I am  requesting support of the council  members to take of the $2,084,257  from the fire victims trust fund  to the fire victims trust fund  which is now in the hands of the  city to allocate $300,000 to the  fire fuel reduction program in  window channel specifically from  highway 99 up to manzanita that  section.  this is a one time request a  one time use of the funds there  will nothing be ongoing which I  know was a sensitive matter for  you.  and the  the !  this is just taking $300,000  out of that amount dedicated to  reducing the fire fuel in window  channel closest to closest to  residences as possible and if it  happens this year I would like to  see it happen as soon as possible  if it happens this year that'  s great if Mr.  guts wants to carry over some of  the funds for next year or the year  after I will leave that up to him so  that is my request.  all right what do you think we should do in terms of public  comment?  because we discussed  individually  you do have one speaker  I would recommend taking that  why don't we take the speaker?  okay Sam barber  three minutes  I am  growing increasingly concerned at this  council's inability to properly  question our police department  particularly when it comes to  fire fuel and the  funding staffing and an excessive amount  of military equipment  the police department has over 140  full time employees with an additional 100  volunteers and accounts for nearly half  our budget there has been a proposal  for three new police officers our mayor  would apparently like to hire more than that  with the chief of police saying he would take  up to 35 are we a city of  trees or a city of police I recently  talked to some public workers and was  made aware that they made a  or had a measly three workers to maintenance  over 40,000 trees in our city  not only this but one worker not one  worker I spoke to and enough to be a  homeowner meanwhile you have given the  police a raise some months ago without them having to even  ask and also gave them a $40,000  sign-on bonus to laterals  coming from other departments the  median income in Chico is 60,000  40,000 is two-thirds of that just for a  sign-on bonus the most distressing  part to me is when the police chief asked for  the sign-on bonus one of you indicated  it wasn't your responsibility to question  their requests and only one of you actually  asked any questions when asked the  police chief could not say if the sign-on  bonus would actually help or not but you  gave them the money anyway one of you  joked as if they shouldn't have that kind  of information when you're asking them  for money if only our council is as easy  going with money when it came to  affordable housing taking care of our  infrastructure paying our public workers  living wages and funding meaningful  solutions to our homeless problem this  police department is responsible for the  murder of Desmond Phillips a 25 year old  in the middle of a mental health crisis  this incident should be a clear indication  that the police are trained and not to  be trusted with lethal lethal weapons of  any sort they shot Desmond a total of  10 times firing 16 bullets total  we're not talking about the budget now  yeah just stick to the budget sorry  okay I would then move on to the area  where they have to file their annual  military equipment use report here are  some of the things I found munitions  capable of liquefying human flesh  sixteen types of flying drones ranging  from 300 to 14.7 thousand units what's  this have to do with a budget yeah again  we are we discussing no but we do  discuss that in issue individually so  and at this point we're discussing  funding and your opening was fine with  that and we'll give you a little extra  time to finish up but try to stick to  the funding aspects okay yeah I mean I'll  just leave it there I thought I was  gonna talk to you about the budget  section because I was meeting to talk  during the public area to begin with so  I'm kind of frustrated and now I'm  being cut off because I got shifted to  the budget section when I was meaning to  talk during the public hearing section  did we move his card no his card  indicated that he wanted to talk about  the budget the police budget but you  didn't put down you didn't put public  comment on that item so I took it and  put it under budget because that's all  you put on your card  section 3 didn't know just so we know  which topic you want to talk about right  so this discussion would be better  under that comment I mean the beginning  part was certainly fine for this  whatever thanks all right okay so we'll  go one by one already heard from what  mr. Bennett about the first I mean is  it probably to have a little like  questions on on that yeah absolutely  absolutely  I think you mentioned one I was almost  had burning question and I realize how  bad of a pun that was he mentioned he  mentioned pulling I think he said  300,000 it says 200,000 in the staff  report and the fire victims trust does  that violate the budget policy that we  set for that fund I don't believe so I  think the primary target was  infrastructure but I think moreover it  was one-time expense items as opposed to  reoccurring so even though it's like  I mean there is ongoing expenses in  maintaining the channel in general but  we can look at this as a one-time  expense other question is made for the  fire chief I pulled up this community  wildfire protection plan and I see I  totally agree that linda channel has  huge needs there and I think it's a  really appropriate use of funds but  there's also all these other areas in  town and I just wanted to like run by  like are we are we going to put the  funds in the in the place that they're  most needed in terms of fire danger  because there's a lot of red areas on  this map and like in addition to Linda  channel Linda channel is a high priority  for us because the vegetation in there  and then the the joint joining  properties up there are at risk so I'm  absolutely in favor of taking care of  Linda channel I know that I'm just  thinking like little Chico Creek also is  one that sticks out to me is having like  huge needs there's a lot of properties  that I think are even closer they didn't  have the same setbacks at the time those  were built  and I wonder if it would make sense to  spread it out or does it make sense to  concentrate our efforts in one area the  the actual process for dictating who  where we spend it falls under parks but  they they often come to us and talk  about the necessity so I wouldn't  prioritize one over the other so maybe  this is a customer Bennett like a  question like knowing that the Linda  channel is a high priority for us does  it make more sense to just allocate the  money for wildfire prevention in  general care and then allow them to  choose what are the highest priority  areas within the parks division  okay all right  I just actually had a question for  staff is this not being done because we  don't have the $2,000 is the hundred and  eighty whatever already been spent and  you're in need of more to do more  mitigation I guess let me clarify I did  have a conversation with Steve excuse me  chief Standridge and asked him  specifically how concerned he was about  Linda channel and he's just confirmed  that he is very concerned so using the  money there makes sense according to him  and mr. Gustafson also is concerned  so that's why I place it as a priority  oh no and I completely agree I was just  making sure that we did use all the  other funds and that you were needing  this to move forward that the years left  what is left is already committed to the  grazing program so that's why it would  be zero once that's all I want to make  sure is that we were okay the other  reason it's a priority is that there are  a growing number of homeless people camp  there who start fires not only are we  going to be able to get them out of the  fire as opposed to Little Chico Creek so  I absolutely  I'm actually super concerned about  roses and ivy who has several people who  can't even be mobile and there was a two  or three fires behind their retirement  home here and that's just a very scary  thought of having to evacuate that so I  definitely see the priority I definitely  got it I just wanted to make sure we  read thank you that's all I have to burn  their fence almost pretty serious mr.  Gobson we had a little bit of  conversation about kind of the master  plan for Lindo Channel and what the  future holds and I know you're getting  some you know basically what Chico  State's done with the creek you know  it's been pretty substantial in terms of  turning it into a really beautiful area  that that people can utilize and you  mentioned that we're getting some kind  of we're getting approval so that we  can actually look at that with Linda  Channel is that correct approvals to  further this what I mean didn't him yeah  so to move forward maybe you know put in  walking paths permanent like walking  paths things along those lines you know  I think that's always on the table and  we don't have any specific plans at the  moment to do that but I think in  respect to this I mean yeah I mean we're  always open to adding new features and  improving areas especially in the no  channel due to the you know Jason  residential houses and businesses this  particular scenario is you know we're  fortunate to receive that FEMA grant  with some local match we did quite a bit  of work on that area I think it really  uncovered that there's more work to do  to councilmember Bennett's item and I  think you know any additional funding  will help you know continue those  efforts and additional grazing efforts  and vegetation removal efforts and  deadwood removal efforts and we had some  parameters on this due to the grant  where we could only go within 100 feet  of residential homes and then we had a  planning to stay within 50 feet of the  channel itself so with additional  funding we might be able to do a little  bit more outside of the grant parameters  to continue to reduce the fire danger  and then I think to your point mayor  Coolidge to also look at you know the  west side of the channel and start to  scope projects you know west of 99  they've also improved those areas yeah  okay no that's my interest I know we  talked at one point that there's a  long-term plan for it but perhaps there  was additional funding needed to scope  that out is that what  yeah there could be yeah I don't think  that's what we're discussing now but  there always could be for long-term you  know master plan of little channel okay  just for the future future Mr. Mayor yes  you do you want me to make a motion or  do you want to yeah I think that's the  best way to do this if we go one by one  and then we make individual motions and  move through each of them and so  everybody good with that okay then my  motion is to allocate out of the !  fire victims trust fund $300,000 which  will specifically go to the reduction of  fire fuels in the no channel from 99 up  to Manzanita  second  all right  councilmember Bennett yes councilmember  Morgan councilmember van overbeck yes  councilmember Winslow I'm  concerned about the budgetary  allocations for district specific  activities and we're going to lose  sight of the whole of what it is for  Chico also this is originally $200,000  and so I'm gonna vote no okay  vice mayor Reynolds yes mayor Coolidge  carries 5-1 with one absence all right  pull back up our next one so additional  for funding for paving state structures  and greenery and other areas of the  greenery and greenery at Genesis shelter  site as well as portable building for  dining is there anyone wishing to speak  to this topic particularly  as before by me and  the ladder the portable building for  dining was something that was  specifically mentioned by a by the  management of the the pallet shelter is  Genesis as a need the others are things  that I thought are worthwhile  investments that would both improve the  quality of life out there shade  obviously has a big part of  psychological betterment and then  because of the gravel alley and seeing  there's some ongoing maintenance I  thought that maybe paving that would  would be better  part of this is like looking at  providing some kind of a good faith  permanent investment in this place so  that we can like see it having a future  and also so we can try to improve the  quality of transition out of it into  housing which really we're not seeing  very well given that I've had some  conversations with the  public works director about some of  these items and I think I should punt to  him to address the three of them quickly  would you  sure I think you know the shade  component we've already allocated we  recycled our the old trash cans from  downtown and some of the old planters  there they've already been delivered and  we're working on a project with urban  forest manager to to plant some trees  and those things will be a lot more  conducive to the landscape there if you  will because the tremendous amount of  road base and gravel that was laid down  is lime treated so really not conducive  to to planting tree material there so  that's in process now we're you know  we're finalizing our phase three  projects of our sustainable solutions  turnkey program which are pretty you  know large-scale energy conservation  projects the genesis site continues to  kind of be a thorn as far as consumption  we're we have pretty significant  utility bills and a lot of consumption  there both in the winter and in summer  months so we're looking at ways to maybe  offset that once with some you know  we're looking into feasibility of  adding some PV there's some solar there  and within those projects I think we  could probably include a modular  building portable building to  accommodate the needs that the site  management has kind of requested so  that's in process now and we're also  working on that had some pretty  extensive conversations with council  member Winslow on the paving and you  know we paved the driveway last summer  then it was the only section that was  not lime treated and we had significant  wear issues from dirt and a lot of  kind of get a daily trash truck service  that services the dumpsters and the  toters there on a daily basis and so we  paved it with some success in the  original intent was to continue that  paving from the end of the driveway to  the admin building just to kind of cut  down on the dust and all the you know  the vehicle impacts really starting to  kind of reluctant to do that now to move  forward with that the looking at the  cost of benefit analysis it's pretty  costly and you know kind of making sure  reasonable and I'm not measuring the  benefit it's not sure if it's a good  use of paving dollars plus the site  itself was engineered to specifically  sheet flow from a storm drain  perspective and it works my colleague on  the engineering side did an excellent  job designing it and it works perfectly  we've had some very significant storms  there and there has knock on wood has  been no flooding issues into any of  those units so I'm I'm pretty reluctant  to disturb that in any way shape or form  so we've had some pretty good discussions  on I think we kind of continue to  monitor that scenario and if we have  specific where points in the in the  gravel base or the aggregate base now  then we'll you know react quickly to  repair them and maintain the site so the  the funding has already been taken care  of for the tree planting in the old the  tree planting yes we're able to do that  with internal opera existing operating  budgets there is not funding identified  for the modular portable buildings yet  but we're still working on scoping and  designing that project to include you  know potentially some solar to offset  the monthly consumption and then we can  include a modular building in that  project as well but we would have to  come back to council to ask for approval  and then ask for those dollars either a  supplemental or a future budget session  so mr. Winslow what's your thoughts and  so yeah what I had kind of landed to  with that is that it seems like with the  sustainable turnkey solutions project  there's opportunity to actually get a  lot of money out of it and I think  long-run save money by investing out  there and that's some government money  that can come through but there's some  uncertainty about like what that will  cover and so having a kind of a modest  dead aside for that modular to make sure  that it can be there and it's not going  to be put on hold based on how this  government program unrolls so it seems  like it's the kind of thing to put some  money aside likely it wouldn't even be  needed but that would make sure that we  do have that out there sooner rather  than later which you gave me some kind  of numbers based on looking at all  modulars yeah we looked at some modular  buildings there's some used ones out  there new ones out there and both  averaged between 50 and 60 thousand per  unit that are roughly 20 by 50 would  like to double two of them up so we get  you know approximately either you know  40 by 80 or a 50 by 100 size facility so  that you know mash two of them together  so that's approximately a hundred  thousand maybe to you know prep the site  to land both of those buildings we want  to consider maybe another 50,000 so at a  minimum 150 thousand and then we're going to  have to  maybe 250 maybe 200,000 would be a good  amount to or an adequate amount to  pursue that ever all right yeah also  when it was brought up to me the idea  from the Jesus Center it was perhaps  like CUSD will have a spare one that  they'll donate so it's really more like  the site preparation stuff so I think  what we're gonna need to have some  funding for in order to operationalize  that so yeah my motion would be to set  aside $200,000 for for that  if needed all right  all right is that a motion that was a  motion okay the motion is set aside can  you repeat it set aside $200,000 for  those portable units and the site  preparation transportation and all but  you know using it if needed if this is  a little turnkey solution it doesn't  provide us with some of the funds to  offset that so where are we getting the  money from general fund we'll come out of the general fund  not the fire victims trust  it's a  $2 million in the fire trust that's not what he just said  he said coming out of the general fund so you want to take the  fire victims fund and give it to the  palace shelter that's not what I said  that's that's what I'm seeking  clarification on you want to take money  from the budget that was balanced you  want X amount to go to somewhere else I  want to know where you want to give them  these are these are potential costs and  I think I think coming out of the  reserve is appropriate  what  what's your question  where you want to take the money from  we set aside some for reserve I mean I  mean  you still want to take it from the reserve that's what I'm saying  thank you I mean a city manager if you  have any any other recommendation of a  better place to pull the money from  I'm just not sure what you're meaning  when you say reserve  but we set aside  set aside some money for reserve a  proportion of the budget  ah  now I understand  so we would drop below the level  called for in the budget policies at  that point  so what would there be more appropriate  place to pull it from or is the fire  victims trust that's the only place we  feel like we have  leeway funds at this point in time yeah  well general funds are all fungible and  moving around so the fire victims trust  is good as anything I suppose  assuming that the budget policy doesn't  have to be  that's true  that is absolutely true yeah yeah  it's a valid point  all right  yes we have discussed things though  individually into everybody's entire  their opinion  okay all right so we have a motion for  200,000  is there a second  there's not  okay  so it dies for a lack of a second  so I'll make the motion for 100,000  okay  no second  okay  nothing close  okay just a moment so that was  for the same purpose as stated before  that a hundred thousand out of  fire victims  okay  council member bennett yes council  member morgan council member van overbeck  council member winslow yes vice mayor  reynolds mayor coolidge yes so it dies  it dies for a tied vote okay all right  for the motions on that item all right  seeing none we'll move on to  additional funding for the airport  revenue guarantee we also at that point  talked about  the possible costs for tsa building or  changes necessary  i believe  i don't know if anyone else wants to  speak to this i can certainly speak to  it my thoughts  no anyone all right i don't want to step  on anyone's toes so  but i am an airport  junkie i guess our revenue guarantee  we're getting there right we're really  close  we're close to the amount i think we're  we've got some airlines certainly  looking at chico i think this is huge  not only for our university for our  business for local ag for everything  else but we have you know paradise  giving us  $75,000 towards this we have not been  put any money towards the airport  revenue guarantee fund in the last  couple of years  i think it's necessary and would help  chico immensely so i would put forward  a motion that we  and amounts i'm certainly flexible on  but i think we need what three hundred  thousand dollars for tsa building is  that correct i think that about 350 i  think yeah  so are we safe to say 300 okay and then  i'd like to see us allocate 250 this  year and 250 next year  future with budget  to the airport revenue guarantee fund  i have a question  if it's the same question you asked  evidence from  the fire trust no i'm not going to ask  that question if it's from the fire  trust why do you want 250 now i have two  questions and 250 next year  and my i'm not finished my other  question is  so you're separating the airport  revenue guarantee which is on here but  you also want to upgrade the terminal  actually did discuss that the last  you're asking for more money for it  so you're asking for three hundred  thousand dollars for the terminal 250  000 for the revenue guarantee this year  and 250 000 correct revenue for  guarantee next year correct so you're  budgeting into next year  we budget into the future years all the  time okay  so i mean rotating expenses so and part  of the reason why future years too is  the likelihood that we're using any of  this money this year it's very unlikely  we would have to have flights by june  25 so so i recall that one of our won't  touch this  distinguished council members said once  that we'll get airline service once an  airline determines  that they will generate more than  they will generate more revenue than it  costs them to come here  and i think that's one of those sort of  simple and profound statements and  throwing throwing money at  first of all we have a budget  and i and i applaud the city staff for  how they constructed the budget it's  appropriately conservative  uh and i think it's just a bad idea i  mean they're going to come here  if they can make money and they won't  if they don't and if we do  some subsidy on the front end as soon as  they don't make money they'll be gone  so i oppose it strongly  further comes  do i dare ask the question mr  guftison is where are we on  here is this holding us up from getting  error  do we have any updates you know i think  we've made a lot of headway in the  last couple of years on our revenue  guarantee fund our goal was 1.5 and  we're sitting at 1.2 committed we're in  discussions with some some big  stakeholders to hopefully get us to 1.5  and to hit that goal so we're there i  had a good discussion with a prospective  airlines a couple of weeks ago on site  and they were very pleased with the  progress we made and and chico's  definitely you know on their map and and  you know 2025 2026 is you know a lot of  things that we're going to be doing  we'll hopefully be fruitful for us it's  it's hard to tell it's a long game  so you know we're close and i think if  we were to get towards 2 million we'd  be highly competitive our our neighbors  to the north of us reading are trying  to extend service east and their goal is  a 2 million dollar revenue guarantee  fund so you know for 1.5 to 2 million  we're competitive and things are looking  good but it is indeed the long game  so even if you get to the 1.5 or the 2  million without council funding you  would still need the funds to upgrade  the terminal and the flight to come in  yeah it'd be you know we we are  constrained at the at the terminal as  far as size we've had you know handful  of meetings with the prospective  airlines and and and some of them are  very cavalier and fantastic we've asked  them about a terminal and i said look  you know throw to cape coat of paint on  it we'll be fine and i appreciate that  that perspective and and that's what we're  going to be doing so we're going to be  doing that in that that stance the the  problem is this tsa you know soon as an  airline wants to come to chica we have  to initiate tsa services and it takes  about six months for them to mobilize  and get here so we need to accommodate  their space needed equipment needed and  so to do that quickly in the lowest cost  possible we're looking at modular units  on the north side of the existing  terminal to accommodate tsa so you know  we haven't budgeted for that yet it  would be great to have that in in a  reserve or identified at least to you  know once we get the green light we're  able to initiate that action and get  some modular units there to accommodate  tsa it will be something we'll need to  do and need to start planning for and  be great to have that available yeah i  would just remind council that money  doesn't get spent unless we get an  airline so i mean we don't have any  costs out unless we bring an airline in  which would be a huge economic benefit  for our community so we have of course  towards the 3,000 students from l.a.  so you know i mean obviously we're not  going to be bleeding out money  necessarily and certainly not 2  million dollars by the end of fiscal  year 2025 since we're not probably  going to fly in 2025 at least until the  middle of it hopefully.  I guess my concern is that other towns  around us are putting money into our  revenue guarantee fund and we have not  lately and i think it'  s just sad that paradise is throwing  flyers into our revenue guarantee fund  and we haven'  t as of late identified any  additional funding for it so that'  s why i think it'  s necessary i think this  community wants it i think we have the  flyers in our catchment area but you do  not play with airlines unless you have  one of these funds quite simply they  don'  t come to communities  economically ready or whatever that  saying may be they come to communities  with revenue guarantee funds now and  they come ready to fly but when they do  they have to have these guarantees and  guarantees so that'  s the way the game is  played.  in light of that i will make a change  to my motion to do 300,000 and 250 only  in this budget year so 250 for the  revenue guarantee fund 300,000 for the  tsa set asides not spent unless  obviously they'  re needed.  I think it'  s critically important to do whatever  we can to try to attract an airline to  chico.  We have the population i think we  would definitely have the use so i  would support i would second your  motion to set aside money it'  s not going to be spent until it'  s necessary which i think is a very  important factor.  I will support your motion.  I second.  I understand.  I am just amazed that the name change didn'  t do it.  Madam clerk.  okay.  So we have a motion and a second for  additional funding for the airport  revenue guarantee fund and possible  costs for the tsa building of 300,000  and then 250,000 this year for the  guarantee the revenue guarantee.  councilmember bennett.  yes.  councilmember morgan.  no.  councilmember van overbeck.  no.  councilmember winslow.  no.  vice mayor reynolds.  yes.  mayor coolidge.  aye.  it carries three oh i'm so sorry.  no.  it does not carry.  i put it in the wrong column.  so it fails.  tied vote.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  else but I'm not sure we're going to get anywhere.  This is your last show. Yeah.  Okay, let's do  $250 for the revenue guarantee. A second.  When you're ready. Okay.  We have a question. $250, that's it.  $250 set aside for the revenue guarantee if they come.  We're not talking about the TSA building or anything else. Not right now, no.  You're saying $250 if an airline comes in. Well, none of  the money gets spent. We already have a hundred.  I mean the community doesn't pay anything of their share of that if the airline never  comes and doesn't fall below revenue levels.  Yeah.  Okay. Council Member Bennett.  Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek.  No. Council Member Winslow. No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes.  Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 4-2 with one absence.  Okay, next is, and I don't even  I have to look at what this was, but additional funding using  Measure H surplus. And I  believe this was our discussion.  Was it not?  On how long?  Anyone? We were all there.  We had it.  Yeah.  Let me check my notes. Yeah, I believe you did.  Yeah, you wanted to use Measure H funding to give more money to the park.  You wanted to talk about parks. Oh, it might have been because we had  previous direction from the council to incorporate park  and housing funding from Measure H, but we didn't actually get any proposal  to do it. And I think the idea here that I had was  because we would have direction from us to have  to see this in a future meeting, that we would actually have a proposal  here. So I think not seeing any proposal, it's like, well, I don't know what to do. I feel like  that's staff's job to come up with proposals  for this. And there was direction to talk about park and housing funding.  So not having it here, I don't really know what to do. I could just pull out something, but  that doesn't really feel appropriate. Well, I think more importantly, there really isn't a Measure H  surplus. The fund balance is currently estimated  to be under a million at the end of this next fiscal  year, which is within the margin of error. So I wouldn't  say that there is a surplus.  Right. So I guess it was just the council direction  that we had to make sure that we were doing it.  And I think it was important to note, obviously, that some Measure H funding would be used  to support parks and housing. Because as we had alluded to in last year's  several discussions we had on it, it went out in mailers there.  Yeah, the mayor's face was on them. And we thought that this was like a promise to the community.  Part of the reason people voted for it is thinking that we would kind of diversify our funding strategies  there. And we're not seeing that. Well, actually, parks was  quite a beneficiary in this budget cycle to the tune of an entire  third tree crew and all of the equipment.  Additional maintenance workers. So parks definitely was a beneficiary  in this budget cycle. Yeah. And as to a note,  what the mayor did is he said very specifically when he agendized this  that this was for parks, public safety, and  roads. So, and in that mailer you referred to, I  never said housing. Right, right, right. Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. Now I know that the group that put across this, because I have  No, we can have a discussion about it.  This is fair. Come on. You guys are discussing politics.  That's not politics.  It's, it's, it's.  They did, in fact, mention housing quite substantially.  But it is general fund money. So it is certainly willing to, we are able to  talk about it in that respect. Well, if there was any money left over, but it looks like  there's not. And I guess we'd have to pull it, wrest it off of something that's already committed to.  So I feel like we're kind of past the  point there.  Probably, probably a discussion for  future budget.  Yeah, there's always supplementary allocations, right? Six months from now, maybe?  So since this appears to be a non-issue,  why don't we move to the next item?  Yeah.  You guys all seem in a hurry.  All right. Additional police officer  personnel.  Estimated annual  cost of $150,000  or $190,000.  And we have a  $5,000 The ! The ! !  budget in terms of we did a presentation that showed you where the number should be.  The city manager understands that number, but at the end of the day, the city manager has a  budget to work within, and I think that his recommendation was a responsible recommendation  for growth, and I support that. So at this point, I would say that's what I support,  is what is a responsible decision for the budget.  And something I would add to that, one of the critical limiting factors we have at PD is  facilities. We're at a point of ridiculousness in terms of that facility and its ability to  support the current mission, and we're looking at some both short-term and long-term solutions to  that, and even those, I don't think we're going to be able to do that. I think we're going to have  to do that. But we're also looking at the cost of the facilities, and we don't know where we're  going to get the money to fund them. So it makes me even more reluctant to add to reoccurring cost  when we have a very huge facilities need that needs to get addressed fairly soon.  We do have $1.4 million left that we could talk about.  Yeah, that won't get us very far.  No, no. Get your plans done, though.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe.  Actually, in one of the short-term solutions, it would do more than that, but yeah.  Would that be an allocation you'd recommend?  Not yet.  Okay.  I think we need to have a better formulated plan.  Okay. Certainly you can bring that back any time you like.  Which we hope in the next few months we'll have at least one of the short-term plans  coming your way.  All right.  Okay.  So,  we're going to have to do a lot of work on that.  With that, I'm not going to make a motion on that if no one else is.  I don't think anyone else is.  Go ahead.  I have a comment.  First of all, I echo what the chief said.  I would love to see more headcount, but not at the expense of violating the budget.  But secondly, the real cost for officers is not their salary and benefits.  It's the whole burden cost.  And when you take the number of sworn officers divided into the budget,  you come up with something over $300,000 a year per head,  and that is the realistic number, not $155,000 to $192,000.  But I oppose it for the reasons the chief cited.  I don't think we made a motion to do it.  So, I'm not sure there's anything to oppose.  Then can I make a motion to approve the budget?  Yes.  So we can move on?  Yes, please.  Is there a second?  We just need a second.  Second.  Oh, second.  There we go.  All right.  That'll do it.  And this is to adopt the resolution for the budget, the preliminary budget.  Councilmember Bennett?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  No.  Okay.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Was that aye?  Yes.  Okay. I apologize.  Five, one with one absence.  So, I'm supposed to answer.  All right.  Item 5.4, Measure H, reauthorization resolution and ordinance.  Report from City Manager Mark Sorensen.  Thank you.  And before you, you have a proposed reauthorization of Measure H that may become necessary if  a certain ballot measure is not approved.  The measure currently on the ballot, in November of 2024, passes, it has the potential to  invalidate.  The current measure H, as it exists today, effective December of 2025.  Unfortunately, while that item is being challenged and might be removed from the ballot by the  California Supreme Court, we're on a timeline to get things ready for the November 2024  ballot.  Which means?  On the 8th?  On your meeting line?  the 18th we must pass all of the final resolutions and ordinances necessary for  this item so what you have before you is the proposed draft ordinance and  resolution to place a successor to measure H on the November 2024 ballot  it does make some changes so that the measure H or I should say the succeeding  sales tax measure is compliant with the Taxpayer Protection Act and that's  described in your agenda report so looking for any council comments  recommendations as to the wording that's used in the resolution and the ordinance  if you have any we would bring those back to you on the 18th for final  adoption because as I said that's our our deadline to have things ready for  the November ballot  thank you Mr. Chair.  Mr. Chair I have a question for you Mr.  you want to just generally discuss  after this Mr.  Moore.  I think it'  s important to point out  that vice mayor Reynolds chaired a committee that discussed this for a very long period of  time almost word for word got some fantastic input from Mr.  Bennett that was immediately shot down by Mr.  Lamb.  and we arrived at this point.  I think it was sarcasm was it was a long meeting really.  It was a talking party.  It was seven minutes.  I think the important part to point out is essentially nothing is changing we're reauthorizing what happened and we're putting a 15 year was it 15?  Well that's what's before you but we're open you know it's up to you all.  Is what the recommendation that came out of the long committee meeting.  I think it's a good idea.  I move to approve.  We should wait until public comment.  That's a good idea.  We have one speaker Nicole Nava.  Three minutes.  Hello again.  So on this one.  I actually.  I struggle with this one.  I appreciate that we used funding for the parks primarily.  And as the mayor aptly noted he was behind three things.  That was what I supported as well.  And promoted.  And so I actually think if it if we hedge our bets it's probably a good thing to have it show up on the ballot.  And I would appreciate that it would stipulate how the funds would be used.  Because I feel like.  There was some kind of.  Slip in of the housing thing because I was assured that that wasn't.  What it was tied to.  And I put my name behind it and was pretty upset to find that it included that later on.  I've made it clear how I feel about that.  And so for me and for the rest of Chico I think that voted on this.  They were clear on the marching orders which was the parks the public safety and the roads.  And thank you that it seems like that is where the energy has been expended to date.  So I think the sunset thing is.  For me if it if the stipulation is there about how it would be used.  You know I'm not as tied to having to have the sunset piece of it because we're always going to have a need to have it the improved roads.  But yeah I think you guys should consider that we do not want to do without the 24 million.  That this has brought the community.  And that we would be hard pressed to keep up with our roads if it went away.  So hopefully everybody would support if they find it on the November ballot again.  And that it would the funds would be used as stated.  Thank you so much for your time.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Mayor.  Mayor if I may real quick.  Yes please.  Just to respond to that comment.  We can't articulate specific purposes that becomes a special tax.  Right.  Which would require different voter approval percentage.  Right.  And so that's really to comply with the potential adoption of the taxpayer protection act.  We're adding the sunset provision because that's what that act requires or calls for.  And also as you see in the staff report it's very minor changes basically adding a phrase to refer to for general government use.  So again this act is you know the successor to measure age.  So the age is really substantively very similar other than just the sunset clause.  Okay.  So does anyone.  Well let me start with everybody else.  Does anyone else have questions?  Or.  Just one thing.  Like it would just to be clear because this is what I read but I want to make sure I understand.  If the Supreme Court, State Supreme Court shuts this down it's not going to end up on the ballot.  Yeah.  I.  Right.  That's correct.  Which?  Oh no.  Oh.  Okay.  So it doesn't go into effect if it's if that taxpayer accountability act isn't passed.  That's correct.  Yeah.  Okay.  That sucks that we just have to put it on the ballot even if that gets shut down in June.  Well two things to that point.  It depends on when the California Supreme Court provides that direction.  We won't be taking you won't be taking this action until June 18th.  We may have a day or two we will try to slow walk it to the elections office.  So you know if the California Supreme Court provides direction in that period of time  and we can prevent this from reaching the ballot we will.  That is part of that's built into your resolution.  I think it's section 12 I think.  Right.  Well there's a lot of moving parts here.  I just want to commend you on doing I think the smartest thing there is to do and slow  walking at the elections office might end up being the best thing.  So hopefully it doesn't end up being necessary.  I don't want to get into the weeds too quickly.  I don't want to get into too much but I did want to ask.  So could you not say measure whatever let's say it's measure C is just simply establishing  a sunset date of March 31st 2040 on the one percent sales side?  I'm sorry Mayor what was your question?  So could you just simply say that measure whatever let's say measure C you know establishes  a sunset date in terms of the title?  Because you know titles are all important when it comes to ballot measures.  So is the title flexible or not?  There is flexibility but there are some requirements we would have to refer to for general government  use and we have to refer to the percentage of the tax.  So you know we want to just be clear as to what's going on and there's some benefits  for having additional information in the title as well.  Yeah I just thought putting the sunset part first makes the most sense because people  would vote.  They wouldn't vote against it and go oh I'd love to put a sunset date on that tax.  So you know anyway okay sounds like it was all thought out then.  Yeah I was saying flip flop it.  So how does no you know put the establish a sunset date of March 31st and reauthorize  the you know one percent.  I think starting with that might be more conducive to have voting or voters who would generally  vote against the sales act vote for it.  We can work on that language and you know when we bring it back on the 18th there could  be a couple options that you can decide on at that point and we can council can decide  then.  I mean voters only read you know they say that voters only read the first seven words  of any ballot statement so.  Yeah of course we could also make it well we wouldn't be writing the ballot arguments.  No but I mean the actual.  Right right.  Verbiage.  The title and then the other.  Yeah.  So.  We don't get a lot.  All right.  I'm discussing politics.  I'm just thinking you should have been on the committee.  No.  No I shouldn't have.  The committee has to.  No I'm just I thought it was a bell topic.  All right.  So.  So is that just direction to staff.  Direction to.  To bring back the resolution.  We don't need a motion we're just.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  Just full steam ahead.  Consensus.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  With that reports and communications following reports and communications items are provided  for the council's information no action can be taken under these items in the section  agenda unless the council agrees to include on subsequent agenda 6.1 city manager's report.  No report.  All right.  6.2 final map pending approval received and filed council member request pursuant to APMP  1010 council members may verbally request item B agendas at a future meeting after a state  council meeting.  Any сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл  сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл  сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл  сл сл сл сл сл сл  сл  сл !  Wyatt west was there.  We spent probably ten times as  much money on consultants and  staff time as the stop signs  cost.  I would like to amend the city  code to allow the staff to  discretion to make changes in  traffic signage under the amount  of $10,000 without it having to  go to internal affairs or the  council.  you want to agenda the  discussion about that?  I would.  I will second that.  Madam clerk?  all right.  council member bennett?  yes.  council member morgan?  yes.  council member van overbeck?  yes.  council member winslow?  yes.  vice mayor reynolds?  aye.  mayor coolidge?  aye.  carries 6-0 with one absent.  all right.  and with that, we will adjourn.
