 yeah okay.  so i reached out to megan who castigated me for not being involved earlier.  but i think it's a great opportunity to talk about this.  and i think it's a great opportunity to say what can we do to have the commission and the council work more closely together.  because if you want to get things done in the park we have to make sure those things are reflected in the budget.  and that's what the council does.  so i want to find a way for us to work more closely together.  and have the council and the commission.  and what you need as a champion.  as somebody who will when you have something to say.  and what you want to get done.  we'll take it to the council.  and i'm happy to do that.  but also i'm a conservative.  as most of you probably know.  but the person who is the senior progressive.  addison winslow.  and i are very much in alignment on the park.  and the priorities.  and what we want to see in the park.  so you're in the enviable position.  even though we have a divided council.  people are pretty much of one mind.  around what love for the park.  and how we want to take it forward.  so i don't know what the process is.  and maybe larry you and i can talk about it.  or the rest of us.  but how to come up with a 20 year plan.  you know what do we want this park to be in 20 years.  and then pick away every year.  we try to get some more money in the budget.  and pick away at it.  there's a lot that's been done.  we're scheduled to repave south park drive.  and peterson.  and then we're going to have to get some more money in the budget.  one mile is being rebuilt.  because the pool has.  you know it's 80 years old.  and it has some major structural issues.  and obviously the big issue is.  we've got to get the campers out of the park.  and we're waiting for the supreme court.  not supreme court.  the ninth district judge to get back to us.  but.  so we can take this off line.  but i want to say congratulations to shane.  and also the new members.  for being on the commission.  and thank you.  and i think.  we are in a very enviable position.  to have a superb staff.  so eric and his team.  and shane.  and even though richie and i have crossed swords.  a few times.  i would include richie in that group of outstanding people.  so thank you.  and i look forward to working with you.  and anybody that has any questions.  please feel free to reach out to me.  i think you'll have my contact stuff.  i think that's probably going to be happening.  in the next couple of weeks.  you mentioned council priorities.  what do you believe those priorities to be?  for the park?  yes.  well i think the first thing.  first of all there's some maintenance infrastructure things that have to happen.  you know the roads and one mile.  one mile is nothing like it i've ever seen anywhere.  i mean it's just.  it's stunning.  it's the first thing i show people when they come to town.  i think the two big issues.  we have to get the campers out of the park.  because to me we're not going to be successful.  unless my 12 year old grandson can do it.  he can go ride his bike.  and i don't have to worry about him being accosted by some crazed meth head with a knife.  and secondly.  vegetation management.  we've got some money in the budget to do that.  because we have a real fire risk.  especially in the summer.  because the campers are building fires.  so you may have seen the item we had on the council menu.  authorizing the mayor.  to declare an emergency.  and so we can summarily get the campers out.  of not only bidwell park.  but lindo channel.  and the other thing.  we don't need the place to burn down.  so that would be a real disaster.  so i think those are the two big issues.  and then there's the whole headway report.  which had a number of great suggestions.  way finding signs.  and better access from the sides.  on valambrogia.  i put out an issue.  to get cars out of the park.  on weekends and holidays.  and headway recommended.  getting cars out of the park.  and we have a lot of traffic.  and we have a lot of traffic.  correct me if i'  m wrong.  south park.  that'  s going to be closed seven days a week.  i intended to update the commission.  during the park manager'  s verbal update.  but no.  the headway report recommended a closure of south park drive.  seven days per week.  on the fourth.  which will council's direction from the last meeting.  was to close both peterson and south park drive.  to vehicular traffic on weekends.  and national holidays.  my question for you.  isn' t the idea to close south park drive.  seven days a week?  ultimately.  well.  yes ultimately after the design.  but i think the council first direction.  is just to close it weekends and national holidays.  was the direction from council.  and the city council.  any other questions?  thank you.  thank you.  anybody else?  thank you.  nicole nava.  good evening commission.  i am here because i wanted to let you know.  that i actually have been actively working.  with mayor casey reynolds.  throughout my time at commission.  but i'  m here speaking as an individual.  about an election.  and i think that is a very important.  but i do try to share.  things that i believe the community.  have brought to our attention.  and public speakers share about concerns.  about the park.  and i agree with what council member.  van overbeck was saying.  about some of the priorities.  not necessarily the last.  but what i wanted to say.  was just today i published a petition.  to try to enjoin the honorable judge.  to rule on the rules.  on the bill 60.  submitted by the city of chico.  regarding the encampments.  and so what i plan to do.  is if hopefully get a bunch of signatures.  and just deliver it to him.  and make the plea again.  please make a swift ruling.  we'  ve been waiting for months and months.  and i feel like the staff is demoralizing.  how much they have to do the maid service.  continually.  community members are at risk. Apparently relate to a family member of being assaulted by a homeless individual again alleged But these are concerning things we've had fires we've had assaults we've had horrific violence you all know this But these are concerning things we've had fires we've had assaults we've had horrific violence you all know this just at my Street alone where my husband and I enter the park with our dog on a daily basis There's been a tent that he'll bring croach on the entire sidewalk. You literally cannot get through the little path You have to go to the bigger path and the city thankfully moved him promptly buddies back just FYI. He went right back across  and the city thankfully moved him promptly but he's back just FYI he went  right back across and so it's an egress issue it's behavioral the smell is not  pleasant in many places because people are doing their business where business  should not be done so that's a public safety risk so I am encouraged to hear  about collaborative efforts because I think that is what is needed to kind of  figure out what is our long-range plan what are some actionable steps and I  really really hope the community more starts coming to these meetings to give  input it gives more weight when we go to speak with people I think that's  important and I just really want to also say how pleased I was to go to PV high  and take part in a wonderful event and watch all the high school kids and  things they're working on for the keeper acres  improvement and I think that's a really important thing to do and I think that's  something the commissioners benefit the most out of the technical  technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  am I allowed to ask a question?  sure.  can you clarify exactly what  the communication or what the  vehicle of communication you'  trying to use to get in touch  with the federal court judge?  yes I'  m just doing a local  petition which I would then just  send directly to the honorable  judge in question to try to see  if because of the public health  and safety risk he would consider  expediting the decision.  okay.  so it would just be delivered  and I get that judges don'  t always take things like that  into account but one can hope  with some of the things that have  happened recently added on and  things like that that would  happen.  okay.  thank you I appreciate it.  there'  s a couple of things that  re going to run into with  trying to petition.  I'  m not petitioning the  judge it'  s literally just a change.org  one that I will deliver.  I don'  t think there'  s any issue with the  public trying to ask for help  when scotus backs up what can be  done and I get we'  re under a  settlement I'  m not ignorant as to the ways  of some of this.  thank you.  okay.  thank you.  thank you.  do we have any other speakers?  we do not.  okay.  so we will move on.  regular agenda item 5.1.  ms.  gresson.  thank you chair willis.  thank you commission for kind of  putting up with me coming in.  as you are well aware I'  m responsible for the  training of all of our boards  and commission members.  I'  m the city clerk and I'  ve been tasked with all of  those things and I wanted to  just give you a quick overview  of what we'  re planning for this year.  we'  re getting ready to host again  a new orientation for all of  our boards and commission  members.  it will not be with an outside  consultant it will be with myself  and my staff.  and I think it will be really  informative.  I think that sometimes there'  s a lot of  rules at the state level as  well as council directives and  as well as outlined in ap and  p.  10.  1.  I think we attached ap and  p.  10.  1.  to the agenda and I would  encourage all the members to  read that to kind of hold you  over until we can have that  orientation which I believe will  be done in April at the latest  early may.  and it'  s interesting because we had a  council member address working  together with the commission and  I just want to point out that  that absolutely should happen  and can happen but there'  s ways for it to happen.  I know that the commissions were  told several years ago or asked  by the council by a change in  the policy to not agendize items  unless it'  s been referred by council or  referred by staff.  It doesn'  t mean you can'  t reach out to a council  member and say I have this great  idea what do you think and then  the council can decide if that'  s what they want to take up.  I think that what commissioner  nickels indicated what are the  priorities of the council that'  s going to be addressed on March  11 when the council looks at  their priorities and it'  s a special session it'  s on an off Tuesday.  I would encourage all of you to  attend if you would like.  If it'  s too large for conference room  one then we'  ll move into the council  chamber.  But we are planning for the  council to have that strategic  planning and I think that will set  in motion a lot of things for the  directives once they prioritize  their work.  So AP and P 10-1 I'  m not going to go over it  because we'  re going to go over that during  the orientation.  I will also be providing a chair  and vice chair training so that  if you want we can all sit down  with all the chairs.  I think there'  s a strength in our experiences  and being able to share each  commissioners opinion and  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  agenda. The agenda is you have  to whenever there'  s quorum of the  commission you have to be in a  duly notice meeting and the  topics you'  re going to talk about  have to be identified on the  agenda. That way if I or angie  want to attend because we want  to speak on one particular item  we know you'  re going to take up that  matter. If it'  s not on the agenda you can'  t talk about it.  The public has a right always  to bring up things that are not  agendized on the actual agenda  and that'  s from public comments. I  know that'  s a little confusing but the  brown act says that the public  always has a right to be part of  the process. It really is  important to make sure that they  know that you as a collective  body are talking about things in  this room so that everyone can  hear and provide feedback and  information and that you can  actually make your deliberation  and take final action. It'  s always done in front of  everybody. Where can a violation  of the brown act and a violation  of the brown act is a misdemeanor  and prosecuted by the d.a.'s  office. They'  re very few and far between and  hopefully it'  s because we'  ve helped guide you to  understand the ramifications.  Again keep in mind the whole  purpose is to make sure the  public is aware of it. If you  the d.a.s office, one violation  is like in serial meetings. If  you have a hub and spoke, if I'  m one of the seven commissioners  and I contact another commissioner  and then I contact another one  and another one and I end up  with the fourth one, that'  s a quorum. Four members is a  quorum. I have just committed a  violation of the brown act. The  other way that could happen is a  daisy chain. I call commissioner  ravel and the commissioners  make sure the commissioners  make sure the commissioners  make sure the commissioners  make sure the commissioners  make sure the commissioners So it's really important to say how many people have you talked to if they call you and say Would you like to discuss this idea is on the agenda and there's nothing wrong with it of doing that Just make sure you know how many? Commissioners they've talked to before you take up that matter  reminding them that you would really want to hear all the comments so that everyone the whole  commission has all the comments in an open session so the citizens can hear that as well so it's  protecting the citizens interest so that's really um the brown act in a nutshell the only other  thing i would remind you of is on emails so we think emails are just generic and we might send  an email out saying hey i what are your thoughts on this item or i really would like to see a  council member agendize this matter and then someone forwards that email that's that's a daisy  chain even though it's not speaking now they've got us where the emails count as well which is  important because you could do a lot of dialogue and have a lot of meetings without having a meeting  and the public's not invited and can't participate so i just wanted to bring those few areas i  promise you that we will go over all the other areas and i'll hopefully bring a lot of tools  for you and if you have any questions i'm happy to answer anything real quick like  okay excuse me i have a question miss preston i want to clarify something you said about agenda  items what is the policy if a member of the commission wants an item on the commission  agenda is that prohibited um it is because what was happening was some of the commissions were  adding budgetary items that they didn't have the authority to do  as well as the council wanted to make sure that the council sets priorities in their meetings  and that's through every action that they take and then through the adoption of the budget  when a commission wants to take up a matter that the council may not endorse we should first check  with the council if they want to have you work on that because when you have staff reports from staff  when you have meetings where you want staff to actually do some additional work the council has  set a huge priority on the council's priorities and that's what we're doing and that's what we're  doing here at the commission commission commission commission commission commission commission Then we still support I support the Arts Commission Eric supports the Airport Commission Shane is now going to support this Commission and so we have all and we just have all these other things  commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission  commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission commission  the board and commission  agenda items.  That'  s why I ask you to look at  that because that will help you  understand how you interact with  council as well. It says on page  three of nine board and  commission member request to  agenda items prohibited without  express authorization by council  action or staff referral. The  work of each advisory body is  driven by council policy referral  for recommendations or items  brought forward by staff in order  to fulfill the responsibilities of the  city and its work for the  community. Individual board or  commission members are prohibited from  agendizing personal requests to  discuss potential ideas or to bring  back discussions related to operations  of the city. Items for commission  review and discussion are determined by  council action or by  referral of an item by staff.  Staff is very much  apprised of their responsibilities in this  area and wanting to make sure  understanding the role of the parks  commission so they'  re going to be  bringing you those items as they come up.  There may be something you think should  come up a little earlier or sooner or  it'  s been dragging and you can  always reach out to council about that.  I guess the short answer is  that if we want to put something on  the agenda the proper procedure would  be to go through staff.  You could go through staff but  if you'  re asking or directing  staff to put something on the agenda  and they'  re not ready to bring that item  forward then it would need council to  redirect staff to tell them please change  your priorities, change your workload  and do this item now.  this isn'  t really a question this is kind of by  a way of history for the new commissioners.  This policy is three years old I  think so we used to be able to  agendize our own items.  This is a little controversial but  I think for some people it'  s not.  I think we'  re all still trying to work out  what the process is because we'  re the ones sitting here  meeting after meeting listening to the  public with a deeper knowledge of  what'  s going on in our parks and  playgrounds so it'  s intuitively you think we should be  able to put an item on our own agenda  while we'  re not able to do that anymore.  Again we'  re still trying to figure out how do  we communicate these priorities these  needs once to staff to city council.  I would just recommend to you you  were each appointed by a city council  member forge a relationship with that  city council member set up a coffee  every once in a while that'  s going to be a great way like  council member van overback said to  keep the lines of communication open  and to be able to communicate to them  that they'  what we'  re hearing here and what we'  re seeing in the parks.  That'  s just my little tidbit for you  there'  s going to be times early in the  procedure for you or this process  that we will have to give you a bit  of history on some of these things  that are coming up.  I wanted to do that for you real  quick.  questions?  comments?  the only other change I wanted to  talk about real quick was on this  agenda you notice that the written  parks manager report was not included.  The reason that'  s going to still be sent out to  you it'  s just not going to be  agendized the way it has been.  We at the council level do not include  the city manager'  s report.  He does email blast constantly updating  the council.  So I think that'  We'  re encouraging all of our boards  and commissions to do the same.  I think this one is really the only  one that has that written report and  has done that for some time.  You'  ll still get the information.  The problem is if you go back and  you watch your commission meetings  there'  s been times when it'  s become a free for all on the  discussion of that written report and  then other matters get taken up.  Plus there'  s not a place under reports and  communications for your citizens to  address the dialogue that they hear  going on between the commissioners.  So we will have it come out either  before or after or how often you want  to send out that report.  You may not have to do a monthly  report.  However you want to adapt it to  your needs and to the commission'  s needs.  But it isn'  t to keep you from having the  information.  s going to be  discussed.  When you say a written report but  then you'  re going to discuss every  component of it and perhaps give  direction to staff you really need to  be able to open those items up.  I would encourage staff to work with  your commission and when there'  s an item that needs to come back  to the commission bring it back and  put it on as a regular item so they  can talk about it.  we'  re not going to get a written  tree report either?  No.  Okay.  you'  ll get a written one but it'  ll be by email.  I'  m not going to get a written  It'  ll be sent out and you'  ll still get  whatever richie has been sending  you whenever he sends it.  But it'  s not going to be attached as a  written report to the agenda.  okay.  I could add commission  too.  We talked about this at the staff  level as well and kind of intend  to maybe implement a higher  frequency of notification and  communication with the commission  both airport commission and park  So you'  ll likely get more emails  from Mr.  Romaine and Mr.  Bamlett on weekly happenings or  biweekly happenings versus  everything for the whole month  kind of compiled into a long  written report as Ms.  Preston was advising that starts  to kind of open up the discussion  for additional items and then it'  s almost unfair you'  re not able to take action or  anything else like that on that  item too.  So I think we hope that the  commission will continue to  update you on the things that are  happening in the park and with  the tree division and if there  are items that need to have more  robust discussion and potential  action on then we could  definitely put those on a future  agenda for a park commission  meeting.  so if we have a question on  some update from you like have  you hired the third park commission  re in the park ranger  position yet.  How are we going to get that to  you through email now we ask  that as opposed to discussion  amongst ourselves or here and  there?  I'  ll just add real quickly we'  re always open to individual  emails with questions we could  answer those very quickly we  don'  t want to violate the brown act  if there'  s more than two  commissioners on that email.  But yes if shane sends a weekly  meeting we will be happy to respond  to shane.  I had a question about this  item what'  s happening here and he  could elaborate a little more and  hopefully answer it for you.  thank you.  where if you copy every  commissioner then you have a  potential item that you'  re discussing outside of a  public meeting.  So it'  s when they send you emails I  believe you put them in blind cc  so you can hit reply all and it'  s going to go to staff and you  have absolutely every right to  call staff and ask them a status.  I believe our council members I  had two come in today and talk to  me about items that are coming up  or they want to see come up.  So believe me we'  re here to serve you and we'  re here to help you be great  stewards of our community it'  s just the report in and of  itself being on there was opening  up discussions that the public was  not allowed to participate.  So we want to make sure you have  participate and to protect you  from that.  That'  s why we changed that.  I would think that is what  the chairperson is for though to  keep the discussion focused on  the agenda.  If I didn'  t do that then that'  s my fault.  I keep those reports I like to  refer to them from month to month  and compare them.  I think it seems like this is  going to be creating more work if  you'  re going to be fielding  individual questions about things  that we used to get in the report  it doesn'  t seem like that'  s the efficiency we'  re looking for here.  That'  s just me thinking out loud.  you are going to get your  reports and you will get them.  If it is whatever period of time  that you cover in your reports  that'  s fine.  I would like to  ask you to please bring that  report back to the commission  meeting and say can we discuss  it because you have concerns  about it.  What'  s happening under reports and  communications is that the  written report would be there and  then it would kind of some  commissioners had an interest in  one or two of the items and then  it started these long  conversations that the public  could not participate in.  Again it'  s all about protecting the  public'  s right to participate.  So you still get your reports.  You will be getting them.  You can keep them as long as you  want and they'  ll still probably be called  something similar, tree report or  whatever.  thank you.  I just want to say that that is  fine for me.  I appreciate that we'  ll still be getting them.  That'  s the important part to me and I  know that I have historically as  well seen the technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  naturally through conversation  that comes up there was that  concern how do we do that  efficiently and expeditiously  right?  My reading of it initially when  it was shared with us was we can  go and ask that an agenda item  be added right through our city  staff here and I get the added  layer that you'  re adding  that if it'  s something that would be  budgetary that we would need to  move further up the chain so to  speak.  thank you.  question.  my recollection is the reports  were the printed reports were  part of the published agenda  correct?  yes unless it'  s a verbal.  we often times have verbal  updates that are under reports  and communications and then  there'  s not a document.  we have presentations at the  if we have a staff report  where you'  re going to take action we  want to be able to give you all  that information and we have  those.  I was wondering if it'  s part of the  published agenda in accordance  with the brown act then how is  the public precluded from  understanding the dialogue about  the printed report?  well if the reports are going  out to update what'  s the purpose of them being  agendized?  were they to update the  commissioners?  you'  d have to probably give me  some more information in regards  to that however when we have  reports and communication items  they are not discussed other  than council member requests  because that'  s a stand-alone procedure  but there are no citizens input  taken on the council request so  you couldn'  t have your citizens address  it.  I would encourage you if you  have an item in one of those  reports and you'  d love to have a discussion  at the commission talk to staff  and see if that'  s something that  can be agendized.  staff can initiate items to be  placed on the agenda based on  what the needs are for their  division and what the commission  wants to work on.  I don'  t think we'  re trying to throw roadblocks  we'  re trying to make sure it'  s fair and important.  department as well as taking  care of the seat at the table  by the citizens.  thank you.  other questions?  thank you.  thank you.  moving on.  thank you.  moving on.  the big chico creek park fire  burn scar storm impacts.  the fire burn scar storm  the fire burn scar storm  good evening commission.  good evening.  give me a moment to bring it up.  all right.  good evening commissioners.  chair willis and vice chair  latchley.  commission my name is david  keene with the public works  engineering department and i  will be presenting the impact  from the fire burn scar on big  chico creek.  well hello everyone. So here's what I'll be going over first We'll talk about Big Chico Creek the creek itself the watershed and then the five mile diversion how the water gets into Midwell Park and into Big Chico Creek within town Talk a little bit about the burn scar and then we'll talk about two particular events that happened one in November and one this early Talk a little bit about the burn scar and then we'll talk about two particular events that happened one in November and one this early  well hello everyone.  well hello everyone.  well hello everyone. We'll talk about what we observed in Big Chico Creek a little bit Lindow Channel a little bit in Sycamore bypass And then lastly we'll analyze what happened and we'll put some conclusions out there. So To start Big Chico Creek. Here's an image of the watershed the yellow it goes all the way up to Colby Mountain  the water flows down the  watershed yellow goes all the  way up to colby mountain it'  s a pretty long and narrow  watershed which was good with  regard or not good which was it  can depend or we can get more  into that but basically this is  the watershed. The water comes  down out of the mountains you  can see big chico creek comes  down and it comes to the five  mile diversion system where it  comes up across the mountain  across the mountain and the  water flows up the mountain up  the mountain up the mountain up  up the mountain up the mountain  up the mountain up the mountain  up the mountain up the mountain  up the mountain up the mountain  up the mountain up the mountain  up the mountain up the mountain  the flow is a maximum amount of  flows that can go down big chico  creek and lindo channel. As you  can see here there'  s a design  capacity of 1500 cubic feet per  second going down big chico  creek. 6000 down lindo channel  and the remainder down the  bypass. In an ideal state that'  s the amount that would go down  big chico creek. We'  ll talk a little bit later  about whether or not we believe  that to be true. One important  thing I wanted to talk about  this is there are many  stakeholders in this five mile  diversion. U.S.  Army Corps of engineers built  it. Central valley flood  protection board regulates it.  Department of water resources  manages the channel. Fish and  wildlife manages the fish and  all the plants. Butte county is  the local maintaining agency and  the city of chico is protected by  it and this doesn'  t include the environmental  advocacy groups and all the other  groups out there. This diversion  system has quite a bit of interest  from the community rightfully so.  Next the bark fire. We remember  burned 430,000 acres. During the  fire as the fire was actually  happening and moving up north  the California watershed emergency  response team put boots on the  ground and started creating what  they call their watershed  emergency response report which  I'  ll call the work report moving  forward. This was produced by  cal fire and the California  department of conservation. The  primary findings from that report  are that the fire has a  frequency in which they will  happen. A 10 year storm would be  a storm you would expect to happen  once every 10 years. 100 year storm  same thing you would expect that  to happen once in 100 years. For  example the impact would be a  two year rain event would produce  an 11 year runoff event. It'  s disproportionately larger which  makes sense. I found this image  to show prefire you'  ve got the  canopy and things soaking it up. The soil is nice and soft. There'  roots all absorbing it. Post fire  foliage is gone. In places where the  fire was so hot it can actually make a  water repellent soil on the top and  that causes increased runoff from the  burn scar. This doesn' t include the  ash and debris and all those types of  things as well. This is just more water  running off the watershed than there  would have been before the fire. I  like this graphic to show you that.  How did the burn scar impact  Big Chico Creek watershed?  Unfortunately about 75% of the  watershed was burned. Something to  note I talked earlier about how it'  s a long narrow watershed. It'  s bad in the fact that a lot of it  got burned because of the steep walls.  With regards to storms it'  s unlikely that a long narrow storm  will park itself right over the whole  thing which is good when it comes to  managing runoff from flows. There was  quite a bit of high burn severity and  moderate. You can see the high is  the red and the yellow is the moderate.  We were fortunate enough to do a  helicopter flight and we were  fortunate enough to fly over and  observe some of this with the sheriff'  s office. A picture in the upper right  there is what you would consider a  high burn severity. I always call that  the black sticks. It' s the type of  forest that doesn' t come back for years.  You can see the moderate is with the  gold some of the leaves left and  of course some mild to medium is  where the green is left. You can see  the impacts were far ranging as we  flew up in the watershed.  I show this mostly for the item on the  left. This is the multiplier. This is  a big long report that cal fire and  the department of conservation came  out of. This table summarizes it all.  I pointed to the two most important  numbers in the whole report there which  are what are called flow multipliers.  What that is before the fire you would  have a rain event and you would have  flow coming out of the hills. Now you  have the fire you use those multipliers  and that' s what you would expect.  1.7 to 1.8. We will get into that later  but just remember those numbers there  that before the fire you would expect a  1.7 to 1.8 increase in flow.  As you can see there were other  watersheds impacted by this and big  chico creek was just one of them studied.  We have all this information and we  worked with the department of  conservation and here comes the first  storm in November. It was indicated to  be a bomb cyclone and very intimidating  but here we looked at the forecast and  it was forecasted to be a two year 24  hour storm. A little bit more as far  as classification goes.  It is classified as a storm and  it is classified as a storm and it  takes two parts to classify a storm.  The frequency in which it happens and  the duration. If it happens once in 100  years but it is only a really intense  ten minutes or once in 100 years but  it is a long three days so you need  the two parts to classify the storm.  The good news for both of these storms  was in that work report it identified  debris flow thresholds which would be  a torrential downpour that' s enough to  flow. Not quite water that' s brown or  water that' s black with ash in it but  more almost looking like mud. That was  not triggered and thank goodness that  was so and it wasn' t forecasted either.  The February one was considered to be  an atmospheric river. Again no debris  flow threshold reached but this one was  bigger. The February one was forecasted  to be a two to up to five year storm.  That' s getting to be pretty big.  Once in five years that' s getting there.  We' re in November. We' re coming along.  We' re working with the Department of  Conservation and we have empirical data  on the flows in Big Chico Creek that we  know what we would expect for a two year  storm. For a two year storm we would  expect around 3800 CFS. We simply apply  that multiplier and we expect flows in  the 6000 to 7000 CFS range. What do we  see? Sure enough right around the peak  of the flow 7147 CFS. This is interesting  because we have a lot of data that  the technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical technical  technical technical  technical  Well, a lot happened between those November storms in February, but imagine, and I'll talk a little bit about it here a second, though, but if we only had the data that we had in November, we would have forecasted a five-year rain event at around 5,000 CFS, applied that multiplier, predicted around 8,000, 9,000 CFS.  But in that time, we networked and made connections with people down in the National Weather Service, and lo and behold, they modeled Big Chico Creek.  So we found a link to a model that I still don't think I could find unless I had the direct link, and it's extremely useful.  There's a snapshot of it there, and it's very valuable that we did because I highlighted a little red circle there, and what we had in early February was a small rain event, and before the creek could go down, we had another rain event.  So applying that simple multiplier would have underpredicted the flows.  So I would have predicted 8,000 and 9,000 had I not had that tool.  Thank goodness for our partners at the National Weather Service.  And Department of Water Resources, they gave us this increased flow, showed us this model that shows the increased flow.  We still did apply a multiplier because in discussion with them, it did not take into account the burn scar impacts.  It took into account saturation, meaning it had just rained, everything soaking wet, so they wouldn't expect anything else to settle in.  But it didn't take into account loss of foliage and the hardened soil with the water-repellent soil.  So we applied a flow multiplier around 1.1 to 1.3, and we 4.3.  We forecasted flows of 9,000 to 11,000 CFS, and sure enough from 5,000 we saw flows of 10,500 CFS in Big Chico Creek.  So the take away of these two graphs is that what these reports are saying is true and it can have an impact on infrastructure.  So the take away is the first storm, we forecasted a 2-year 24-hour event and we observed a 10-year flow.  That's a once in a decade.  But to me the more critical one, and I want to point this out, is the change in our forecast.  out we forecasted a two to five year event but we actually observed a five to ten year event  so we forecasted it but then when it actually hit it was more rain than we thought and we saw a 50  year flow event so if you were out there on the evening of february 4th you saw something that  might happen twice in a century which is pretty interesting so what did that look like here's  some impacts to big chico creek up by bear hole you can see the debris laid up in the yahi trail  here's an image of five mile recreation this is the back of the recreation area completely soaked  which i had never seen those record highs here's an image of big chico creek around 5 20 on that  same day and then there's the diversion structure with two and a half feet of freeboard which is a  record high for i've seen the system is designed to carry 16 000 cfs but there are some issues with  sediment deposit in this entire basin that are impacting the height of the water on these gauges  and interestingly there was a  model that was designed to carry 16 000 cfs but there are some issues with sediment deposit in  a model that was designed to carry 16 000 cfs but there are some issues with sediment deposit in  was a model completed by butte county that showed the water levels and what they would be and the  observations from the models the observations were that the water level was higher on big chico  creek and interesting it was lower on lindo channel diversion so we're going to work with them on  their model and what caused that but that's just something to show you that a model is a tool and  it's helpful but observations are the most valuable tool that we have so here's an aerial shot that we  got of the system itself and i really like this image of the water level and i think it's really  interesting because the technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical technical  Those are all within the  sediment deposit that is not  there in the original design  drawings.  What were the impacts to the  park?  Butte county is the local  maintaining agency for the  diversion structures.  They have slide gates on them  that they can open and close  and control flow to go down  big chico creek and lindo  channel.  With the huge concern of this  increased runoff from the park  fire burn sky they had every  gate open making sure we can  handle as much water or they  can handle as much water as  they can and manage their flood  protection duties.  As a result we saw significant  flow through big chico creek.  You can see flooding under the  bypass.  One mile was completely  flooded and the park had to be  closed.  In working with butte county  they have to manage their job  as a flood protection agency  and if they shut a gate at big  chico creek what impacts will  that have on the park and other  areas of the park?  The other thing that  complicates this is that there  is so much debris and wood  coming down that it'  s really impractical  to try and run these gates up  and down in the middle of a  storm.  So we have to kind of set it  and hope and once you'  re getting up to  predicting 10,000 C.F.S.  you don'  t really want to close it  unless you absolutely have to  which is why we did experience  flooding and there was pretty  significant flooding all  throughout the park and we  lower Bidwell Park, which you can still see all of the silt and sand built up on the edges.  I did want to show some bin packs here to Lindo Channel as well, just because it's part of the  system. I know it's not part of the park, but I just, the picture on the right there captures  some of the ash that came off. You can see it's basically black. The picture on the left shows  some of the debris that builds up and the impractical nature of running these gates up  and down during a storm. This is a video that I took, and this just shows, this kind of flow  is typical for Lindo Channel. It happens pretty regularly, but what's unique is the color,  and this is impact from the burn scar, which you can still see today up on the edges. You can see  the ash running up and down. Lastly, when flows are high enough, sycamore bypass begins to flow,  and this is what that looks like, some of the debris coming down. It's hard to tell when it's  all brown like this, but it didn't appear that all of the woody debris coming down was burned.  Maybe half of it, three-quarter of it was actually from the burn scar. Another of it would be normal  woody debris that would have gone down.  So, it was impacted, but since those debris flow thresholds weren't reached,  I think that's what protected us from a lot of the woody debris coming down all at once.  So, what are the conclusions? The conclusions are that the work report accurately modeled it,  so that 1.7 multiplier, their research and the model has come through,  but the multiplier is complicated when you have a short storm first, and if we didn't have the  National Weather Service model, we would have underpredicted flows pretty significantly. So,  it's good that we were able to kind of work with our partners there. The other one is a lack of rain  gauge data in the watershed. We have very limited rain gauges up there, so we basically had the  forecast and then you wait and see. For larger watersheds, they have what's called rain gauge  radar adjusted data, which is a really fancy system where they have aerial imagery and they  can look at the storm and predict what kind of rain it is, and then they have a gauge on the  bottom saying, okay, you think you're getting an inch an hour, okay, you're actually getting two  inches an hour, and it's talking to itself in real time, so you can actually predict the flows  coming out of the hills other than just the aerial imagery. And then lastly, we need additional stream  gauging information in Big Chico Creek. We believe there's a maximum capacity of 1,500 CFS going  through Big Chico Creek, but we don't have any gauges. So, Butte County and the Vining Groundwater  Sustainability Agency are pursuing a project to install a gauge. I don't know exactly when that  will be completed, but they are working towards that, and that will help us better understand  flows and quantify those flows when having the discussion with the National Weather Service.  I think it's important to be able to say, okay, this amount of flow is causing us flooding,  therefore can you please close the gates? So instead of us just saying, hey, water's too high,  go turn it down, it gives us a more objective way of communicating with them.  And that's my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions.  I know I'll always be first.  Is it Mr. Keene?  Keene, yeah, that's right.  Keene, thank you.  The flood that we saw in the lower park, that was more than 1,500 CFS going down Little Big  Chico?  We don't know.  But those gates, they don't regulate those gates to limit the flow that goes down the creek?  So historically, they can and they will, but under these circumstances,  they wanted them all open because the runoff coming out of the watershed was unknown.  So in previous years, if we had experienced flooding, then we would communicate with  Butte County, hey, we're starting to experience flooding, can you guys close the gates?  And they would. But with the impact from these storms, they're having a lot of trouble. They're  hesitant to do that because they need to make sure that they're not overwhelmed in a storm and  trying to run a gate up in the middle of a storm.  So if the whole system is you had 60,000 CFS, so above that, you would overtop Mud Creek?  Well, there's modeling. We don't know that exactly.  Okay. So my question is, in a major event like that, the county is going to open the gates and  let more water run down through Chico Creek in the park and flood the city? I mean, that's the policy?  No. There is only so much flood.  There is only so much water that can go through the Chico Creek diversion,  and that's 1500 CFS, according to the design documents.  But you don't know how much is actually going through there?  You don't know how much that is exactly.  Commissioner Nichols, too, I could add that we have a hypothesis and a hunch that there's more  going through just because of the sediment buildup behind the Five Mile Dam structure.  So it's changed the hydrology over decades and decades of not removing that sediment.  The county is working off the latest modeling that we have or they have is from the, I don't know,  Army Corps of Engineers that was modeled directly, you know, as soon as the structure was  completed, construction was completed, they modeled it. It's from the late 60s. So a lot has  changed since the late 60s. They used to remove the sediment up until the late 90s when environmental  regulations, they received a cease and desist letter from California Fish and Wildlife at the  time, which doesn't necessarily preclude you from continuing to remove sediment. It just makes you go  through the whole entire environmental review process and get the proper permits to do so.  So we're working with the county now and DWR, as Mr. Keene mentioned, they're the local maintaining  agency. They are scoping a project currently to remove that sediment and go through the  environmental review process to do so. And so we're excited to combine our efforts with them,  to work alongside of them, to make sure that project goes through and that sediment is  ultimately removed. So it could go back to operating how it was originally designed,  and then we're going to request after that is updated modeling take place now that we know the  sediment's been removed. Let's model it again to see where flows and hydrology actually is.  Is 16,000 CFF the 100-year storm? Empirically, no. Meaning that over the past  60 years since it was built, a 100-year storm is around 13,000, 14,000. But in the 60s,  they said 100-year storm is 16,000. That's what we're designing it to.  So hopefully it's overbuilt then?  One would hope, yeah. Filled with sediment, potentially not, but I think that it can  handle. I mean, it handled 10,500 CFS pretty well. It had two and a half feet of freeboard.  It's not ideal. You'd like to have three foot of freeboard,  but removing the sediment will make a big difference.  Thank you for your presentation. That was really fascinating. I have a couple questions. One is  about the history of the watershed area. You said 75% of the area had been burned in this fire in July of 2024. Do we have any, and honestly, I just don't quite know how far up that goes. I can't visualize it in my brain. But I'm wondering the history of fires in that area previously and if that is exacerbating that kind of  desertification of the watershed area?  well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well  path of water but they in times of flooding could be very close to the water's edge and I'm wondering if there's any  Data that you collected or either with visualization or through community outreach hearing anecdotal evidence of  water approaching or encroaching on  Private property and particularly those homes in that area  Yeah, thank you for that. Thank you. It's a good questions the first one. I don't know offhand that's likely in the work report  That's the kind of thing that they would look at burn severity does is impacted by previous fires  So that's something that we can get back to you on with regards to the channel and homes being close to it  we had a discussion with Department of Water Resources lately and  Stream beds do change their location over time naturally now when you build homes close to them  Then you need to protect those homes from that  Another thing that can impact that is sediment deposit just as their sediment deposit at five mile their sediment deposits in Lindo Channel and those  build-up  and cause the channel to move so  Depending on the time of year and as to guy progresses then different homes will be closer if we can shore up the edges that that's  Something we can do to protect those homes, but in the long run  It's going to be a constant battle because we're trying to constrain something that shouldn't be constrained naturally  so  Ultimately those homes that are built close if we may have to build some type of shore protection or work with the Department of Water  Resources to clear out the channel and bring it back to its original channel carrying capacity  But as far as observed impacts nothing outrageous for this storm people were calling in and we did experience flooding  unrelated in some localized areas  But nothing nothing out of the ordinary unless O&M had any input on that  Eric did you have anything?  Perfect covered it.  Thank you.  I can answer some of that questions about previous fires because I'm very familiar with the !  Here at the technical technical technical technical  example of that and that'  s  probably likely related.  I remember as a kid the lendo  channel got really high and they  got what they call scouring  flows that would take out some  of the vegetation. They don'  t get those  kind of flows anymore in the  lendo channel is there any plans  or any ideas about vegetation  management in the lendo channel  so you don'  t get those backups and  you get the log dams and  informal log dams and that kind  of stuff?  there'  s two things.  One thing I talked about was the  observed flow split versus the  modeled. The observed was higher  on big chico creek diversion  structure and lower on lendo  channel so that means we'  re getting  less flow than expected for a  expectations are probably true and  it'  s not flowing as much as it used  to because more is going down big  chico creek. That'  s true and the second part of  your question?  is there any plans or anything  to do vegetation management in  the lendo channel so that you  don'  t get the backup from the  overgrowth in the bed of the  lendo channel?  I think we'  re going to  have to look at the !  Thank you.  I have one question. Has one  agency taken the lead on the  diversion dam area?  when you say the lead?  I don'  t know it'  s just a big cooperative effort.  everyone'  s responsible for their own part  and defining that is going to come  down to by the foot. Butte county has claimed responsibility for the  diversion structures themselves and  the levies. In the 70s the department of water resources legal council made a  finding that the sediment deposits upstream a diversion structure that are  caused by that diversion structure are the responsibility of the agency  maintaining that diversion structure. That was a legal finding in the 70s  against the local maintaining agencies. If Butte County is  going to have to fight that, they could. At this point they don'  t have the appetite for that and they'  re moving forward towards a sediment removal project. We'  re already asking ourselves how far away from the diversion structure is that?  Is that 100 feet, 200 feet, past the pedestrian bridge? What are the impacts?  That kind of discussion that you'  re bringing up is actively happening. We meet with DWR. We'  re going to provide all of the agreements and memos and everything we  can find from the 60s, 70s and up to today. They'  re going to look at all their stuff and make a legal finding as to who'  s responsible for what.  We'  re going to make sure the  Rules out the  technical technical It is because you can nothing's been done there for 20 years, right?  technical  technical  And and back to this presentation for better or worse the park fire burn scar exacerbated that it really focused the attention because now  And you can see the implications right a two-year storm had a 10-year flow five-year storm had a 50-year flow  So it's not linear and that a 10-year storm would be a hundred but it is still a 10-year storm is gonna have like  An 80-year flow if we get a 25-year storm, we might see flows that would exceed what we consider a hundred year flow  So each time we go ahead. I'm sorry  I know that tree removals they've been doing a lot of tree removal  So I think did that probably help it seemed like that that there was an immediacy about about that process  So it seems like maybe that  You didn't see the big trees coming down the big burn trees  Used it didn't look like it. So absolutely all of the watershed protections were very well  Very well done and well received also butte county got out there before this season and cleared vegetation in five mile  As much as they could  I !  So that they did make an attempt this past season which helped every little thing helped  Okay, thank you very much for your report is so informative. So interesting one last question as  As vegetation regrows in the burn area the multiplier effect will immediately  Diminish that's correct. And the the word report indicates it should be two to three to four years  I think the big question at least in my mind is we haven't had those  Debris flow thresholds or also, you know torrential downpour  So once we have that we you know as much as  We want rain this season  I'm praying we don't get it to rent late season  torrential rain for because that would dislodge a lot of things that we hadn't seen and cause some impacts that we're not quite used to so  If we can get through this season with another light soaking  I think next season that impacts will hopefully be less and we'll observe the same thing and that the whole goal for us is this work  Team report they were just at the Palisades fire  They basically go to burn scar after burn scar and make these models and so they work with us continuously to refine their model  So that's why we're gonna say okay year one. Here's what we saw year two  Here's what we saw and are there efforts to regrow the area to reseed it? I don't know. That's a good question  That sort of was my question  Some of these fires burn hot enough that they sterilize the soil  Has anybody made gone up there and made any observations about where there is any natural?  revegetation of that area I  Mean anecdotally, I was just an upper park and there seems to be quite a bit of green growth  I haven't gone to the upper watershed and some of those high burn  areas  You know  like this one  The upper right I don't know about that one but in general I mean my experience is that it is it is coming back  Okay  any more questions  Okay, thank you very much for the presentation mr. King  Okay  Moving on to reports and communications  item 6.1 the  Park division report  Thank You chair Willis. This is a verbal report only  This can go through some of the highlights since the last time we got together  Last year to let you know through our community cleanups we did  over  403 tons of trash were removed from city properties that included our parks and greenways so  down from the previous year, but still  s a lot of trash 403 tons there.  In our annual volunteer hours for 2024 we reached 19,092 hours.  In our parks and greenways and that equates to nearly $740,000 worth of contributed labor from our volunteers so kudos to our volunteers.  Something that I'  m worked with the police department to bring back was our.  The  Park rangers.  We received 80 calls for service reports for our park rangers.  I will be updating you monthly on how many calls for service our rangers have received and the results of those.  In January they received 80 calls for service and responded to those they issued no citations but did make eight arrests.  To address the rangers the question of where we are with our third ranger.  Park ranger mendez is currently in the process of getting a call from the park rangers.  second week or phase two of his field training.  If there'  s no extensions for  performance issues and he successfully passes his field training program he will be off training in about mid-May.  We'  re looking forward to getting that third ranger in the park.  As commissioner narva mentioned earlier we'  re able to attend a presentation at pv high  school for the partnership between pv  chico high fairview high and rotary for the amazing work the students have been doing for whimsical types of signage they'  re going to be placing on the newly constructed cape  rakers fence which I'  m hoping is pretty ambitious but I'  m hoping that will be installed by the fall of this year and then we'  ll be able to get those structures put up on the fence they'  re pretty amazing these students have done some incredible work.  Looking forward to sharing more with you about that.  Speaking of cape rakers we recently received a $50,000 donation to go towards the rehabilitation of birthday of ring 2  specifically from terria and gloria to saints.  We'  re very thankful for that.  With that to elaborate a little bit more on potential road closures or the status of that is we'  Thank you.  Thank you.  I wanted to take an opportunity to update the commission on some council level discussion on closing both south park drive and peterson memorial drive to vehicular traffic.  I applaud commissioners, previous commissioners that looked into this in the reconstruction really of south park drive and peterson drive in early 2023.  A lot of discussion at the commission level over  We had multiple meetings.  Staff presented the headway transportation circulation report which addressed some circulation issues in lower park and made a handful of really good recommendations.  A lot of recommendations actually that could act as council member mentioned earlier can act as a road map if you will for the next three to five or three to seven years on what we should do.  We don'  t have a lot of  We have a lot of good ideas in there.  We have implemented a handful as far as way finding signage already.  Reduce the speed limit on both roads.  And some commissioners may remember the it was due to the reconstruction schedule of both south park and peterson drive.  The payment is in a failed state.  So we'  ve identified both roads to be reconstructed.  So the park commission previously really focused on the lower park area from one mile to canada.  We have a lot of good ideas on the caper acres where there'  s a lot of vehicle traffic  because vehicles need to access both the one mile parking lot, sycamore ball fields and then of course caper acres.  We even met on site as mentioned and I think there was probably 30 or so stakeholders in the audience neighbors and park goers.  I met with our engineering team who is responsible for the design of that.  And really looked at several different options that the headway report recommended for that particular area.  One of those options was to be able to  be able to be able to be a shared bike path.  A bi-directional bike path.  A separated bike path.  There'  s a handful in the park commission landing on alternative number one which was a bike path attached to the existing roadway.  Bi-directional bike path but separated or delineated by rumble strip.  But that particular bike path as you enter the main entrance off of cypress due to the width requirements it would widen south park drive significantly to accommodate that part of the road.  So the idea was to be able to be a shared bike path and give us extra space.  Would delineate or detach if you will from south park drive and meander through some of the trees to do our the least amount of tree removal possible.  Because of adding that bike path and the width it was going to impact trees.  And especially in lower park they'  re large very old very established valley oaks.  We did not want to take any of those trees out.  So the commission gave staff and the  engineering staff the direction to design that with separating the bike path to minimize the impact on the environment specifically any trees.  Reattach it as you get past the one mile entrance and then have that rumble strip from that area all the way to caper acres.  And so due to the widening of south park drive in that area it triggers a full environmental review and a much more intensive design.  So at the time engineering advised okay we'  re going to do this.  re going to design it now and look at the environmental review process and come back in June of this year to give recommendations for the commission to hear that and ultimately council.  Peterson memorial drive was a replacement in kind.  So no environmental review we'  re just going to grind up pulverize the asphalt.  Add a concrete treatment to it regrade it and use the existing grinding as base.  Trying to do everything as environmental responsible as we can.  And use that grinding material so we don'  t have to truck it out.  And truck a new aggregate base using the existing.  So we'  re recycling that asphalt and then coming over with a new coat of asphalt to reestablish and repave the road.  So due to that it was replacement in kind.  It'  s scheduled peterson memorial drive is scheduled for reconstruction this summer.  So that'  s going to take place.  The original intent was to come back with a design for south park drive.  Get a recommendation and then go full fledged in the design and reconstruct the road.  We took the technical technical technical  technical  technical  technical  technical  technical !  technical  council understanding that there  is an intent to allow  engineering to come back first  with their recommendations before  we tackle the vehicular issue  upon further direction from  council they wanted that to come  back sooner in the context of  the road closures because we  could address those now.  We spoke and brought that item  back to the council and we  had a robust discussion about  it.  Council really made the  recommendation to consider the  design that engineering is  working on now without allowing  vehicle traffic at all and would  that change the design where we  could keep it a replacement in  kind there would be no  environmental impacts because  we'  re not widening the road  we would have to establish  access points for one mile six  sycamore it'  s already there but we  would make sure that stays there  improve the parking area and  establish an access point for  sycamore field currently one does  not exist from woodland and  establish an access point for  caper acres where currently it'  s only an exit access point so  we have to make that  bidirectional at woodland you  have three access points for  Council's plan was to leave  peterson memorial drive open to  vehicle traffic because of the  picnic sites on that side there'  s 27 on peterson and 13 on south  park drive.  Council moved to come back at  the they asked us to come back  at the 18th March 18th meeting  with recommendations to close  south park drive and peterson  We are also leaving south park  drive open to vehicular traffic  for access issues to those three  areas that I mentioned from  cypress the cypress avenue  entrance all the way to caper  acres.  We have the ability to close  both south park drive and  peterson memorial drive in the  preferred locations now with our  current gating system. On March  4 we'  re going to come back with  three items for council to review  and approve. The first one is to  close south park drive from after  caper acres all the way to  manzanita all the way to  centennial if you will and then  close peterson drive the second  item will be close peterson drive  to vehicular traffic and this is  on weekends and national holidays  they both will remain open to  vehicular traffic during the week  we will be keeping we'  re bringing  it back with three items because  the conversation can get very  confusing on where the closures  are and what type of closures  there are. The third item we'  re going to ask council to  consider on March 4 is keeping  south park drive open from the  cypress entrance all the way to  caper acres but allowing  engineering time to consider as  an option the design without  the !  the action that was given by  council and one of the  re going to include in that is  to come back in six months with  a full report on how it went.  Council wants that before we  start reconstruction of south park  drive likely in july of this  summer. We'  re going to close them to  vehicular traffic weekends and  national holidays until july and  then bring back a condition  report if you will to council on  how it went.  It'  s a lot of information. We  discussed it a lot and we are  discussed it a lot at the  commission level back in 2023  but I wanted to make sure you  were aware this has been an  accelerated conversation at the  council level and it'  s going to be  discussed again and finalized at  the march 4 meeting coming up  quickly and it will be a six  month trial until july and we  will make a full recommendation  from there that way council can  consider the design plans for  south park drive and then we will  make a decision right before the  reconstruction starts for peterson.  any questions?  first did you do that from  memory because that was really  impressive?  I did.  I'  ve talked about it a lot lately  so it'  s fresh thank you.  I want to recommend that somehow  we get the new commissioners that  headway transportation report I  think that'  s a great  be great for them to see.  that was really my only comment  thank you for that synopsis.  I'  m glad this is an accelerated  thing because it was going to  happen in 2024 and then it is  2025.  one thing I wanted to emphasize  again and I know I said this to  you before is that one of the  recommendations in the headway ! !  Exit out of the park on to  woodland on to val  ambrosa with intersections right  now that'  s going to take  some fence closure and then those  need to be realigned which is what  they recommended and striped for  pedestrians right now there'  s a few little exits that  just kind of jet out in the middle  of nowhere and I'  m surprised we haven'  t had an accident truthfully.  I think that was my only comment but  I think we did recommend two I  don'  t even think we took into  consideration the cars we just  assumed when cars were there they  were going to drive over whatever  delineation we had decided upon but  we recommended the roads split in  two pedestrians on one side cyclists  on the other side rumble strip in  the middle and two way traffic so  that we won'  t have that intersection of  pedestrians and cyclists that are  currently it'  s a mess and I  don'  t pay attention to the one way traffic  anyway but that'  s what we  recommended split in half pedestrians  one side cyclists the other side two  way traffic so I don'  t remember that being discussed and  what I read in the paper was not  consistent with that recommendation I  don'  t think but anyway.  I think it added the  vehicular traffic as well.  We didn'  t even consider that we just  figured the cars drive over they'  re  going to be able to fit in either lane  if you have it we have the road split  in half the car is going to be bigger  than the lane we have delineated for  either one of those lanes.  Mr.  Pedestrians or  bicycles.  That'  s what I remember we discussed.  Thank you.  I had a question for shanes  but I think commissioner  holland.  I do have questions for eric I  also had one for shane too.  I need some clarification on what  you'  re saying and I have a  recommendation when it does go  back I'  m really bummed it'  s that day because I was told it  would be the latter part of March  I'  ll be gone the first one.  When they were discussing it when  they discussed south park drive I  think it'  s critical for  council especially to articulate  s important to be  hyper specific about that and when  they were saying closure because a lot  of times they were not precise about  that.  It was confusing some of the people  saying it'  s from cyprus the whole way and  then of course people are panicking  like I play baseball and all of that.  I heard you saying it sounded like the  impact would be on the closure would be  from cape breakers forward.  The other point of clarification I  am looking for is when you'  re discussing the ingress  egress kind of situation specifically  at caper acres I wanted to ask you  does it look like when your staff  were leaning into what that could  look like the first way you go into  caper acres and not having them come  that second way and making it a  true up where it'  s bidirectional in just one  location or are you perceiving two  dump outs right there?  that'  s a great question commissioner  I'  ask the commissioner that will be  flushed out through engineering design  I think they will analyze the best way  forward whether that'  s a one way  throughput where there'  s an entrance point to caper  acres and you exit to keep traffic  flowing through or does it make more  sense to establish one entrance one  bidirectional ingress egress  entrance at one point.  then the other point I was going  to make was the note that the other  commissioner made was the true up  to the intersection so I appreciated  that being raised because that is  why I also asked about caper acres  because that would be true of that  as well if it does move down it would  be more at where that joint of  seventh and woodland come together  where it makes sense to go.  people do tend to take if design  could take into consideration coming  out of the park at that existing  caper acres where you come out onto  woodland people take a very wide  turn and almost broadside people I  also think that the  s not a great turn for folks and  m surprised somebody hasn'  t been hurt because it'  s not a great intuitive turn for  folks and they also get confused and  think they can get on the freeway and  so they frequently go left.  anyway if I had my druthers I  would say the earlier entrance just  so it true up.  then the other one I wanted to make  sure on the  second one I want to mention the  sycamore field I get that one that  would be also a bi-directional that  would dump out onto woodland would  open is what your initial thoughts.  correct.  the third one were you saying  the actual one mile sycamore pool  and that it would because that'  s existing already  bi-directional.  existing that' s existing we  would just improve it.  three total.  I' ll hold my question for shane so she can go ahead and do her  question.  I think the first one is  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  they wanted what'  s going to  happen on March 4 is  consideration to close south  park drive vehicle traffic  weekends and national holidays  from caper acres to centennial  peterson drive on weekends and  national holidays but leave the  cypress entrance open to caper  acres so vehicles can still  access those areas until  engineering comes back early  go to the volunteer hours you  mentioned Mr. Romain. My very  scrawled notes say 19,000  volunteer hours were worked in  the park last year?  yes.  19,092.  I know there are a lot of  individuals who come out on  their own and volunteer but I  wonder if we have some  resources that we can use to  facilitate those volunteer  hours. I always feel it'  s important to recognize our  community partners and so I  don'  t know who those might be but  I would love to know who to  thank that helps organize their  employees or their volunteers  to help our park.  of course just right off the  bat chico bell trail works we  work very closely with them.  Just this last Saturday they  hosted a volunteer training  session. Half of it being in  class and half of it being in  the field. They have done  hundreds and hundreds of hours  of volunteer work in upper park  on the trails. We make sure we  do acknowledge our partners and  every year with our volunteer  program we do recognition  barbecue. We make sure the  kudos are out there. I would be  happy to provide you more  information on that.  I will be happy to provide you  Mr. Romain do those trash  numbers include homeless impacts?  Mr. Yes. Those community  cleanups that'  s primarily when we go into  the impacted areas from  encampments and city staff has  removed the debris that'  of years after we have done our  enforcement efforts.  they'  re down because we'  ve had fewer homeless  people in the park?  Mr. Will the rebuilding of  the roads change the  recommendations for closures?  no. As far as vehicular  traffic?  No. I think the intent is still  working on that. We will be  working on south park drive to  make sure is it better off to  keep it the same size and  replacing kind so we don'  t have to go through the  whole environmental process  widen the road that'  s more costly and designing  that now will be different  recognizing the vehicles may  not be allowed on south park  drive moving forward.  Mr. The closures are  safety issues exclusively?  Mr. Correct.  can I clarify one thing for  the new commissioners when shane  is giving you volunteer hours  and amounts of trash these are  not just from bidwell park  they'  re from all the city  parks. On my last report that  I have here it lists bidwell  ave, mlk, rio londo bike path  I'  m sorry I'  m not sure what that  Mr. Comanche creek.  Mr. I'  m listing a few.  Just to get you orientated that'  s not just bidwell park it'  s all the city parks.  Mr. Parks and greenways.  Mr. Parks and greenways.  Mr. Thank you.  Mr. Ms. Nadeau.  Ms. For shane and  then I have a wrap-up for  Mr. Nadeau you have been a  little stuffy lately were you  saying that'  s across the board for  not just for the specific  acres plan but for parks in  general or was it hyper specific  to that?  Mr. That is hyper specific  to the renovation of birthday  donations from an anonymous  donor to go towards that fence  construction.  We have received some truly  generous donations for the  caper acres renovation effort  this year.  Ms. Just back to Eric I  will say this on the closure  situation because it was a  little rough for me as being on  commission that we were told this  would bounce back to us and then  go back out.  It was a little preempted and so  then we didn'  t get to have  additional discussion after you  guys were going to come back and  clarify some of the questions we  all had because there was a very  robust conversation as you alluded  to over multiple meetings.  I just want to be on record that  I am concerned about the disabled  individuals and I think that it  is very easy to say we'  re going to create additional  egress points like around peterson  on the weekends and the holidays  and also on the opposite side.  I get there'  s more picnic  spots maybe that people think of  when they think of peterson and  the weddings and such.  I think people are forgetting the  impact to disabled individuals  and frequently elderly people  who are accommodating their  partners to try to carry coolers  and all the accoutrements that you  have along with you for picnics is  issue for people and I get that  for able bodied people they'  like they can just do this or  push it in a wheelchair alongside  them. I have worked in that  industry and it is difficult just  even having sometimes shopping  bags that exceed the storage  under and I'  m very concerned I hear a lot of  people talking about usage on the  weekends and such and that'  s when they drive elderly folks  I would encourage people to attend  that meeting in the hopes they  have one last hurrah to be heard  from about their concerns about  that I do appreciate they'  re saying  they'  ll try to make openings and  have exceptions but then to step  through those things and call  people out for their disabilities  and have them have to preplan to  ask for some kind of exemption or  I don'  t know what the plan and where they would come in. There'  lot of work to be done on that and just as a tack on the  capturing of action items has been something we'  ve all discussed before that we get  concerned that we go forward on the  meetings and we want to make sure it'  s a great timing since you'  ve taken over shane and I'  m really thrilled for you again.  But to make sure since we can'  t ask for agenda items that they be  stated very overtly as was alluded to  earlier and I don'  t know how we can do that  mechanism to where we all have that  at the corporate level that we won'  t drop a ball such as jordan  forte coming back to talk again  about the progress on the way  finding idea he had and some other  things. I want to leave that with you.  reach out to me and remind me.  thank you shane.  thank you.  I can add quickly too.  I' m also sensitive to the commission'  s position as you were told you were  discussion about the design that came  out late spring early summer of this  year. We still knowing this is at  the council level now but we still  intend to at least bring that back to  the commission for you to consider it  and make a recommendation to council  for that matter and what you think would  be the best as far as the design on  that section of south park drive as it  comes forward.  thank you.  we can always go to get to  the meetings council meetings  individually but that is different.  We'  d have to speak as a  concerned citizen and not having a  debate at our commission level which  is actually very helpful and why we'  re all here. I'  m glad that it'  s going forward.  thank you.  one thing that I noticed a lack of  discussion following up on ms.  nava'  s comments. I'  m not sure whether they'  re still active but when I was in  active practice we had some very  aggressive dda attorneys who were  making a really good living bringing  litigation on questionable claims and  what you'  re talking about is on holidays  and weekends limiting access to  public health services and  as you said 27 well 50 or something  like that. Picnic areas you'  re limiting it to the able  bodied. I'  ve been out of the business for a  little while but that sounds like a  slam dunk dda suit against the city.  Has the city attorney'  s office been sought about their  question on your potential litigation  issues?  yes the city attorney'  s office is part of the council meeting  so they'  ve heard that.  ll see the recommendation going  forward and they'  ll have to continue to analyze  that and I think that might shape  ultimately the decision long term.  For now it'  s weekends and national holidays  which still allow some accessibility  during the week but recognize that  concern. Part of their task for  engineering is redesign of the south  park drive area as an alternative if  we do keep it closed to vehicles where  they'  re improving those access points  and existing parking facilities would  also be to improve ada parking  facilities.  I think that could mean some  turnout pockets on the adjacent  right of way streets woodland and  then val  ambrosia on the other side to create  some ada parking capabilities there  where they could then access those  picnic sites as they would be close by.  Part of our planning too with  10 year plan for capital projects and  roadway improvements is looking at  val ambrosia for a full improvement.  It was brought up years ago it wasn'  t the neighborhood adjacent neighborhood  t have the appetite but things  changed. Traffic counts are much higher  now. The city has over 100,000 people  in and out so things are different and  the roadway is starting to fail and  needs to be reconstructed and replaced  soon. That will be an identified project  in the coming years for design and  likely taking some of those ada features  to get a.  any other questions?  sorry as someone who had shoulder  surgery 10 days ago and I fully  understand the  issues we'  re talking about but  also there are a lot of families  there are a lot of single parents or  people caring for children who go in  and out of the park quite frequently  and as the mom of three I have become  a pack horse for my children and just  that type of I would hope in the  consideration of doing pull outs  doing ada accessible parking sites  that we really look at this from a  broad picture of the  who will be using this who does use  this and how do we make sure they  can access it when they need to the  park is such a refuge for so many  young families and older families in  our neighborhood in our city but really  young families taking a few kids to  swim in the park there'  s not much better thing  growing up in chico so hopefully we  can make sure those accessible parking  spots are for all types of park goer  rather than.  thank you.  thank you.  any more questions for either shane  or eric?  if not we will move on to our last  item street tree division report  richie bamlett.  thank you chair willis again  this is a verbal  report just to touch on the  highlights since the last time we  met.  on friday firestorm  concluded the  phase three  of park fire removals  so they finished a removal  project  which involved the removal  of 125  trees which were the most  impacted by the fire  we did get  a survey  of the fire  damage from staff at  big chico creek ecological  reserve so using that data  we generated a work order  for firestorm  and they were working on that  project for two or three weeks  things were slowed up by the  recent rain that we had  but yeah they eventually got it  all finished on friday and i  believe their equipment was being  removed today  and that paves the way for the  parks natural resource manager to  open the park so i guess there may be  an announcement coming soon so that's  good news for everyone because i know  people are very keen to get access  back to 10 mile house road  certainly the you know the mountain  bikers and  hardcore runners that you see you know  that they really want to be on that  steep slope doing their recreation  and the  technical technical technical report that you know, we do feel that the 10 mile house is a lot safer than it was three weeks ago because These trees were in pretty bad shape  technical To see how they pull through and if they've survived the fire and there may be  technical  technical  other rounds of removals as we gather more data and it may become apparent that certain trees  also need to be removed. So it's an ongoing process, but we're happy with the results that  we've had. We're really taking a conservative approach that we're not just getting too  trigger happy with the chainsaw, that we're really trying to hold back and really only remove the  ones that are clearly, you know, to any trained arborist that's familiar with fire damage, that  they're not going to pull back. There really is no point to wait to see what would happen.  We can predict with a high level of confidence that the trees will not pull through from the  fire damage. So that's something that we're happy to report. And just generally, just to give a  shout out to our tree crews, with all the recent storms we've had, they've responded to a multitude  of requests.  Phenomenally, and we've been able to keep the public right of ways open. We've had some very large  trees come down. And we were able to deal with most of them in house, even though we do have a  emergency contractor on call. I think we needed to only call them two or three times, which is  unheard of. So now the city council authorized extra budget.  So we're able to respond very quickly and with great skill to requests that we get from the public.  And in storms like what we've had, we're super impressed with the way that we were able to respond.  So big shout out to my team.  And just generally, with the contractor that we have, North Valley Arbor Management, which encompasses North Valley  trees.  We also have the technical technical technical technical technical  are on the removal work order.  And that will be followed up with stump grinding and tree planting,  which carries on the back of the current grant that we have with CAL FIRE.  That grant finishes up in the end of March this year.  So that grant was to plant 1,000 trees around town.  So we're currently up to about 930.  So we'll be making a final push with tree planting in the next six weeks.  So that's exciting.  And then just to touch on some upcoming work,  we will be doing some tree removals on Park Avenue.  And that is ahead of an engineering project,  which is tied to a transportation grant that we got from Caltrans.  So that's really just to update.  The...  the bike trail that runs from 20th Street down to East Park Avenue  on the north side of Park Avenue.  So a number of the trees that really just haven't been doing well  and really never were doing well.  So a lot of the pear trees and the crab apples that you see,  so they'll all be getting removed.  And then the next phase will involve totally upgrading the irrigation  along Park Avenue and just, you know, redoing the trees.  So they'll...  there could be up to 100 new trees going in along Park Avenue,  which is super exciting because it'll change the way Park Avenue looks  because it is...  has got a, you know, a blighted look about it.  So it'll really rejuvenate the look of Park Avenue.  And then only today, myself and other public works staff,  we had a meeting at Airpark Boulevard.  So that is now on the docket to be completely redone.  The plan is to remove all the turf and a number...  most of the trees that are currently there  and we'll just completely reboot Park Avenue,  replace the mulch, replace the turf with mulch.  We'll put in rock, you know, landscape.  It'll really give it the look that a regional airport should have.  So it's exciting to get that ball rolling.  And then finally, we've mentioned Peterson Drive.  So...  after Park Avenue is finished,  the contractor will be put onto Peterson Drive  to do end weight reduction pruning,  which is a fancy word for safety pruning,  of all the big trees from the Wallenbroser entrance  all the way down to one mile.  So just so you know,  that may actually impact vehicle access Monday to Friday.  The exact dates of that are still to be determined.  But we'll let Commission know and, you know,  we'll make sure the public's aware  if that does actually shut down traffic to vehicles.  But, you know, we'll flesh out the details of that  as it comes online.  And finally, we mentioned earlier about volunteering  and all the great work that volunteers do.  With Tree Division, we had a great partnership  just last month with Chico State.  And they're climate action ambassadors.  One weekend, about a dozen students showed up  and we did a fruit tree gleaning,  which has never been done before.  So we were very excited about that  because the city does own and look after  around about 200 fruit trees.  Like, it's a lot of fruit trees.  Mostly around South Campus  and in the downtown area.  You know, planted by Bidwell.  These are old historical citrus trees.  And really, most of the fruit just falls on the ground,  ends up in the storm drains, and is a complete waste.  So the Chico State students gleaned over 200 pounds of fruit.  And from that, it went to the Wildcat Food Pantry.  And they actually made a whole batch of marmalade from it  as well.  And they brought some into our area.  And they brought some into our office.  This is good stuff.  So if any commissioners do want some marmalade,  hit me up for that.  We'll get you some.  So this was just a pilot project.  You know, 200 pounds is a lot of citrus.  But really doesn't move the dial that much  when you look at how much we have.  So we're hoping to expand this program  and really roll it out  and really get the numbers up there.  You know, and try and glean as much of this fruit as possible.  So watch this space.  That's an exciting project.  So that's pretty much all I have.  But I'd be happy to answer any questions  any commissioners have.  Richie, I love that.  You always have just the greatest kind of new ideas.  And they also do, when a woman has a baby at Enloe,  they will deliver a tree to her newborn  so the tree can grow with the baby.  But you just always are doing these great things.  And yes, I want some marmalade.  I'll message you, too.  You got it.  Thank you for that.  And it really is sad to drive around town  and see the fruit just on the ground.  And, you know, I wish we could get some private landowners  to get involved with that, too.  Maybe that would be a consideration  if they wanted to say,  hey, let me put my address, you know, up on a list  and the Chico State students can come by  and help them out harvest.  You know, glean.  I hadn't heard that before.  But that might be something to consider, too.  So sign up and we'll come take your fruit, you know.  But thank you.  And thank you for your report, as always.  Who's paying for the park tree removal?  Is it under your emergency declaration  the federal government reimbursing the cost?  Yeah, we have a capital account  as part of our budget with Public Works  for the specifically,  for parks tree.  You're not getting federal reimbursement for it?  No.  Yes, no?  No, it's a part of the park budget.  You got anything to add?  Yeah, Commissioner Nichols, I was nodding my head.  Yes, it's a city budget.  We're not getting any federal reimbursement  or state reimbursement at this time.  Thank you.  Any other questions?  Thank you, Richie.  Is there anything else to come before I commit?  No.  No, Commissioner.  No, number seven.  If not, then we are adjourned  until March 31st at 6 o'clock here.  Thank you all for coming.  Thank you, everybody.  And I think the new commission...
