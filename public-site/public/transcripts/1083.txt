Council Member VanEck.  Any  Any  Any  Any  Any  agenda how many speakers to all right three minutes okay three minutes three  schools okay James Hutchinson followed by Paula  hair those of you who were here last meeting remember that I brought up the  right of voting and how some apartment complex and a number of others were  denied once again the right to vote for just representative two straight  elections and now this is what is going on here did any of you know that this  would be the impact of what you did you made these districting decisions because  you have a district three that's sitting there once again you got people who are  being excluded from voting that is a capital sin  you've got other  people who now apparently can vote for two different candidates different  elections so you give the right to some people to make broader decisions you  take away the right from others this is what I talked about earlier my concern  is conservatives used to be about principle they used to have a standard  you had people like William F Buckley jr. who went out into the international  waters and spoke  cannabis to find out what it was like because he had opposed him and said it  was no worse than the cocktails I have in the afternoon therefore I see no  reason to outlaw you have people like Barry Goldwater who sat there and said  hey look on the abortion issue yeah abortion should be legal but the  government shouldn't pay for it they stood on principle in this case our  rights are being taken from us again once again if you look at the Enterprise  Record endorsement  Did anyone read it?  Because it starts off right away.  The outcome of these first district-based elections were stunning,  especially considering Democrats held a registration advantage in some of these areas.  Last I heard, city council elections were about nonpartisan politics.  What you believe.  Putting it out there on the table and letting people judge that based not on your party,  but on your beliefs and what you laid out there.  Just for the record, I am neither a Republican nor a Democrat.  I don't volunteer at those two parties.  Just to make it clear, I'm not speaking for one agenda or another.  I'm a little bit tired of seeing elections where people are excluded.  Go back and if you have people who haven't looked at what happened last meeting,  go back and see the video online.  Clark does an excellent job of putting it there most of the time.  And it's there.  See what was said.  See what we're doing.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Paula Hare, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Okay.  You all know who I am anyway.  Of course, this is probably the last time you've seen each other.  Hopefully voting will take care of that problem.  Got a lot of problem down there at Tegger,  on that little pond at Chico.  We've had shootings, divings, all kinds of stuff.  We've got a boat out there in the middle of it by itself.  And they're deserted.  Moving them both.  Probably stolen.  Could be a body in it.  Who knows?  Somebody needs to check it out.  I've tried getting people to check it out.  Nobody wants to do it.  So, since you all know about it now,  and if it doesn't get checked out in a couple weeks from now,  somebody finds a body out there in it,  I don't know you weren't doing your job.  You said you picked up the garbage down there.  That big garbage pile that's back there?  It's still there.  But you told all the people at Chico,  even on Fox News, that you picked it up.  You didn't.  Did we get billed for picking it up, us as citizens?  There's a lot of garbage down there.  You got over at Window Channel,  you got a lot of campers over there on the channel.  Some out in the middle of the channel,  they're gonna get flooded out in the first rain,  we get.  You got some that are building shacks,  actual buildings,  alongside their tents.  I'm sure they didn't go to code  and pay to build some structures like that,  but I'm sure you're all allowing it all to happen  for whatever reason.  It's not a very good reason,  no matter what,  because we got plenty of housing for people.  And it makes no sense what we see when we go through there.  When they go and they pick up all those needles,  it's something else.  I'd like to get into the pond area and fish,  but I can't, of course.  Wouldn't want to keep anything,  there's all the pollution now in it.  It's a real shame that we had beaver back there,  and we had otter,  and we had kingfishers.  You don't see any of that stuff anymore.  They made sure their campers killed all that off.  We had good wildlife.  We had a good spot in Chico for us elderly to go and fish,  and look at birdwatch and stuff.  Now we ain't got nothing.  We just got a bunch of crooks back there trying to kill each other.  So we're not going to get any of that stuff back.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Our final speaker is Jessica Giannullo.  Hi, Council.  Thank you for taking my card.  First off, I want to advocate again for our accepting cards  after we've started,  specifically for this kind of instance  where someone may be coming in seconds later  and would still like to speak before the Council.  That's why we come here.  Also opening up our meetings to Zoom or call  so that people at home who cannot come here  would like to participate.  Okay.  That's something that our Council does have control over.  I keep asking for it.  I'm hoping we move towards that sometime in the near future.  Another thing that I wanted to bring to the attention of the Council  is, in case you hadn't seen it in the news,  was another shooting out of Tiger Ponds.  And this is the second one in almost exactly a year.  And people are dying.  They're being killed because they're targeted  because of the rhetoric that happens to the community.  The rhetoric in the community sees people  who are homeless as being different from us, not from here.  They are from here.  They are people.  Whether they came here last year, last week, 10 years ago,  it doesn't matter.  They're human beings.  So that rhetoric leads to how they're treated and killed.  So that's just something to keep in mind  when we're making our public statements about who's  in our parks, neighborhoods, who needs to go, who doesn't.  Let's see.  I had a third.  Oh, yeah.  I was just echoing with what James  was saying with that recognizing the voter participation.  Those phone calls play a difference.  They make that difference.  And I'm just going to go ahead and wrap up.  And another piece that intertwines,  I just want to say with the rhetoric, too.  I think we all care about our community.  We all do.  We just seem to approach things a little differently  or see things a little differently.  And I don't know anyone who wants  to see people living in parks or anyone who  wants to see our waterways poisoned  or stuff going into our waterways or fires happening.  I think we all care about our community very much.  And it's nice to be able to see the truth out there instead  of maybe misleading lies.  So just putting that out there.  Thank you so much.  She was our last speaker.  All right.  Let's move on to public hearings.  Hearing ordering the abandonment and vacation  of public utility easements in the vicinity of the Bar  Triangle.  And we have Director of Public Works.  Good evening, Councillors.  My name is Matt Johnson.  I'm Matt Johnson.  I'm Matt Johnson.  I am working in the engineering department  and here on behalf of Leanne Sutton, our engineering  director tonight.  What you have before you is a second meeting  having to do with abandonment.  The first one is an intent giving notice  to the public and any interested party  of abandoning this easement.  So now is the order to go ahead and do it.  I'm sure you're aware of the background that this,  abandonment will support a affordable housing project.  The easement was created, I think it was February 1984.  So long, long time ago.  So now as we're developing that property,  there's no really need for that easement.  We obtained permission from each of the four utility companies  that they would agree to abandon that.  So I'm here to answer any questions you might have.  And hopefully you'll vote in favor of it.  All right, questions?  Thank you.  That was easy.  Thank you.  All right, we'll open the public hearing.  How many speakers?  We do not have any.  All right, we'll close the public hearing,  entertain a motion.  I'll second that.  A motion from Vice Mayor Rounds, a second from Council Member .  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Here we go.  Are you .  Yes.  .  Hold on just a second.  All right.  A little bit of a surprise.  Sorry.  Okay, item 5.2, ratification.  Oh, sorry, 5.1, consideration of temporary downtown parklets.  And we have a report from Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCarthy.  Welcome.  Thank you.  Good morning, everyone.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good evening.  Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the Council, Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy  City Manager, here today to talk about the status of parklets in our downtown.  As you know, when COVID hit and businesses shut down, the city moved at rapid speed to  make sure that we were there assisting our businesses so that they could keep serving  the needs of the public.  And one way we did that was through a number of executive orders.  One of those executive orders is number 2020-003, and that was the establishment of temporary  parklets to allow for outdoor dining.  In terms of time periods moving forward from there, our Internal Affairs Committee of the  Council met last month to discuss the status of parklets.  It was their recommendation to adopt a temporary ordinance to allow for the temporary parklets  to continue until such time as a comprehensive ordinance could be created, because otherwise,  what happens with the executive order is once the COVID emergency is terminated, which is  December 1st of 2022.  Okay.  So, the temporary, the allowing of the temporary parklets goes away.  So, just for those that need a little refresher on our permanent infrastructure improvements  downtown versus our temporary parklets, we've got a couple of pictures up there that show  you.  The temporary parklets are those around town that you see with the temporary K-rail.  We have them at restaurants such as the Banshee and Momona and others downtown.  It's created a lot of lively activity in our downtown area during COVID.  When we really needed those businesses to be able to continue to meet the needs of our  public.  In addition to that, we have permanent infrastructure improvements that are also allowed in our  downtown area.  Examples of those are things that you see like here is Tres Hombres, but you can also  find those permanent improvements at other restaurants such as the Raw Bar, for example.  This shows you an example of where these parklets are located.  The temporary parklets are shown in blue.  We have seven permitted temporary parklets and six that are operating.  So, we have a lot of temporary parklets.  Many  of  these  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  cutting  working through what the design of an actual temporary parklet would ultimately be,  one that is safe, one that is aesthetically pleasing in our downtown area,  working through what that design would look like, getting those final cost estimates.  And as you remember, the council has allocated towards the parklet program previously $300,000,  of which $39,000 went towards design.  We've only spent a small portion of that currently.  And the remaining was to go towards the assistance of construction and implementation.  So when looking at start to finish of the steps that would be involved,  Director Sutton anticipates that it would be approximately six to nine months to walk through that process.  So again, the Internal Affairs recommendation last month was to adopt a temporary ordinance  that would allow temporary parklets until a permanent, more comprehensive ordinance could be created for a community.  So staff looked.  We looked into that and we just wanted to bring to your attention kind of a couple of issues that we found with that.  The most, the highest level of issue really being the timing.  So if we were to go through a process to develop a temporary ordinance and then a comprehensive ordinance,  we really would not be able to get that temporary ordinance in place before the COVID emergency is terminated, which is December 1st.  In addition, you'd be spending the cost of doing a temporary ordinance as well as a comprehensive ordinance,  because there is noticing that's involved.  There's multiple readings of the ordinance that needs to go forward.  One option that the Council could consider if you are not interested in the temporary to a comprehensive is to just go directly into a comprehensive ordinance.  Those again, those steps that I outlined previously would take about six to nine months  with the realization that there would be a period when parklets are technically not authorized in the public right-of-way.  And then certainly the other option is to take no action.  If no action is taken,  the executive order that allows the temporary parklets would be terminated when the local COVID emergency is terminated,  and that would be December 1st of 2022.  So with that, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I actually have a question.  Okay.  Hi there.  This, the temporary parklet situation is not replacing the temporary parklet.  Is that the permanent, the 14.70 ordinance, is it?  It does not, no.  Okay.  The permanent.  I wasn't quite sure.  Yes.  Thank you for making that clarification.  The permanent infrastructure remains in place, and the ability to do that is still in our code, and it still will remain.  A temporary parklet ordinance, it's funny because of the words, but the comprehensive ordinance, they'd still allow for, they'd be considered temporary,  because they are not permanent infrastructure improvements.  They're temporary by nature.  Okay.  But the benefit, as I see it, would be that it would be far more aesthetically pleasing.  It would be actually designed by an architectural group, so we'd have something more pleasing to look at.  Is that correct?  That was the intent, and Vice Mayor Reynolds can probably elaborate on that because of the conversation we had during an internal affairs committee.  Okay.  Thank you.  I think she had a question.  I'm not sure if I need to elaborate on that, but I just want to bring up, before we go into public comment, one of the big rubs on this, Jen, you're not, wait, hold on, this is you.  I know that there was a letter sent out for voluntary compliance of anybody that wanted their parklets picked up.  Could you advise us who took advantage of that and who did it?  I believe the mayor did, but maybe somebody else did.  And can you tell us how many parking spots are currently being taken up by parklets?  Because obviously the conversation for, I don't know.  I don't know, a thousand years downtown has been parking spots or somewhere to tie up your horse or whatever it was a thousand years ago.  Sure.  Yeah, parking spots are a big deal.  So how many parking spots are parklets taking up right now?  So first to the letter, staff did send out a letter to all individuals that have temporary parklets to let them know if you're not using them right now, the city, free of charge, would come and take away the K rail and help bring it back to its original condition.  We were contacted by the mayor and public works department was working with them in terms of the removal of that parklet.  And  And  And  And  And  And .  And . . . . .  And  to 42 parking spaces?  Yeah.  You're welcome.  Any other questions?  All right. Thank you.  Okay. Speakers?  We have three.  All right. Three minutes.  Okay. First speaker is Greg Scott  followed by Audrey Taylor.  You called me first.  I thought I was  I thought I was  Mr. Mayor, Council,  City staff,  my name is Greg Scott.  And while I agree with almost everything  Jen said,  my position  in this as a restaurant owner and a business  owner in downtown Chico is we all  were impacted by COVID.  Restaurants, obviously all the way down  from outdoor dining, closing  indoor outdoor dining to takeout service.  And you're right.  There's only six.  There are only I walked it yesterday.  There are only six outdoor parklets operating now.  Five.  If it's really if you look at it because I don't count  Duffy's just outdoor dining, but  we already have ordinances in place.  I'm an engineer.  I would not design or try to design an architectural,  more aesthetically pleasing parklet.  I don't think traffic engineers or civil engineers,  mechanical engineers,  that's not their strong suit.  I don't think we should be spending more city money chasing  something that doesn't make sense.  None of the current parklets are ADA compliant.  Zero.  That's going to cause a problem.  I think most of them are safety hazards.  Probably most of them are traffic hazards.  Yesterday, our governor announced that in February 23 is going to eliminate  California stop California's emergency order.  What's the ABC going to do?  Because you can't walk out.  You can't walk out of a door across the public right of way  into a parklet with an open container.  All I see is problems coming up with this.  You refer to them as K rails on the East Coast.  We call them Jersey barriers.  It's I'm sorry, but it's like putting lipstick on a pig.  At the end of the day, you still have a pig.  There are processes in place.  If people want to have outdoor dining, which I am totally in favor of,  let them go.  Let them go through this process.  Just let them go through.  I think you, Mr. Bennett, 14.0.  I think that's what we should do.  And that's where I'll leave it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Audrey Taylor, followed by Doug Roberts.  Obviously, my new hearing aids aren't working to do that.  Audrey Taylor, president of Chabon Concepts and volunteer for DCBA.  I'm here on behalf of DCBA and also the DCBA restaurant committee.  And we recently formed a restaurant committee so that we could make sure  that we're listening to our restaurants downtown.  And we do want to thank the council for the swift action of doing the  parklets during the emergency.  It was extremely important to the survival of some of these businesses as  well as downtown.  We believe that the emergency is over and that option two or option three,  seems to be most appropriate and let that go by the wayside so that we can  recapture those parking spaces that are so desperately needed downtown,  particularly in the month of December.  December is going to be a very busy month for downtown.  We have many activities going on, particularly the ice rink,  where last year we had over 20,000 people visiting the ice rink,  which was amazing.  And just recently over the art and wine,  we can the wildcat weekend and harvest Saturday.  We probably had 10,000 people downtown with close to half of those being  visitors from outside of town,  attending CSU Chico for their parents weekend and the alumni weekend.  So it's very important that we have an aesthetic downtown.  Now we also want those restaurants that have the temporary ones.  We would love for them to have outside dining.  And however,  we can make that,  we want to participate with that.  I agree with Greg that you have a process in place that we could follow.  How do we work with our businesses to make sure that they follow those?  And we have an aesthetic looking downtown and ensure that the businesses that  do want outdoor dining habit,  and it looks good for downtown,  that it is safe.  Um, the members of DCBA,  the restaurant committees are all willing to work closely with the city on  getting this to move forward.  And we would encourage you to,  I think,  look at both option two and three.  Let this sunset remove those temporary ones for now.  Let's go through our process,  make sure we have the right designs.  We're meeting all the right codes and have an aesthetic looking downtown.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Doug Roberts. [inaudible]  Yeah.  My name is Doug Roberts.  I own a Duffy's tavern and the building that holds  Duffy's tavern.  And I really hope that you guys go ahead with trying to adopt an ordinance  to allow the park list to stay.  The money came from a,  A nursing home.  grant. Was it a federal grant?  The $300,000.  So, you know,  the money's already there. It's been there for over a year.  I think that  it would be great to  upgrade the parklets. I think it's  not difficult to make them ADA compliant.  Plenty of other cities have done the same  thing. And I think  since the money's there, the design  is almost already there.  I hope that you guys  recommend going ahead  and allowing it to continue.  It's been extremely  helpful for my business  since the implementation  of it. And I also thank the city  for allowing us to go ahead and do  it. It was great  because it happened, you know,  ran through the city, ran through the  planning department  and all that stuff. They allowed us to  move quickly and  you know, construct  what we did. And I've been waiting  for  hoping that the money would come  because I agree with probably everyone  they are definitely an eyesore as is  but we've got  all kinds of examples from  tons of different cities who still  have their parklets and they actually do  look good because they  you know, they design them  more aesthetically pleasing and  I also think you can keep them  you can keep a kind of a unity  between all the different  parklets as far as the aesthetic.  I just really  hope that you consider  keeping them  as long as possible. Thanks.  Mr. Roberts, I actually have a question for you.  You might know the answer too because I know you obviously  deal with ABC so in terms  of the outlet, you know, crossing  the public right-of-way  deliver drinks or something of that nature.  Yeah, so that is a good  question because it's part  of the temporary  you know, the emergency  declaration  I guess you'd call it. And so yeah,  I think . .  . .         .     . .        . . .  . . . .  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  If the city allows it, but the ABC doesn't allow it, we're nowhere.  Right.  So that might be the place to start.  Okay. Thank you.  Thank you.  Ms. McCarthy, do you know the answer to that question?  Okay.  Because, I mean, I think how many of these are bars that serve alcohol?  Or, I mean, they're probably all establishments that serve alcohol, but some of them are.  Or Banshee and Duffy's obviously are more.  The Banshee, Duffy's.  Alcohol forward.  Bear. I'm not sure if Mom spills alcohol.  Yeah, they do.  Does.  Yeah.  All of them.  All of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some of them are drink forward, though.  I mean, you know, Banshee and I think Duffy's are probably the two that come to mind that they're more alcohol focused than they are meal focused.  Not to take away from Banshee's food.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is amazing.  Yeah, yeah. It's really good.  Okay.  So, anything further from council?  Questions? Discussion?  I have a question or a follow-up for Ms. McCarthy.  To dovetail on what was just said, the $300,000, that would be split amongst all of the potential applicants that we have.  And do we have an approximate cost on?  I think we have an approximate cost on what it's going to cost to build because from the small amount that I've been hearing, seeing that what the city has might not even cover a quarter of the cost.  So, the business owner would likely be out a large sum of money.  So, it's not like what we have is going to build everybody parklets.  So, could you clarify that?  Certainly.  And that will need to be part of the program that we determine how exactly that money is spent.  As we're working through the design process right now, they're expensive.  Especially when you consider putting in ADA improvements.  And making sure that they're accessible as well as the city would want to have that anyways.  We want to have those improvements done.  So, they could be some communities are coming in as low as $30,000 and others communities are over a million dollars.  And once we get a final design together, we can get those cost estimates.  But even with the amount of funds that the council has allocated, which was $300,000, we will have after we get the total design cost done.  You'll have $200,000.  $261,000.  So, I do believe in internal affairs, we talked about opportunities to maybe develop a grant program where we could assist.  People could apply.  And we could assist businesses with that cost.  But it will not cover 100% of those costs.  I know it wouldn't be 100%.  But, wow, that's.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  So, I have another question.  Mr. Morgan, do you have a question?  Okay.  So, well, first off, just for clarification.  So, I'm asking.  I'm asking a rhetorical question.  All this money came from the federal government in terms of the COVID.  That is correct.  The $300,000 that was allocated was part of the American Rescue Plan allocation.  So, I just want to make sure the public understands.  It's not general fund monies.  The second question I had is on.  At the last meeting when we ended our COVID, you know, declaration.  It said that anything set forth in those executive orders had 180 days.  And then another 180 days.  After that?  That was only one of the executive orders.  Okay.  And that was in regarding to planning and building entitlements.  Oh, okay.  The other two that had to do with outdoor commerce.  Right.  And parklets.  Those terminate upon the termination of the local emergency.  I just want to clarify that.  Okay.  And I believe the police chief can clarify on the ABC question.  Chief?  Yeah.  As we were sitting here discussing this, I reached out to our local ABC rep.  And he said that it's going to be extended for another year.  Past the.  Emergency order removal.  So February of 24.  Okay.  And it's temporary parklets.  I mean, you know, we're.  You know, if they want to go through the permanent.  Process.  And that's obviously different.  Temporary program.  Okay.  Good enough.  Thanks.  So.  Sorry.  Miss Morgan.  Do you have questions?  No.  Sir.  Not yet.  I'm going to make a motion.  So I don't know if you want to go first or not.  I'll go first.  Is it.  Is it part of the thought process that this is the temporary will turn into a permanent  and this is an avenue by which the business owners could.  Stay active as far as the outdoor dining and drinking.  Until they're ready financially or ready.  So.  However, to go into the permanent.  Outdoor dining and drinking.  Situation.  Is that.  That was not my understanding of the original intent that they would be two separate items.  You'd have permanent infrastructure and then you'd have the ability to do temporary parklets  as well.  Two separate improvements.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  So the beginning.  This is.  Is repeating a little bit of what the vice mayor said, but pre COVID.  All we heard about downtown is there's not enough parking.  There's not enough parking.  There's not enough parking.  We got to do this with the meters.  We got to do this.  We got to do this.  And then COVID came and suddenly there's enough parking.  And there's enough parking for the parklets and all these things.  I think that's going to end up playing itself out.  The current temporary parklets are ugly.  I think if a downtown business restaurant, whatever.  Wants to expand into a parklet.  They need to.  Spend the money that I won't name all the restaurants, but those people did making theirs.  Part of a very beautiful and getting prettier every day downtown.  I probably voted to use the federal money to do whatever we did with the parklets.  But I think if the council gets into the business of trying to figure out who gets to do it and who doesn't,  that's going to be dangerous.  Here are my other questions.  The cost of the parklet we talked about the cost of the parklet should be fully borne by the business and no one else.  That's how it's supposed to work.  The city's got lost revenue when it comes to parking.  The city should be reimbursed for that at the very least.  Otherwise, it seems kind of like a gift of public funds.  There's also the impact on the neighboring business.  So if I've got restaurant ABC and I want the four spaces in front of me and we determine, oh,  they're all worth a dollar a piece a day, whatever the number is.  I'm sure somebody has a number.  Probably not.  Doesn't matter.  What about the business next to me that might be a retail site that people use that and they want to go there as well?  So my point to all that is that.  The COVID emergency is over.  The temporary parklets should go on the same day.  And then if we want to send to internal affairs some kind of direction to figure out how we can move forward with restaurants or whoever that wants to have a permanent parklet and how that happens, what the cost of that.  That's a completely different topic.  I don't think we're prepared to do that now.  But my motion would be to eliminate the temporary parklets at the same day.  The COVID emergency is over.  We're going to have to move to internal affairs.  And to move to internal affairs, a long-term discussion about how permanent parklets that meet all the criteria that is necessary would and could look in the city of Chico, not with the city of Chico necessarily funding all of that.  And internal affairs seems like the place to have that conversation.  Because right now I think we're kind of ahead of ourselves.  All right.  We have a motion.  I'm going to support that motion.  I'll be honest.  I'm a little surprised we didn't have more businesses with temporary parklets come and speak.  The fact that DCBA came and provided their perspective really has changed my mind on this particular issue.  I'm going to support your motion and second that.  Mr. Morgan.  Can I quickly ask the internal affairs committee representation if those businesses came to internal affairs and what their concerns or comments were?  If I remember right, I think we had three.  I think we had three businesses there.  And in general, most of them liked having the parklets and were supportive and wanted to obviously keep them as long as they could.  But all I think agreed that what we had was horrible and awful and ugly and that agreed that it was a temporary solution and wanted things to be better.  You were there, right?  Yeah.  So I think that's what in my.  Okay.  That was my memories that everybody kind of agreed.  And the intent was to have a temporary solution.  Yeah.  And the intent was to come out of it with a way to hopefully allow them to continue.  But now seeing that it's six to nine months, that obviously was not information that we had at the time at internal affairs.  Given that, that makes it a little bit tougher to double spend the money for me.  And it surprised me that the DCBA has actually went in a different direction than I anticipated.  So thank you for your input.  That does change my mind as well.  Yeah, same as Councillor O'Brien, so.  Councillor  O'  Yeah . .     .  . . . . .    Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  to develop and go through.  And they can basically only serve alcohol  until when our emergency ends on December.  Well, so the date would be a year after,  yeah, February 2024.  I mean, we'd have to have a two-month process.  Yeah, to make it worth spending any of that money  because you're only going to have it for another year.  I mean, even if you were to go to February,  I'd be willing to extend it to February,  but only if we can move the process forward  to be a four-month process  by the time they have it complete.  Do you think that's viable?  That's a pretty tight timeline.  Yeah.  I would be skeptical that we could move it.  Okay.  All right, we have a motion and a second.  Motion by Council Member Morgan  and a second by Council Member O'Brien.  Council Member Bennett.  I will support the motion.  Council Member Brunner.  Council Member Brunner.  We're having this conversation  because we eliminated the COVID emergency  and I think we did that hastily.  No.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  I'm just going to say no  because I think we should, you know,  look at it in terms of a temporary.  I don't mind extending out to the February 2024,  but it doesn't seem to be the popular opinion.  So, no.  Carries 5-2.  But this will be going to Internal Affairs  and if we have other information,  we can bring that back.  Right.  It would end at the end of the COVID.  Try to get that one for next month.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Moving on to Item 5.2,  Gratification of Memorandum of Understanding  to Chief of Management Employees.  And we have a report from Interim Director  of Human Resources and Risk Management, Amanda Patton.  Call it.  You have a really long title.  Sorry.  That's all right.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council.  The last Council meeting,  we brought forth the sunshining  of the Chico Management Employees MOU  and we are here tonight for ratification.  The Chico Management Employees proposed contract  extends their existing contract  to June 30th, 2025.  Large fiscal items are a 5% pay increase  for a 2%.  pickup of the employer's cost of CalPERS. And then in July 2023, a 3% with no pickup.  There are also some lump sum payouts for the management and a small change to some floating  holiday benefits. The fiscal impact for 2023 is estimated to be $53,000 to the general fund  and $140,000 in total. And over the three years, which again is extending the current contract,  $260,000 to the general fund and $564,000 in total. I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  All right. Questions? Thank you very much. Thank you. Public comment?  All right. No comment. Entertain a motion.  I have a motion by Vice Mayor Rounds, a second by Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk, you take the roll. Council Member Bennett? Yes.  Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Carry 7-0. All right. Item 5.3 is my request regarding  airport service and renaming. So as many of you know, the Chico Airport,  has undergone a huge variety of improvements over the last two years. So we've had federal  funding secured by Congressman Doug LaMalfa, which has allowed for our taxiways to be replaced,  which was huge in terms of one of the new federal requirements. And then also the road  improvements that we've had coming out to the airport will be complete in the coming months  and will also offer easy access to the airport. So also within the last five years or a couple of  years, the city of Chico Airport has undergone a huge variety of improvements over the last two years.  So as many of you know, the airport has undergone a huge variety of improvements over the last five years.  The city has received a $500,000 DOT grant that is solely for the help to secure an airline.  And then I believe the city's also put $100,000 into the revenue guarantee fund too. And correct me if  I'm wrong on this, Mr. Jefferson, on any of this. But in some recent discussions, the airport  commission was discussing rebranding the airport. We've had some past discussion about it prior to  COVID. My goal was to move that forward. So I'm going to move that forward. So I'm going to move that forward.  As soon as possible. You know, I know some of those suggestions and I'll let Mr. Jefferson kind of  explain where some of those suggestions are and where they came from. But in terms of contacting  an airline, having an airline come to Chico, moving forward with our revenue guarantee fund, I feel  it's now is the time to start with the rebranding. I think at one point in time, we had hired a PR  agency to do that and move forward with that. And I think we had the university do a study.  But Mr. Jefferson, maybe you can elaborate on that a little bit.  Yeah, thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Yeah, just we've hired a marketing firm to kind of produce a  marketing plan in our air service pursuits. And yeah, the timing's right. And just to kind of give  a little history as well to go back a little further, this kind of effort started at the  airport commission level in 2019. The airport commission formed an ad hoc committee to look  at rebranding and the potential name change to kind of capture a little bit more of a regional  perspective. And we even partnered with the airport commission to do a study on the airport  cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting  cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting  cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting  cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting  cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting  cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting  cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting  cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting  cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting  cutting cutting cutting cutting  Unfortunately, COVID, when the pandemic really hit, a lot of those students didn't return after their spring break,  but they continued with the effort, and we received nine formal proposals to rebrand and change the name of the airport.  The airport commission ultimately heard it in August of 2020 and narrowed it down to four options ranked.  At that time, again, the industry was really changing due to the pandemic,  and things were really in a standstill and a holding pattern, if you will, no pun intended.  It was still being discussed, and I think it didn't really lose momentum,  but the consensus of the airport commission at that point was this needs to happen.  However, as we come out of the pandemic, it might be more appropriate for staff to work with  and be able to do that kind of work.  Once we hired a marketing firm to run this through the marketing firm and then ultimately bring it to the full council.  That was kind of decided once airport, or excuse me, air service efforts,  returning air service efforts really ramped up as we were coming out of the pandemic and kind of considered a later date.  I think we're here.  We formed an air service stakeholder committee.  We've been engaged in numerous discussions in our catchment.  We've been engaged in numerous discussions in our catchment area, which includes, you know, a part of Tehama County,  all of Butte County, of course, and then westerly into Glyn County.  And in a handful of those recent discussions, we've gotten a lot of feedback.  You know, as we've moved through this, we've picked up taglines like choose Chico and help Chico fly and things of that nature,  which we think are great and are great for Chico.  But we've gotten some feedback that, well, wait a minute.  Our business, our organization is in Tehama County or Glyn County.  Why is it just Chico?  which makes sense.  And so we're kind of recognizing that it might be a good time now  to reconsider changing the airport name to get more of a regional approach.  We're not alone.  Our neighbors to the north of us, Redding,  recently changed their name to Redding Regional Airport.  And so it's something along those lines,  just so it's not just Chico, it's the region.  It's the Northern California or North State region.  So at this point, yeah, I think it's appropriate to bring it to the table again.  It's, you know, Council's desire if they wish staff to bring something back  at a close, you know, a future meeting, very close to consider.  Maybe a few options that the Airport Commission considered  from the marketing students,  and maybe we could run it by the marketing firm that we have  just to get their input and then bring a formal staff presentation back.  All right.  I know we have Tom here as well, our airport manager,  who's, you know, working with this stuff as well.  So if...  And Council has any questions.  You know, I would just further comment by saying,  you know, our catchment study, at least the last one we had,  shows quite a few folks in the local area  who travel on a daily basis to Sacramento to fly.  And, you know, I used to hear it when I was a kid living in Marysville  that, you know, Sacramento's airport will never be anything  because it's too close to San Francisco.  But as we know, and as Natomas gets bigger and bigger and bigger,  Sacramento gets further.  It's further away.  A trip that used to take an hour and 15 minutes  takes about an hour and 40 minutes now, depending on traffic.  So in that airport, it's getting busier and busier too.  So at some point, this will be something that either you're heading to Reading  to catch a flight, which we're not...  It's not necessarily advantageous,  and the airport's getting a little further away too due to construction.  So I think it makes perfect sense to look at this.  I know we do have some airlines interested  that the city's having conversations with,  at least one at this point.  So, you know, I think this is just the next logical step.  The other is, of course, staff to continue on their direction  with bolstering the revenue guarantee fund,  which I want to make this note  because I think it was maybe wrong in the media  that that'll come from, you know, private companies raising money  along with that DOT grant and the $100,000 that the city put in,  which, of course, is public funds.  So are there any questions from Mr. Kefson or myself?  All right.  Thank you.  Speakers?  We have three speakers.  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  First speaker is James Hutchinson,  followed by B.T. Chapman.  Some people are going to be surprised,  but I think the mayor's on the right track on this one.  But there is one thing that's going on here  that keeps bothering me.  It's kind of like...  Rick Twain said, when he pointed out that we are like discreet sheep,  we wait to see where the drove is going, we follow.  We keep hearing the words Reading on everything.  Cannabis, how much we're going to charge, airport.  We're not Reading.  We're different.  We have a different offering.  When you look at Reading, they've created an iconic image.  Beautiful images of this bridge coming across.  They have a foundation that's funding another,  several great projects.  It's wonderful.  But we have a university town.  Yeah.  And universities produce much bigger business pictures.  If you look what happened in Santa Clara,  it wasn't the Santa Clara City Council  that developed the business there.  It was Stanford.  The people coming out of there.  One of our own graduates from Chico State,  Sandy Lerner, founder of Cisco System,  is among those people that founded business there.  And it came through the university system.  The other thing that happens,  the people I worked for were in the laser industry.  The boss I worked for.  He came from Cornell, New York,  out here for the business opportunities in Livermore  because of the research facilities there.  And he went out and formed his own business.  He kept it in the community  because the community was a good place to live.  He tried coming up here.  He thought about it back in the 90s.  Didn't get a good reception.  He said, okay, I want relocate.  And that's what happens.  But what we need is an airport vision that says, okay,  we've got more than an airport here.  How about a company?  How about a convention center of size  that combines both the city needs and the university needs?  Not just one downtown where it's close to the university.  Somewhere like when you look at the Kmart situation,  that huge lot area.  Wonderful convention center.  Wonderful number of hotels, businesses there  that would benefit by bringing in conventions.  When you bring people into convention centers,  you bring in people who are in businesses,  whether it's agricultural.  Agriculture now is big.  You bring people into technology.  If you look at what they're doing with farm equipment now,  you bring in those kind of people.  And you bring in people from other diverse interests  for the university.  And those people look around.  And if you have a community, if you have a transportation system,  for instance, that would go from the airport out to the convention  center into the downtown area, places like Inlow Hospital,  and then beyond eventually to Merriam Park,  the cancer center is going to be.  Those kind of things are attractive.  They're bringing people in.  They're bringing ideas and people.  That's what I'm suggesting, looking beyond.  Golden Gate Bridge was built during the Depression, folks.  And it was a huge gain for Marin because they didn't sit back  and say we're going to fail.  They said the country's going to succeed.  Let's do it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  BT Chapman followed by Nicole Nava.  Good evening.  I would just reiterate.  The work that the marketing group did  with the university was very thorough and it was complete.  And if this initiative to rename the airport goes forward,  I think the work that they did should be considered a part  of the whole package of that study.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nicole Nava is our last speaker.  Good evening, Council.  So I'm here at the behest of some folks that wanted to weigh  in on this topic.  So and I as a personal commuter myself would like to weigh  in on this.  And I realize that I'm just a slice and some  of these people are just a slice of all the people in Chico.  But that said, there were some points I wanted to make.  So for the commuting situation,  I'm not sure how many people really realize the impact  and quality of life, time lost and things like that  for when you do go out of the area for work.  It's a minimum of five hours if you're doing the work.  And then you're going to be spending the turnaround just  to do the drive and what it takes to get checked  in early enough if you don't check a bag.  You could be spending up to eight hours depending upon all  the other things you might need to do.  And then sometimes depending upon when the flights come  in in Sacramento, you could be having to stay overnight  and have that expense and then come back.  And you know, not to mention all the time lost with families.  There was a particular gentleman who works  out of the area out of state.  And so he takes the flight regularly.  And so he was really, you know, a little bit of a burden.  And so he's been hanging on for a long time.  And so he's been really feeling that he will have to relocate  if this kind of thing doesn't go through.  He's been hanging on because he really thought it looked  like it was happening.  Then it looked like it slowed.  There were other people weighing in with similar situations all  over.  I myself go down to LA at times.  And that would be fantastic to be able to just fly right  into Chico.  I would love that.  And I'm sure others would as well.  The other impact is to the businesses.  I appreciate what the prior gentleman had to say about all  the variety of businesses.  Once that cancer centers up, you're going to get people that  are coming for treatment from all over the place.  And when people are not feeling well,  I've been with personal family members,  it is not fun to have to be in the car for hours.  And so that would be kind of a huge thing for someone  to immediately have their needs be met.  We lose people because we don't have air service.  Because there have been people  coming out here.  Because there have  been people  coming out  cutting  partners with Facebook and others that, for a variety of reasons, leave the area, that  perhaps if we would have had something like this, maybe they wouldn't.  We're getting way more people that are people from outside the area that have business here  and bounce back, and that would benefit them as well.  The other impact to the university is you have Chico State parents looking for their  kids, and if their kids go here, they want to come visit.  They're losing half a day to even see their kids that are going here.  So I see a lot of benefits to this, and I see that there's been a lot of work done to  try to, I guess I'll put it, groom the area to start making it look like we mean business.  I would say I still would love to see the roads done, because I think that's going to  be a huge thing if we want to draw and attract people.  We need to look like our city is nice and physically healthy.  So that's pretty much what I want to say, and please look at the acronym for that name.  Oh, a little unfortunate.  All right.  Thank you.  So comments, questions, council?  All right.  I'm happy to make a motion.  So, and that would be for city staff to bring back recommendations compiling through both  the PR firm and the recommendations of the university group to come back and bring recommendations  to the next council meeting so we can move forward with this.  Have the.  Another piece of the puzzle put together.  Second.  We have a motion and a second.  Further comment?  Quick question.  Sure.  Mr. Gustafson, maybe you can answer this.  When was this set to come back per the airport commission?  Great question.  There wasn't a set time.  It was just as our air service pursuits really started to ramp up.  You know, this took place during the pandemic and the industry was changing rapidly.  Still is changing.  It changes by the week and pilot shortages and fuel prices and so on and so forth.  So there wasn't a set time.  It was just when appropriate, when our air service pursuit efforts really started to  ramp up and we were engaged under contract with a marketing firm to confirm as well.  Thank you.  So I'm going to support the motion.  Here's my challenge.  I'm going all the way back to like the last two times.  Scott.  When I was here talking about strategy, talking about how we spend city funds, what's happening or not happening with the sales tax measure.  I think the airport's fantastic.  There's a bazillion reasons why the airlines don't come here.  They want to make money.  And when they can make money, they'll come here.  Regardless of what we call it.  So if we want to spend some money renaming it and doing things like that, it doesn't distract staff a lot.  There's a lot of other things that are more important than putting the airport there.  And I know one for one with anybody.  I know one for one with anybody on the airport commission, anybody in town about why Reading has one, why San Luis has one, why we don't.  Would I like to have an airport here?  Yes.  And would the airlines like to come here as soon as they can become profitable?  At the end of the day, and everything that the speaker says, we're right.  Oh, would it be better for the university?  Sure.  Would it be better for the business owner?  Sure.  Would it be better for all of us?  But so are the roads.  And so we're having enough police officers.  And so we're having all these other things that to me have to come first.  So I get worried.  Why don't we distract ourselves with bright, shiny objects, which is I know I'm in the minority on the council and the entire city.  Although the airline industry does agree with me that this is a bright, shiny object for us right now.  But I'll support it because I know the emotional appeal it has.  I'm anxious and interested to see the new name.  All right.  Further comment?  I'm clear.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  No.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Moving on.  No items posted after the agenda.  Reports and communications.  Following reports and communication items are provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on subsequent agenda.  We start with city manager's report.  City Manager Mark Sorensen.  No report.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Council Member request.  Pursuant to AP and P 1010.  Council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting.  After stating what the item would be a majority vote.  The council is needed for staff to agendize.  Council members may also submit requests in writing.  Do we have any council requests?  All right.  Seeing none.  We will move to the sun shining the draft MOU.  Which is the draft draft.  Therefore information only and then adjournment.  Thank you very much.
