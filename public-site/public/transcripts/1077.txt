We will call it byает 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 181 18  point one must first complete a speaker card which can be found at the back of the room once  completed turn into the city clerk my left to your right once the speaker begins their comments  no additional cards will be taken all right move on to special agenda item 3.1 council ballot measure  mr ewing thank you mayor coolidge at the council's last meeting on august 2nd 2022 you directed me to  incorporate additional wording provided by vice mayor reynolds into a proposed ballot measure i've  done that at this meeting today council will consider the amendments as provided by vice  mayor reynolds and provide direction to staff to submit the measure to the county for adoption of  the following ordinance and resolution i will omit reading that anticipating a motion all right  council discussion or questions  i have a couple and probably best for our new city manager  probably my questions are probably best for you so um in regards to cost obviously or ability i guess  so if we get a ton of notifications about particular areas that need to be addressed  how well do you think we'll be able to handle that unknown since we don't know the quantity  or what the type would be i would imagine that we would be able to handle that i would imagine that  would be folded into the existing structure that code enforcement uses to accept those kinds of  reports okay and so again depending upon what they are yeah you know if they're right away related  they would be as they are today they would go through go to public works right away maintenance  so it would depend on the type of complaint and what type of property it is okay do you see that  or anticipate that harming normal city operations anyway i would expect the  that to be normal city operations.  Okay.  So you think it's something we could probably handle  and incorporate in?  I would expect so, yes.  Okay.  That was my main question.  All right, any others?  Mr. Bennett.  My only, and I brought it up Tuesday, two days ago.  I'm just, you know, I'm not suggesting any changes.  I'm just, if it becomes an ad hoc committee,  and then if it progresses to an appointed chair  in a committee position, is 20 days to respond going to be,  I mean, 20 days seems, for me,  seems like it goes by in a few minutes.  So I'm just gonna bring that up and make a comment  and leave it if anybody wants to follow up, that's fine.  I'm just, 20 days.  20 days goes by so fast.  I'll respond to that real quickly.  One of the things that will be part of my motion on this,  and we can discuss it now, is adding in a line  that says something to the effect of this act may be amended  by the city council upon two thirds vote of the members  of the council, but only to further the purpose of this act.  That reason being, if we get into something later  down the road, if this passed by the voters,  the only way to change anything,  if anything passed by the voters,  would be to take it back to the voters,  and if there's something that's absolutely not working  and we need 30 days or we need 45 days or whatever,  or we would have the ability,  staff could bring it to council and say,  hey, this is really hindrance.  In order to make this work better,  this is what we need to do.  So that would be a recommendation to give us that leeway.  Is that okay with you, sir?  That's fine.  Also, just prospectively, the two,  it's related but it's unrelated.  So the perspective of the potential ad hoc committee  is not a part of this resolution if at the point,  and if you got to the point where the time period  that that committee is working under isn't working,  they would not need to go back to amend anything.  They could just change the time period themselves,  that ad hoc committee.  And again, I'll stress the two are related  but unrelated to the action today.  Okay.  That was, as council member Morgan said, the recommendation of the city council.  and said bifurcated out  because we've learned all this fun legal terms  from our attorney, Mr. Yeung.  Well, thank you, Vice Mayor,  and thank you, City Attorney.  All right, Mr. O'Brien, do you have any questions?  I do not, thank you.  All right.  So what I'm understanding is that  in case there is a modification  to the ordinance needed in the future,  we can just do that?  Without going back to the voters?  Is that what you're suggesting?  That's what the, if the council takes action  to adopt the ballot measure language as amended  based on the amendment provided by Vice Mayor Reynolds,  the council and the voters adopt the ordinance,  then yes, the voters would be giving the council power  to change it by a two-thirds majority vote.  Okay, so that needed,  to be added, correct?  Okay, that needs to be added, right?  It's not added yet.  I'm just double-checking that part, so.  All right, further questions or comments from council?  All right, with that,  I assume we have one or two public speakers, at least?  We have two, Patrick Newman, followed by Rob Berry.  Three minutes.  Come on down.  Three minutes.  Could I address a point of order  from when the clock starts?  Sure.  Sure.  So, the last,  last meeting,  I saw a card dropped  after the discussion started.  Tonight,  I saw another card dropped  after the discussion started.  Now, in 20 years of coming here,  you had to have your card in  before the discussion started  on the agenda item.  Has that changed?  It was never that way,  and what it is,  no, no, so.  As I read it,  it's once the first speaker begins their comment.  Right, cards are taken  until the staff presentation is over  or council discussion is over.  Once the first speaker begins to talk,  I,  I do not accept additional cards.  Okay, thank you.  Uh-huh.  Thanks for the water.  So,  there's two things wrong with this.  First of all,  when you have economic refugees  on the scale we have today,  when you have economic collapse  and a huger and huger gap  between rich and poor in America  and you see people falling off the edge,  in this case,  we're losing people.  into the public space,  because we don't have the public housing  that we need,  you don't humanely address that  by punishing people for being there.  It doesn't work.  It's inhumane.  And I think if you all spent more time  getting to know the people who live out there  on an individual basis  and really understood why they're there,  this kind of approach would seem totally untenable.  But if we take people back into the public space,  ridiculous. The other point is that the way it's being done, making this a ballot  issue to me seems like obvious political grandstanding. It seems strategic, it  seems directed at trying to get a certain outcome from the electorate. So  instead of just passing an ordinance the way that the council has passed  ordinances for decades or generations, you're putting this ordinance into the  hands of the people. There's less flexibility in changing it, which you  just described, and there's no upside to that other than the fact that it gives  you some kind of strategic advantage in the electoral process. So that should be  spoken to so that at least the public understands what's going on with that.  You actually have a quality  of life ordinance on the ballot. It's a 1% sales tax. Bringing that money into the  coffers of the city of Chico would allow for an upgrade of the infrastructure. I  mean I was just, where was I today? Oh I washed my car and I was pulling out onto the  side road and the pavement is literally buckling all over town. It's not because  of the heat, it's happening 365 days a year, and I've listened to expert after  expert speak right here about the fact that we have hundreds of millions of  dollars of infrastructure failure happening. So we're all backwards here.  Instead of supporting this and putting it on the ballot, what you should be  doing is supporting the sales tax so that quality of life in terms of roads,  infrastructure, sewers, buckling sidewalks, trees, those things can be addressed  effectively instead of having to go to the !  I'm sorry, I'm having years and years and years of more failure there. Anyway,  I'm down six seconds. Thank you. Thanks again for the water.  Thank you. Rob Berry.  Well apparently at least one person here would prefer that I don't speak, so I'm  going to accommodate him and sit down. But not before I thank each one of you here for  the hard work in getting this over the finish line. This was quite an effort and I really  appreciate it. I do want to make sure that what I understood Casey to just say is, you  know what it means by getting it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  Get it on the ballot?  voters to make an adjustment in some small detail of the ordinance.  Okay, thank you very much.  All right, further discussion from council?  Entertain a motion.  So I would move to approve with the amended language or the added language of this act  may be amended by the city council upon two-thirds vote of the members of the council,  but only to further the purpose of this act.  Or something to that effect, if that language is okay.  All right, we have a motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds and a second by Council Member Bennett.  And before we take the roll...  Who actually made the second?  Council Member Bennett.  Oh, thank you.  Before we take the roll, I have some comments I think Council Member Tandon.  Do you? No? Oh. Okay.  Okay.  So I've been a little bit hesitant.  Mark, your explanation actually helped me a little bit.  Your amendment has helped me a little bit too.  You know, I'd certainly don't, I'd like to spend more time with this.  I'd like the public to spend a little more time with it.  But given the choice between not having it and having it,  I think it's better to have it and push forward with it.  So if anyone else has comments.  Mr. O'Brien, do you have any comments prior to the vote?  No, I think everything has been said that,  uh,  I wanted to say and I heard some things tonight as far as some amendments that I appreciate.  So I'm ready to vote.  All right.  No further comments.  We'll go ahead and take the vote.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries five with two absences.  All right.  And with that,  we will adjourn the meeting until our closed session meeting following the regular City Council meeting on September 6.  Thank you very much.  You put me on the motion.  Yes.  But  you want to get a little screening.  Right.  Yes.  Okay.  So  you want to. All right.
