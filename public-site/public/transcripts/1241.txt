representing them.  they have another item on the  agenda later on concerning the  columns or pillars at the  entrance to the park.  they' re going to be other  members are going to be talking  about proposal to put historic  signage on them.  but i' m here to talk about the  lighting on those pillars.  they don' t work at this point  they' re not on.  i spoke with shane.  i don' t know who shane is.  hi shane.  we spoke with the commission.  the supervisor checked the lights  and they are working.  they are working.  i went by at night the other  night and none of them were on.  the lights themselves work but  the timers needs reset.  okay.  good.  as a public service and a project  we thought chico heritage could  make sure those things are working  properly and or refurbish them.  the ones on the north side there'  s two over there.  they have an ornamental grill  around them and it'  s just a leaf collector so they'  re full of leaves.  i thought maybe we could adapt  them in some way that could keep  that from happening.  the ones on the south side there'  s four on that side.  they' re not real attractive they'  re just kind of square boxes i  don' t know if you'  ve noticed them.  re going to be replaced or  cleaned or if anything needs to be  done maybe they don'  t.  i'  ve never seen them turned on so  i don'  t know.  chico heritage is offering our  services even possibly monetary to  get those things working and looking  good.  i just wanted to throw that out  there and see what the commission has  to say about it.  thank you for your input.  it sounds to me like our park  director is on top of it.  the next item on the agenda will  be chico heritage association  talking about the plaques they'  re proposing.  speaking with them we'  re going to start with the  plaques and move forward with any  improvements for the lighting from  there.  taking it one step at a time at  this point.  it'  s very much on our radar.  we'  re going to  as i said the park supervisor looked  at the lights they'  re working.  we'  re going to make sure they'  re on the timing or the photo  cells are working properly and he  is going to wait until after leaf  drop to clean out the leaves in  there and spruce them up.  we want to help if you need it.  thank you for your input.  next item is item five.  request to place interpretive  plaques on pillars at the one mile  entrance.  thank you Mr. Chair.  the parks office was contacted by  catherine gabriel from the chico  heritage association with an idea  to provide some interpretive plaques  to explain the history of the  pillars at the entrance of both  south one mile and the pier  bridge.  are in the pier bridge.  there'  s existing plaques  there now that commemorate the  dedication of the pillars but  they'  re pretty limited in their  history.  i provided some pictures in the  packets in case you'  re not familiar with  the plaques that exist.  the history is very interesting.  i think it'  s a great idea.  i would like to talk further  details about the idea and get  the ball rolling with your  approval to move forward and  start with some designs.  with that i would like to  introduce ms gabriel to speak to  you further about the idea.  good evening.  i gave a you should have a hand  out in front of you that starts  like that.  we got involved with putting up  historical plaques in downtown  chico and that'  s a picture of an example of one  of the plaques that we put up.  this is the phoenix building.  they'  re about like this except for  in front of the silverstein  building the columns are narrower  so we adapted it like that.  that'  s what you can see what they  sort of look like.  we participated in researching  and making sure the history that  was listed on all of the plaques  was accurate with most of them.  we weren'  t involved in the first three  that were put up.  they got us involved.  we were able to download a  self-guided tour and that'  s a little map with all the  numbers where all 19 are placed.  you can download that and there'  s a little bit about it where  you can read about each one.  when we saw that they were  talking about fixing up the south  park drive and the north park  drive or peterson drive we  thought the pillars are such a  historical part of chico.  they'  ve been there for such a long  time we thought it would be a  plaques so it would include both  the pillars on the north entrance  and the south entrance.  i'  m remiss.  a lot of our board members are  here tonight.  this is liz stewart and paul who  just spoke and carla norley and  john gallardo and we are part of  a 13 board member for the chico  heritage association.  we'  re all volunteers and we'  re a nonprofit organization for  chico.  on page 2 you'  can see the picture of what the  pillars looked like in 1946.  when they and you can see with  the lights that'  s before they had the mesh  around them.  i just thought you might be  interested the original what they  used to call it originally was  the gateway to bidwell memorial  park.  plans to have these four handsome  grand pillars begin in 1918 with  the chico mundy bridge club.  all the members there was only  about 15 of them.  at each of their meetings they  contributed 50 cents each member.  they met every two weeks.  it took them 15 years.  all of them knew annie bidwell  personally.  it took them 15 years until they  had enough money and said okay  we can now get the pillars erected.  in 1933 they went to robbie marble  works which was a local business  founded in 1879 by william robey.  i guess i said his name wrong.  robey.  he was the first to have a  pillar erected.  he had just recently passed away  but his son john was now in charge  of the business and he designed the  pillars.  the two inside pillars are 16 feet  high counting the lanterns and  they'  re 10 feet high on the other.  that'  s just sort of a highlight.  they are granite and they have  plaques on them and they were  installed in 1934.  so whenever we do a plaque we try  to keep it under 150 words because  we know people will not stand there  forever reading great big long  narratives.  so we get to the essence of it.  i thought i would highlight that for  you.  we'  re thinking of the plaque that  would be on the side that when  people walk or bicycle ride they  could be able to stop and read it.  looking at page 3 this is an article  from a 1920 i'  m sorry that'  s a typo it should say 1939 chico  record.  that'  s the  title of the  title of the  article is  the  was  spending too much money on bidwell  park and they all resigned and the  city council said okay and appointed  all new park commissioners like you  and said we'  re going to put the road in.  it was a  new problem.  it was a  new problem.  it was a  new problem.  it was a  new problem.  it was a  new problem.  it was a  north side of the park too. Before that, you had to go down  Valambrosia. And they did have a horse trail, but no way for an  automobile or other things to go through. It was during the  Depression, and the Public Works Administration, WPA, did a lot  of projects around town. And they worked with the Bidwell  Park Playground Commission to announce that they were going to  have a road. They supplied the labor, and the Chico, city of  Chico, supplied the truck and the gravel. At one point, they  had 40 men working on the road. And it was several years before  at that time, it was just called the North Park Drive. So  meanwhile, several years later, before they decided to erect the  pillars and have the entrance like you see it now, and rename  it George F. C.  Peterson Drive. So he had immigrated to United States in  1864 from Germany. And he participated in mining and  butchering. And fast forward, he first went some other places,  mined in Plumas County, then went to Oroville, came down to  Chico in 1878. And he owned the first meat market in Chico, and  was a successful businessman, and acquired a lot of property  around town. He retired in 1900 and married in 1902 to Clara.  Well, when he died in 1912, he left some directions with his widow.  And I want to tell you, the Chico record said when he died that it  marked the passing of another man of affairs who was prominent in the  upbuilding of Chico. His nephew, by the way, also came to Chico and  was Bidwell's gardener and botanist. And he had a nephew named George  also. So in researching this, it was a little confusing because there  were two men who were in the same building. And one of them was a  man from the north. And the other man was a man from the north.  And so we had to find out which one was actually responsible for  the drive, for the North Park drive. But anyway, his wife, after  he passed away, she kept kind of a home base in Chico but traveled  around and lived in the Bay Area. But she never forgot Chico. When  she died in 1944, she kept her husband's wishes and she willed to  the city of Chico some property. And the property was to benefit  Bidwell Park.  sell it or use it, but to benefit Bilbo Park.  Well, do you know where Mangrove Shopping  Center is? That whole area there is about  17 acres with the, you know,  on Vallabrosia and Mangrove, that shopping  center, that's what she gave to the  city of Chico. And the  city council, there's 17 acres all together.  And they decided that,  you know, they kicked around the idea and then they  decided they would sell the property and use  the money to pave the  north drive  road and use  some of the other money for some other  park projects. So after  they decided to pave it, they  decided to rename the road  Peterson Memorial Drive and have  the pillars erected with the plaque.  And a ceremony dedicating  the road and the pillars took  place on June 6, 1951.  So we,  I might have gone a little bit too much, but we  do a word count and we kind of  smith it together and highlight it.  And we would, what we do on every  single plaque that we've been responsible for  is  we take it back to the owner.  In this case, we'd bring it back to you to look over  the draft, see if you want any changes,  have you approve it. And the  Chico Heritage Association would pay for  the  plaques. And  then we would work together on either  help pay for having them put  up or see  what we're shaying on having them put up.  And maybe on the, you know, not so that it spoils the  front view, but on the back. Something like  that that would be, you know, acceptable  to you all. So that anyone  walking or bike riding or even  driving, they could pull over and stop and read about  the history of the pillars.  So that's our idea. And then, of course,  the next step would be maybe to fix the lights.  But we wanted to start with the plaques.  So.  Any of the commissioners have questions?  You raised your hand first.  Thank you for  that detailed report.  I have two questions.  The number  one question  is, and I'm a, I'll  just say this, I'm a researcher, and  so I'm constantly  asking about research. I'm wondering  where we can go to find  out the information and to kind of look at the  information so that we're not only looking at the text  when you come back, but I'd love  to make sure that, like, where is the  information coming from and all that. So is there  a place where we can go and  do that research? When we've  given you back the text that we write up,  we'll give you resources,  you know, a complete  bibliography of where we got the information  from. We've  usually, we've dug through  mostly old newspapers, Chico  Record, Chico Enterprise,  and then I've also asked  Shane to double check the minutes  from the Park Commission  to make sure that we're, you know, that we have  everything accurate.  And so we'll have a little, you know,  resources listed for you.  Thank you.  But I think, I agree, that's great, and I  would want you to do that. So thank you so much.  Thank you. My second, can I ask  a second question? My second question  is, those pillars are,  if my calculations are correct, about  90 years old. And I'm wondering how  the plaques will be affixed, and if there's  any concern about the integrity of the  stone with how they might  be affixed. I think that  first of all, they'd be on the backside  because we don't want to spoil the view on the,  you know, like when you first enter the drive.  And I think,  you know, we would work with  of the state, and we would work with  shane to make sure that  however, like, however they're  attached, because they are granite.  And so we'd want to make sure that, I'm  sure that shane and his staff, and, you  know, we would work together to make sure that  they're properly fixed without harming  or damaging any of the pillars.  commissioner  I've actually been thinking about that a little bit.  And I was thinking about it today.  When we get a little bit further into this, I think maybe a good option is,  you know,  if we can get  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  of the water towers. And the signs themselves, when they were designed, Tom Van Overbeek was  involved when he first got, it was his idea. And they are, what do you say, they're made out of  material that they're not easy to put graffiti or anything on. They're easy to clean. Yeah,  they're easy to clean. So they're, you know, they're clean. Depending on the cost of the  plaque itself, it depends on how many you have made at one time. And we do know there's two more  buildings downtown. Right now there's 19. We've had 20 plaques all together, but one person hasn't  put up their signs, so they're not on the map yet. There's 19 signs already up in that map. And you  can go to our webpage and do a self-guided tour, download it. And they're easy to clean if there's  any graffiti on them. Thank you. They're not so expensive too, that if they're updated, we can  get them. Yeah.  You know, make another one.  Thank you for that presentation. It was really interesting.  Just a comment to piggyback off that. I wouldn't worry about the pillars themselves. They're  granite. Granite's a hard stone. I was just looking them up on the Mohs scale. They're six  or seven out of a one to 10 scale. And as, I mean, their hardness, I don't think we have to worry  about damaging the pillars. They're not soapstone. They're not limestone.  But I wondered, still talking about the granite, do you know anything about it? Is it California  granite? That would be interesting to find out. No, but it was funny when I was getting ready  to come tonight, I was sort of, you know, the questions keeps coming up, so we can also keep  researching and try to find out more about it. Because once I found out when the north side was  built, I sort of thought, wait, when was the south side built? And that's not in there. And so that's  a little more research. Well, I'll research for you too, because-  Oh, right.  There are a lot of rock hounds out there, including myself. So that might be interesting  too, because there's such big, you know, chunks and beautiful. So, and also to thank you for  this newspaper article, because it lets us know that the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission  is almost a hundred years old. Maybe even, yeah, that made me think, wow, how long has this body  been a part of the city of Chico? We can look into that a little further.  Well, I can do that too, but I just wanted to thank you for that little tidbit, because  that was interesting to me also. But this looks like a great project. So  thank you for-  We are all volunteers. And basically anybody who comes through the door, you don't have to be a  member. We love it if more people join, but whether or not, if they say, hey, my grandmother  lived over on blah, blah, will you help us? We help, we try to research almost anything and  everything if we can. And it's, it's quite fun. It's like being a,  you know, investigative detective or something.  Exactly.  Mr. Nichols?  Kind of a philosophical question, and Shane sort of touched on this. Putting new plaques on a  90-year-old pillar seems to compromise the historical integrity of it. So I'm sort of in the  idea that putting the plaques is fine, but maybe they should be put not on the, on the actual  pillars to keep them the way they were originally constructed. Second question, if they were to be  put on the pillars, they'd be done. on the pillars they would be done professionally and by a contractor approved by the city I assume. Absolutely. I' m confident the park staff could fix them but I think we would contract it out. You take a look at the one we did in front of the water tower so we put a post and attached the sign to the post. Do you have a thought on the integrity question?  question?  Well, I guess I was sort of  thinking  I had first thought we would  put it on the back of the pillars and  then some of my fellow board members said  they were a little worried about that.  Maybe it should be on the pillars. So we were  kind of leaving it open to what you  all wanted and  how you wanted to do it.  So if you look at some of the other  plaques around town, I think, in fact, there's  one on Collier Hardware Building. You can  see the little map there and maybe get some  ideas from that. But definitely  I think all of us  believe in keeping the  integrity of historical  buildings. That's kind of what we're all about.  Thank you.  Or try to be.  Any other questions?  Okay.  Are there any  other speakers on this issue?  I see no excitement.  Does anyone want something to add?  No, we'  re good.  Okay. Then I will declare the  hearing closed.  the recommendation for this is for the  commission to either approve or decline  moving forward with a design. So the  reason why this is on the agenda is for  the commission to hear it and then make a decision on whether it'  re going to  see this project move forward with design or not. We would  need a motion and a second to vote.  I'  d like to make a motion to go  ahead and move forward with the draft proposal.  Okay.  I'  ll second.  Discussion?  Okay. On discussion, I would like the motion to  the motion includes the understanding that the actual  text will come back to us.  This is just to start the process.  I understand. But as I understand it, the motion is to start the process.  Before they'  re installed, we'  ll actually review the plaque.  Yes. I can stipulate to that. I'  m making compromises.  To the compromises. This is just to start the process correct? I would also request an amendment to the motion that request the heritage association  To the compromises.  To the compromises. request the heritage association to comment on the appropriateness of putting the plaque on the pillar or putting it separate.   I would think that' s part of the process. That would be something you would further discuss when they  members of the committee we will  discuss when they bring a draft  and we get further along with  this.  I would like you to understand  I' m interested in hearing your  thoughts on that issue.  I would assume that'  s an  issue you have considered and  will continue to consider?  yes we'  ve talked about that and  we'  re willing to bring back some  ideas back to you all.  Again we would definitely finish  the research looking at it and  put it together and bring it  back to you all to red market  and see what you would like to  add or not.  I do want to say this I might  have already said it.  We try to keep the narrative a  little bit short because we found  people don'  t stand there and read a great  big long narrative.  about it but then we would back  it up on our web page and they  could go to it to get more  information or maybe on the  city'  s park commission'  s web page to say here'  s some more information if you  would like more for those history  nuts besides us.  any more comments from the  commission?  we have a motion pending.  we'  re discussing the motion.  any further input on the motion?  could we have a vote please?  commissioner nava?  aye.  commissioner nichols?  aye.  commissioner piva?  aye.  commissioner shears absent?  commissioner petti?  yes.  vice chair blashly?  yes.  I would just offer one more  comment to the heritage society  would you guys in the process of  building your proposal please  talk to a stone mason so we  don'  t have to come back and do  that?  as someone who fabricates granite  to see about the integrity of  those pillars and affixing the  signs to the pillars because it  sounds like that'  s going to be an  issue maybe you can clear that up  and we'  ll do that.  thank you very much.  sounds good.  thank you.  that motion passes.  we'  ll move on to item 5.2  permit to hold spring and late  summer concerts at children'  s park.  the applicant would like to host  spring and late summer community  concerts in children'  s park.  they'  d be free to the public.  sponsor and information booths  food vendors and a bounce house  will all be part of the events  that take place on saturday  evenings.  james?  Mr. Chair thank you very much.  I just read what you wrote.  Mr. Sanders is here this  evening to give further details  on his proposal for the concert  series and children'  s playground.  I believe he has a powerpoint that  we can get to.  I will be happy to get to that  if we switch to that view.  welcome Mr. Sanders.  thank you for having me.  I don'  t this is not an extensive  presentation so I will briefly  run down what the idea is.  I also want to amend shane and I  talked I would say at length  about food vendors specifically  food trucks and how that would  really work in that park.  I think we decided it doesn'  t make a ton of sense there  specifically because of the lawn  I know it was written in the  agenda but I don'  t think food vendors are part of  the concept at this point.  Also a little more downtown  friendly if we'  re not bringing outside food  vendors in.  Let'  s take food vendors off the  agenda.  Here'  s the idea for a concert in the  Very similar to stuff we see in  the plaza across the street.  With the difference being that  this is I would say a little bit  more family focused.  We'  re thinking families on picnic  blankets, very little concrete,  a lot of grass, shade trees, a  playground for the kids.  yes.  would it be possible to get  this dell command update box off?  s interfering with his powerpoint  presentation.  thank you.  I'  m happy to send you a file  too later if you'  d like to.  I see what you'  re talking about.  you can click that off.  I can just.  remind me later.  there we go.  hey.  I didn'  t realize I had all the power.  I can see the bottom right corner  of the poster.  yeah.  so slightly different audience.  also the reason for kind of two  legs of a concert series instead  of one continuous is I'  ve been working with the dcba to  provide sound in the plaza for  quite a while.  I think I started mixing those  concerts in 2001.  I'  ve done it a lot.  and it'  s too hot to do a concert  series in the plaza right through  the middle of summer.  so spring and fall makes more sense  to me as well as continuing to  support dcba.  they will fill in the gap in the  middle and I'  ll be on either end.  I'  m trying to be a good partner to  all the people involved there.  here'  s the location.  I know it'  s very small.  I have a zoomed in view here.  in fact let'  s just go to the zoomed in view  here.  essentially we'  re talking about the  the !  m pulling a mobile stage in  right where the power box is.  there'  s a pad that used to have a  picnic table that I think will  function perfectly for the two  porta potty toilets that we plan  to bring in.  other than that it'  s really just sponsor booths  around the outside.  again have to have a bouncy house.  I think we'  ll go here.  we'  re trying to make space for  people in the shade if they want  it and in the sun if they want  it.  not a super complicated floor  plan here.  this is a general timeline of  the event itself.  it takes us a few hours to get  everything set up.  we'  ll probably start rolling into  the park around 2.  sponsors and all the external  stuff arrive around 5.  we'  ll begin the show at 6.  it goes for about an hour and a  half.  no 2 and a half hours.  I think we'  ll probably do a two act show  every Saturday.  it takes us generally about two  hours to clean up an outside show  as well.  we'  re looking at 8 and a half  9 hours of presence in the park.  please stop me if I'  m going too fast.  I'  m happy to answer questions as  we go.  I don'  t have specific names assigned to  re going to have a  technical lead to communicate.  this is what we consider the  skeleton crew here.  we'  ll need a technical lead to  lead the stage and all that.  community lead is that point  person that any community member  might come to for information  and way finding.  safety lead we don'  t necessarily need armed  then a sponsors lead to coordinate  those outside whatever sponsors  do want to set up tables.  I guess I should have started  here.  I'  m ryan.  I'  m with the local nonprofit  sound source.  as I mentioned I'  ve been doing sound in chico  specifically for quite a long  time.  recent past clients include the  dcpa chat.  I do the chico pride stuff.  I mix in sierra nevada.  I'  ve done a number of other  things.  I've been doing concerts for  maybe the last two and a half  decades.  this is quite well tried ground  for me.  for this event we'  re partnered with maker  radio which is a radio station  over on orange street there.  community radio station.  in this endeavor they will be  broadcasting the shows themselves  so there will be a longer shelf  for the show.  content and that gets  rebroadcast every week as the  series goes on.  lastly the levitt foundation is  a funding source we'  ve been going.  they offer grants.  they'  re an l.a.  based foundation that offers  grants for free community  concert series in small towns.  I couldn'  t imagine a better match as far  as a funding source is concerned.  we applied to their grant and  have been moving through that  process.  out of 300 applicants we finished  10th in the nation.  they have yet to make a decision  that comes in mid-november.  where we finished really does  seem to indicate that we will be  well funded.  that funding is a three year  runway as well.  should provide stability and  capital to not only launch it  but keep it going for quite a  long time.  thank you.  does anybody have any questions?  thank you for your presentation.  I really love it.  I used to bring my kids to  children'  s park they'  re 13 and 15 now.  I think it'  s an underutilized space and  it'  s such a peaceful space you  have the traffic coming into  downtown you have the university  energy and I'  ve always loved that space.  s a great idea.  I love the poster it looks like  a jake early poster.  I'  ve been speaking with jake  about doing a better one.  I love that one.  thank you this sounds really fun.  children'  s park hasn'  t gotten such great pr in the  past few years.  it hasn'  t been a safe happy space for  kids.  I think this is a great proposal.  thank you.  you seem like the guy to do it.  thank you.  I appreciate it.  I'  m sorry I didn'  t see you.  thank you.  I echo megan'  s comments.  I love children'  s park.  I love the park.  I love the park.  I love this idea.  I have two questions or  maybe comments.  one I'  ll fully disclose I'  m an employee of chico  state.  that is where my department is  housed in the new behavioral  and social sciences building.  that'  s why I' m particularly familiar  with the new back side of that  now opens up to children'  s park which is fantastic.  I'  chico state'  s new building.  I'  m wondering what kind of  consultation and collaboration  with chico state police has  taken place or will take place  anything like that because I  know there'  re some unique issues there  just with making sure that  everyone'  s on the same page.  then the second I'  m offering that as a  good idea.  close and ask what  special considerations for that.  my second question is you  mentioned safety there.  I'  m wondering specifically this  area backs up to the creek.  I'  m wondering if this is a  family-friendly event what kind  of safety protocols will be in  place and I know families will  be watching their children and  all those other things but I'  wondering if there'  s a  safety protocol for having people  kind of being roaming free and  next to the creek particularly with  young children. I'  m wondering about  the safety of that and will there  be special consideration of that.  Again just kind of considerations  you don'  t need to answer right now but  those are my considerations.  thank you for thinking of both  of those. I really do see that  creek as an asset as long as it'  s safe. That'  s also something that I feel like  in the way that maybe the fountain  is meant to be the creek is a  really fun water spot as well.  I would be happy to report back on  that. I haven'  t spoken to chico state.  I don'  t have a specific answer for you.  I can tell you that I'  ve reached out to vips and will  be engaging with them but that'  s not a specific answer.  thank you.  thank you.  thanks for addressing the food  truck thing up front. I don'  t know the area used to toward  the back end near the new building  used to have it was very compacted  and it was like dirt and it'  s where we had an event there and  that'  s where the police officer  association put their big old  barbecue and things like that. I  don'  t know though is it all grown  over in beautiful grass where you  wouldn'  t want any type of food truck  on the back end?  not as impactful?  as ryan mentioned earlier  him and I did speak about the food  truck aspect and that'  s my mistake to not take that  off there.  we mutually decided the food  truck is not compatible.  we keep that area very well  irrigated so that grass is damp a  lot of the time.  so it doesn'  t have the compacted dirt  like it used to?  it'  s been a while since I' !  in-house landscape crew has been  looking after children'  s park it'  s improved the  landscape has improved  dramatically. There'  s not those  compacted spots and access  through the pathways to get the  stage set up I don'  t have any concerns about  that.  I hear you people can go  downtown and whatever it would  be nice if we can see some kind  of way that maybe dcpa can  encourage some of the food  providers in town to figure out  something maybe some fun runners  some program where people could  do it and almost like uber it  in like pedal uber walk uber  because when you'  re there with families and  stuff some of them may not go  avail themselves so it would be  great to find a way where  everybody could benefit but I  love the concept too I love that  space I agree with my peer over  there and I think that we'  re going to see a lot of  that people will definitely go  I think a lot of us old timers  to miss the vibe somewhat of the  old downtown where you could  kind of sit and it was a gazebo  so I think that'  s a beautiful idea kudos.  The gazebo was totally cool  wasn'  t it?  Yeah it was.  In fact I have been doing  that event for so long I did the  Friday night concerts when they  were in children'  s park.  Wow.  And so I'  ve seen it work before we'  re just doing that again  basically.  I love your idea of delivery  runners.  Something fun I don'  t know because I'  m like them too and  even who knows with chico state  because I really want to see our  city and the campus partner more  throughout the year I know we do  on specific things especially  with the park they do a  fantastic job of being our  partner.  Thank you.  other questions for  Mr.  Sanders?  I'  ve never had a  I noticed in your map  I think you said there'  s going to be just  two porta potties and yet I  think you'  re predicting 150  people do you think two  porta potties especially with  children is sufficient?  You know the best I can  tell you is I think they will be  sufficient but I don'  t know that.  And what'  s nice about a weekly series  is that every week I get to  rethink that decision.  What I can tell you right now is  that the park is designed with  public bathrooms although not  quite in service and I believe  there are two of them is that  correct?  They'  re across the street.  The ringgold park  bathrooms but they'  ve been closed for some time  and I don'  t foresee that they'  re going to reopen.  What I mean by that is the  space was designed as a public  space with two bathrooms.  I see what you'  re saying.  And so now here we'  re talking about  re providing those two  bathrooms.  I may need four and that first  one may be tight but the next  time I'  ll be able to bring  four.  What'  s going to have to  be handicapped?  It says ADA.  I believe the farmer'  s market has four doesn'  t it?  Farmer'  s market?  I don'  t know.  On Saturday mornings?  newfoundland newfoundland I' m talking about crowd size and that is a very important thing  I believe they have one handicap  newfoundland newfoundland  newfoundland newfoundland  newfoundland newfoundland  newfoundland newfoundland  newfoundland newfoundland  newfoundland newfoundland  newfoundland newfoundland  newfoundland newfoundland  right people to follow our  guidelines.  it'  s difficult to guess  how many people are coming.  Being in concerts for so long I  have seen so many people say  there'  s a thousand people  coming to this and 50.  It'  s so hard to predict until you  start doing it.  What you'  re looking at is a general  plan at the moment and plan to  do it as quickly as you can.  I have one more question.  What type of music?  Great question.  The idea would be it would be a  very diverse line up.  There would not be a stylistic  theme at all other than it  should be quite different a lot  of the time.  I would hope to be as  representative of both the  community but also available  music styles as I could.  I'  m speaking in this like I hope  to be a part of the community  m not trying to make  commitments to bands right now  without having approval without  having funding.  I'  m trying to hold off on taking  up people'  s time if I can'  t actually do it.  I would just thank you when I  saw children'  s park music.  It'  s going to be children'  s music.  Yes.  We won'  t get the wiggles or anything.  I would say the one thing would  be that it will always be  something that parents will feel  good having their kids around.  That would be almost the only  stipulation I would provide.  thank you.  sure.  thank you.  Sorry just to follow up.  I see the dates on here and I  know this is still planning  stages but kind of post spring  and late summer community do  you have any idea when your  first concert would be?  yes the first Saturday in  May of 26.  first Saturday in May.  thank you.  sorry if I missed that.  no that'  s okay.  I probably didn'  t explicitly say that.  the first one happens in May  every Saturday in May and the  second one happens Saturdays in  September and I think there'  s only four of those so we  go into October something like  that.  any more questions?  any more questions from the  commission?  I would like to make a motion.  okay.  I would like to make a motion  to approve the commission's  commission to conditionally  approve this item with  stipulations. The number one  stipulation would be to consult  with chico state whoever you  need to consult with over there.  and then also this would be a  conditional approval so  conditionally approved to bring  this back probably at the end of  May to reassess how it'  s gone.  so yeah I would like to make a  motion to conditionally approve  this with the assumption of  consultation with chico state and  with bringing it back.  see how the first go around  goes and then so your motion is  to approve it for May and then  bring it back at the end of May  and.  is there anything in  particular you might want to hear  about at the end of May?  attendance numbers.  level of chaos.  what did you say?  level of chaos.  level of chaos.  okay I'  ll develop a scale.  we hit the orange zone for a  second there.  we need a second.  before the second I have a  question about your stipulation.  m just trying to think about  with the chico state element I'  m not quite tracking to so  there we always can do  reservations there are you  stating because you are concerned  there might be evening classes  and so at the same time I'  m just trying to get an idea  of where the concern might arise  there.  no it'  s not as much of a concern as  just to make them aware what  will be happening right along  their property line and to just  kind of say.  so it'  s more to inform them.  yes.  so stipulation isn'  t just in case an objection  comes in.  okay thank you for that.  s just to say we'  re going to be having a  concert here on Saturday night.  okay thank you I just needed to  understand better.  sorry I should have been  working.  second question on the  motion.  does the two-step process  compromise your ability to put  the september program together?  I suppose a little bit.  yes.  let'  s assume that we'  re great at  fundraising and we receive this  funding it will be for a ten  show series.  if for some reason it'  s not approved by the !  s not approved after the may  run I will have to run it  somewhere else.  that will just be part of the  agreement of the funding.  so it certainly creates  uncertainty that I would prefer  to not have in place but that'  s what is needed.  s what'  s needed.  I think historically the  thursday night and friday night  concerts in the plaza haven'  t created any serious problems  have they?  no.  okay.  so.  and just to add on to  that.  so I think that the  the  new new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  new  there's a possibility that  Other events may have reserved the area during that time there also might be a possibility that we don't have meetings because summertime  we get  Our meetings cancelled occasionally if we don't have a quorum because people are vacationing etc. So  Right now we're waiting for a second. I have a substitute motion if we don't get a second  I  Should actually I'd actually like clarification on the what our agenda says then and that is it says recommendation for conditional approval  What were those conditions  initially, so the conditions are  listed in a  Standard reservation. There's a list of conditions  so  with any reservation is the  recommendation is  always gonna say a  Recommendation for approval with conditions or something like this  And that just covers that okay, you see the conditions you agree to all the conditions  It's it's just a standard language that we put in there  Shane I have a question wouldn't you normally from the parks apartment just maybe send over  information  Sheet to Chico State Police Department and just say we're gonna have this event. Does that can that occur?  it would be on the applicant to  Take care of that as a good neighbor. We could do that, but it's on the applicant and the person that's having the event  We haven't had a concert series in children's playground for several years and  For this applicant to reach out to Chico State as a good neighbor. I would highly recommend that  I'm gonna be happy to do it  actually that would give me an excuse to form that relationship and I think there's a lot of opportunity to partner with campus as the  series matures I  Assume you'll let the DCBA know too. So but downtown business owners will know and maybe they have to  Trace embrace will have to add a few extra staff or you know  So I think that is part of being a good neighbor. It sounds like yeah. Yeah, and because I currently work with them  This is definitely been topical conversation and Shane  if we say we  Conditionally approve the ten concert series if the first series turns out to be a disaster we can always bring it back to the  Commission and cancel it  We wouldn't even have to bring it back to the Commission if it's a disaster or if something goes  Absolutely sideways during the concerts. They just don't continue that doesn't have to come back to Commission. We could do that in my office  Okay, so  That contingency is covered. Yes, then there's really no reason to  Bring it back the end of May. I  Don't I don't see a reason for that. Okay. Okay. I'll withdraw my motion. Okay, or you can amend it  I'm just you can just a minute to approve  Take out the second step. Yeah. Okay. I'll amend my motion make a motion to I'll amend my motion to  Conditionally approve item number 5.2  I  I  And I'll say with  I'll still say with the  Expectation of notification and or consultation of nearby neighbors  Second okay discussion  If we talk this thing to death, okay, let's have a vote  Commissioner Nava  Yes  Commissioner Nichols aye  Commissioner Paiva yes commission she read not present Commissioner Thomas Petty. Yes vice chair Blatchley  chair Willis  Thank you  I  I !  To the For the reservation for space 12? For the little family memorial. Did that get pulled? It was on the consent agenda.  To the It was on the consent agenda.  To the  To the  To the  To the  To the  To the  the last time we met in august we  talked about the master  management plan and the  facilities portion of master  management plan and also touched  on the current bench donation  policy.  I requested the commission to  review that section of the  master management plan and come  back to you with any  recommendations this evening.  Based on your recommendations  and some information that I will  share with you from what I'  m seeing in the master  management plan my idea is to  come back next meeting with a  list of priorities that we could  work on for projects for the  next one to five years for  facilities.  And then we could even look  further out but I think a  wonderful opportunity to come  And I think that five year chunk  is a good place to start.  With that commissioner nava has  supplied a written list of  recommendations which I will  share with commission and also  include in the next park and  playground commission packet for  the next meeting and with that  I'  m curious if other  commissioners have recommendations on projects that you would like to see.  Thank you.  You have a list?  okay.  okay.  Perfect.  Other commissioners?  right now you just went  projects potential projects for the  next three to five years not  observations on the document  itself.  right.  the document itself is in desperate need of updating so we could all day long red mark that thing and be like this doesn'  t apply here.  There'  s a lot of that in there.  I think my interpretation of the council direction is for the commission to come up with a project list so we could start requesting capital projects for the next one, five, ten, 15 years.  I think it'  s wise for us to take smaller bites  and focus on  five years out on our immediate needs for facilities.  my principal observation is  the fire plan for the  park is just very broad in  general.  To see that specific fire  prevention projects were  incorporated in the capital plan for the next five years.  the  the vegetation management  part of the master management  plan and the vegetation fuels  management plan and we'  seeing the council is allotting  more funds to vegetation fuels  management and vegetation  projects in general. We'  re  also well on the way of  obtaining a maintenance  agreement with the california  department of fish and wildlife  that will allow us to do quite a  bit more vegetation fuels  management in our greenways  that'  s something that'  s without that  permit we'  re limited on what we  can do as far as maintenance but  we'  re very close to  obtaining that. The vegetation  fuels management plan provided  permit required for us to obtain  that permit to move forward.  We'  re also looking at  different preserve areas and  different things we can do  there. Also something we did  different this year usually we  have one company contracted for  grazing animals like goats and  sheep this year we have a  primary company but then two  others we can use because when  we only have one we'  re limited  availability but now we have a  couple others on the books we  can spread that out a little bit  more so I foresee that we'  ll be  doing more grazing in 2026 as  long as funding is available.  what I'  m understanding you to say  that fire issues are more  appropriately addressed through  the vegetation management plan  and not the parks management  plan?  no in the master management  plan the section we'  re focusing on now is  facilities. Within the master  management plan there'  s a section  that'  s dedicated to vegetation  which we'  ll dive into more in the future.  thank you.  you'  re welcome.  I have a question this is for  shane. I guess looking through  facilities we'  facilities I would like to know  before I approach it the way you  want me to approach this what  your ideas are as far as  facilities goes what your  priority list is in here what do  you think should be addressed  first? Playgrounds the golf course  the equestrian area the swimming  areas obviously one mile that  rehabilitation is our priority  s already in the works. I  would like to know if you want  to share now or maybe next  meeting what your priority list  is. I'  ve put together a priority  list exactly like you'  re describing. I'  ll share that with the commission  between now and the next meeting  so you can take a look at it and  see if your thinking is along  the lines or you may have  suggestions maybe we should do  s a good question. The way I  broke it out from looking at the  master management plan is by  sections like lower park what'  s needed  there picnic sites one mile  area bathroom facilities  caper acres cedar grove five  mile these types of things. It'  s going to be a lot of back and  forth dialogue before we actually  come up with a priority list.  have a meeting at the end of the  year at our January meeting that  will be far enough along to say  these are our priorities for  January or 2026 based on funding  available and then we could make  requests for capital project  funding depending on what the  priority list is and then go from  there.  thank you.  about a year and a half ago we  had a presentation in reference to  sycamore pool revitalization  project has that grant been  submitted?  I want to say that that  grant didn'  t go forward but I would  have to go back and research that.  I remember that conversation happened  something that was happening but  as far as moving forward from  there it kind of fell off but  I will double check that.  it was from river partners  and then it was their document  said it was supposed to be  submitted August 1 of 2024.  I don'  t know.  I'  m doubtful right now there  are some projects that are  river for the  one-mile dam area and also  five-mile for different passage  projects but that'  s really early in discussion  right now.  thanks.  moving forward a little  bit on the signing I'  m curious  that the commission had a chance  to talk about the  commemoration of the  any thoughts that you would like  to share on that tonight or  through e-mail or whatever.  yes commissioner nava.  I do have a question on it.  I believe it was like a three  bench limit annually that can be  added to have the commemoration  type thing and or bench  whatever.  and then there was of course a  certain price point which you  had said it'  s probably gone up  significantly since then but I'  m curious what do you know from  back then what the thought process  was to limiting it to the three  out of curiosity?  I think the three bench limit  was there'  s probably a few different  thoughts on that one to where we  would get inundated by bench  requests which happened anyway.  The three bench limit was a  The waiting list got completely  out of control.  It was almost a full-time job for  someone to keep track of the  request for benches that were  being made.  Also our maintenance staff was  there doing the installation so  it'  s a matter of what their  availability was to install the  benches and then maintain them as  well.  Where we are today with the  Three benches a year is  unrealistic.  Even one.  How do you select the one that  I think in my research the bench  donation idea was twofold.  At that time we didn'  t have the bench  infrastructure so we had plenty  of availability and it was also a  fundraising idea.  It was very popular.  A lot of people decided to go and  do the bench donation and the  purchases and the plaques.  And when that was all happening  the people that had the benches  placed it was forever.  There was no time limit on  maintenance.  So now we'  re in a  situation there'  s an expectation that we'  m maintaining these benches  ongoing without any additional  funding or anything like this.  If a tree falls on a bench it'  s not very long after that I'  ll get a call from someone just  recently from north carolina  that said I heard that the bench  that I donated 15 years ago was  destroyed but when are you going  to fix it?  We don'  t have the means to operate under  those.  It'  s a different time.  Our maintenance staff is very  limited.  If I believe if I recall in the  master management plan the bench  donation policy should have been  reviewed either I'  m pretty sure every five  years.  It hasn'  t been reviewed for several  years.  So there'  s a lot of things to talk  about.  The memorial benches people that  call and request them there'  installing any memorial benches  for at least a decade now that we  haven'  t taken any.  It'  s just the update to the policy  is going to make that official.  Because right now it'  s like we have a moratorium but  maybe that will change.  What I'  m looking for is to update that  policy to make it realistic for  what we can do in the park.  Plainly we just don'  t have enough room to install  more benches.  I'  m going to offer to do a little  research.  Maybe there'  s another way we can honor  people in memoriam in the park  besides the bench.  I was just doing googling I know  I'  m not supposed to do that.  On other ways that parks and golf  courses to honor people I know.  It sounds like we'  re working on that.  re maxed out on benches now and  the upkeep on them has always  been an issue.  Maybe planning a tree memoriam  and funding like that.  Our tree department could always  use money and that'  s a beautiful  way to memorialize somebody.  I'  ll bring that back to the next  meeting to maybe some creative  someone in the park.  appreciate it.  What I'  ve been doing is suggesting  people could purchase personalized  brick for cape breakers, $100.  A lot of people have taken  advantage of that.  It'  s affordable for most.  They'  re way more than $1,500 now.  That really excludes a lot of  fee between $350 up just for the  plaque itself.  If someone wanted to put a plaque  on an existing bench that has a  plaque already that'  s permissible according to the  bench donation policy.  That space is not exclusive.  That'  s an option for people.  Another option which I'  m really excited about is once we  the park and the  affordable and a metal kind of  vine trellis that goes around  and people are going to be able  to purchase personalized leaves  so that would be a good option  to and also again affordable and  very low impact on the park.  that sounds great and we can  have the appendices be city of  chico and the city of midwell  park and the city of chico and  the city of midwell park and  we can have the chico memorial  policy instead of the bench  policy and we saw those leaves  and we went to a breakfast.  Where do you see what they'  re going to do to the  fence in cape ricketts? It is  amazing what these artists have  done I'  m really excited  about it these are high school  kids and I'  m getting  a lot of ideas and I'  s going to be a good  option.  yes.  do you want suggestions now on  the bench or do you want it next  meeting?  if you have suggestions now I  will take them now and then I  can take those suggestions and  put them all together.  it was interesting you said  they could have more than one  would have done that because I  could see some family seeing  somebody who'  s been dedicated to  and said I don'  t like them I want my son or  like the hatfields and mccoys on  the same bench I got a little  worried about that one. The only  other one I had is you made a  standard design you said is the  existing plaques. I would just  change it to a verbiage of what  the standard design will be that  way they'  re all the same.  What is existing plaques?  The only other one I had was you  and your definition of the system  of the plaques you had to strike  a balance with meeting the needs  of all park users. I would  eliminate that portion of the  wording and just leave it  protecting the park environment  and ecosystem and include the  words visitor safety for your  park. You'  re not going to be able to  balance the needs of all park  visitors.  that would be fantastic if we  could we try.  I know you do but I'  m just saying.  thank you.  one other question I had when I  was up there I was looking at  it and I thought since that'  s the upper park where  everybody has their dogs do you  get inundated with dog names for  memorials for the benches or have  you ever said it'  s just humans?  I can defer to kathleen on  this too. We'  ve done a lot of research on  the bench just updating the  inventory was pretty labor  intensive and I can'  t recall any animals in  there do you?  no.  it came to my mind about my  dog.  thank you.  you'  re welcome.  anyone else on this side?  we'  re moving on to the parks  division report.  do you need us to do a motion  on some of the items that our  children have in the park  information that we need to do  a motion on?  no.  we have a motion on the  is it on the park building  or is it on the same ground?  the recommendation was just to  provide direction further  direction. it'  s an ongoing discussion. I  don'  t think there'  s a recommendation for  I appreciate that. thank you.  I would think the only motion  we would need if we'  re going to pull the plug  on this and I don'  t think we'  re going to do that.  thank you chair willis.  a lot of things have happened  since we'  ve met last.  pearson drive and south park  drive the six-month trial period  of the closure had ended. that  item went back to council and it  was decided to reverse revert  back to the schedule of seven  days a week open at 11 a.m. to  vehicle traffic. we'  re right back where we  started with that one.  the latest on big chico creek  and water quality sampling.  butte county public health has  been looking at different  options to expedite the testing  process without the involvement  of the cdc. they'  ve been in contact with the  ve been in contact with a lab  to where they could get that  done in about a month. they'  re in the park testing the  water last week. they have those  samples submitted and they'  re expecting to get a return  on those tests by the end of  november. we'  re anxiously awaiting those  results and hopefully we are  0157 e coli clear.  before you move off the  topic did they grab the test  when it was still warm or once  it had cooled down?  it took them a little  while to secure the testing  for the 0157. we had that period  of time where we had that huge  amount of turbidity in the creek  where it was running like a  chocolate river. they couldn'  t do testing during that time  because it would clog their  testing equipment so they had to  wait for the water to clear.  water temperatures they haven'  t dropped that much. we haven'  t my pool water and the creek  water are almost the same  temperature. we have to wait  to wait for the water to clear.  it'  s a little chilly but it'  s still swimmable as of last  week. that'  s when they'  re doing the testing. water  temperature may play into the  results of that test. I don'  t know.  thank you.  is there a corollary to that  did they ever narrow down the  source of the infection?  they'  re still trying to do that.  they did some more testing in  the golf course area to see if  s any type of animal  correlation. to be determined.  thank you.  do you have a question?  no.  okay. the iron canyon fish  ladder project has been moving  forward with the road  improvement work was completed  last week. the work they did on  upper park road is incredible.  it'  road work is made a very big  difference compared to how loose  that gravel was. they did a lot  of rolling of it. the rolling  dips they had to make some  modifications for those just so  the crane wouldn'  t bottom out. there'  s a little bit of  redesign. they completed that  work at the end of last week.  they'  ll be done with that road work  until spring. anticipated that  late spring is when they'  ll continue with  that and start working on getting  the crane up there for the iron  canyon fish ladder project. that  project depending on weather  migration patterns, the earliest  fall of 2026 most likely 2027 is  when that project will be  completed is what we'  re looking at now.  could you repeat that?  the timeline.  earliest of fall winter 2026  they can only be working in the  waterway at certain times like  non-migratory times. that limits  that. early would be 2026 most  likely 2027 though. fall.  last time we talked a little bit  about the waterway.  the 5 mile and some camera  installation and stream gauges.  those have been installed. we  were on a call with them today.  it will be interesting to see  just data moving forward about  the flow of big chico creek and  different spots like a manzanita  bridge at the 5 mile diversion  and then going into sycamore  channel and lindo channel.  also butte county public works  they completed their first phase  of the sediment removal project  at 5 mile. it will be interesting  to see what happens this winter  with those flows and how the  water responds. we'  re moving forward there  making progress. the eucalyptus  removal project went well. very  well received from the public.  didn'  t hear any complaints  about it even though at first  glance it'  s pretty dynamic the  change there. but in just doing  research at other places that  have done this eucalyptus  removal it'  s happening all over.  people have realized the fire  danger and the invasive nature  of the eucalyptus. I'  m very happy that we had the  donations from the public. we'  contributions from friends of  bidwell park and private donors  and our city contributions to get  that project done. moving  forward we'  ll do some restoration  in the area and do some native  planning as weather allows and  what makes sense so we'  re successful. a lot of people  have asked about the stumps  there. right now the stumps are  being treated for resprouts but  recently i came across near the  golden gate bridge they did a  huge eucalyptus removal project  there and they discovered or  they'  ve been using a particular  type of fungus to put on the  eucalyptus stumps that  accelerates the decomposition  process dramatically. I'  m looking forward to  researching that a little bit  more maybe collaboration with  chico state and some other  departments that might be  interested in doing some  monitoring on that. I think  that'  d be a really interesting  way to take care of those stumps  and make sure that we' !  lots going on in the volunteer  program we had the 38th annual  bidwell park and chico creek  cleanup with the butte  environmental council over 600  volunteers came out for that  event. We were focused as the  parks division with our crew of  volunteers at a hot spot over on  big chico creek at nord avenue  up to rose avenue that area gets  very impacted it'  s very difficult to  remove the debris there. During  that event with about 50  volunteers we removed six tons  of material just from that  corridor there. We'  re very proud of that.  make a difference day last  Saturday there'  s over 30 volunteers  that worked in the one mile area  and they really focused on  removal of grapes and invasives.  cave the community action  volunteers and education program  has resumed for the fall and  they meet every friday in the one  mile area and they'  re doing vegetation  work. We also have college core  has resumed they'  ve been working on the  eucalyptus restoration area of  re working on  removing other types of  invasives such as hackberry the  smaller types of invasives so  they don'  t get out of control with  additional sunlight they'  re receiving. They'  ve been  spreading chips in various areas  and now they'  re working on vegetation  behind the card center.  Finally chico state recreation  hospitality and parks management  department has adopted a spot in  the south one mile area and  they'  re working on  a new project on the !  with lindsey at the home she'  s doing an incredible job with  the volunteer program she'  s putting  out a lot of feelers really  reestablishing a lot of  relationships with the chico  state and big chico creek  ecological reserve so she'  s been a very  busy young lady so doing very  well with the volunteer program  and by our next meeting I figure  new  creek and I hope you have any  questions that concludes the  park division report.  notice the absence of rich  so we'  re not going to have  a tree division nothing  significant to report this time.  I have one question I haven'  t gone to look myself but I  question I did read that there  are eucalyptus on the other  side of the creek to in that  same area.  I saw that friend is a  bidwell park host. I'  ll have to follow up on  that and see because if there  are we do need to address those  because we'  ll get into the same  type of situation and they'  ll spread.  thank you.  thank you.  ll look into that.  thank you.  thank you. You'  ve been busy.  never a dull moment.  I know it'  s like there'  s so much going on I so  appreciate your work thank you.  I had a question about the  gauges that are at five mile and  I'  m wondering how frequently  does the data come back to you  or someone who'  s watching how fast the  and how quickly is it rising at  any given moment? I'  thinking of very rapid rise in  creeks and rivers and I'  wondering how closely that data  is monitored. thank you.  the scholar may have more  information on that but that  is just getting online right  now so I don'  t have a good answer for  that.  that'  s a good question the  project will be online up and  running before the major storms  hit us. Critical staff will have  access to the stream gauges as  well as the camera at the five  mile diversion area and there'  s an additional stream gauge  being installed over the  manzanita bridge in that area  just downstream. Shane may have  touched on that sorry. He already  did. Those streams will be  available on the c deck site as  well. We will be working on  that as well. That'  s the ultimate plan is to  get them on to that state c deck  clearing house site. They will  be publicly available in that  sense where everybody can see  that data in real time. However  the stream gauges will also be  accessible to certain staff that  are going to monitor it. Butte  county in particular has vested  interest in monitoring the water  any other questions?  this pertains to the management  plan because I have a question  about naming stuff. Like wildwood  park got renamed veterans  memorial park is the word  memorial in there or just  veterans park?  wildwood.  I was trying to remember too.  I was wondering if you were  name of the street that  corresponds or was it literally  just isolated to the park?  that'  s a good question. I  haven'  t heard. I don'  t foresee it changing the street  name but I may be wrong. I  haven'  t heard anything like that.  my other was about the  duration you perceive for this  entire thing. I'  m sorry I didn'  t ask earlier I was trying to  remember it during that section what my question was. Getting older. Are you  perceiving that when we get into the other sections that that'  s going to take us through 2026 or was there some other timeline laid out for you?  Because my thought is if I was some staff where I have stuff where I know my  sections I would appreciate a heads up going hey, kind of like these gals, people who like to  research and make sure they have current data to provide you aren'  t put on a hot seat and don'  t have as much time. So building capacity it seems like they'  s a good question. I think there could be some things happening in  tandem with city staff being alerted like hey fire section. We need that data from you guys we don'  t have that data. The same for other sections that are relevant to people like CARD. There were a lot of things where it was like ask CARD if they'  re done with it. Is this done? Is that done? Are people maybe going to give Annabelle a heads up and say can you check these sections do a word search for CARD and make sure all your stuff looks good? Is there something we need to do?  I think the question is not a question but a question. We need to know so it'  s collaborative along the way and we don'  t stack it up at the end. Just a thought.  processing everything you just said?  this is a huge undertaking. We haven'  t been asked to revise the master management plan. We'  ve been asked to come up with a list of projects based on the data that we'  basically but as we'  re going  through this exercise it'  clear this master  management plan should have been  updated long before this and I  think going through this  exercise is really going to  illustrate the desperate need  for an update to the master  management plan and I'  m  predicting that'  s going  to come out of this at least  some conversation to start  putting aside funding because it  something like that but it  was almost like the prior  master management plan to this  was a good start this one'  s a little  beefier I think it would be  starting from ground zero for an  update so I don'  t know how  expensive it would be but it  seems to me it would be a half  million dollar project or more  million dollars but some of  these places they'  re not  even there anymore. We'  ll see how  that goes but I do understand  what you'  re requesting and I can  make that happen. Before I  forget probably the most  important update for the evening  is if you haven'  t heard our public  works director of om&m Eric  gustafson is promoting to  assistant city manager and his  first day officially is next  Monday. It'  s November  1st is effective but his first  day will be next Monday. Just  to say publicly my experience  working under Eric has been  absolutely exceptional and  incredible. He'  s been a fantastic leader of  public works on m. I'  s going to be available to us  but he'  s going to be very  busy but we'  re very happy for him  and I think he'  l do fantastic in his new  position.  that takes care of the agenda.  one more moment. I want to  make sure we'  re recognizing the  volunteers you mentioned here  because it'  s an incredible amount of work  that you mentioned. I want to  run down the list here. You  said 600 volunteers came out on  cleanup day. You said make a  difference day had another 30  people. You said cave which I  know about 10% of chico state  students are involved in cave  not all working in the park but  a ton. Cave college core which  college core chico state is one  of the largest participants in  college core in california.  Then chico state you said  you had the volunteers from  the rec department. I want to  give a shout out to all of the  volunteers because there are so  many hours that they are doing  and lindsey I understand you'  re the one who'  s working with that so thank  you for your time with that. I  want to say thank you to that  because literally the park would  not be what it is today with the  staff and the volunteers that  come out so regularly so thank  you for that and thank you for  that come out and we average  about 20,000 hours a year  volunteer service. I neglected to  mention that just in the beginning  of october we had our annual  volunteer appreciation recognition  barbecue which is very well  attended. A lot of long time  volunteers come there and we do  recognition for years of service  special recognition for different  projects and things. Then like  cave students we usually will do  thank you.  folks know we do appreciate  the time and effort they'  re putting in  the park.  just a little bit of  institutional memory here when we  got a written report we used to  get a chart that charted all the  volunteer hours. That might be  nice to have at least once a  year maybe a yearly report  instead of every time. Every  meeting I know it'  volunteers that we used to get a  chart that showed us. That was  really nice to see.  I'  m sorry.  I was actually speaking with  lindsey about that today and  explaining that we still track  that every month so that chart  still exists it'  s not in a  written package and as lindsey  starts presenting volunteer  information she will give you.  programs and these were the  highlighted events. It will be  part of the verbal report I will  give an overview of the updates  of general park information and  she will give you an update of  what' s going on with the  volunteer program and any  significant donations.  I also might note a  substantial contributor to those  events.  I will give you a heads up  about the next meeting.  I will give you a heads up  right now.  I will give you a heads up  right now I will not be here.  It'  s my birthday.  and b I probably will still be  wearing a cap.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
