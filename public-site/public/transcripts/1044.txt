 Heather Pyle, M.D.: Hello everyone and welcome to peak agenda training for peak minutes today, my name is heather pile i'm a product training specialist here at grant and kits.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: it's good to see you all again I know some of you have been with me all week going through your peak agenda management solution, and this is our final day, so what we have in store for today, this is considered session for.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Of the peak solutions or sessions outline, so I believe most everyone who's on this call or sometimes if you go back and listen to the recording.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Ideally, we would want you to start with session one so we began this week with an overview of your media manager site administration settings and your peak.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: agenda management administration settings that was session one and then on session two we went over drafting and approving items within your system.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: session three was for agenda coordinators, so we went over creating new calendar agenda calendar dates in the system and publishing the agenda and, finally, this brings us to session four so we will be.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: processing our minutes and publishing them to our view page so this session is specifically for peak clients who are going to be processing their minutes in the peak system.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So if you are streaming your meetings live with the grant and kiss streaming solution.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: You would not attend this session so usually we have a little bit smaller group so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: we'll move on to peak minutes, so this is day four or considered the the last session, so our adventure is almost near an end.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And this is what we'll cover today so we're going to start with an overview of minutes in peak and the information there and then, once we begin with our meeting will go over taking roll call and attendance will review how to record motions votes and notes within the.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Peak minutes application and then we'll be publishing those minutes to our view page so pretty simple and straightforward.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Excuse me, as everyone already knows, we are live and this session is being recorded, so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: I will continue to upload this recording onto your media manager sites into your archive folders so you can look there for a copy of this session and then.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: i'm just a reminder that I do encourage you to ask questions through the chat box, and if you have a question specific to your site setup or design, please.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: direct those to your project manager or product trainer and again thanks a lot for your participation this week and let's get right into our peak minutes training, so I have my web browser open and we're going to be utilizing again the grannicus university.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: grannicus platform or media manager site so when it comes time to process your minutes, you will log into your media manager site, which will be your.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: jurisdiction or agency name dot grannicus.com and from there you'll enter your username and password that's given to you by your administrator.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then, once you sign in typically the minutes processors sometimes our administrators in this site media manager, so you may be brought to.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: This page media manager or your administrator may have set your login so you go directly to the peak agenda APP here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And you're on the dashboard so if you're brought to this page just a quick a few pieces of information as it applies to processing minutes.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: This site, the grannicus platform that is also known as media manager is the primary function is to manage the view pages that are the landing pages for your the public and your constituents where they're going to be viewing the information that we are.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: producing and publishing from peak so when we are publishing.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Our minutes the view page that we're sending that information information out to is managed from this site.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So I just need to make a quick setting change here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So here under the administration is where those view pages are managed and your site may only have one view page that's labeled new view or default view.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: But you can have additional view pages setting so today we're just going to be monitoring the past events of you page when we process our minutes so i'm going to.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: double click here and open up this page.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then know this page in your system might be configured slightly differently and you will have the ability to customize this somewhat your product trainer will will help you with those functions when you work with them one on one.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: But what we're going to be working on today is we're publishing minutes so it's going to be here under prior meeting content and you may have this label differently as well.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So we're going to process the minutes for the city council meeting here that occurred yesterday on February 2.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Our end goal here today is to get the minutes minutes published to this column for this February 2 city council meeting so we'll be popping back.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: To this page to verify that information and this just opened a new tab in my browser so i'm going to toggle back over into my meeting manager site so again, if you land on this page once you login.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And you wanted to manage your view page or enter your view page from the back end of the system.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: you'll go to admin views and then double click that that specific view page and once your system is ready to go live your project manager will help you get those view pages connected to your live system.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Now from here i'm going to navigate over to my peak site so i'll go to my Apps drop down menu and move from the granite because platform again, we also call this media manager.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: into peak agenda, and this is going to bring me directly to my dashboard so if you've had the opportunity to review or attend.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Any of the prior peak group training sessions you're very familiar with this dashboard at this point, so the information here as it applies to.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Your minutes creators or minutes processors is from here, we can use the dashboard to go right in and process the minute so of course this the dashboard always shows the for.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Current or upcoming meetings so of course the meeting we're processing for us in the past, so if we toggle back one.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: you'll see this is the meeting that we're getting ready to go.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: process our minutes for there are two different ways to access the meeting minutes within peak.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So the first way is from this dashboard we can select our meetings i'm just going to click on this meeting, this will take us to the agenda, of course.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then, at the top of the agenda once the agenda is published, it gives you a link to view the minutes, so this is how you would access the minutes from here i'll just click view minutes.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And this brings us into our minutes processing page so if you've never seen this.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Before this might be the first time you're seeing this but we're going to spend a great deal of time in this screen today.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: But I just want to back up a step and show you so that the first way that you can get into peak minutes from your dashboard.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Open the meeting agenda and then click the link into the meeting minutes or the other way that you can access your peak minutes is from the meetings tab in the summary column over here on the left.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: If we look for our.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: meeting in here, we can click on the link here into the minutes, so this is the second way that you could access so i'll click in here, and this brings us directly into our minutes screen again where we just worked so two different ways, you can access your minutes.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Now from this screen up here in the top left just below our our different tab sections we've got the, of course, the identifying information about our meeting body and the date and time.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then we have a quick link here back to the view the agenda, so we can be.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: toggling back and forth from the agenda, if we need to while we're processing these minutes just by clicking this button so i'm going to click here view agenda and you'll see where.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Here we are at the agenda for the city council meeting, and then we can click view minutes again from here and toggle directly back into the minutes.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Now below that information in this Gray box, this is where we're going to be spending our time processing this information so i'm going to start with a quick overview of the information that seen here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then, before we start processing.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: These minutes i'm going to take you to a view a few pieces of information in administration, so if you are a peak administrator you have this option on this box up over here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And just to point out or or reference how some of the information that populates on this page is listed as options if, in case you need to edit or change any of that information.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So, starting here in the left hand column we've got the roll call, so this is going to be the first button that will choose once we're ready to start processing our minutes.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: It does look a little misleading because the checkbox is already checked, so it almost appears as if a roll call has already been taken.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: But it has not, and the reason we know that is because, once we confirm the roll call there will actually be some more information here to the right of that box so we'll see that in just a moment, once we start that process.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then below where you select the roll call is of course a list of your agenda all of your agenda sections and your different items on this specific agenda so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: As we're working through.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Through this process will be selecting that specific header or item and then with that selected over here in this box.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: The information we enter here is of course going to be applied to that specific item on the agenda, you can see, once I selected the first item it's listed up here in this box, so this summary box as we begin.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Processing information and saving it is going to give you kind of a summary of the information you've entered below.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Now down here, there are two different categories so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: The first one is the motion tab, which is where we're processing information for an item the motion tab is of course where we're putting our motion text.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: and entering our voting information and then you can toggle over to the notes and here's where you would be entering that information.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So there's two different sections within here, so I do want to point out a couple things within this box as it relates to the motion so we've got a list of all of our office members are voting members.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So this is.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: populated.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: From administration it's attached to this particular meeting body, the city council so we'll go i'm going to point out where that information is held within administration.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: This is also going to determine the list of people who populate you when you go to take the roll call.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So there's this voting information comes from administration and then also down here the motion to drop down menu.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: These list of options, this is populated within administration, so if you need to add or edit any of these.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: will be an administration.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: will go through that in just a moment, and also the results, so all of the information contained in these fields down here, you can manage those in administration as well.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Before we jump into that I just want to point out a couple other things just in the overview of this page so here's where we'll be changing the status to final.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Once we've completed our minutes and then we'll download a draft using this button and we'll publish it to our view page using this one so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: that's kind of an overview of everything that we're going to be working on.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then, if we want to do a little bit of a quick review of what's going on within this minutes screen here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: i'm just gonna take a quick pause and grab a sip of water, so if anyone has a question or comment go ahead i'll check the chat window looks like we're doing okay so far.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: You guys were all really quiet yesterday, so I might I might ask everyone, someone else just to send me a message or an emoji so I know you're still out there, and can hear me.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Okay, so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: i'm going to click into the admin section.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And show you how this.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Voting list is populated and where the motion to and results information is populated as well, so from admin.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: we're automatically into the meeting bodies section so in these sections over here we're in meetings and meeting bodies by default, and so, if I go into my city council.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: meeting body sorry I need to scroll down here a minute to get to it so here's the meeting body that we're working with today and i'll click edit.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So we have the details section and then here's the office Member section.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So in the Members, this is where the system got all of those people who were listed as my voting Members and it pulled up these specific people because their status is active so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Keeping this accurate, of course, for that reason, is very important as you're managing your office Members as people are coming and going and their terms are ending.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: there's a few different ways, you may choose to manage them most of our clients prefer to only keep this list of the active Members so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: As your office Members terms are ending there i'm just simply coming over here and using the trash can to delete that Member and then coming up here and adding the new Member, so you can do it that way.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: You could also click on the pencil icon and edit the person's name and information, if you wanted to.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: or again simply add a new Member so when you add a new Member, it really is just important to have the status set to active the role and start and end date.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: don't really impact the system.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And they aren't going to impact our minutes at all that that's just really for your information, but it is important to always have their status is active, of course.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then this checkbox here voting Member, this is the system is automatically going to select them as a voting Member in the minutes when we take the roll call and i'll show you where this checkbox being defaulted here comes into play when we go back into take the roll call.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: One other thing about this Members list the order their names are listed here, this is.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: How these office members names are going to be listed in the voting list and on the minutes, so if you would like them to be in a specific order that's when you'll use the arrows over here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: To move around and rearrange them, so the order they're listed here is the order that they are going to appear on your reports and your voting and roll call information.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Now from here so again, we were in when we came into administration.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: We were in meeting bodies and then I just scroll down to found to find the specific meeting body.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Clicked edit.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then we were in the Members tab here how we manage them.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So the other thing that I wanted to point out in regards to your emotions and your result categories over here on the left that's going to be under the minutes category.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So I selected minutes and then we have your emotion to settings and below that are your emotion your results settings, so this is where you would manage the information populated in those fields.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: You will have some already entered in your system, but again.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then, if you need to add a new one, of course, you would just simply click add new record and label it here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: As you work within your system, you can always edit them if you wanted to edit the name, you would just click the pencil and then, depending on if you've used that action or not.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: You may be able to delete it eventually So you can see some of these the trash can is grayed out because these have already been used in my system so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: peak was not going to let me to ever delete these.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: But the ones that have never been used.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: I do have the.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: ability to click.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: The trash can and delete them so you can manage all of those actions that you're going to motion to within this section.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then right below that are the results information so basically you're managing these the exact same way your system does have some initially populated, you would just click add a new record to add a new motion result and then you can always edit the name or delete it if it has not already been used in your system.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So minutes over here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Motion to and motion results.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So from here, I am going to go back into my minutes so i'm going to access this through my meetings tab and i'm just going to go through the summary tab and click on minutes here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So we're back into our system and we're ready to start processing our information, so I do want to make one other quick note.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: This system is not designed to be recording your minutes information during the live meeting so we're going to be working from the perspective.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: That this meeting has already occurred and we are coming back later that day or the next day or that week to enter this information into the system to publish it so we're we're going to be from the perspective that the meeting occurred and now we're coming back later.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So when we first start off to process our minutes we're always going to start by entering the roll call information so you'll always start by clicking roll call you can see here's a list of my office members.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: i'll choose them present or absent and then here's that voting Member information so that checklist.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: box we were just talking about an administration, so all of these Members listed in administration have that voting Member checkbox selected in their.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: profile and that's why this is defaulted and checked within this screen, so you can always uncheck one if they're not going to be voting that day.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: But, of course, this is where you would enter your roll call information, so if you happen to have any office members.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Who maybe we're running late or had to leave early.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: That down here in the notes section is typically where our clients would enter that information, so if.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: we'll just say if Member Smith arrived late, you can enter that information here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then, once I click confirm attendance then you'll see it's added that attendance information just to the right of the roll call so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Once it's confirmed.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: you'll see this information listed here next to the roll call setting.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Now, after you've taken the roll call.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: there's one other step that we might want to do before we begin processing pressing the rest of our minutes, and that is the option to add an item so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: Some of our clients their jurisdictions or their specific meeting bodies are not allowed to add an item after the agenda has been published so.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: If they get into the meeting.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: or right before the meeting it's not allowed, but we do have quite a few clients who.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: would have an item added at the last minute to their meeting so i'm going to go through an example and show you what that would look like in case that, in case you could do that in your.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: For your meetings so i'm going to click the add item button here and it's going to give me the ability to type in the title of that item and then what section, I would like to place it to on my agenda so, for example, let's just say.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: I don't in here.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: So once I enter the title i'll choose which section on the agenda, I want this item to be placed in.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And I can add a note, such as item was added during the meeting or before the meeting.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: And then i'll click save so when I click save it's going to show me the item that I want to add to my agenda.  Heather Pyle, M.D.: so here, so here, so here, so here, so here, so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here so here  Peek will never let us create a new item for that same meeting date.  So if you do need to add an item to your minutes that was not part of your original agenda,  the ability has somewhat limitations in that you can only enter the item name.  I won't be able to add in any supporting documentation such as attachments in the system.  And it's really not going to be a file within the system anywhere.  So the only place this item resides is on this meeting minutes.  Itself.  So let me know if you have any questions about that function add item.  So I prefer to go in and add the items before I start going through and processing this information.  And some people like to start processing it.  And then when they get down to that section, they'll add an item.  So please do whichever order works best for you.  But typically, I would go through and add those items into the sections before I can begin processing them.  Now, from here, we're ready to start processing and entering our information.  So I'm just starting at the top, selecting my first agenda section.  So once I've selected it, it's selected over here in my summary window.  And then with this item listed here, all of the motions and notes that I'm entering are all going to be applied to that item.  Now, of course, you're not always going to be recording motions and notes on everything that you select.  And in this particular instance, the call to order, I'm just going to toggle over to notes and add that specific information.  So I'm going to go ahead and click save.  So starting off with just very simple entering your first note, I just typed the information in and I'll come down to the lower right and click save.  And now it's been added to my agenda.  This and this box here and indicates there's a note under that item.  And you can see the note was also added up here.  And then I can click down to my next selection.  Enter a note.  If needed, I don't have to enter a note.  I could record a motion and vote if some agencies do record that for roll call.  I won't do that on this example.  And I'm just going to do another example of entering a basic note.  And then when we move down to public to be heard, we'll talk a little bit more about some more detailed notes if you needed to.  So again, I'll select my invocation and pledge and  I'll click save.  Now, if I wanted to come back up here and edit this note, I'll just click on the one that I entered before.  You can see it brought me back up here and I can edit and save.  The system is not going to automatically save.  So you are always going to need to once you make a change, always come down to the lower right hand corner and save.  So I've edited my note.  And I can continue.  And move down.  You may have a specific agenda item that you don't record a motion and vote.  So you maybe have an award like this doesn't require a motion.  You might just enter a note underneath that information.  But I am going to use this item here as our first example to demonstrate how to record the motions and votes on an item once you get to it.  So I've selected my item here and you can see it's listed that information up here.  In the box.  So I'm going to go to the motions tab.  So I'll start by entering here the motion text.  And of course, this is going to be, you know, what we're motioning on or what we're motioning for.  So.  And then I'll choose my motion to.  At this point, we'll already know that our results will be.  And then I'll choose my motion to.  Passed.  And then over here, of course, I'll enter my voting information.  So I'll select my mover and seconder.  Some people think it's easiest just to mark everything for and then maybe just enter a few that may have been against.  So you can do that.  And you can also do clear all if you need to start over.  It popped up here to ask me if I was sure I wanted to clear that motion.  So I'm just going to answer this pop up and then start over again.  Okay.  So I'll go ahead and click on the next one.  So I entered my motion text.  I added my motion to in my result.  And then I just entered the check boxes here.  One thing I do want to mention in case anyone has noticed my option over here for my voting information seems to be a little duplicated.  So your system won't have that anything from here to the right.  I've got some lowercase versions of my voting options.  So.  That's just a glitch in my system.  So I hope that's not confusing to anyone.  But your system won't have it.  So you'll be okay there.  So I'm not we're not worrying about any of this information.  This here is probably more accurate to what your system looks like.  So I'm going to save that information.  And once I saved it, it populated up here in this summary box.  The motion that it was passed.  The motion text.  So we've gone through the process of entering that motion information for our first item.  Pretty basic.  As we move further down, we'll review that and go over a couple different scenarios that you might need to review.  So the first one is the motion text.  So the motion text is the section that you're going to be using to record while you're processing your minutes, such as recording multiple motions and votes.  So we'll start basic and we'll move up to a few of the more advanced options.  So speaking of advanced options on my public to be heard.  This is maybe where you might need to enter some more detailed notes.  So with this section selected, I'm going to go into the notes.  So if you've for those of you who've been participating in peak group trainings, you're familiar with this rich text editor box field here.  It holds 5000 characters and you can utilize all of the formatting options.  Very similar if you're using with any other editor tools such as word and additional editing formats here.  So this is these are all the same editing options that have applied when you're working in peak, whether you're entering item text, drafting an item or entering information in fields for your agenda sections.  So this might be where you're entering.  If you keep track of all of the people that you're working with.  If you keep track of all of the people who spoke, then you might have a list of people you would want to enter here.  So you can cut and paste, as everyone knows, into this box.  And this might be where you have a separate word document that you entered notes and you would cut and paste that information here.  So we always recommend that you paste as text.  That way we're going to keep utilizing the same font and point and save yourself less work from having to go back and change that information.  And then, of course, we'll keep your text information consistent throughout your course.  So you can also use the same font and point and save your entire minutes report.  So you can cut and paste into this field just like you can in all of these rich text editor fields within peak and utilize any of the other formats such as inserting links and advanced formatting sections.  And you really could even add a table in here if you want.  I know that probably wouldn't be required, but if you keep track of your people who spoke with a table, you could do that as well.  Okay.  All right.  Great.  quick note and click Save. So our next example here moving  down in our agenda is approval of consent agenda. And consent  agendas are I'm sure you all are familiar with the place on the  agenda where we're recording the same motion and votes for all of  the items contained in that section or in that area of the  agenda. And there's two different ways or two different  methods that you can process a consent agenda information  within peak. So the first way is you can record that information  on the section header itself, as I have highlighted here. So I've  selected the section header. And then in the motion tab, I'll  enter my motion text. My past is  hidden. So there we go, takes me a minute to find past in this  little drop down menu. And then of course, I'll do my mover and  seconder and mark Yes. So at this time, when I click Save, this is  going to apply all of this information just to the header.  So when we process our minutes report, it will just list all of  this information for all of these items. And then if we  happen to have one of these  items that was pulled from consent, we would go down to that  specific item and select it and then record the motions and votes  under that particular item. So if you record it on the header,  like I did here, that will apply to everything in that section,  except the particular items that you select separately and record  a separate motion and vote. So that's the first way you might  choose to process your motions and votes for your consent  agenda. Now, for the second one, I am going to  delete this. So this is this is also going to be a demonstration  of how to delete information that you don't want. So I've  selected my header. So the information up here in the  summary section, I'm just going to click the x over here on the  right, that's going to ask me if I'm sure I want to delete the  motion. And now it's removed all of the information that I've  entered. So basically, I'm starting over from scratch, in  entering the information that I placed here.  So now the second option or method that you have for  recording,  is to go to the ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  Well, maybe say one person was against. And then down here at  the bottom, it is grayed out right now it says apply to multiple  items. So this information obviously won't let me select  this now. But once I save it, and record this information to  this particular item, now I have the option with this item still  selected, and all of these motions and votes here to click  on the item. And so now the system is pulling all of the items that are in the same section as this one.  And I can click apply to all of these selected items. So if we're processing our consent agenda items this way, if an item is pulled, then you would just simply uncheck that item that was pulled and then you can process that one separately. So I'm going to click apply to the selected.  so now you can so so now you can so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so  And I'll save.  This might be an example where you would record a motion and vote and also enter a note, such  as this item was pulled from consent.  And then I'll click save.  So we've gone through those two options again, entering the information just on the section  header or selecting an individual item and entering the information and then using the  option to apply to multiple items within the system.  So I'm going to take a quick pause just to see if anyone has any questions.  I know that was kind of a lot of information showing two different versions.  And then from there, we'll move on to a couple other options for recording motions and votes  as we move down through this agenda.  Okay, so now I'm going to move on to these items here.  And I'm going to go ahead and select my resolutions.  So just again, a quick, quick review.  Once you select an item from the agenda column, it is listed up here in the summary panel,  you can record the motions in this tab and add any notes in this other tab.  Motions, I'll enter here.  Okay.  Also, so usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually Mover, seconder, mark all. And then of course you can go through and change any no votes and save. Now, another option that I want to show you moving on to this next one is if you happen to have multiple motions and votes and how you would record that information.  usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually  usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually  usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually  usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually usually  usually usually usually usually  So I'm going to go through the process of entering the regular motion information.  And let's just say, for example, that this one actually failed.  So we've moved and we voted and this one failed.  So I'm going to click save and now we want to take another motion and vote.  So I've saved that information and then up over here in the summary box, I would just click new motion.  And so as long as I have the same item selected,  I'm going to click save.  And I will begin recording another motion and vote.  So at this point, it's the same motion text.  So this one we may, you may do like approve as amendment or approve with amendments made depending on your terminology.  And this time we'll say this was passed.  Okay.  And then I'll click save and you'll see up here in the summary box that it will just add another motion and vote listed in that information.  So you can continue clicking new motion if they want to motion 10 times on an item, as long as you keep that item selected. Every time you click new motion you'll just click, you'll just keep recording that information for as many times as you need to.  Again, every time you record a motion and vote you'll always have the box here, so you can always X that to delete it and that lets you start over.  I do want to make one other point, there is a trash can up here in the summary box.  This trash can delete is going to delete this entire item off of your agenda and you typically wouldn't do that, or excuse me, off of our minutes and you typically wouldn't do that so just be careful with this trash can button because you probably aren't going to want to delete an entire item.  You're really going to want to  really just using these X's here to delete information and then re-enter it again.  So again, moving down through our minutes process now we're at the item that we added during the meeting so remember it's not going to have an item number.  This item is not going to exist anywhere in your PEAK system, except here on this minutes report, so the only information we're going to be able to add is  the name of it and, of course, any notes that you might want to add.  So I can click here.  You can see, these are the notes that I added when I first added.  You can always edit that information and  and then I'll save.  And then remember, I'm going to edit this.  And then after you save an item, it does give you the option to apply to multiple items, so this only can be used if you have multiple items in the same section.  So typically we would only use that if we're approving the consent agenda section, but you could potentially utilize it in other sections if you've got the same movers, seconder, and votes that you might want to apply.  Again, they just have to be within the same section.  So moving on down here,  I don't have any items in my PEAK system, so I'm going to go ahead and do that.  I don't have any items in any of my other categories, so I may want to enter a note that there were no items.  I'll come down here to adjourn and just add a meeting adjourned note.  And I'll click save.  So from this point, we've gone through the process of entering all of our minutes information that we took during the meeting.  And we're ready to run a draft and then publish our report. So I'm just going to take another quick pause to see if anyone has questions about the process for entering any of that information, notes or motions and votes, as it applies to consent items or individual items with multiple motions and votes.  Or if there are any voting motions and voting scenarios that you might have in your organization that you have a question about, I might be able to answer that today.  Or I might be able to ask questions about that.  I'll have to direct you to your trainer. So we'll just take another quick pause and and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  This might be a good time just to ask for if anyone just wants to send over a quick emoji. Perfect. Oh, thanks. We do have one quick question. Let me review this real quick.  So the question is, would we add details for motions that need to be recorded to the notes? So  as far as the details, are you referring to just detailed information that you would like included on your meeting minutes for the public to know about? Or are you talking more about details as far as the motion text?  If so, you would might use the motion text box here. Of course, this is just what you're motioning for.  But definitely the notes section is where you would provide any other additional details that you want the public to know about.  You have to have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a background so that the other players have a  a motion question text with the question mark so again the motion text here and when we process um  when we run a draft i think you'll see how the system is taking this information but that we're  just entering what you are motioning for and then um i think that should answer your question  because then i think you said i did perfect just to see  so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so  download a draft of our minutes, give them a review before we publish them.  So we're going to come up here to the upper right-hand corner and click download.  So you can download the minute summary in three different formats, either Microsoft Word, PDF,  or HTML. We are going to do two examples. We're going to download a PDF version first  and publish it, and then I'll download a Microsoft Word document and publish that version. It is  very common. A lot of our clients do use the download the Microsoft Word version and publish  that, so we'll just run through both scenarios. So I'm going to start by selecting PDF, which is  highlighted by default, and download this information. And then once this downloads to  my computer, I'll just pop this open, and this allows us to review the information here. So  the first time you run a draft of your minutes as you're practicing and working in your system,  as we've talked about throughout the  webinar, you're going to want to make sure that you're using the right format.  So in each of these reports, if you identify anything that you would like to change or any  adjustments that you would like to make, please just mark up that document and then send in the  marked up version over to your project manager, and that person will definitely make sure that  we get your reports designed and updated within your system. So here you can see is my roll call.  Here's the note that I entered about my roll call, that one particular member, and it was late.  And then as I come down through here,  You can see here's my information. So the motion text is here, approved to award an employee.  So that's the motion text, my voting information.  And now here's kind of an example here where you can see that in this PDF document, item five, the public to be heard, all of the notes are on another page.  And that is an example where sometimes our clients would prefer to keep that all together.  But because this is a PDF document, we aren't able to do that.  So this would be might be where we would choose that Microsoft Word document version.  So I'll show you that example next. But from this perspective, we'll just determine that this draft of our meeting minutes meets our approval as we scroll through here.  And that we would like to go ahead and publish this to our view page.  So I'm going to go back into.  My peak system.  Click here.  So now I'm going to click publish PDF.  I'm just going to have it generate automatically.  So the PDF version that I just downloaded is going to be exactly what's going to be published.  Notice it won't let me click publish PDF yet because I need to select what view page I want this published to.  So we're working with the past events view page.  And I'll click here now publish PDF.  And now I'm going to come up.  I left this tab open my past events view page.  So I'm going to refresh.  And then you'll see that down here under my prior meeting content.  So we were working on this city council meeting in here.  You can see our minutes are published.  The link is right here.  So the public would just click here and that would launch their version, your version of the minutes.  So I'm going to go back into peak now and show you that other example of downloading in Microsoft Word document.  document, and potentially making some edits and then uploading  that version. Again, that's definitely going to be the  probably the most popular. So I'm going to choose Microsoft  Word, and click download. And then this will just take a few  seconds and it does download is that format here in my lower  left. So now you can see I'm just I am simply working in  Microsoft Word. Sorry, I'll get it up here. So at this point, if  I wanted to make any edits to this section, move that on to  another page, or any of the other sections, you know, or  maybe even simply just remove a piece of information or change  something if I just want to say to be right off late. From here,  I will save this information.  So I'm going to save this information as a Word document  to my desktop, but I'm also going to save it as a PDF. So  when you publish this version of your minutes, PEEQ will only  allow you to publish a PDF version. So I did save the  Microsoft Word version. But I am now also going to save this as a  PDF. So the PDF version is the one that we're going to upload  to be published.  so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so  publish a PDF version of that document. So from this point,  now we're going to upload the version that we want. So I'll  click Choose File. And then as you can see, the system wants a  PDF. So it's only giving me PDF documents to work with. But one  of the most common mistakes that our clients do make, they do  forget that they have to have a PDF version of that Word  document. So I'm going to just browse here and and try to  upload this Microsoft Word document. So I'm going to pull  in the word, pick my view page, and try to publish. And then  you'll see here, I've got this warning. And this tends to throw  people off. It would be nice if it said, you cannot upload a  Microsoft Word document, please upload a PDF version that could  be a little bit more straightforward, but it doesn't.  So as you can see this error message, you don't have  permission to perform the action is a little confusing. So  this comes up if you are trying to upload a document that is not a  PDF format. So just keep that in mind, I'm going to go back, I'm  just going to arrow back here and come back into my meeting  minutes. And so what we'll need to do when we're ready to  publish that document, so click Publish, so upload, then of  course, we'll browse and we'll have to select the PDF version,  of course.  And then again, I have to  pick my view page. And I'll click Publish. So now I'm going  to go back out to my past events view page, we'll do a refresh.  And then you'll see that my city council meeting minutes, this is  now going to be the updated version where I didn't save the  right version.  So I'm going to go back to my previous PDF.  Back.  One more time.  Sometimes when I'm demonstrating this information, it's to show  you what not to do. So clearly, I didn't upload the right  version. So now I'm just going to browse to my computer, make  sure I know what's which is the right one that I want to open.  You have to have a background so that you have a background so  have a background so that you have a background so that you  have a background so that you have a background so that you have a  So again, I saved my Word document as Word and now I'm going to back in and back in and  save it as PDF.  That's the key point here.  And then just to review.  Since we're ready to publish this again, so I've got the right version that I'm ready  to publish, I'm going to upload one.  So I'm going to choose only a PDF file from my system.  Here we go.  Probably would have helped if I would have browsed to the right file folder where I had  saved that particular document.  So we'll come back and refresh our view page.  And now you'll see that we've replaced that minutes with the one that we have uploaded.  There it is.  Hooray.  So we've completed our main goal, which was to get our minutes published out to here.  As everyone knows, sometimes there is an option where you might want to unpublish that information  or take it down and then republish at a later time.  So you may have seen this.  When we were working over here in the publish PDF option.  But if we click unpublish, that will remove that information immediately from your view  page.  And then you can just republish the information when you're ready to.  So I'm just going to pause for a moment and see.  I don't see any other questions, but I'll just give you a few seconds to let me know  if you have any questions about the process for downloading and publishing your meeting  minutes.  And then I'll run through a review of everything we cover.  And one other step that I wanted to go over today that is most common with our clients  is once we've got these meeting minutes, the draft downloaded, a lot of times our clients  won't publish them until they've been approved on your next meeting agenda.  So you might be downloading the draft, but not coming back and publishing them until  after the next meeting.  So in that case, you would create a new item within your system and then you would attach  the draft version of your minutes.  You have to have a background so that the title of the title of the title of the title  of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the  title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the  title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the  title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the  So the first way is from the dashboard, you can scroll back to that date, open the agenda, and then from the agenda you can click view minutes and go directly into the minutes information.  The second way that you can access your meeting minutes is going to be from the meetings tab at the top, and then from the summary panel here, you'll click on the minutes link.  And that brought us here.  And then from this page, this is where we did most of our working in our information we have the view agenda toggle box up here so we as we're working on these minutes we can easily be toggling back and forth between the agenda, and the minutes for this particular  meeting.  And then once we started processing our information we started with the roll call, and if you remember the list of voting members here, and how they appear in your roll call.  call that's populated from peak administration under the body members category.  We entered a note if we needed to.  And then from here, we added an item that was added before the meeting.  So this would be an item that was not part of your original or revised agenda.  It was either added just before or during  the meeting, and we added that item by selecting a section.  Or I'm sorry, you can just click add item, and then the system will ask you to enter  the title and choose which section you would like to add it to.  Again, that item will not reside anywhere in peak with a file ID,  and also you won't be able to add attachments.  It's just going to exist here on this meeting minutes.  And then from here, we began processing our information.  So we selected a section or an item on the left, and then we filled in the  information regarding to motions and votes or added any notes over here on the right.  And then we talked about two different  ways  in which you can process your motions and votes for your consent agenda items.  When you have multiple items that you want to apply the same motions and votes.  So we talked about how you could enter that on the section header here.  And then if there was an item pulled, you could just  select that specific item and add the motions and notes separate.  Or the second option was choose one of the items within the consent agenda section,  enter all of that information, and then use the apply  to multiple items box down here at the bottom that appears.  So those are the two different ways.  From there, we continued entering motions and notes.  And we also did an example where there were multiple motions and votes  on this particular item here.  So as you've gone through and entered all of this information,  you can always click back on any information within the system and use the edit button to delete and reenter  the information again.  And from here, I can change the motion information or I would just click here to get access to any notes.  If I decided I wanted to delete a note, I would just simply remove the information and click save.  One final thing, once we've got all of this process,  we would like all of the peak users within the system to know that these  minutes are final.  And that indicates that you've published this information out to the public.  So changing the status here from draft to final, and then I'll click save.  What that will do is back up here on our dashboard,  any of our peak users who are scrolling through these meetings.  Oh, sorry.  That's for the agenda.  Here in the meetings tab, here we've got our minutes are final.  So changing that drop down menu populates it here.  So.  Any of our peak users who are reviewing the meetings information,  you've now changed this piece status of information.  I'll take another quick pause then.  We've gone through that review.  I might just real quickly, though, since we're reviewing, jump into admin real quick and just  review where the member settings and the motion information was.  So here in our meeting bodies, again, select your meeting body and choose the pencil icon.  And then your office members.  Okay.  And then your office members were coordinated within here.  So all of these people need to be in an active status in order to be part of the meeting minutes and selected as voting members.  And then also over here in the minutes category, these are where your selections for your motion to your actions and your motion results.  You can manage all of that within here.  And I'll go back to the dashboard.  Okay, perfect.  So still no questions.  So that's great.  I'm going to I'll move on to the one last piece of information that I wanted to share with you, or maybe just to review because it is a pretty common practice.  So if we wanted to create a new agenda item within the system for our minutes for this particular meeting, we would just create a new agenda item.  So this might be depending on how you label it.  So a lot of times people do have an item type of minutes within their system.  So this is now going to go on to my next city council meeting for the next date.  The drafter, of course, does automatically fill in.  And depending on if you have a minute section or a lot of places, we'll put it under their approval of consent.  So we're just basically.  Okay.  Creating a new item.  And then when we browse to add an upload, we'll just be selecting the meeting minutes as our upload file.  And then I'll click create.  So I'm not going to set up an approval process for this.  I'm just going to simply click create.  Sorry, I skipped a field that was required.  And typically, minutes do not have to go through your approval process.  So once you've got this item created,  generally you would come up and change it from in draft to set to approved.  And from there, you're ready to go.  This is all ready to go onto your next meeting.  And then once they are approved on the next meeting, then, of course,  you would move forward with publishing that information to your view page.  Perfect.  So this session does.  This session does.  The minutes session of your peak group training typically does take us the least amount of time.  So a lot of times we do end up not taking the full amount of time.  And definitely, if we don't get any questions from anyone, that does make the time go faster as well or doesn't take up as much time for everyone.  So at this point, I'm just going to take another quick pause, see if anyone has any final comments or questions before I conclude the meeting for the day.  So just do.  One last check in.  If you want to just send a quick emoji my way, that would be great, too.  And remember, everyone, that all of these  the recorded videos from all of these sessions are saved on your media manager site.  And I'm going to toggle over there real quick.  So remember to go from peak back to your media manager site.  You'll use the apps and you'll go back into the Granicus platform.  And then in your archives tab, you will have a folder labeled either just labeled training or it might be labeled peak training.  And within that folder, you'll see all of the recordings from the videos that we've worked on this week and specifically this session.  So from here, yes.  Thank you, everyone, for your time and participation this week.  It's been a great week.  We've done a lot of work.  Best of luck to you on implementing your peak systems.  So I'm going to stop sharing my screen here and I'll let you go.  Have a great rest of your day.  Thank you.
