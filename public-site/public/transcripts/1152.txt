 Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Madam Clerk, will you do the roll call, please? Commissioner Cooper? Present. Commissioner Laffins? Present. Commissioner Poulin? Is not here. Commissioner Scarpa is not here. Vice Chair? I'm sorry. Commissioner Wolf? Here. Vice Chair Scott is absent. And Chair Wall? Here. Thank you. Okay, speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the commission on an item listed on the agenda must first complete a speaker card, which can be found at the back of the chamber. Once completed, please turn the cards into Nicole. Speakers are taking any order the cards are received, and once the first speaker begins, their comments, no additional cards will be accepted on that item. Now for information, we will not be taking public comments or items under the consent agenda as it will not be open for a public hearing. The two items on the consent agenda will be heard at a public hearing before the Chico City Council at the February 20th, 2024 meeting. The single item on Orchard Creek will be heard at the meeting. The second item on Orchard Creek will be heard at a public hearing at the City Council. The minutes will not. So now under the consent agenda, items listed under the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and can therefore be enacted by one motion. It should also be noted that public comments will not be taken on item 2.2 as the public hearing on this item was closed to further comment. However, you can make additional comments on this item when this matter is heard, at a public hearing scheduled for the City Council meeting on February 20th, 2024. So let me reiterate that we will not be taking public comment on Orchard Creek this evening. If you wish to speak on that, please send your cards and letters to City Hall to make your desires known, and please attend the meeting on the 20th when the Council will make the full decision. The meeting will be held on February 20th, 2024. The final decision on Orchard Creek. Any decision we make here is merely a recommendation to the Council, and what we did last time was what we are going to send to the Council with a couple administrative changes in the wording to make sure it conforms. So, consent agenda. Anybody want to make a motion? I move to approve the minutes of January 18th. I'll second. And also... I would like to pull item 2.2 from the consent agenda. Okay. So we have one item remaining on the consent agenda, and that's the minutes. Anybody want to second that motion to approve? Anybody? Anybody? All in support? He pulled it. Oh, you pulled number 2.2? Yes. Now we're down to the minutes. Yeah, but I would have to talk about that. I'm confused. We're just... I thought we were just approving the minutes. Yeah. That's it. But we need a second. Yeah, I did second it. You did? Okay. I have a motion and a second. Roll call. Vote. Commissioner Laffins? Yes. Commissioner Cooper? Yes. Commissioner Wolff? Yes. Commissioner Poulin? Yes. Chair Wall? Yes. Okay. Unanimous consent for the remaining item on the consent agenda. Yes. Okay. Okay. Now moving on to item 2.2. Item 2, which was pulled. Mark, go ahead. Yeah, I'll start off. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The process here is a little murky. I apologize for that. But I pulled this item because I think that the record can be fleshed out a little bit. It might be more helpful for the council and the community. What kind of went on last time? And why we ended up where we are right now. And with that, first, I'd like to thank staff for its continued dedication to high-quality work. I think that the staff report that was prepared was really thorough and thought through. I think it ended up reaching the wrong conclusion, though. And so I ended up going a different direction. I'd like to explain a little bit of that. First, this is from the staff report. Quote, Because the Bill Muir SPA, that's the special planning area, contains existing rural residential patterns and new, very low-density subdivisions, are actively developing, it is unlikely that the SPA will be master-planned in a manner contemplated by the 2030 general plan, unless the city were to champion the effort. The divided ownership across the SPA means that a developer cannot easily acquire sufficient ownership interest to justify planning the entire SPA. I personally couldn't agree more. I think that's absolutely the case. There would be a precedent set here, at least so far as reducing the size and viability of the SPA is concerned. An approval granted on the basis that it would not necessarily prohibit somebody coming along later and preparing an area. But I think that's absolutely the case. The plan begs the obvious question. By how much can the size of the SPA be reduced without effectively dooming it? And perhaps more importantly, how will we deal with a next proposal like this one? Such proposals would, I think, quite naturally be put forth by other home builders in the very near future. Without some kind of analysis of the SPA's actual viability and a policy resolution, perhaps the elimination, of the SPA altogether, at this juncture, we're just kicking the can down the road. With such analysis, it could very well be found that the costs, including project delays, of acquiring a, of requiring a neighborhood plan, clearly exceed the benefits. In that event, this area, which is located within the city's adopted urban boundary, could be annexed and subdivided in a normal, fashionable fashion sooner as opposed to later. I believe we have the policies, standards, and guidelines already in place to do so responsibly, and with a very good result. The city, the county, and LAFCO, all major players in this process, all have some highly talented and capable planners and engineers on their staffs to solve the usual problems. We'd end up with more housing at city densities, and the process, for approval of subsequent projects, would be far more predictable and less time consuming than what this applicant has experienced. All that said, this is not the right time for approval of a subdivision in Bellmure. I believe the city ought to first decide the fate of the SPA once and for all. The proposed piecemeal approach of reducing it, one project at a time, isn't good planning, and will be more costly, in the end. That being said, there are some good reasons to not approve the particular map before us. I'll list three of those reasons in just a minute, and importantly note that they can all be addressed simply by following the municipal code. Before getting to that though, I regret that I must first point out that the initial study used to support the proposed negative declaration is faulty. Specifically, the tree survey missed about half the site. As compared to other sites, in more sensitive, biologically sensitive areas, this is perhaps not such a big deal, but just the same, to be defensible, this ought to be corrected before the neg dec, the negative declaration is adopted. But back to the subdivision design itself. First, the back on fencing, proposed along east and nord. We don't know what it's going to hold, what it's going to look like, what kind of wall or fence will be used, what the landscaping will be, or who will be responsible for long-term maintenance and repair. The plan before us even shows the rear property lines going down the middle of the sidewalk. I'm honestly not sure what to make of that. I asked about this two weeks ago, and really didn't get an answer. That's a problem, because the municipal code specifically requires that the planning commission review and approve such fencing and landscaping as part of the subdivision when back on lots are involved. There are some good examples of bad planning in this respect, literally right around the corner on East Avenue. Fences falling down, no landscaping, customized fencing, et cetera. This kind of thing drags our community down, and can easily be prevented. Secondly, the code limits cul-de-sacs to no more than 500 feet in length. At 700 feet, the one in this plan is well over two football fields long. Exceptions can be made per the code in certain circumstances, such as to allow for topography, unusual site features, and those kinds of things, but those conditions, in my view, are not evident in this case. This is or will be open level, unconstrained land. No deviation from the code is really necessary in order to develop it. That the layout resulting from this excessively long dead end street is considered to be more efficient is not noted in the code as being a basis for a deviation. This rationale can be applied literally anywhere, as long as cul-de-sacs, as longer cul-de-sacs, can often mean a greater lot yield, or a lower per lot improvement cost. Here I'll point out that the solution offered to mitigate the effects of this overly long cul-de-sac is a pedestrian connection to East Avenue at its terminus. The connection would be a 110 foot long corridor running between two homes. Such dead and concealed areas are sometimes used for nefarious activities and can cause ongoing and serious problems for residents. The city has approved and then later had to close these kinds of connections in this area. This is a concern that I've had in the past. Vandalism and other crimes occurring in or in association with this feature are a concern that I've got. Lastly, the required deviation to allow a contiguous sidewalk that is right up against the curb versus the tree-lined streets required by the code is without any basis. It is suggested that they are acceptable in this case due to low traffic volumes. I don't believe this metric is cited in the code as a basis for safety. It is a deviation. Park strips with healthy street trees like the ones I'm pretty sure are going to grow out here with this incredible soil will make our town more beautiful and maybe even a bit cooler in the summer. To conclude, the development of the Bellmere area, including the subject site, is called for by our general plan. That's clear. It's inside the urban boundary. The general plan says this is an area we should grow out into. And as commissioners, our job is to implement that plan. That clearly means approval of a project on this site. The comments I've just made should, however, not be misconstrued to suggest that I or any other commissioners, if they agree with me, are anti-growth or standing in the way of housing. I can say that personally, such assertions could not be farther from the truth. That's it, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Wolff. Thank you, Commissioner Wolff. Anybody else wish to comment? Sort of said it all right there, I think. Yeah. What more is left to be said? I guess I just want a point of clarification on what the... I thought we were just here tonight to reaffirm the motion that was made at last week's meeting. That's correct, yes. Okay. As I said, I wish to express this to better provide the community and the council with an understanding of at least why I did what I did, because that's not really reflected in the minutes. We don't have minutes really anymore, and it wasn't really reflected in the resolution. So I guess not knowing that, I would have come prepared with a speech myself. But reading off of the agenda that we had, I think that's a good point. I didn't. So just asking for a point of clarification so the next time I can be prepared. Okay. Does anybody would like to make a motion to move this along? I will make the motion. Recommendation that the City Council not adopt the mitigated negative declaration, not approve the general plan amendment 22-04, not approve reasonable and not approve subdivision 22-02, and not approve subdivision 22-01, Orchard Creek Estates, Tetro Construction Inc. And before we move to discussion of that, I'd like to ask the Chair to, again, and I apologize, Larry, I don't honestly understand why we can't hear from the people who are here to voice their... We have a motion on the floor. Do we have a second to that motion? Okay. Okay. That motion dies for lack of a second. Anybody else want to make a motion? Okay. We have no other motions made. Now what? Let me ask if we can get the Council, excuse me, Marina Ramirez, our Assistant City Attorney online, maybe to put some perspective on what's being requested to the Planning Commission right now. Marina, can you hear me? I can hear you, yes. Can you hear me? Yeah, maybe. I think Commissioner Poole got it right. What we're doing is legitimizing action that you took at your previous meeting, similar to just like the minutes that you approved. The only reason why this is coming back to you is because you didn't see this resolution the first time because we had a resolution to approve. We harvested the comments that we thought were legitimately reflected in your last action and put them in the resolution. Now, if you feel like you want to add some things to the resolution, that's fair game. But we're not here to talk about whether or not you want to undo your previous action. Understood. Then I would ask that the comments I made, if anybody else here supports them, be included into the resolution as whereas's. The comments during tonight's meeting? Correct. I don't think that can be included in a previous meeting's minutes. We were just told that it could be. Well, I think if you want to, we're talking about this resolution right now. And if you want to fine tune this, I think we can fine tune this resolution tonight. Marina, can you confirm or clarify that whether we can do that? So the prior motion that was already voted on is what we're talking about right now. The additional comments that are being made are, I don't know, separate and apart from that. However, if there are some other additional comments that were stated in the last meeting that you guys would like to include, we can include that because it was at that meeting that you made that vote. And I'm fine with including any additional information that you would like to add from last meeting into that resolution. So at this point, the order of business is not in the resolution. So I think that the order of business would need to continue in the sense that we are approving this resolution to include additional comments from last meeting that comply with what was stated at that meeting because that was when the vote occurred. Chair, well, maybe I could take a crack at this. I'm still curious if a majority of the commission might support the resolution we provided you, which captured the no vote from last time. There was a no vote last time, right? It was 5-2 to recommend denial of the project. So if a majority of the commission can agree with that, that the resolution substantially captures what was, what I put in there was based on what Commissioner Wall and Commissioner Scott said during the meeting. They said this was the resolution that was made by the board during deliberations where they said, well, let me start with the general plan. And he actually ended with the general plan too because that was that comment embodied and that policy, that correspond with the policy that we put in the resolution. So that would be the policy basis. And if you think the vote was right, 5-2 to recommend denial, then maybe the resolution we presented tonight is acceptable. And it moves to the council. And then it will move to council on the 20th and they will realize. And we're putting information in the staff report to council to capture what the community said, what the commissioner said that led to that outcome of the recommendation. So we are putting elements of what Commissioner Wolff stated tonight in the report to council. So it's going warts and all to the city council. What is, oh, go ahead, no, please. It's like a duet. So this vote is to move forward with the changes or additions that were made if, for example, I was to want to change my vote from last week. Is that? That's not what you did last two weeks ago. Right. So that's two weeks ago. So, okay. So you're basically trying to be asking for a do-over and I think at this point we would just go to council. And say that the commission was, they failed to act. They failed to uphold their previous motion that did pass to deny or something like that. So what we're voting on today is to clarify what was said last week. The basis for the denial, right? That is reflected in the resolution. We left, we left the last meeting with, with, with a motion that passed and everybody knows what that motion was. We have to give a written recommendation to the council. So the, the, the resolution represents a written form of that, of that motion that passed. So if we don't agree to the, or if it doesn't pass, the written portion doesn't pass, then what happens? I would recommend that we go to the council and we report to them that the commission had a failure to act. Got you. They had a failure to conclude its business. I'll make a motion. I'll make a motion that the commission failed to act and did not conclude tonight's business. Interesting. Okay. Another motion that has failed the, I would, I would make a motion to adopt the proposed resolution with an amendment that, um, if the rest of the commissioners would go along with this, that I recommendation that the city council direct the staff to prepare an analysis. I would like to see an analysis of the Bellemere S.P.A. and the wisdom of maintaining it or abandoning it now, as soon as possible, if that's the direction we want to go. That's your amendment to 2.2? Correct. I'll second that. Okay. We have a motion and a second. So how, what would the resolution, how would the resolution be? I'm going to let the motion read now. We would add another clause under, therefore be it resolved by the planning commission and say that the planning commission also recommends that the city council direct staff to take a look at the S.P.A. and see if it should be retained or removed from the general plan. I would add before we do any projects out there, just take that out of the mix. Take the S.P.A. out of the mix. Okay. But now we're making changes to a meeting that didn't, I mean, we're making changes tonight. Correct. But whether or not the S.P.A. was even a good idea was part of the discussion last time. Commissioner Scott said that. Either way, it's going to the council. Right. So. We should just hold true to what we did. Why change it? Why not just keep it as it was? Well, what I'm trying to do is kind of clear things up out here in Bellmere because otherwise, we're going to be dealing with a lot of things. I think with a series of requests like this, kind of piecemeal, and that's going to bog everything down, confuse people, annoy people. And I'd like just to take care of it if we're not going to do some kind of neighborhood plan. I don't think we are and I don't think it's really called for out here. I don't think it flies. Let's just move on. And I don't disagree with what you're saying, but that's the whole reason why I voted no last week. So it seems, though. People have to vote no. They don't have time to reflect on things and want to change their vote now by putting additional comments into the resolution. Because one of the things that I felt strongly about was dissolving the SPA. But that wasn't before us. What was before us was a subdivision. Okay. We can get there. And I'm going to take a try at it by stating a substitute motion. And the reason for doing that is, and I voted for this subdivision last meeting, it's a subdivision in the midrange of affordability. There is a real shortage of homes in this price range throughout Chico. Rentals in Chico, two bedroom, one bath, $2,000 a month, three bedroom, two bath, $22.75 a month. Two bedroom, one bath, $2,000 a month. Two bedroom, one bath, $2,000 a month. Or a one bedroom, one bath for $1,195 a month. For sale recently, median sale price is $479. $479,000. Listings in December around 125. And they're on their way down. Expected by some in the community. Realty. Realty. To be down to the 25-30 range. Now, we can't continue that way. There's just no housing to be had. And that which is had is bid it up and kept. People are commuting to Corning, to Orland, to Willows, and even further, because there's no housing, affordable housing. When I say affordable, that's a nebulous term. But in this price range... I just talked about so what I'm going to do to let the sense of the Commission possibly Move that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 24 dash 0 to recommending that the City Council Adopt a mitigation negative declaration and approve the general plan amendment Rezone and tentative subdivision map for the Orchard Creek Estates project subject to the attached conditions if that goes to council and the council will know that in spite of all the maneuvering with the different Changes in the other motion from two weeks ago that the Commission is in agreement that this project should go forward I second that Substitute motion takes precedence I Chair walk can we please ask the public? Mr.. Chair I think I think might be helpful. I believe we already had There was a motion that was already on the table Substitute motion jumps Okay to the top of the list and so that was seconded and and and so I I just don't I I Appreciate the city attorney's guidance and advice here because I'm not sure that we can Well, let me jump in because I'm planning Commission resolution 24-0 to has already been voted down by the Commission We that's why we went on to 2403 It failed By a motion now that's on the floor to approve with a second and I'm asking for a roll call vote What what motion are you are you? 2403 or 2402 2402 It's not on the agenda yeah, I agree with the city clerk it's that's not 2402 it's not on the agenda could we please have the opinion of the city attorney on this matter Yes, so we we do have a second motion right now But we're that second motion the substitute motion that the chairperson has indicated that was seconded that motion Includes a resolution that is not on today's agenda so We don't have the ability to vote on that today on today's agenda So we do need another motion with the correct resolution for today's agenda I Asked for a roll call on that if it we'll see what happens We have a motion in a second, and I'm asking for a roll call on the vote and Larry this is a motion a second your motion and Lindsay second Mr. Chair, but I think that with the city attorney is saying and what the city clerk is saying is that that that we don't have a legitimate motion because it's not on the agenda so that's I Understand that's where you want to go, but that's not what we've been noticed to do and that's not what the purpose of the hearing is So we didn't notice to not approve it last two weeks ago either The best we could do is come back with a resolution if you're very Clocked in there. This is part 2. This is part 2. This is part 2 Chair, our recommendation might be that you take no action. And if there's this much confusion, and in our opinion, this was perfunctory. All we were doing is legitimizing the action you took at your previous meeting. Somehow it got convoluted and we got introduced to all this new stuff when really the simplest thing was just to reflect your action. You took similar to minutes. Now that it's kind of changed and gotten, it's morphed, it might be easier to go forward with the project to just not take any action. And then we can go ahead and run with that. And as Mike indicated, we will still reflect the record, you know, the concerns that were expressed. That's part of our job anyway. Those comments that were said were said. And if we're struggling over, you know, whether or not to support the project, this one or go back to the other one. I think we're getting in an area where it's getting a little outside the bounds of our normal business. And we'd almost recommend that you just take no action. And then we could go with that to the council. Okay, I'll withdraw my motion. And I'll ask for a show of hands from those who believe this project should have gone forward to the city council either tonight or two weeks ago. If chair will withdraw his motion. And there is an active motion on the floor and a second of that motion. Mr. Cooper's motion. Commissioner Wolf's motion. Yes, please. So what is the motion on the floor again? The one to move with an addition that we suggest the council ask that the council direct staff to provide some analysis. That's correct. On the viability of this before we approve projects out here. Yes, the substitute motion was withdrawn. Okay. We have a motion here. Second. But isn't that. That's literally what we that's literally what we just got the attorney's input on was changing what happened last week. So she said that anything that was discussed two weeks ago can be part of of what the resolution for the city council says. Let's hear from the city attorney on this then if we if we could please. I did indicate that that you guys already had a discussion. You guys already voted on the resolution twenty twenty four oh three. You guys already had that discussion two weeks ago. So we can include those additional comments that you guys would like to have as part of your your reasoning for that resolution to not approve this project. I'm willing to go ahead and amend the resolution. Today's current resolution to include those comments from last meeting so that that so that this resolution twenty four twenty three oh sorry. The correct resolution from two weeks ago that we fix. Um I apologize. I apologize for not remembering the right number. Um we can. Amend that to reflect those comments from the last meeting so that it's. Comports with what you believe was stated. Then as to your reason for that vote to not go forward with the project. If I could ask for a clarification, uh, is the motion on the floor as I proposed. Um, uh, in this amended fashion with the second, is that a viable motion? And is that a, um, would that be a legal quote unquote action? Yes. Your motion on the floor from my understanding. It sounds like you included. Additional opinion that was not provided before. I included what I'm sorry. If you can clarify for me, that would be nice, but I'm saying that it does sound like you've included additional comment tonight. That was not stated at the last meeting. I understand, um, the, the motion that I'm able to be to, uh, approve the, uh, resolution. As it's been presented to us here tonight with only one change. And that would be to add a request. That the council direct staff to provide some analysis as to the viability of this SBA, um, before we approve projects out here. That's it. She was discussed about it at the last minute. Is that I hope reflect that discussion? You're going to second. I already did second. Okay. So we got a motion in a second, right? And well, I'm not just getting clarification. And I'm not sure. Do we have a thumbs up from the city attorney? Is that kosher? And I, I'm not clear. Are we are we updating? Is your motion to update the resolution 24-03 or update the meeting minutes from our last meeting? I'll try this again. I move to adopt the resolution as it's been presented to us tonight with one change. That one change. Would be to request the city council direct staff to prepare an analysis of the SBA's viability before proceeding with approval of any subdivisions in this area. That's it. I accept that. I second that. Okay. So we have a motion in a second. I'm going to vote against that because I don't believe dragging that planning area into this particular agenda item is appropriate. So roll call. Roll call on the vote. Commissioner Laffins? No. Commissioner Cooper? Yes. Commissioner Poulin? No. Commissioner Wolf? Yes. Chair Wall? No. Okay. That motion fails. Three to two. Okay. Would you be open, chair, to? What was that? I'll make a motion. Okay. So my motion is I think Mike Sully said it the best earlier that the planning commission failed to come to an agreement and make a motion on tonight's resolution and go back to the original resolution. Okay. So I'm going to take a motion to approve the resolution and present that to city council. I already made that motion. What are you asking? That we don't basically we don't do anything tonight. Makes sense. Point of clarification, you're asking for the prior resolution to be presented to city council? You need a second for that. Okay. Could the city attorney please repeat what you just said? Yeah. If Commissioner Pouling can repeat her motion, that would... If... I'm confused as to what she just asked for a motion for. Basically, I'm making a motion that we don't make a motion tonight. All right. All right. All right. But we made some headway here. I think that as it stands right now, and if staff or the city attorney would please correct me, we have at this point a decision to move ahead with the resolution as it's been presented. Is that not the case? That is the case. So a vote has been taken, and the decision was to proceed with a recommendation for denial to the city council pursuant to the resolution that was included in the packet without the change that I suggested. Is that correct? That's correct. Okay. I'll remove my motion. Chair Poon, can I get a clarification? What are we doing with your motion? I'm a butcher. Okay. Then that's it. So we have a failed motion. Have we entertained the idea of just recommending a dialogue? Or the resolution that was presented? I tried that already. I don't think that that's been tried in this part of the meeting. There was a request to do that with an amendment, and that was just voted down. So if you want to put another motion on the floor to recommend that you move forward with the resolution as presented today. I'd like to make a motion. Motion is to recommendation that the city council not adopt mitigated negative declaration, not approve the general plan amendment 22-04, not approve rezone 22-02, and not approve subdivision 22-01 Orchard Creek Estates to Tetro Construction, Inc. Second. Okay. Okay. We've got a motion. So we're here to second. We'll second it. Yes. Okay. Commissioner Laffins. May I abstain? Before we start the vote, can I clarify? Yeah, it's very confusing. What the motion does is it would say yes for this resolution to the city council as a reflection of what the planning commission did two weeks ago. Which was to vote 5-2 to deny the project. Recommend denial of the project. And the verbage just wasn't. We just didn't accurately clarify that. You didn't have it in written form. So now we're providing. You did. If you thought you did. You did. Okay. In written form. Absolutely. So I would submit that it is a fact. The Planning Commission recommended denial. Of the project 2 weeks ago 5-2. I know you might not have voted the way you wanted at the time. But that is part and parcel. That's a fact. That's what happened. You're right. And whether or not this captures the action absolutely correctly or not, I don't know, but it captures the general gist of what you did. You're recommending that the City Council as a whole body, not individually, but as a whole body, recommending to not. And we would like to report that to the City Council in written form as the code requires. So voting yes on the motion just says, yeah, that is what we did. Not that you agree with what we did. Well, then why are we even voting on it? Because the code says we have to forward your recommendation to the City Council in a written form. And all we walked away with last time was a motion that passed. Our recommendation can be no recommendation as well. That's what I was trying to do. Do nothing. That's right. You have a motion and a second over here. We're in the middle of a roll call. We can call a question. And I'll see where we are. Are you saying that we cannot? Have no recommendation on this item, 2403. I think we're going to keep seeking some sort of resolution from the Planning Commission on this because the code wants us to forward a written recommendation to the City Council. So, sorry, for one more clarification. Last week you had the resolution in the form that it was going to be approved. Thinking that that's the way that the... The Commission was going to vote. They didn't vote that way. So, therefore, you didn't have a resolution not approving it last week. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. So, now we're here approving a no resolution, which is reflected in the minutes. I wouldn't even say you're approving a resolution. You're accepting the resolution as an accurate reflection of what you did last time. You're not approving it. It's already approved. We filled out the votes and everything for you the way you voted. So, it's just you're accepting. Accepting that is what you did. The Planning Commission did. But then... But then... So, the code... Point of clarification. The point... So, then the point being why are we here now? Well, it was pulled from the consent agenda. So, since it was pulled to the consent agenda, we're now in this situation where we now have to vote on you guys affirming your prior vote. What have not... The vote on a consent agenda been effectively the same? Yeah. It would have, but it was pulled. It was pulled. It's clarifying that it would have been the same either way. So, another point of clarification. It's code for staff to come with a recommendation in writing. But it's... I guess you're trying to tell the... You're trying to tell the future of what... You know... Be fortune tellers of how the commission is going to vote. Because you're only bringing forth one resolution, whether they vote yes or no. You're not bringing both forth two. But for clarification, I don't think that was the case. The way in which the motion was presented originally for the project was struck down by the commission. You guys then decided on a new motion, which was completely... Completely different. There's no way to predict how that new motion would have been expressed by the commission. And because of that new motion, we created this resolution to reflect how you guys voted. And what the motion was on the floor based on that vote. Which was that 5-2 vote to not move forward with the project. So, we have to formalize that to send it to the commission as stated by Mr. Swally. And so, with that moving forward... We're going to do that today so that you guys have that formalized in your commission meeting. But if we voted no on the recommendation, we didn't make a motion to pass a new recommendation. A new recommendation was given to us. And then we're being asked to vote on it now. We already did. It's not a new recommendation. It memorializes the action that you took. That's all it is. It's a resolution that you never saw before. But then why can't that just be the meeting minutes? We might use the meeting minutes at this point. Well, it wasn't a meeting minutes because it was a completely new resolution. Again, the motion that was originally stated for this project stated that it was going to approve the project. And you guys struck that down. When you struck that down... I mean... You guys decided as a commission to move forward to not recommend changing the general plan, changing the subdivision map, and rezoning as part of this project. Because of that, there was no resolution as part of your packet. Therefore, we're here today to formalize this in writing because the resolution needs to go forward to the city council. Right. But we didn't have a resolution that we voted for at the last meeting. We voted against... We voted against the resolution presented before us. That's right. So now we're basically being given a resolution to vote on that wasn't given to us at the last meeting. So it just seems very confusing. And... It's a lot like the minutes. I would... We didn't have the minutes the last time either, but we went off after the meeting and we created the minutes to say, this is what we think you did. And then tonight you said, yep, that's what you did. And this resolution is very similar. We're just trying to say, this is what we think you did. You made certain forms. There's findings. There's certain facts in here. And then there's findings that you made. You cited general plan inconsistency and voted to recommend denial. But why does a resolution have to even be developed? Why can't our... What... How we voted last week go before the council the way that it was? Why is this document... Why was this document developed? Because we thought... It would be the best way to adhere to the code. Well, and if I may, it's also the resolution is a communication from the commission to the council. But we didn't give a resolution. So... We voted no on something that was before us. No, we adopted... If I recall correctly, we voted yes on a recommendation that the city council not approve this project. Correct. So that should be one paragraph on here. And this, it's not. But it needed to be changed to reflect that at least. And I think that ideally what we probably should have done in retrospect, 2020 hindsight here, would have been to say we... The motion maybe ideally would have been to direct staff to prepare a resolution capturing the commission's recommendations or comments and then come back for a vote on it so we could make sure that... Right. And we didn't. That didn't happen. We didn't do that. But yet, this is in front of us. So I don't feel comfortable with the way that this is played out tonight. I just... That's just me personally. I don't think anybody knows... Not getting votes. No. We're... But this is something that quite frankly, now I'm questioning if it accurately captures everything. It's a summary. It doesn't capture everything that happened at the last meeting. But the code also requires that we base our determinations and our recommendations in approvals in findings. And so there's certain findings. And one of them is the project is consistent with the general plan. And that was the point that I took out at the last meeting as the commission, the majority, the people, the people who voted this. majority did not believe was being met. So we identified that it's not consistent with the general plan as a basis for recommending denial. And then we put in the vote that you did vote last time. So, I mean, unless you think you might change your vote on that, you would have changed, if this was the resolution provided, you would have had a different vote, then it probably doesn't, it's probably not something, it's probably something you could support because it does reflect the fact that you weren't in favor of recommending denial, Commissioner Pollan. Right. But I also think that the meeting minutes could prove that. I guess I don't know why we have to have a separate resolution to vote on before us. Let's finish the roll call vote and see what we can do. We have a motion in a second. And Chair Walt. And if I may, just to beat this dead horse once more, to get clarification on what the motion is. Please. The motion was to approve the resolution. As is. 24, resolution 2403 as presented. Chair Wall, may I just ask that the public keep their boos and clapping to a minimum so I can get a clear vote? Commissioner Laffins. It's not going to change, so it doesn't matter. We're not changing the way the vote was, so yes. Commissioner Cooper. Yes. Commissioner Poulin. No. Commissioner Wall, or sorry, Commissioner Wolff. Yes. Chair Wall. No. Okay. We got three, too. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So. Okay. The resolution is passed. And adopted. Thank you, Mr. Chair and commissioners. Sorry for the confusion. And thank you for the city attorney to help clarify that. The only reason, again, the only reason why we're on end of these things is when we change the recommendation that's originally presented to you. So this can happen again, you know, in cases where you don't see, where you have a counter recommendation or a counteraction of what the resolution was presented to you. We will always come back with another resolution reflecting your action. So. We got the support. Thank you. Okay. Public comments. Members of the public may address the commission this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes. The commission cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. Please note again, item 2.2 cannot be taken. The commission cannot be discussed further under public comments. Anybody have anything outside of that? We do not have any speakers. Do you have any cards? I do not have any speakers. Chair Wall. We have one comment. Public comment. That's a public comment, right? Yeah. Your response to the meeting earlier. Well, I don't think anybody knew how this meeting was going to go. Okay. This is where we are. Speaker. Okay, sir. Chair Wall, if you can give me one second to get this in the system. All right. She's got . J.C. J.C. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Chair and Commission, I'm not exactly sure what we saw tonight. Not going to speak on the item, but I'm going to speak on the process. This was, I think, confusing for probably most of us sitting out here wondering what was going on. And I think it was certainly confusing for those of you up there. I've seen student council meetings run better than this with more informed information. It's just for something that is this important that the community spoke of last time for this process to be so gummed up. And it just really appeared that nobody knew what was going on, that the the item was a simple affirmation of what you did last time, a reflection of the vote. And I appreciate that we finally got to where it should have been. And I appreciate that we finally got to where it should have been. It should have never been pulled from the consent agenda. It was a routine item. It got pulled. Commissioner Wolf had a statement, which I think was improper for that. I think if you were going to pull it from the consent agenda, you needed to give the public the opportunity to speak since the item was now an agenda item and not just routine business. So I would ask that the commission, through staff and council, probably get some additional training. And I think that's what we're going to do. We'll get some additional information on how to run a meeting and deal with these things that come up. I find it very hard to believe this is the first time that you all denied something, that this process seemed to have broke down for whatever reason. So I just ask that you take some time and get it right next time. Because having this meeting and confusing the public and confusing your constituents just was not a good look. Thank you. Thank you, Sir. . . No further comments. No further comments. Okay. The public comment period is over. Regular agenda, we have nothing further. Any reports or communications? We are adjourned to the regular adjourned meeting of Thursday, February 15, 2024.
