Would you bow your heads? Dear wise and loving Father, let me just say thank you on behalf of all of us who are gathered here tonight. Thank you for the many and abundant blessings you've given.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. and so we continue to have vacancies and we're just not going to lower our standards. We hire good people at Chico PD. Some of the great things that occurred in 2021 is our up the years. James Bennett was our civilian employee of the year for all the incredible things he does for us. But not only that, just our volunteers, our chaplains. And what's ironic is we also had five life-saving awards that came out of 2021. So officers out there doing good things. Just to highlight a little bit about our patrol division. Your patrol division is really the backbone of the police department. This is where it all starts. It breaks down kind of the shifts, educates the community on what those shifts look like, the staffing levels that occur with patrol. And then also all the collateral duties that come out of patrol, such as canine, field training, bomb technicians, accident investigator, those types of positions. It also gives the city or the community a little look at the beat system, the six beat system that the city's broken down into that we use for not only area patrols, but also for data analysis as well. Some of those collateral duties include the canine unit. Canine unit has taken a little turn. I received last year an executive summary from the canine unit wanting to move in a little different direction. We had Kimbo up there. Or I'm sorry, Aaron, that we retired last year. And so they wanted to look at a concept of tracking hound. I read that executive summary. I was impressed. I approved that. And we currently have Pyro, who is a plot hound out of South Carolina, who does nothing but tracking. This dog is not a protection dog. It's not an apprehension dog. And all it does is serve the department in a tracking mode. We've already seen huge successes. We have several arrests. We have one track. That went almost a mile. And not only can he just track people, he can actually track individual scent. So on his second day on the job, we had a burglary of Dutch brothers. We brought Pyro. Of course, the inside is full of human scent. We found an item from the suspect that he knew he touched. Locked onto that scent. Tracked about three quarters of a mile and found the suspect. And we were able to find the suspect. We stole him property and make that arrest. Excited about that. Detective Bureau. Detective Bureau is really responsible for high-level crimes that occur in our city, such as homicide, sexual assault, child abuse, elder abuse, domestic violence, robbery, and burglary. It breaks down some of the stats that came out of 2021. As you can see, they're very, very busy. They had 252 cases, 66 arrests. They had 259 CSD referrals, which are suspected child abuse, as well as 217 APS referrals, which is suspected elder abuse. Including in that. Also is missing persons that they investigated. And they're also responsible for monitoring sex registrants that live and move into and out of the city of Chico. The violence suppression unit. Again, this was a unit that we started. They were focused on violent crime. That unit in 2021 had 40 cases that they were responsible for arresting. They made 56 arrests. They dealt with 34 criminal street gang members or suspected members. They served 50 search warrants. They conducted 34 probation and parole searches. And they secured 60 illegal firearms and got those off the street. In addition to that, they were the lead investigator on those three homicides that came out of 2021. And all those cases into another high-profile assault with a deadly weapon and an armed robbery. In all those cases, every suspect is in custody awaiting trial. Our target team, I think most people in here. Understand the target team and what they do. That is our outreach team currently. That is the team that is coordinating with your O&E team through the settlement agreement. And working with the city, public works, and the other agencies as we move through the homeless situation in Chico. Traffic and parking services. This is a unit that is understaffed based on the staffing needs of patrol. This currently only has one working sergeant and one officer. Those. When the weather is good. They're both on motors. And are out there issuing citations. They wrote 1,155 citations in 2021. They handled 155 non-injury collisions. 75 injury collisions. And they towed 33 vehicles for either unlicensed or suspended drivers. This does not include our major accident investigation team. And we'll talk about that here in a few pages. But this is something that concerns me. I don't know about anybody else. But the. Automatic driving behavior that I'm seeing in this community. And just about every community I've driven in in the last year or so. Is off the charts. I don't understand what's going on. And so we know. It's well documented that the more. The police department enforces traffic. Laws in their city. You will reduce your collisions. So this is something to be thinking about. This is on the very front of our minds. And how do we address what we're seeing in the city as it relates to traffic. School resource officers. Again. This is something that I feel very strongly about. And it's having officers engaged. On our campuses in this city. Working well with the Chico Unified School District. We've done that for many, many years. And we lost these school resource officers during the recession. We got them back under a different grant. That grant didn't come back. To the school district. The city of the Chico Police Department filed for the DOJ grant for the SROs. We've got that. So we currently have a sergeant and three officers that work in the schools. That grant I think is good for another two years. And we still have the ability to apply for it. And I think gain up to three more years on top of that grant. So with all the things that we're seeing. These officers do a great job to build great relationships with our students. This grant is also under the tobacco grant. And so large things. That they do. Is they're focused on tobacco use with juveniles. And we really have a big anti-vaping campaign going on right now. For what we're seeing. And the dangers of that. With our kids. So those officers are out there. And like I said. Really appreciate what they do. For our kids. Training unit. This is another thing in 2020 that we looked at. We used to have a civilian training manager. But we know. Some of you in here know. That post requirements for training continue to go up and up and up. And we got to try to find ways. How to meet those training requirements. And so what we do is. We have started. When that person retired. We put a training sergeant. He's a supervisor. And administration assistant. And the idea is as we continue to build back. Is to try to move all training under one umbrella. Apparently it's kind of collateraled out. So that we're accurately tracking what we're doing. Making sure that we're meeting all of our. Post requirements. As well as trying to find creative ways. To get our officers to that more specialized. Training that's not just that bare minimum. That's where your de-escalation. And that type of stuff come from. This unit was solely responsible for implementing. The 40 hour CIT and de-escalation training. That a previous council approved for us to receive. Gave us two years to do it. Not only did we do it in one year. We added about 30% extra staffing to that training. Because it was only deployed for sworn personnel. But we know our staff. Our CSOs. Our dispatchers are also dealing with the public. And so we're pretty much essentially got all of our. Employees that interact with the public. To that training. Field training program. This is where the rubber meets the road. For these young men and women that get out of the academy. We have very high standards. And if you complete this training. It usually takes about six months to do. This is all extra duties for patrol officers. They're all highly trained. To train our officers. And I just retired. And I hired an officer yesterday. Who spent almost 20 years with the city. Chico. And was a long time training. Officer. And I think I would estimate he probably trained 30 or 40 officers in his time here. So very important. This is another really exciting thing that we put together at the Chico Police Department. This is really a partnership and collaboration. I do have Jody Drysdale here with us. If there should be any questions. But under the Butte Strong Wellness Unit. This comes from the North Valley Community Foundation. Butte Strong Fund. Which is administered by the Butte County Sheriff's Office. We have partnered with them. To start looking at better ways. Of how to take care of our people. Both mentally and physically. It really has. I'm really excited. In almost 30 years of doing this job. I really think this profession is starting to break those stigmas. And starting to focus on employee wellness. And it's about time. Jody has done a great job being the coordinator. We work well with her. There's some things that we've done. So far. As the Chico Police Department has built out a peer support team. They got to go with Jody. And the other teams that were built by the other agencies in the county. To a conference. They meet on a regular basis. Not only are we doing that to support our teams. And this is for all first responders in the county. This isn't just the police department. Or the sheriff's office. This is fire. This is EMS. Across the board. What I'm really excited about. Is not only mental wellness. And focusing on that. Is the physical wellness of our officers. I remember. Probably 10 years ago. I sent up a memo. An executive summary on trying to get on duty workouts. And I got shot down. Saying it was a work comp issue. Well as we've evolved. And agencies have looked at this. There's really good data that shows. If you have these programs. Not only are you going to have healthier. Safer officers. Your work comp is going to go down. That's what we're seeing at the Chico Police Department. And so this partnership has been amazing. We've been able to add some of that type of equipment. To our gym. And then there's also all different functions. That are being offered to our officers. To the fire department. Such as physical therapy. And actually programmed workouts. So they're not in there. Doing it wrong and hurting themselves. So this has just been an awesome program. The peer support is great. And we're really starting to break those stigmas. In law enforcement. These people. This is a tough job. And we need. We need to be taking care of them. Honor guard. This is just. This is awesome. Our business support team. Had raised money for those special uniforms. They're really designed. To look like. You know. Old school. Chico Police Department. Fitting. Now that's our 150 year anniversary. But. This just really represents. Your police department so well. And the city of Chico. And they go out and do events. Unfortunately. They go to a lot of memorials. To represent. Law enforcement. And fallen officers. But they do a lot of. Great things in the community. They do a lot of the. Presentation of colors. Of football games. Other sporting events. And I think we typically. Come here for the council meetings. For your swearing in. So. They do. Great representation. Of the department. Crime scene investigation. Is a collateral duty. That comes out of. Comes out of patrol. And these are. Officers that have this collateral duty. Special training to come out. More crime scenes. We know. You know. Some of these cases. Get down to. You know. Critical evidence. And. And biological evidence. In different ways. So. It's a great group. And they're also helping us. Solve crimes. The unmanned aerial system. So. I come to you. Looking for approval. For this program. Originally. It was funded by private donations. I was very proud of the organization. We've been talking about this. For a few years. But we really took our time. And building that out. Working with the community. Before we even put these things. In the air. To garner that support. Garner that trust. Make sure. Everybody was educated. On how they'll be used. And how they won't be used. And that's what you're seeing. On the street right now. Is. These things are really. The technology. That it offers us. Are really. Really helping your police department. To do several things. One. To be able to slow down. And use this technology. Rather than having to rush into something. It's providing. It's lowering our use of force. And it's helping us. In that area. When you talk about. Critical incident. Training. And being able to. Slow things down. We're able to do that. With these devices. And they're working really well. The major accident. Investigation team. These are made up of. Not only the traffic members. But also. Highly trained officers. Out of patrol. This is the unfortunate thing. And this is where. The police department. In this city. Needs to be looking at. In 2021. We had 11 serious collisions. Seven of those were fatal. With four. Four of those. Resulting in criminal charges. Being filed. Which means. It was some kind of. Impaired driving. Or egregious. Violation. That resulted in a fatality. That's a high number. For service streets. For the side of the city. This does not include. Any other areas. Of responsibility. Like the freeways. That are. Fall under CHP. Jurisdiction. So those are the numbers. Coming out of 2021. On your surface streets. The city. And this is something. That we need to be focused on. So again. Looking at how. We can find creative ways. To get back. And focus on traffic. Enforcement. Based on our staffing levels. Because we know. These numbers. Have come down. If we do that. And then just some of the. Joint teams. And collaboration teams. That the city participates in. So we currently have. A crisis negotiation team. All three of these units. Fall under our tactical command system. This really is. A great team. That works side by side. With all the different functions. That we have. And we also. So this is really our team. But we do have two. Chico State officers. Assigned to that team. Our special weapons and tactics. Also known as a SWAT team. Has been around for a long time. We're a size of a city. That needs this type of team. To be prepared for whatever. Comes our way. They're highly trained. This is kind of where. You know when we came up here. On AB 481. And we talked a little bit. This is kind of where. A lot of that. Technology and equipment comes from. But this is. This team. Is so highly trained. And has the capability. That they're recognized. By Cal OES. As a regional team. So not only does this team. Respond to calls. In the city of Chico. They can be called out. In mutual aid. Situations in the county. And the region. That also goes for the Butte County. Interagency bomb squad. We have two officers. Assigned to this as well. This is actually a sheriff's department. Function that he is required. To provide this service. As a mutual aid. Coordinator. And so we. We're also involved with that team. We're also involved in the Butte. Interagency narcotics task force. And I was proud to serve. As the board chair in 2021. Of the board of directors. For this team. I don't have to tell anybody in this room. What's going on. We've been sounding the horn for a long time. Of what we're seeing. But Fentanyl coming into our area. There's one certain board member. That's been doing that. Quite well. As a bent of commander. But I'm proud that we're associated with this team. They're turning a lot of cases. They're working really hard. To get this stuff off our streets. Communications. These are some numbers that you kind of heard during budget. This was some concerns that we voiced to you. And looking at creative ways to work with fire. Regarding our dispatch center. Remember we are a peace app. We are answering service for 911. That is a service the city is required. To provide your community. We provide that. And so just to give you an example. Of how busy that room was. There was 48,324 non 911 calls. That came into that center. 56,982 911 calls. And 111,000 that came in. On the administration line. So total inbound and outbound calls. Coming out of your dispatch center. Was 216,346. And recognize that that unit's been understaffed. By four or five that entire year. So all that extra workload that's going on. Cat incidents. That's where we're creating and call. Into the center. We had 47,000. And some change on that. We had 11,000 self-initiated police calls. We had 12,942 cat incidents. Regarding fire department. 9,000 with some of the other calls. Such as animal control. And call outs for our vets. Total cat incidents for police and fire. Where a dispatcher entered a call into the system. 81,457. That's a lot. Property and evidence. Another. Like I said. A very important function. Chain of custody. And the property. They handled 13,000. And plus items in this property room. And 2021. But here's an interesting note. And talking about patrol. And VSU focused on gun violence. And getting illegal weapons off the street. We booked in 113 handguns. 89 long guns. 298 bicycles. 509 backpacks. And 818. And 818. And 819 items of narcotics. Now that's not saying every one of those firearms. Is technically illegal. Because we do on certain calls. We have some laws and requirements. To take firearms simply for safe keeping. But that just gives you a number. Of how many firearms came into our system last year. Our community service officers. They're great. They're attached to patrol. They really run our holding facility. But they also supplement patrol. Out on the street. We. They handled almost 3000. Arrest. Arrestees. They conducted over 1500 transports. To the Butte County jail. And they also supported. The police department by. Completing 500 police reports. Records division. So this is. This is what we were talking about. As far as context. So. Report process. So that's where an officer actually. Or a CSO went out and took a report. And that report was later. Put into the system by records. That's 7176. Now we have an online reporting system. And that's designed to try to refer people. With lower levels of crime. To be able to go on. Get into our system. And report that crime. Two things for that one. Because we want to know about it. And try to get their stuff back. Two. It helps us track data. To tell us what's going on in the city. And what these crime. What crime statistics look like. What I find interesting here is. Out of reports process. 7000. Online reports 2000. And so we know. As I looked at that number. I know that we've been referring. Quite a bit of people to that online. Especially last year. When our staffing was very low. It seems to me that that number. On online reporting should be much higher. And so one of the things we need to look at now. Is as our staffing level comes back. We want to get back to being more of a full service department. And so now we're getting to the point. Where somebody calls. And you know hey. Someone stole the package off my porch. Okay would you like to do it online. Or would you like an officer. So we're getting to the point. Where being able to offer that service. There's some people that said no. I'd rather report it online. But a majority of the people. They want an officer to come out. Right they want to take a look. At any potential evidence that's out there. They want us to look at their cameras. And things like that. So we are getting back. And I just point that out to you. Because next year. It'd be interesting to see what that looks like. As we start to build the officer staffing back. And be able to be a little more full service agency. Our. Social media and relations team. This is something that. We've been building for a while. It's a collateral assignment. It was really taken off by our PIO. Michelle Walker. She unfortunately has left us. In a full time capacity. She's been working as an hourly. Trying to help us kind of keep our messaging going. I did give a conditional job. Officer for office. Offer for that position. So we're really excited. To really stay engaged. This is really about. Public engagement. With all the different social media accounts. And all the different things going on. Make sure we're educating. Staying transparent and engaged. So here's all the different sort of social media platforms. That we're on. That we engage on. These are just some of the community engagement events. That we participate over the year. Those were pictures from the law enforcement torch run. For the Special Olympics last year. We just did it on Friday this year. And. We're going to be doing it again. I blew it. I challenged. My staff. That if I had so many staff members sign up to do it. I would run the entire thing. Which is a little over five and a half miles. They immediately responded. And so. That was a long run. But it's just what a great cause. For us to be involved in in that. And. And all in the collaboration with the other agencies. You know, we do a national night out. We do coffee with a cop. We do treat street. We had a really good time last year when we're locked down. Around that Easter time. We did a Easter egg coloring contest. Through our social media and put these things out. We've got tons of colorings from kids throughout our community. And I got to pick one. And meet with this young lady and provide her with that. Awesome Easter basket. So doing a lot of great things out there. And then obviously. Blue Santa is always a huge hit. And. Again, just. Pre-order. A lot of other creative ways to be out there and really engage with. With our community. The police department oversees our animal services and. You know, there's a couple slides here. The only thing I really want to point out and just something to look at is when you look at their bite report. We had 285 animal bites reported to the animal services department. But out of the 285, only 87 of those animals involved in that were vaccinated. And so that's a scary number, and we need to look at different ways of trying to promote vaccinations with animals in this city because, one, it's very dangerous, not only for the animal, for the other animal, but for the human that's bit. It's a long, not friendly process to go through the process of if an animal is not and they cannot determine their vaccinations or their rabies status, it's not good. So those are some things that we'll be working with animal services and trying to see if we can get that vaccination rate higher. And then, again, there's just some outcomes here. It just kind of tells you what goes on when we intake and outtake the different types of animals in the city. Our volunteers, this is just a crazy number. These people volunteer their time, and they do so much. They help us administer. They're on call. They come out and do traffic control. They participate in a lot of our outreach functions. And out of that, in 2021, our volunteers logged over 7,000 hours of volunteer hours for their police department. There's 47 volunteers, and they handled 24 call-outs where we needed their help. Same goes for our chaplains. You just saw Joel here give your invocation. Great. They support their police department. They're also a part of our wellness program as well, making sure we're taking care of our folks. They're a great source of, you know, we take them out into the community when families, and we're dealing with critical incidents to provide support for families of victims. And they also are very much engaged in public outreach with the city. And finally, this is your police community advisory board. When I took over as chief, this is the board that I put together. We kind of reinvented what we thought that should look like. Vice Mayor Reynolds is on that team. Some of the things that we discussed in 2021 were like the unmanned aerial system. I took that to them before we even brought that out to the public to get that insight, to get that feedback, and get those perspectives. Great team. We've had some difficult conversations. There's no question about that. But from what we went through in 2020, those are conversations that need to occur. One of the things I'm happy about is we went through all these topics that we chose to talk about. We issued not only minutes coming out of those meetings, but the recommendations from this team back to the chief of police. And we're trying to get this team back to you in August for a report out from this team to tell you what they've been talking about and lay out the recommendations that they have for the police department moving forward. And again, never miss an opportunity to recruit. This is our back page. And that is your 2021 annual report. Do you have any questions? Again, I'm just really proud. This just really gives you just some highlights. And as much as even for me as I begin to build this, feeling that we were so bogged down coming out of 2020 and in 2021, and even for me as I look at this, I realize, man, your police department did a lot last year and continue to do a lot for this community. So it's my privilege to present that to you. For the community, it is on our website. Feel free to look at it. Go through. Go through it. And I appreciate your time. All right. Thank you, Chief. Any questions? No? I didn't have to wait until I got to the driver. Haven't had a ticket in at least eight or nine years. All right. Thank you very much, Chief. Appreciate it. All right. We will now do our report out. And Clerk Presson, if you could report out from the June 14th. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. pursuant to the Brown Act has to be done in open session, so that'll be coming forward. In addition, the Council met at 5 o'clock tonight with the Labor Negotiator on the first item on the closed session. Council will recess after this meeting to go back in to talk about the other items. That's my report. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Number two, consent agenda. All matters listed on the consent agenda are to be considered routine in nature and enacted in one motion. Speakers may submit one speaker card for the consent agenda. How many speakers do we have? We have one. All right. That is Nicole Nava. Good evening. So I am not here to object on 2.1, the Jamboree Housing Corporation, because it is a loan. My understanding is that what you're considering tonight would bring the loan amount from the CBO to the Jamboree Housing Corporation. It's a CBO fund up to $1,634,975. What I just would like to point out was at the outset of this project, publicly it was stated that it was senior housing, and that somehow morphed a little bit. And so what I would like to recommend is that, and part of this is in your housing plan later, I think that a little bit of gap analysis is in order on some of the spread of housing. I think that a little bit of gap analysis is in order on some of the spreadsheets you have related to sheltering, so that you could maybe create like a dot matrix as opposed to the spreadsheet that's there, or add some columns that show the gap, delta, whatever. An example would be, we are short 541 elderly housing units, because it is really overwhelming to look through all the material and quickly be able to do an analysis by category of what is needed in this community. And you all have had a lot of time to do that. And you all have had to deal with a lot of housing issues. It's just all around this all the time, whether it be homeless units for the working people, whatever. So I think this is a great project. I don't want to be misunderstood on this. This is a fantastic project. It looks like it will be pleasing to the eye and all of that, and it looks like with the vouchers, that will meet a need. I'm just concerned because I think a lot of people were counting on it being all elderly units, and there are people who have really been waiting a long time for things like that. So I'd like us to encourage, more of the next steps piece so that when you meet as a body about giving out money and things like that, you can prioritize by critical need like that. So that's all I had. Thank you. Thank you. She was our only speaker. All right. Any no votes by council? Entertain motion. Move approval of consent. Motion by council member Brown and second by council member Morgan. Madam clerk, take the roll. Okay. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Brown. Aye. Council member Morgan. Aye. Council member O'Brien. Yes. Council member Tandon. Yes. Vice mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Business from the floor. Members of the public may address the council at this time went on. Any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or is determined based on the number of speakers, the council cannot take any action at this meeting on the request made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have seven. All right. Three minutes. Okay. I'll call the first two speakers. And if you can go ahead and come down to the middle aisle. James Hutchinson followed by Ben Greenleaf. It's really a shame Chief Madden didn't bother to look at what was said at the last meeting. Yeah. You can address us in terms of. The council, if you want to address something he did, please just make it. It's part of your bureaucracy, sir. You're addressing me on this and using my time up. I resent it. We've stopped your time. Actually, while I'm talking. We can reset that. I'm happy to do that. But you need to address this body correctly. Thank you. The reality is we're talking about the police force that's not doing its job. Most of you know it. The people that are out on the street, that is. Not the people in this room on the front desk here that aren't out in the creeks. They're not out by the ponds. They're not out by any other area of the Chico other than the safe areas. You don't have camps sitting outside of your door. You don't have people threatening you when you go out to clean up along the creeks. You don't have people attacking you. Police department? Let's talk about. Let's talk about fentanyl. Do any of the people understand that in 2019, 2019, the Rand Corporation issued a similar report about fentanyl dangers heading to the west coast? And it not yet established itself here totally. It started 2013, swept Europe, swept the east coast, swept part of Canada, and was headed this way. A top researcher for the Rand Corporation. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. Those are these guys. back. You know it. When I listen to this and hear you people talking about fentanyl, let's talk about fentanyl for a second. It's what's called the demand drug opposed to a supply. It's a supply drug. I'm sorry, I misspoke. It's a supply drug as opposed to a demand drug. Demand drug is something like marijuana. People see it as safe. They see it easy to use. They enjoy using it. There's a big demand for that market. Supply drug are drugs that are imminently dangerous, but they're cheap and easy to use. You can lace any kind of other drug with them and make your drug effective. We don't see that out of any of these reports from any of the people that are supposed to be telling you about this. You haven't heard that in his report. He suddenly, they're going after the supply now, three years later. Folks, you're going to keep falling behind just as you did on the housing issue, just as you did on the crime. In my own case, I resented Officer Love being promoted. On my apartment complex where I lived, a 69-year-old man was attacked by a dumpster diver with a steak knife. They let him walk. A complaint was filed about it. They let him walk. Ben Greenlee, followed by Nicole Nava. Mr. Mayor, I would like to nationally the month of June as LGBTQ plus celebrate at pride events to commemorate the Stonewall riots in June of 1969. So happy pride month. I don't see any pride stuff up. I came out as transgender at 49 years old. I'm Native American culture. We call ourselves two-spirit, which has to do with the fact that I'm a woman. I'm a woman. I'm a woman. I'm a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. Those are two spirits that are recognized by the tribes as sacred spiritual beings. Here I am coming out to my hometown to bring awareness and discuss protections for our trans children, special medical needs as well as transgender adults in our community. Transgender lives are in danger right now. Every day that goes by without being recognized as an LGBTQ plus child, adult and not living the life God intended us to be. Those are two spirits that are recognized us to have is a life and death situation. Naturally, trans children are in a health crisis and being attacked politically in our community. What is the council going to do to protect their trans children from having parents being sued for taking their children to obtain special medical needs for gender dysphoria? Gender dysphoria is real and not a choice. I was born this way. I have a complex medical health needs and special spiritual condition. At all this time, I thought I was the only person in Chico that had these feelings. I didn't know gender dysphoria was a real thing. A parent cannot hide their children from the world, neglect a trans child because they have special medical needs and because a parent doesn't agree about gender dysphoria diagnoses and critical judgment of ignorance from others. I ask the council to immediately write out a human rights ordinance for the protection of trans children, their parents. And be reinforced by local law enforcement and overseen by a community members called oversight civil rights committee to keep the Chico City Council members honest by establishing and enforcing the human rights ordinance in Chico. Our trans kids and trans adults living in Chico need intelligent, understanding, caring individuals on our city council as to say, to say you matter and we see you. I'm asking the Chico City Council not to go back to the Chico City Council. A time when children are not seen or heard from, not wanted, objectified, neglected, exploited and ignored. A time where animals had more rights than children, but not today because our city council members don't judge trans children's medical health needs. They leave it up to the health professionals, patients and parents. I'm asking you, the mayor and the council, to put this on the next agenda, to talk about this national crisis, trans children medical issues. And I'm going to stop there because I only have so many seconds. So I just need one of you to put this on to the next agenda, this topic. Thank you. Nicole Nava followed by Jessica Giannola. Good evening again. So I wanted to address comment on the homelessness topic of alternative resting sites. So I know they were going to be meeting. You were going to be meeting. I'm sorry. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. But I am. That's where the site of the needle exchange used to be. And they're just not getting a breather. The bike paths also are getting a huge amount of chatter. People are saying that they don't feel safe using them. That's been a familiar reframe. But if you guys have not been on it, you really should. Or at least get on and look at the pictures where people are dating them. It's bad. And you cannot get through at certain points. And that is a safety hazard. So my understanding is, for enforcement purposes, that cannot block rights of way. So refuse and things and structures cannot impede a right of way. So you would have enforcement. Of course, you cannot move them to another location entirely. But they must clear the right of way. So I'd like us to pay some attention to that. Also, I would like to point out that a certain individual on the dais has received a couple of missives from a person via email who is concerned and was instructed by said council member to refrain from sending more emails on that topic. And I find that. That is an abuse of authority. And I would ask that person to refer to the Constitution and to the city charter and understand that even if it's negative feedback, it's your responsibility to take it in. That's why you're sitting there as we put you there. Thirdly, the Pitt survey. So the Pitt numbers were out. And for Chico, we had 393 unsheltered people. And I mean seeing stars, not the ones already sheltered. And that was, of course, as of the end of January. So. What we have in pandemic times for the community's understanding is 317 single occupancy beds between the tourists and the pallet. Non-pandemic times, we have 354. Double occupancy, when people agree to it, would be 494 beds in pandemic times, 531 beds in non-pandemic times. Again, things like this need to be more transparent. You have a sheltering provision site. And I do appreciate the staff so much for cleaning that up, making it easier to look at and see. But I think we can do. Even more to use it as a dashboard for the public to understand the amount of beds, ADA beds that might be out there that people need when they are disabled and have special needs in the shelters and things like that. Again, this is all about creating the what next and an understanding of outcomes. And it's still we're not quite there. We're getting there. So let's work a little more. Thank you. Thank you, Jessica Giannola, followed by Lynn Beliante. Council. So I'm first off. I just wanted to bring attention that the cooling tent is once again not working. It seems like we've had enough instances in this city to pretty much count on that happening and maybe think of a backup plan and how we're going to cool people in the city, perhaps indoors instead of the tent with misters. I would appreciate it. I think everybody else would, too. Thank you. Secondly, I just want to address there was a co-authored letter written in the ER recently by one of our councilors. Council members that spoke of they compared Florida's housing crisis, I would say, to California's and suggested that jail be the appropriate method of dealing with on house folks. So imprisoning them, putting them in jail rather than addressing our housing crisis. It just speaks volumes to that disconnect of California. The. Housing price is so much higher than any other state. And we've gone through I don't know how many countless fires that have destroyed housing. We have city after city that has not invested into low income housing. Low income, by the way, just means the mean income or below. And in Chico, that's over $50,000 a year. $25 an hour. I don't know a lot of people who make that. So we need. Even below that. Also in that letter, it referred to basically essentially people like myself. So advocates, people who are out there working really, really hard to do essentially the city's job. We're out there trying to save lives. We're not benefiting from it. We don't feel good about helping people by giving food or getting them in a hotel or providing medical services. We're doing it because it's not being done by any other entity. And many of us are people with disabilities. They're retirees. They're single families with very limited income. Many of us suffer illnesses or have been further injured by doing these services for our community. So to gaslight us as to say that we're doing this for our own gain or that we're making the situation worse by providing life saving aid. Again, that disconnect. We need to connect with who are our neighbors. What is the need in our city? And how do we meet that need? And pointing the fingers, that's not going to get it done. Arresting someone isn't going to get it done. They're going to be out. If they don't have housing, well, we're just going to put them back in jail. So I think we should focus on housing as a priority. Thank you. Thank you. Lynn Bellante, followed by Elle Douglas. Hello, my name is Lynn Bellante. I live on Micah Way, about a half mile west of the alternative campsite on Eden and Cohasset. I have three recommendations that I would like to make to you tonight. First of all, the place really needs a dumpster. It's been four weeks today and there is no garbage receptacle there. I think it's stated there would be... toilet facilities, hand washing, water, and garbage, something for garbage. But there's nothing for garbage there. So I know I spoke here two weeks ago and I mentioned it then. There's still no dumpster there. So that's one thing I'm asking if you could please... And not a garbage can, that's not going to do it. There needs to be some cleanup already from even before the time the camp started. But it needs to be a dumpster. Number two, there's two... My other two recommendations... are to mitigate fire hazards and for improved safety for the people there and the residents around there. I believe it's a one acre site and I think you should put a fence up around it to make it very clear to the people who stay there where the acre is. You need to cut down the tall dry grass that's there because there's a large dirt area in the middle, but most of the people who go there, they like, you know, I think they want privacy. So they want to go out on the edges. They want to go out. Kind of hanging over the embankment. A lot of them have cars. There are a lot of cars that park there at night and that's a fire hazard when they park with their catalytic converters touching the tall dry grass. And I think if there was a chain link fence that... It would make it very clear to everybody where the acre was. This is where you park. You cut down the dry grass. That's a fire hazard there. The channel is right there and it would just go right down. The channel. My street would be the first street that would get it. The other thing a fence would do is it would keep people from pitching their tents down inside the channel, which they've done a lot of over the last few years. I don't even know how much is down there right now. I haven't gone down there lately. The fencing would also keep the garbage more enclosed up in that area. Easier to clean up. It would also be safer in the wintertime. I know it's hard to believe that Sycamore Creek there gets filled with water, but it does. I mean, even last winter I thought it was going to overflow onto my street. It gets full to the top and that site is right there. And so for that reason too, I thought maybe a fence should go there. So those are three recommendations I wanted to make to you. And I believe the dumpster was already supposed to be there. So that's nothing new. Anyway, thank you very much. Thank you. Elle Douglas followed by Julie Threat. Good evening, Council. Mine's pretty short. We've got a triplex at 1377 Humboldt, just as the first property south of Highway 99. You're building a capital project, the bike path bridge from 20th Street across Little Chico Creek, and it's right next to our property. We tried to take part of our property a few years ago by eminent domain, and it didn't work. And now they're just going to have to move it. So we're just trying to build parking spaces on our property. We've got a dispute with the property line. I've tried to go through the virtual assistant upstairs, which is really interesting. Tried to go through McDowell or something like that. Tried calling. Not getting anywhere. I thought I'd come to the city council. We want a copy of the capital project piece of paper and somebody to talk to and just meet with us. Just like neighbors would do with neighbors. Very simple. Just email us a copy of the project. It should be public. It's not on your public website. And talk to us. That's it. Thank you. Our last speaker is Julie Threat. Last speaker. I've got your total attention. Hello, council. Julie Threat. I just want to let Chief Madden know this is fabulous. Really good report. You've got a great team. I do think that there's a couple crimes, a lot of crimes that are not reflected in here. I think next year we're going to find that there's a lot of crimes that are not reflected in here. A lot of things that we're going to look back on and we're going to look at ourselves and wonder what we could have done differently. I mean, we've got a school district here. I don't know if you know, but you've got 1,600 kids in this school district that are on special needs programs, individualized learning programs. 20 years. I mean, they just did this in March. Trendline. 20 years. It's got to be, I don't know, 20 years of vaccine. That can't just be it. There's got to be 20 years of, I don't know, environmental toxins. I mean, stuff in the buildings. I don't know, asbestos. Is there something going on with this school district? Because I don't understand this trendline at all. And I bring it to them. I bring it to the county. I bring it to you. That's 1,600 kids. My God. You look at the percentages. 20% at Neal Dow and 20% at Chapman. I mean, this is unacceptable. If there's something we can rally around in this community, right? It's got to be the kids. This is just wrong. This is $29.6 million. We're just going to talk tax dollars and not care about the kids and the health. They're going to come out now with the vaccines for the six-month-olds. There's stuff going on in that hospital. We've got to get real here. I mean, seriously. The crimes aren't happening on the streets with the homeless. The crimes are happening in their lab coats or their school administrators. We've got to start getting real with this stuff. We've got a chance. We've got a chance right now. All adults in the room, stand up. Take a timeout. Take a break. Whatever you want to do. I say the same thing to Danette York and the county board of supervisors. Stand up. My God. It's like we're all neighbors. I mean, a lot of you are related. You've got generations and generations and generations of dynasties and families in this community. I mean, when I came here seven years ago, I thought, you know, I'm going to be a bid well or to be a, you know. Now I'm like, oh, jeez, I'm just glad I'm a three and I just moved here seven years ago. Because what I'm finding in this community is just, it's unbelievable. So, I mean, if there's a time when we can just stand up or take your own independent audit, do your own independent self-reflection. What do you know? What have you seen? What have you buried? What do you need to bring forth? Because now is the time. Because it's just going to get worse. And when we start seeing babies and the horrors, it's going to be horrible. It's going to be tragic. When you start seeing the stories that are going to come to bear here, it's going to be tragic. And we're going to figure out how to help this community heal. But it's pretty clear there's a problem. And I just would like everybody to kind of acknowledge it, take care of it. I mean, we're smart people here. Thank you. Thank you. She was our last speaker. All right. Thank you very much. So, we'll move on to public hearings. I don't forget. We have a public hearing. 4.1, Hearing Ordering Formation of Maintenance Assessment District A39, Marigold Heights Subdivision. And we have the Public Works Director. Hi. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members. Before a final map can be recorded for the Marigold Heights Subdivision, the owner, MK West Investments, must provide means for funding the ongoing maintenance of infrastructure, which provides a special benefit to the subdivision. So, the city received a petition from the owner to create CMD A39, or Community Maintenance District A39, for Marigold Heights. And Marigold Heights is on the east side of Marigold, south side of Eaton Road. The city council is required to conduct a hearing and approve the formation of the CMD, which is what we're doing tonight. And to give you little details about this CMD, it's 24 lots in the subdivision. The city council is required to conduct a hearing and approve the formation of the CMD, which is what we're doing tonight. The city council is required to conduct a hearing and approve the formation of the CMD, which is what we're doing tonight. The city council is required to conduct a hearing and approve the formation of the CMD, The city council is required to conduct a hearing and approve the formation of the CMD, which is what we're doing tonight. The city council is required to conduct a hearing and approve the formation of the CMD, which is what we're doing tonight. The city council is required to conduct a hearing and approve the formation of the CMD, which is what we're doing tonight. The city council is required to conduct a hearing and approve the formation of the CMD, which is what we're doing tonight. The city council is required to conduct a hearing and approve the formation of the CMD, which is what we're doing tonight. developer, they are doing those things. This is the ongoing cost of the maintenance of these items. So at the end of 20 years of useful life, for example, we need to replace stormwater infrastructure or landscaping needs to be maintained on a weekly basis. This is the maintenance costs of this infrastructure that is borne by the property owners that purchase these houses. And so that is a summary of the community maintenance district. I'm available for any questions if you have any. Questions? All right. Thank you. Any speakers on this item? No. All right. Open the hearing. Close the hearing. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. From Council Member Morgan, a second from Vice Mayor Reynolds. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. Item 4.2, hearing on resolution amending the city's fee schedule. This is Barbara March. Welcome. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and Council. Back on May 3rd, we brought to you the annual fee increases related to different fees throughout the city. There were some inflator factors provided in that report. At that time, there was some concern. We brought that study back to finance committee. We brought that study back to finance committee. We brought that study back to finance committee. We brought that study back to finance committee. We brought that study back to committee recommended that we modify that rate down to an 8% rate that more closely reflects CPI inflation rate and will still provide some cost recovery for those fees so I'm bringing you tonight those fees amended as such they are all reflected at an 8% rate and I'm hoping that you approve those and approve the resolution and open the public hearing if these are approved they'll go into effect August 22nd no take any questions all right questions all right any speakers on the side we have one all right three minutes thank you Katie Thomas our speaker for the public hearing good evening mayor vice mayor and council members my name is Katie Thoma and I'm the executive director of the Chico builders Association I'm! here this evening to express our appreciation for sending the proposed fee changes associated with construction costs to the Finance Committee for further discussion has been the past practice the proposed budget would go directly to the Finance Committee prior to council but because of extenuating circumstances this year that wasn't able to happen it was the understanding though that we thought that all construction costs were going to Finance Committee but in fact the only thing that went to Finance Committee was a discussion of the increase in the development impact fees and it's very confusing between user fees and and and Miss Martin just said about cost recovery on impact fees those aren't cost recovery their impact fees so what the development does so it is very confusing I agree but at the Finance Committee we were caught off guard because it was the construction cost index the CCI for short was slated to increase by fifteen point five after much discussion because of the inflation rates supply chains all the indices were abnormally high so the Finance Committee was gracious enough to compromise with us at eight percent but we do tonight want to take this opportunity to mention again the other commonly used if development impact fee is the highway cost index which went down but there was no discussion or consideration to pass along this rate reduction we also want to mention the user fees which are a full cost recovery fee went up by sixteen percent while some accounts namely the building fee account has a substantial balance while we disagree with the Finance Committee's decision not to consider the user fee rate increase nor the HCI decrease we respectfully request Council direct staff to research the policy of not reducing fees when the indices decrease or there are substantial account balances our legal sources are telling us that it's illegal to overcharge for fees we look forward to the Community Development Department's user fee study to begin as soon as a permanent building official is hired and we look forward to the Nexus study which will include the review of the DIF fees to begin this fall where we can have further discussion of the indices used and the equity of the development impact fees thank you thank you she's early speaker all right thank you very much close public hearing entertain a motion i just have a comment that looks like that city manager does too we had a pretty robust discussion in finance committee about all of this and by robust i mean it was Chris Giampali and Bill Webb that should be enough for everybody right back and forth. We made some pretty big compromises and we also made some agreements moving forward how we would investigate some of the things Ms. Thoma brought up. So while I appreciate your message, it is going to be dealt with without any further recommendation by this body. It's already been made. Is that correct? That is correct. And we've also had meetings with Ms. Thoma and that same group just among staff just as soon as last week. And I think we've agreed that the user fee analysis needs to take place and we're going to do our best to make that happen this coming year. And certainly we've entertained the idea that they should be a part of that analysis and we're hearing different other issues. So I think we are in agreement also that, and I think the finance committee also dealt with the issue of if fees go down, that they could go down in the future. So, That was another thing that the Finance Committee looked at. So I think we're on the right path in working with the group. And I'm not sure if we need further direction. I think we're headed in that direction anyway. Thank you, Mr. Honestat. I will move to approve. Second. I have a motion by Council Member Morgan, a second by Vice Mayor Reynolds. Madam Clerk? Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. Sorry. And before we start the regular agenda, we'll take a short recess. We'll go through one letter at a time. plan. Mr. Yune. Thank you, Mayor, Honorable Counsel. The California Government Code Section 8698.4 is a statute that permits cities that declared a shelter crisis to suspend provisions of state housing, health, habitability, planning, zoning, and safety standards, procedures, or laws. And that statute provides that a city that has adopted a shelter crisis to build emergency housing, and in this case, we built the pallet shelter, that the city published a report on an annual basis. That report is now due on July 1st, 2022, and in compliance with that statute, the city attorney is recommending that the city council of the city Chico adopt a resolution approving the 2022 Chico Shelter Crisis Plan for publication on the city's website on or before July 1st, 2022. That concludes my report. I'm available for any questions. Questions for Mr. Yune. All right. Seeing none, how many speakers on this side? We have four. All right. Three minutes. Okay. So our first speaker is Nicole Nava, followed by Julie Three. Good evening again. Okay. So I read the entire report. And what I have to say about it is where it might somewhat touch on the four elements that are required, which is report out on the development of homeless shelters. Check. You did that. Development of permanent supportive housing. There's reference to it. The third and fourth bullet, though, I'm wondering. The development of onsite supportive services and a plan to transition residents from homeless shelters to permanent housing. So I don't know if any of you read the entire report. But what I saw was that included in that report was the entire settlement agreement, maps of the pallet shelter, the low cost housing resource guide and associated like maps and properties and such, which on the face of it, not bad. If you have a lot of other content, I feel like it's lacking a lot of other content. To me, it is not highlighting. I think it's a little bit of a You know, what's what's the what next? It's like it's light. And so when you're on an end of something and you're expecting bang for your buck and even the state should be expecting bang for their buck out of what they ponied up through certain things as well. But that's one thing that I think that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. But that one thing that should be done. And so again, great that you're giving us the what, but there's like a famous speaker that says, okay, you need to have elements of the what, the so what, and the now what. And the so what, you got to make us care and tell us why you're doing something. You covered the what. We've got the addresses, the maps, and all of that. But the now what to me is a fail again. Like we need to get more emphasis on what are we doing about it? Does everyone know where they're heading? Are we unified in this? And I just feel like we're just not there yet. So again, if they could please get like a doc matrix that includes the gap analysis, I think that's where you need to find some energy. And maybe the Greater Homeless Task Force can speak to that when they meet with the continuum of care folks. And this can be a more holistic thing so that the next time you do this report, we can do our city proud with the state. Thank you. Thank you. Julie Threat, followed by Jessica Giannola. Okay. Everybody. I think she just said. I mean, seriously. So for me, we still have a shelter crisis, and we've had one for like probably 20 years, too. And it's the service providers. It's the service providers are getting millions and millions of dollars, and there's a rotating group of them. And I go to the county, and I see all this consent calendar. There's probably 20 items there, and they're all getting just rotating contracts, rotating contracts. I mean, the things that are in there are just insane, and they're just buried in the consent calendar. Like we just write a check, write a check. And then we've got these. We've got these outcome sheets, and we've got pit surveys, and we've got. I mean, it is impossible to keep up with, right? And at the end of the day, I'm like, if we just took all those millions of dollars, all those millions of service providers, and we just give it to the people, we'd probably build enough homes for everybody. I mean, there's somehow we need to hold people accountable for this stuff, and it's the service providers. We're holding the homeless accountable by slapping them around. We're holding you guys accountable, and we slap you around, too. But we need to start slapping around the service providers, the True North Housing Alliance. The I mean, it's unbelievable that the amount of waste and fraud. And every single one of them. And we just gave the Jesus Center some big award down in Sacramento. I didn't understand that at all, because I'm like, we're having a big problem up here. Alert, red alert. So, yeah, we need some whatever she said, because she knows how to do it. Thank you. Thank you. Jessica Giannola, followed by Melody Probstall. Hi, Council. I agreed a lot with what Nicole had said and what Julie had said here. The report was really. I think it was a lot of work. It was really lacking a lot. It really was. And it was just a big thing on the litigation, which most of us have already seen at this point. So the shelter crisis plan, I think we really need to invest in this. Like housing is our top, top, top problem. And I just think there should be more conversation and more allowance for different resolutions. So I attended the planning commission meeting last week. And every single proposition that was suggested that would help provide more low income accessible housing was shot down. And some of the reasons were it's already been presented to Council. They've already said no, they're not interested. So that's it. Like nothing ever is ever going to get brought to any of you. Part of this emergency housing shelter crisis plan should include places where people can park their RVs for now. We really need to have that. And when that was questioned, we said, well, we're going to have to do that. And they said, why don't we have it? One commissioner said, well, we have RV parks. Why don't they use them? Well, one, they're full. And two, they're often requiring a certain age limit of a vehicle to even be there. And three, it costs money. A lot of people don't have the money for it who are using these RVs to live in now. So that's just super, super frustrating when we need these creative ideas for helping these different houses. And I think that's one of the things that we need to do. And I think that's one of the housing resolutions that we do need. We're not seeing our Council talk about it, put it before the community and say, hey, let's think about this one. It's just here's your report, here's litigation on the pallet shelter. And that's it. And the pallet shelter is a emergency situation. We really need to make that more broader with housing, permanent housing, not just invent these shelters for people to go temporarily. Our city should be building more on that end. I see this tiny, tiny little reference to low income, 129 units and a lot of money, over $11 million being invested in it. So 129 units. That's great for those 129 families or individuals. But our need is so much greater. We need to have far more than that proposed, worked on, suggested. And then just turning back to the provider and service provider issue, one of the suggestions were, where are people going to live? Where are people going to go with the RVs? Because the RVs are being taken. We have elderly ladies that are now on the street because their RVs are taken. One of the answers from city staff was that the service providers will take care of that. They'll find the answer. They'll connect the people to resources. What resources? We don't have the housing to connect the people to. We have to have that. And then we can connect people. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Melody Probstall. And I apologize if I mispronounce your name. Very close. Melody Probstall. Thank you. Thank you, Council, for taking some time tonight to look at the shelter crisis. I want to join with Nicole in what she was saying in terms of I feel like the crisis plan is lacking anything other than here's what has been done. I'd like to see more proactive efforts at addressing that. I'm a big fan of homelessness. I want to share a huge thank you to Jesus Center and Amber for really stepping up to take on the Pallet Shelter. That's a huge undertaking, absolutely incredible work and effort that has gone into it. And it's not enough by any means. I want to make sure that you're, you know, really conscious of the fact that the work to address the needs of our houseless community members is not done. And the crisis plan that you have presented clearly does not work. And the work that you're doing is not recognized that. Some of the things that I think are important to consider are that meeting the needs of individuals who do not have access to safe shelter includes things like water, escaping from the heat, like Jessica mentioned in terms of cooling center. It was hot today. I'm sure you all noticed. And for people who, whether it's that they don't have a place to go to get out of the heat or their home doesn't have the ability to get cool, it's not a good thing. We need a cooling center. We need a place for people who are not housed or that are housed and don't have adequate resources to be able to stay cool. We need opportunities for people to have access to water. You know, this has been a back and forth kind of challenging thing. I know at Comanche Creek sometimes water was available, sometimes it wasn't. You know, just this morning when I was brushing my teeth, I thought, gosh, something as simple as being able to brush my teeth is not going to be enough. Like even when I go camping, I look for water to be able to brush my teeth. And so, you know, I think that within the city limits, that should be something that is easily accessible for people, water for very basic hygiene things. I think that, as Jessica mentioned, having space designated for RV parking is really important. While it's not an ideal situation, it's a very important option, particularly for people who have been dislocated because of the wildfires. We at United Way, we have a lot of people who have been dislocated because of the wildfires. They have paid for people to park their RVs in parks. And as Jessica mentioned, it's very expensive. It's not an easy solution. But for people who that is the shelter that they have, is that not better than sleeping on the street? I would like to look to the city to collaborate in good faith with the nonprofit sector to address the concerns of those who are most directly impacted by the shelter crisis. There are plenty of people who are impacted by lack of housing. housing, but the people who don't have access to housing because the housing does not exist, those people are most directly impacted. Not this time. Thank you. She was our last speaker. All right. Council discussion. Further questions? Mr. Ewing, did your office do all of this report? I saw you were recording it, but I don't know if it was staff. No worries. Thanks, Vice Mayor Reynolds. No, we worked with staff, city staff, various city staff to collect the documents that comprise the plan. Okay. And knowing, obviously, this is the first time we've done this, hopefully then maybe we can. We can take some notes for next year and include some of those things that were asked for so we have some of those matrix and data that we can include for the next time around. All right. Entertain motion. We have a vote motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds. A second from Councilmember Morgan. Councilmember Bennett. Yes. Councilmember Brown. Councilmember Morgan. Councilmember Harris. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 6-1. All right. Item 5.2, Council Member Tandon requests, are there receptacles in the downtown area? Council Member Tandon, you have the floor. So it seems like our downtown does not have enough trash cans. And when we looked at the previous council council meeting too, there were multiple thousands of incidents about picking up trash or spill-up cleans. And some of the blocks do not have enough trash cans. They're not equitably located in the downtown. So I would like to propose city staff to work with the CBA and come up with a proposal how we can rectify this. All right. Any questions for Council Member Tandon? I think we, Mr. Gustafson has been working a little bit on this and just to provide some information for the council on what the staff has done to date and then if there's any further direction after that. Sure. Mr. Gustafson. Thank you, Mayor and Council Members. Honored to speak to you tonight. We just put a brief couple slides together on if needed, just to kind of provide a snapshot of what the trash can scenario looks like downtown. There's a little over 100 all in downtown, but in the core specifically there are 56 and they are kind of strategically located as you see before and they consist of this hexagon style. They are outdated. They're decades old. I believe they're placed in downtown late 80s, early 90s. Commonly vandalized just due to the receptacle itself. That metal lid is opened and that's how it's serviced by the waste haulers. And of course vandalism takes place quite often in recyclable theft as well. So they're difficult to maintain. We've recently had some volunteer efforts paint the planters and the trash cans that you see there throughout the downtown core. So it has spruced it up a little bit, but they are in need of replacement. Several years ago in 2017 we put a project together to replace the downtown trash cans. It did not make it just due to other budget constraints and resource constraints. It didn't make it to the recommended budget to you at that time, but it's been something that's kind of been on our list to get to eventually. So I appreciate Council Member Tandon's effort to move this forward. And here's just a couple of options that we've looked at. These are the current trash cans that are in the city. They also have their issues, but they work a little bit better compared to what's in the downtown core. We also looked at the university, and CC Chico has replaced theirs over the last few years, and they have a pretty nice design that's still easy to add trash and recyclables and identify recyclables from the top down receptacle. And then it's also secure and they're able to service it quite well. So those are some options we've looked at, we'd love to work with DCPA and present a proposal to you. We've included some funding in this year's budget that I think will support the effort. And if directed by Council, if you will, we'll bring some proposals back to you and go from there. All right, Mr. Govson, have you looked at, I just have a question for you, but does anybody else have questions from there first? So I know a lot of times we have food thrown out, and these garbage cans, and it's produced a problem in terms of soaring disease, things like that, when the food stays in there past its time. You know, you get a meat product out in the sun at a hundred degrees, and then four hours, you've got a nice little disease cooking. So I know that's been a concern of some of the downtown businesses. And in fact, I think the owner that maybe brought it forward to Council Member Tannen. So, you know, just because they see sometimes the people eating food out of the garbage can, which has been there for a couple of days, and obviously isn't great. And I think they're working, that same business owner's working on a plan to maybe have a takeaway area in some of his restaurants. But I would just say maybe coordinate with the waste hauler too, and then maybe look at a silo can that's not so easy to dig through, because we have had some folks with some mental illness kind of strew out the contents of the cans too. Yeah, and the references that I showed you in the slides here were city-owned trash cans, but the privately owned trash cans that are serviced by the waste haulers are an issue. And we could obviously work with DCB on those as well. And there's some regulations in our municipal code that they're only allowed to put trash cans out during trash pickup days and so on and so forth. So there's some regulations around there that we could also bring code enforcement in to make sure businesses and property owners in the downtown area and downtown corridor are adhering to prevent situations like that from happening. All right. Sounds good to me. Further questions? I don't really have a question. Or maybe it is a question. Have we talked to DCBA at all? I know they're pretty thin right now. I don't know if this is something that they're even interested in taking on. In the past, DCBA was absolutely willing and able to work with us on this. It just, it was a funding scenario. And we had requested previously about $55,000 to do the replacement on the city-owned trash cans in the downtown corridor. That was in 2017, so we expect that price has gone up. I believe we identified about $65,000. And this year's budget to do something along this initiative, along these lines. So in the past, DCBA was willing to coordinate and work with us and then also integrate with our members. And I think Andre Taylor is also here from DCBA that could also speak to it. But I'm assuming they're still willing to do that. I'll just add that DCBA is having their own financial difficulties right now. And I certainly think we could work with them. But they've come to the city. And I suspect they're asking and will be asking for some help for some of their activities. So I suspect that getting any kind of financial resources out of DCBA, at least at the present year, would be very difficult. So if we're going to do something, we'd have to figure out the funding, most likely within the city budget entirely. Well, luckily there's lots of ideas for doing sponsorships and all different kinds of things out there. So anyways, I would make a motion that we at least let staff look at it. Oh, public, all right. Yeah, I forgot about that. Sorry. We only have, we actually have two speakers now, Audrey Taylor and Jessica Giannola. Thank you, Mayor and Council. Audrey Taylor from Chapin Concepts and volunteer for DCBA. And I'm here to share with you that DCBA and the PBID, the sister organization, are both anxious to work with the city on this. And we want to look forward to identifying possibly a public-private partnership, which includes financing. So we know it's a bigger issue than just the public trash cans. And so we're looking forward to this and we appreciate you bringing it forward. So thank you. Thank you. Jessica Giannola. Council, I just wanted to support the request that we have more garbage cans that are accessible that helps keep the trash in the trash cans. I was hearing concern with trash, making it, you know, trash, you know, trash cans, people were hungry, et cetera. So I don't know if the suggestion was replacing those type with something that's more secure. I would maybe suggest that a modification be made to the ones that are existing, perhaps something with a lock, instead of the expense of completely replacing, but just adding something to it so that we're saving money. So thank you. Thank you. She was our last speaker. All right. And I know in some of my conversations with some of the business owners downtown, they voiced that they would be willing to sponsor cans possibly. So, all right. Yeah. Do you want to? I mean, I'll make a motion to let the staff work with the DCPA and bring a proposal back to us. I'll second that. All right. We have a motion from Councilmember Tanda and seconded by Councilmember Kite. Councilmember O'Brien, Madam Clerk, take the roll, please. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. And Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Thank you very much. So moving on to item 5.3, Vice Mayor Reynolds' request, quality of life ballot measure. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Thank you. So I'm bringing this forward because some constituents reached out to me regarding an initiative that the city of Sacramento is actually putting on their ballot this fall. We've been focusing a lot of our attention in One Direction and population over the last year. I believe it's time that we change that course. We should and need to do everything we can to enhance the quality of life for all citizens in Chico. It's my belief that this is a step in that direction. I understand this is a new and innovative idea. I know there's a lot of questions and even naysayers. Shocker in Chico. I've heard complaints, you know, prior to tonight, things like, oh, you're just trying to avoid the settlement agreement, or it's going to cost the city too much, or people are going to game the system. It isn't clear what a public nuisance is. While we can debate and talk about all those things, what's clear to me that there is life beyond the settlement agreement, and this is a step in that direction. I hope that this is a step in that direction. Thank you. All right. Speakers? Yes, we have, let me check, we have 10 speakers. All right, three months. All right. Nicole Nava, followed by Julie Three. You can go ahead and line up in the middle corridor. It's like being on a baseball lineup. Okay. So this establishes the elements of quality of life as safety, cleanliness, beauty, and economic vitality. And it would require council, as I understand it, to restore and enhance the quality of life in Chico. And then it would require the city to use all legal means available to enforce our existing laws and creation of new ones to lift up those elements and provide a way for us citizens to hold the city accountable if they fail to abate the nuisance after receiving notice. And my understanding also through reading is that it would be free to the residents to engage in the city's legal process. And that process would provide the level of transparency. To me, this seems very nonpartisan in nature. I do have to say, I think it's really sad that this even needs to be said. Like, one would think we would have been here as a community, as a society, but we're not. And so here we stand. And so I absolutely stand in favor of this. I hope that you all vote yes on this. To me, I think people that vote no, I would really want to hear, I would want to hear the why, because I don't understand in any way, shape, or form how you could debate any of those four elements. I don't see it. And it's long overdue that we get back to civility, engagement in our community, adhering to our laws. Like, this has to happen anyway. To me, I think people really that may think this is something that it's not need to research the broken window theory so that you understand. And I'm going to hearken back to my... My friend, Jeff, and I know sometimes we're not supposed to name people. He's in a new spot because he got frustrated. He was here year after year after year warning of everything basically that's kind of come to pass, right? Of pay attention. We need to be sharper at enforcing. We need to overhaul our code enforcement. We need to cite at all levels, all statuses. It's not about targeting homeless, targeting people who have the money, and they're the only ones who get the thing. It should be about all of us caring. And everyone needs to be able to say, I'm not going to vote. I'm not going to vote. It's important that we're all being treated the same and enforce enforcement happening and laws being invited by because it's clear in the enforcement what we're adhering to and what's going to happen if we don't. So I think it's a positive that our city is going to be held to this same standard as we all are supposed to be, and that maybe we can all move forward as a community. I've heard some things tonight where there were agreeance on topics amongst all of us. This is good. We're making progress. We're going to do this. Thank you. Thank you. Julie Threat followed by Jody Galloway. I love this idea, the concept of like an out of the box kind of thinking, right? Let's do something different. You know, quality of life, I mean, safety, cleanliness, beauty, I mean, it's all going to be in the eye of the holder. So I see a lot of problems there because, I mean, safety for me right now means I don't have kids over in a dilapidated classroom or I don't have, you know, kids in masks at the school and they're committing suicide. So I think there's a lot of exposure there if we don't be really careful. Because I wasn't thinking at all about the pallet shelter at all. I was thinking about just general universe for me. I mean, I'd rather see trust, honesty, integrity, compassion. Let's just have something to be said about those four things because, again, safety means a whole lot of different things to a lot of different people right now. You know, I'd be worried about the exposure. I mean, again, it's are there things in place right now with this pandemic? We've got emergency use authorization medications rolling around this town for public health. Does that mean that because you've got Pax Lovid, this antiviral medication at the CVS right now, and, you know, it's being handed out for free that we're now exposed as a city because that's not safe? So I just would be worried about what's coming out from the county. Are we exposed because we've had situations in the city where somebody's hiding something or the school administrators are hiding something or burying something and now it's going to come to light? Because now I've got a piece of paper here that says, oh, you're going to take this and you're going to do something with it and you're going to have to follow through and I'm going to hold you accountable even to more levels and layers than I thought I already had. I mean, nuisance? I mean, I was like, this is cool. I was here yelling about this vaccine clinic at the mall last month. That's a public nuisance. I'm like, right on. I've got something to hold behind that. You know, I just, I like the idea. I just, let's put the Ten Commandments in there. Like this was the Ten Commandments, right? Ah, she, it's still, right? I mean, it's kind of common sense. It's a little odd, but I just think there's, it's kind of tough to read this. And I guess the last piece on the general provisions, I mean, read A. If any provision or subsection of this act or application thereof to any person or circumstances held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or subsections or applications or the act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or subsection or application and to this end the provisions of this act are severable. What did that just say? What did that mean? I have no clue. Thank you. Thank you. Jodi Galloway followed by Jessica Giannola. Good evening, Mayor and Council. Thank you, Casey. Thank you, Casey, for having the courage to put something forth like this and trying to change the narrative. I'm normally a very well-versed public speaker, but as I was sitting there, back there and approaching you today, I felt a lot of anxiety building me on this topic. And I think that anxiety is coming from a sense of frustration bordering on hopelessness. My business is located at 117 Myers Street. 200 yards from Comanche Creek. We have had theft after theft after theft after theft. We've experienced a lot of difficulties operating a business at that location. We keep our doors locked during business hours. We've had our vehicles vandalized. I've been there for 15 years. I've never filed an insurance claim. This year I've filed several. I've never had interactions with people. I've never had a I'm not the only business in that area. I'm not the only business in that area. I'm not the only business in that area. I'm not the only business in that area that's suffering. A lot of businesses don't even report crimes. Chief Madden made a great presentation on all the crime statistics. As I sat there and listened, I know of so many crimes in that region that are not being reported. People are taking it in their own hands. It's the cost of business now. It's almost our new normal, something that I didn't want to believe could be here in Chico, but it is. And it is at least at my location, Comanche Creek. And it is at least at my location, Comanche Creek. As Councilmember O'Brien pointed out a couple meetings ago, I was here when the previous council elected to go down this path, creating Comanche Creek. That previous council needs to be held accountable, and one of the reasons, one of the ways we could do it is through this initiative. So I support it. I've heard almost every one of you talk about the need for accountability, accountability to the folks that live at Comanche Creek. And now it's your turn. You need to put your accountability shoes on and walk the walk. Thank you. Thank you. Jessica Giannola followed by Katie Thoma. Council, gosh, when I read this, and I did read it, I have a lot of reservations and concerns. And because there are parts of it that are too much, I think it's important to be able to get a hold of it. It's important to know that it's not just a part of it that's too vague. And it is up for interpretation. And like Julia mentioned previously, one person's version of one thing is different than someone else's. And in the end, it will come down to the city council and city staff and enforcing based on your interpretation. So that's where I get pause there. Ideally, some of these things make perfect sense. Keeping trash out of waterways. Not depositing medical waste. Not depositing water. Those things, we don't want to have those in our parks and waterways. So what else could we do with those besides just citation and arrest? We could also help with prevention. Prevention is going to be with receptacles. Proper disposal. The same with cleanliness and safety. We have people, a lot of people without a home. And they're living in our parks. They're living in vehicles. They're living in places that aren't meant for human life. They're living in places that aren't meant for human life. And they're not safe. They're violated probably daily, nightly. And when people are in a position of trauma and desperation, they do look to their neighbors. People in houses. People without houses. And what do they have that's a commodity that they need? So they will take it. And that will lead to crime. How do we mitigate that? We make sure that they're not desperate. We make sure that their needs are met. That their needs are attainable. That there's equity involved. Do they have housing? Do they have an income? Do they feel safe? Because if we have a large and growing part of our city that does not, then the rest of our city cannot. So when we're looking at these regulations we're proposing, some of them are saying nuisance. Well, anything really could be a nuisance. But it's even citing that people giving out food, unless they have a permit, is a nuisance. Well, who are we targeting at that point? I think we're targeting service providers and volunteers. Because that's who gives food, right? So now we're going to go after the people who are doing what nobody else is doing. Putting food in someone's stomach. Rather than focusing on what is the prevention measure. Getting food to people who need it. Maybe at a place, a building. A home. Something they can afford. That's how we prevent these problems so we have less of a problem. So the enforcement worry. Thank you. Katie Toma followed by Melody Probstall. Good evening again. My name is Katie Toma and I'm the Executive Director of the Chico Builders Association. And I am here on behalf of the CBA to support Vice Mayor Reynolds' voter initiative, Protect Chico's Quality of Life Act. I had the opportunity to attend the strategic planning session the Council hosted a few months ago. It was there that the Council agreed the City's vision of a safe place to raise a family, an ideal location for business, and a premier place to live still held true. Rather than merely being a statement in a document stored away, posted on a wall somewhere, let's make it a reality. We look forward to hearing from the City's legal team as to how this initiative can be implemented. And how we can make it happen. And how we can make it happen in such a way without any unintended consequences. So thank you for your time and appreciate your leadership. Thank you. Melody Probstall followed by Katie Posey. Hello again. I just wanted to share. I'll take this off. Sorry. I do wear my mask. I had COVID last month. I don't have it anymore. But I still don't want to share it with anyone. I just wanted to share about, you know, I appreciate the concept that you're proposing. I love addressing quality of life. That is a huge need in the community in general in terms of people being able to find common ground and agree and support each other. When I taught at Chico State, I've been going back and forth about whether to bring this up. But I think it's worthy of just a minute to talk about. I taught students. I taught students about privilege. And everybody hates that word. But what I want you to think about is privilege is about not having to think about something. Privilege is being able to drive down the road and feel safe that I'm not going to be harassed for the way that I look, for the car that I'm driving in. Privilege is being able to wake up in the morning and brush my teeth because I have water when I turn the spigot on. And so when we talk about quality of life, I want to encourage you to think about that. I want to talk about how privilege comes to play and how we define those things. So when we talk about safety, you know, what looks like safety to me may look very different to someone else. I remember I went to a conference in Detroit right at the time of the campfire and somebody was saying how this woman said safety for her meant moving the dumpster away from her bedroom window because people would come and harass her through her bedroom window. And I said, well, that's not safe. But she didn't go through her bathroom. She didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. But she didn't go through her bathroom. followed by Benson. Good evening, Council. I'm in support of this voter initiative and think that this is something that the city will truly benefit from. Looking at what the initiative does, number three highlights the ability of citizens and businesses to hold the city accountable in relation to satisfying the purpose of the act to restore and enhance the quality of life in the city. I know many people in my district who have been wanting more accountability from the city especially in regards to ensuring safety and restoring beauty in public spaces. This voter initiative speaks to many concerns of citizens and businesses if there is teeth behind it to do what it says it's going to do. This is a good example of how elected officials can serve the public noting what needs attention, for example developing ordinances that relate to improving the overall quality of life for citizens and being intentional about accountability. What I appreciate about this is that it speaks to dealing with anything that is a detriment to citizens' quality of life. So from my observation, this is not just intended to improve the quality of life for a certain segment of the population. Attending to these four areas will affect all citizens and businesses of Chico and this is a good thing. No matter what your political orientation, this is something to get behind and support. So thank you for bringing this to the agenda and giving the people the opportunity to hold the city accountable. That is vital and necessary. Thank you. Thank you. Benson followed by Doug Gillen. Good evening. I think your beauty, like that was the beauty, cleaning us, safety, are all excellent ideas. That's something that we want to achieve or at least lean toward achieving. But in the point in time survey that we just recently got the results back from, 20% of Chico's people, the home population, are mentally ill, seriously mentally ill. So I wonder how this ordinance is going to apply to them. Right now, you've got your police department telling the people who are sleeping out in the plaza, three days of jail. And jail seems like cruelest and unusual cruel and unusual punishment for sleeping in the plaza. I think you've got your setting yourself up to go right back in the court again. The court's still going to be looking over how the judgment is what's going to be applied. And that's the devil's in the details. How's this governance that you're talking about going to be applied to people, in particular the 20% that are mentally ill? Thank you, very much. Thank you. Doug Gillen followed by Rob Berry. I believe that this ordinance gives the ability of the community to express their absolute desire and interest in supporting the police and supporting the city council in your quest to have all our laws and ordinances enforced within the community. We would like to see the police be able to refocus their attention on the quality of life in Chico. In the past, the past city council, former city council, members of that council made disparaging remarks about the police department. Mikey did an awesome job of addressing those at a meeting. We saw bits of that at a meeting. A couple months ago, and you did an awesome job of addressing that. We have to have police, we have to have law and order. I think we all saw what happens when the magistrate in all his wisdom put a temporary restraining order on our community and campsites sprung up around the community. We all saw what happened in those campsites. Comanche Creek, Rio Lindo Channel, Tigard Pond. A criminal element moved in, drug dealers moved in, and really probably pushed out some people that were truly homeless and weren't anti-social people who could care less about our laws and our ordinances within the community. We now are fortunate that we have a pallet shelter run under the capable hands of my new best friend, mentor, and godmother, Amber. I'm confident she's going to be able to take advantage of that. And she is running a facility for people that are truly going to take advantage of the opportunity that the city has provided them by funding that shelter. We are taking care of that population and kudos to the city council for doing that. But there has to be obligations on the other end. Those who are not willing to live by the rules and ordinances and laws of our community should not be tolerated with. We are not going to accommodate those folks any longer. We've done our part. Jodi Galloway should not have to endure what she's endured. It's been absolutely incredible what she's had to endure down there. And this ordinance, or excuse me, this initiative hopefully, hopefully, expresses the interest of the community that we don't want to see that again. We don't want to see any other community member go through that. And I can tell you from my personal experience, when the police arrested the people that committed vandalism on our mini storage, the trespassing stopped the next day and hasn't occurred since. So it matters. Enforcement matters. So obviously I support this initiative and I hope you do as well. Thank you. Our last speaker is Rob Berry. Good evening. I've been coming to this council now for almost six years. And I would say that probably the most common complaint from citizens is about the declining quality of life in Chico. Most of us, I went to school here in the 70s, the quality of life that I experienced was quite different. And most of us sort of long for that time when we can see the salmon go up the creek standing over the foot bridge, that we can allow our kids to play in the creek barefooted and not worry about what they're going to step on or what they're going to experience in terms of what's in that creek. So I would say that even if nothing practically improves as a result of this initiative, it is an opportunity for this community to say clearly quality of life matters. We measure that quality of life by the safety, cleanliness, beauty and economic quality and vitality of our community. And it's time for us to come together and state with a unified voice. And I think you're going to find as a result of this initiative that this community is not nearly as divided over these big issues about the quality and nature of our community as we tend to hear and are told. And so I think there's a lot of benefits for this initiative beyond the practical impact that it may have. Many of the quality of life issues that we're dealing with really we need to blame the state in a lot of ways. Which has implemented unprecedented policies of permissiveness and tolerance for what has traditionally been understood as anti-social behavior. As Doug just said, this city has now stepped up and done a lot for the 1% of the population that we euphemistically call homeless. In that population is a mixture of people as diverse as any other people in this community. It is time for this council and for this community to say having nice things is not a privilege. It's an entitlement. It's an entitlement to be living and working in this community. And we are entitled to nice things. And we need to rally around the idea that we can have these things, that we can protect them, that we can enhance our quality of life. And so I really encourage you to support this initiative. And I want to thank Vice Mayor for bringing this initiative forward. Thank you very much. Thank you. He's our last speaker. Alright. Questions, discussion? I'll start. A couple questions. Most of them for the city attorney. I get why this is coming forward. Absolutely. I actually wrote some names down, but I won't go into that. My questions, concerns are the unintended consequences. The city right now is controlled by the magistrate and the settlement agreement. We can like the settlement agreement. We can not like the settlement agreement. We can say this is a run around the settlement agreement. We can say it's not. We can say whatever we want. I want to know what they would be. I want to know what the further admin and liability costs would be. I want to make sure that we don't have a few Barney Fife's out there playing gotcha with the city trying to earn their $5,000 because we didn't clean up a homeless camp three minutes after they saw it. I could almost name the people that would do that. And then if this were in place or something like it and the judge issued another restraining order, what takes precedence? So while I think it would be premature to vote yes or no on this, having no idea of the reality of it. None. I would like to see the city attorney say well this is what's workable and this is what's not. And how the city can stand up for itself again in light of the state, the settlement agreement, the magistrate, some of what we're hearing. It's the state of California. We can't put child molesters in jail anymore. It's just the nature of California. Everything's okay. So if somebody's going to come and vandalize your business or your truck or this or that, the judges don't care. The judicial system doesn't care. Everything's okay in California. And that's not on our police department. Somebody spoke earlier today about something happened at his apartment building. The police came and didn't arrest somebody. I've been on plenty of ride-alongs. The police arrest everybody they can. Most of those guys are out before the officers go home on their shift that night. They're overworked. So how can we stand up for the city to anyone and make a difference? I think that's what Ms. Reynolds' point is with this whole thing. So I don't know why you're holding your hand up. So I support it. Ma'am, you're out of order. You can't... So my question would be, not a motion yet, because I want to hear from my colleagues. I know AGC's got lawyers all over the state dealing with this problem in all manner of different ways. How can we stand up? And it would also maybe be interesting to call her out just because she's sitting here and I didn't know that she was Mr. Gillen's godmother or mentor. I don't think she's a lawyer. I think she did. If Ms. Bass had any comments on how this may or may not work as well. So those are my thoughts and questions to begin with. I don't know if Vince wants to address those or wait until other people are finished. Thank you, Council Member Morgan, Mayor Coolidge, and Honorable Counsel. This process, the initiative process, is two-fold in California. You have statewide initiatives and you have local initiatives. This would be considered a local initiative. So I would ask for the Council to provide me with direction. I can do an analysis and come back with you. I can come back with that analysis about the different processes that would be available to the city if it wanted to go forward with a it's called different things, a ballot initiative, a voter initiative, a measure. But I'd need some time to take a look at the elections code, specifically in the government code and the Constitution to see how this particular initiative could work. I have a question. So maybe Vice Mayor Marrowns, you mentioned that this was, is this on the ballot in Sacramento or was this passed? This is on the ballot in Sacramento this November. That's where the majority of this language comes from. Excuse me, ma'am, you're out of order. You're out of order. Sergeant at Arms, can you please address her? Ma'am, you're out of order. Thank you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please be quiet. We want these answers. Absolutely. What did we get through to the effort? Close session. All right. Sorry, go ahead. So yeah, it's on the ballot in Sacramento this year. And was it a citizens place initiative or was it a council place initiative? I believe it was citizens brought to via the council, kind of similar to what we're doing here. And I had a hard time when I was researching this in terms of finding them because quality of life obviously is a popular phrase. So are there other cities who have passed this? I'm not, sorry, I'm not aware of that at the time. I do agree that there's some things that we would need to define and I trust Vince and his very large team of amazing attorneys that they could define that. So because I understand that there could possibly be exposure in many ways and that we need to define what safety and beauty is. And I heard that there's a vague in parks and there could be some shortcomings. So yes, I would definitely want staff to bring that back to us. There is, I would love for it to be on this November's election. So we are on a limited time frame because we only have one meeting in July and August. So anything that we can do to get that expedited and back quickly would be great. Right. Thank you. Appreciate that. Ms. Reynolds, in section two of this draft, there are some examples of conduct which diminishes safety, cleanliness, beautiness, or economic beauty or economic vitality. Is this an all-inclusive list or is it up to the complainant to determine what actions violate quality of life in Chico? That is not an all-inclusive list. That was just a few examples of the things that are happening currently. And was this ordinance language, or sorry, legal language pulled from Sacramento or written by a citizen? The majority of it was pulled from Sacramento. Can you point to the areas that were not? I cannot right now. Yeah, I actually share a lot of the same concerns as Mr. Morgan here. I think the vagueness, I think the room for error, I think the liability, I think the settlement agreement, you know, wanting to be past it but not being past it, language is all very problematic. And I guess that is all I will say. Alright, further comment? So yes, Mr. Mayor, I do support this in concept. I have always said compassion must be accompanied by accountability. They go hand in glove and I still believe that today. But I do want to make sure that this passes legal muster. And I do not want to do something that feels good tonight and gives us a terrible headache in the morning. So I'm going to also support our legal team taking a look at this promptly to respond to this and the desire to get this on the November ballot. But I want to make sure that it does pass legal muster. Is that a motion? Sure. Second. Second. Council Member Morgan? Further discussion? So can I make a friendly amendment to that? Sure. That if you do your analysis and find out that it is ready, can you bring us back a ballot ready initiative? Yeah, we could. Assuming that we do the analysis, it will be comprehensive. Specifically, because I have some familiarity with the area, it will be a local initiative versus a statewide initiative. So we'll take a look at that. And we'll balance the concerns of the settlement agreement with our analysis. We'll present that to you. And as a backup, you'll have an alternative when I report to you, probably at the next meeting, you'll have an opportunity to take action on whatever it is prepared. Great. Thank you. All right. I accept that. Acceptance by Council Member O'Brien, Council Member Morgan. Any amendment? All right. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Moving on to Item 5.4. Items posted after the agenda. None. Reports and communications. We have City Manager's Report, Verbal Report. No report this evening. All right. We'll move on to Council Member Requests. Percentage P&P 1010. Council members may verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. Majority vote of the Council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. Seeing no Council Member Requests, we will adjourn into closed session. Do we have any public comment? We already took public comment at the head of the 5 o'clock. So, because same agenda. So we will adjourn into closed session with the report.
