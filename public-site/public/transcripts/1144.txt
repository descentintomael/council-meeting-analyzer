 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Let's pray. Lord God in heaven, thank you for your grace. Thank you for this city of Chico. Thank you for this beautiful place in which we live, work, and we make home. Lord, you've ordained government for the good order of society, and I pray that tonight you'd give wisdom to our mayor and fellow council members that we would prosper in many ways. Lord, we need your grace. We thank you that you give it abundantly in the name of your son, Jesus. Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. Let's close the door to the fact there. And then please stand and join me in a word of prayer. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Amen. All right. And the point of control, please. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. All right. Special note. So item 2.1, which is the active exhibition. It's actually being reviewed. It's not going to be considered a first item on the regular agenda. Just a note. So the speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the council meeting has not or already listed on the agenda unless there is a speaker card. There should be a hand written back to the table. Turned in on your right to sit and explain. So once we've started on a particular topic, we're going to watch the speaker card to be accepted. And then I'll be sitting in the . So we have a closed session announcement from our attorney general. All right. Thank you, Mayor. Good evening, Mayor, City Council. Earlier this evening, the City Council recessed in closed session. There were several items on the closed session agenda. The first one was a conference with labor negotiators. With respect to this item, Councilwoman Tandon did recuse herself with respect to the discussion on SEIU bargaining unit due to a potential financial interest because her spouse is within that bargaining unit. She was present for all other items. With respect to 2.1, City Council was provided a briefing. Direction was provided. No final action was taken on that item. Item 2.2, security of public buildings. City Council was briefed. Direction was provided. No final action was taken on that item. For item 2.3, conference with legal counsel pending litigation. City Council was briefed. Direction was provided. No final action was taken. That concludes my report. All right. Thank you very much. And now we will have a presentation. Mr. Hathaway, I'd love to wish you the best. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen of the Council, citizens of Chico, thank you for this opportunity to present some information about the Chico Rescue Mission tonight. Cambridge Dictionary defines disciple as a person who believes the ideas and principles of a leader and tries to live according to these ideas. The goal of the Chico Rescue Mission is to take men who are in addiction, alcohol, drugs, whatever it may be, people who are homeless, people who are fractured, people who are broken, and through the transformative power of the cross, change their lives. That 12-month process, they are termed disciples. And it is a disciplined process. Because we need discipline in our lives. And that is what the Chico Rescue Mission tries to do. The Chico Rescue Mission was started by Neil Bennett in 1993 in Chico at 13th and Broadway. It moved to 2612 Esplanade in 1998. It has a capacity to house 90 men. This is no cost to the city. We do not receive public funding. We do not receive federal funding or state funding. We currently have 30 men residing in the mission. The cost to these individuals is nothing. This is a free program. It is a live-in 12-month program where they get mental health, medical health, dental health. They go through a discipleship program where they meet twice a day. In a 12-step program as well as a faith-based program in the evenings. Through that 12-month program, they get right mentally, physically. They get housing. They get dignity. Most importantly, they get dignity. In the process of that, they also go through work vocation. They learn how to work again. They learn that there is value in work. They learn that through the process of work, they get value. The process of this 12-month program has transformed the lives of thousands of men in this community. Many of you may not know who we are. The reality is, over the last five years, the Chico Rescue Mission has fallen out of favor within our community. Through apathy, through attrition, through bad management, it has ceased to be relevant in so many ways. We have a new board of directors. We hope to change that. This is a faith-based program. Let me rephrase that. This is a Christian-based program. Unapologetically, at the foot of the cross, all are equal. I know that may be offensive to some, and I apologize for that. But I do not apologize for my faith or belief in the power of this program. I apologize for my faith or belief in the power of this program. That being said, I realize there are limitations. I am not here tonight to ask for city, state, federal funding. It is a faith-based program. As such, it needs to rely upon faith-based organizations. It needs to rely upon the community of Chico. This is an individual plea to every member in this city that wants to see an end to homelessness. But more importantly, an end to homelessness, a cure for homelessness. Because getting people off the streets without giving them a cure for what is ailing them is mute. Mental health, rehabilitation, getting right with God and with themselves is the cure to this. My plea tonight is not for the City Council's help. This is a venue for me to talk about this for the citizens of Chico to hear. On August 17, 2015, the Chico Enterprise Record wrote an article about the Chico Rescue Mission. It talked about a need of $700,000 in order to pay for this mission and where these men are living. Chico responded. They took care of it. That need is now on the table. They are now paying $250,000. Currently, the Chico Rescue Mission supports itself through the work vocation program and a few minor donations from the community. Its day-to-day operations are being currently met. But it's an old building. It's an old motel. In order for the Chico Rescue Mission to become the mission it needs to be, the resource that the city wants, we're going to need money. We're going to need donations. We're going to need people to support us. Right now, Chico Rescue Mission has a website called Chicorescuemission.com. People can log in. They can make donations currently right there on that website. People can come by. They can visit the mission. They can see the program. They can make donations in person. We need prayer. We need money. And we need volunteers. The reality is, is these men, as they go through this program, come to a worker's phase. Nine months of sobriety. They go in the community and they get a job working beside you. We need people who will be willing to give them a chance. Who will hire them. Who will help them in this process of reintegrating into society. I don't expect everybody to agree with me or my thoughts. A happy, healthy community is a diverse community. This program will not be for everybody. That's okay. There's a lot of other programs out there that can help those that don't agree with the philosophy or the doctrine of the Chico Rescue Mission. But I firmly believe it is the best solution for this city. If I didn't, I shouldn't be here talking in front of you tonight. I truly hope and truly pray that this Chico Rescue Mission can be the city on the hill that it needs to be. It is my hope and my prayer that the Chico Rescue Mission will be a shining example of the value of the Chico Rescue Mission. It is a powerful example to cities throughout all of Northern California on how to humanely, dignifiedly take care of homelessness and addiction. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Okay. I'm going to move on to the consent agenda at this time. Item 2.1 obviously has been moved. But all matters listed on the consent agenda are considered to be routine in nature. Again, please note about 2.1. And then are there any council no votes or disqualifications? All right. Seeing none, do we have any speakers? We have three. Okay. And I'm going to call for the first two names. And if you could line up in the middle aisle, it would be great. James Hutchinson followed by Nicole Nava. All right. And if you were going to speak on 2.1, we can... You would want to hold off and wait until that item is heard under regular. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I seldom come before you and say somebody's done an MOU correctly. But this on 2.2, the side letter agreement between Michigan and managed employment, looking at that synopsis of it, that beautiful letter, is done well. And I want to say thank you for laying out the purpose behind it, that it was part of benefiting the city, but it was benefiting the employees. It was nice to see. It was nice to see somebody doing it correctly. I want to thank them for it. Thank you. Thank you. Nicole Nava followed by Greg Scott. Good evening, council. Nice to see you. I am, as you know before, was not a fan of diving into the housing business for the city perspective, because I feel like we have enough to contend with with outdated infrastructure. And are frantically trying to get caught up. Right? I think we all know that. However, we are down that path. And as such, on 2.4, I just want to say it is good that you are trying to grab what money you can, because I think what people need to understand is that may help us with having to dig less into our general fund, to fund some of the needs for the homeless here locally and other housing assistance that is needed. I want to thank you. Thank you. I would like to say how much I appreciate the speaker who is here from the Chico Mission. I am well familiar with their services. And it is excellent. What I particularly think is important as we look at these grant funds and things like that, when we go to dispense them and award grants to maybe service providers that are doing these things, is to look at the components of their programs and see if it is something we as a community can get to. And what I really appreciated about the gentleman's speech was bringing in the pieces about accountability. And it is okay to expect something of yourself and others. And it is okay if it is also faith driven. If that is what somebody needs to pull themselves through and get sober, then I think hurrah for them. I think that is wonderful and we should all be supportive of that. I think that programs such as that one and the adult recovery program through Salvation Army, are worthy places doing extremely good work and that have good success rates for people trying to recover. I have gone through the facilities before. It has been quite a long time since the mission, but not so long since the ARP one. And I would just encourage people to go visit. And I also would encourage you to donate. After being refreshed on the Chico Mission, I will make a donation there. And I appreciated hearing more about the services and the commitment to helping people and pushing them forward. And I think that is a great way to get people to continue pushing through. And the diversity aspect is also huge. We do have a very different composition in our city. We have young students and people that are homeless that are very young. We have the elderly. And we have all manner in between. Lots of single males that also have a great deal of trouble getting assistance if they don't have a tie to children or other things like veteran services. And I think sometimes people don't understand that connection. So when you guys do this, So when you guys are thinking about putting in monies for things, I just think if we can explore helping places like that too that are in our typical emergency bed shelters, that that would be much appreciated by the community. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Our last speaker is Greg Scott. Thank you, Council. I'm here to support 2.3. On behalf of the DCBA, I publicly thank Tom Milne-Oberback for his support and guidance. I publicly thank Tom Milne-Oberback for his support and guidance. It has been a pretty long time since I've been here. It has been a pretty long time since I've been here. It has been a very long nine months as we're restructuring DCBA and he's been very helpful and we appreciate it. And hopefully the confirmation Dale has been to every meeting and our Councilman has been to every meeting and our Councilman has been to every meeting and we really appreciate that. So I just wanted to say publicly thank you on behalf of the DCBA. Thank you. Thank you. All right, entertain a motion. Motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, Second from Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk, when you're ready. And that was a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda with item 2.1 being heard under regular business. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. So we'll move on to public comments. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda and that are within the jurisdiction's authority. So the council cannot take any action on this meeting at requests made under this section of the agenda. I know we're going to have speakers on a variety of topics, but let me just say this, because we did have some issues last time around. If, in fact, you want to talk about something relative to the city of Chico and the area and jurisdiction and the authority that we have, that is fine. If you want to talk about Israel or Hamas or Ukraine or Russia in terms of international policy, that's not what we're here for. So very specifically, your comments must tie to the city of Chico and within our areas and aspects of our purview. This is very much a business meeting. We are here to conduct the business of the city of Chico. Signs, thank you for having them in the back. We do not boo or clap, and I heard a few earlier, we do not also make outbursts during this meeting of any sort. So we do not want to discourage anyone in any way, shape, or form or encourage anyone in any way, shape, or form. So please adhere to those rules. If we don't have those, we will recess. If we have to clear the chambers, we will do that. We do not want to do that. So how many speakers do we have? We have 23. All right. Let's do two minutes. Two minutes. Okay. So I'm going to call, again, two names, and if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle. Daya Amar, followed by Terry DuBose. Good evening. I'd like to present this to you. The last time I was here, I presented the council with an agenda, or excuse me, with a resolution. I would like for the council to agendize looking and adopting this resolution. This resolution is to adopt a ceasefire in Gaza, as many other cities around the country have. I'm asking for the council to adopt a ceasefire in Gaza. I'm asking you to read it, look at it, agendize it. This does affect the Palestinian folks, citizens in the city of Chico, myself included. And I would be greatly appreciative if the city council would do something for us. Thank you. Thank you. Terry DuBose, followed by James Hutchinson. Good evening, council. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'm here tonight on behalf of Congressman Douglas, to convey his enduring support for our Jewish neighbors here in Chico, and our United States ally, Israel. Our Jewish neighbors deserve to feel safe in our city. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism is on the rise. It's in relation to Chico and the people in Chico. Okay. We need to have it directly related to the city of Chico and the business here. It's... Sorry. Go ahead. It's directly related to the previous... We will not have outbursts. Thank you. It's in relation to citizens in our town. So are you telling me I can't... I need to stop? What I'm saying is it has to be relative. So, Mr. City Attorney, we'll get his... If you can outline this for us so we're all clear. Thank you, Mayor. What the mayor is referring to, as indicated on the agenda, the council has certain... authority over certain items in their purview. So, as you know, this is a very complicated geopolitical issue that the city council has no authority to impact or affect. And what happens when there's discussion that's outside of the city council's purview is that there is no ability for legitimate issues that are affecting the residents that is within the city's purview from being discussed. So what the council is indicating, the mayor is indicating, is that discussion should be... is that discussion should be... there should be a nexus between city of Chico issues that are within the city council's purview and any issues outside of the purview should not be discussed at this time. It does impact other members of the audience's ability to discuss other issues that are currently on the agenda or outside the agenda that is within the city's purview. Okay, so I'm just not understanding. So just... For... Say, for example, Chico PD, if we were to have a meeting the ability to protect our citizens in Chico from anti-Semitism issues that is not part of... You can make that comment, but not relative to supporting whoever it might be that whoever you think we should support internationally. So you can relate your comments locally. So if that's your concern, address that concern, I think that would be... fall within that. Is my time running? No. No, I turned it. You can run it if you want. All right, I'll run it. I understand your legal aspect somewhat, but I just don't agree. And I feel like we need to stand up for our citizens in Chico, every single one of them, every one of them, no matter what race, color, anything that they are. And I feel that this is important in regards to that. So if... I'm just asking you to please consider... the public, you know, your constituents need to feel safe. There have been protests in the town. There have been things that have happened that have made people feel unsafe. You know, whether they're Jewish or whatever they are, they don't feel safe. And I think that's your job to protect them. So thank you. Thank you. James Hutchinson, followed by Io Savage. Forgive me if I change my original topic here. Junelli, when she ran for city council, called on the city council to make Zoom available to people who can't be here. And Burt, when she ran for city council, they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. But they wanted to make sure they are safe. That way you do not disrupt the entire proceedings with people yelling and screaming. You have individual chances of people. I think June 11th was right about that. I think making Zoom an available thing for you to adjourn a meeting and take it to Zoom for that period of time, for that particular problem that's causing the disruption, is a good idea. It gives everybody a chance to at least make their statement. If you're not going to follow through on it, you're not going to follow through on it. That's all there is to it. But give them a chance to make their statement in a way that is non-disruptive to the rest of us who have other business. And other business I'd rather discuss tonight. It's not going to happen, fortunately for you. But in terms of procedure, I think you ought to consider it. I think June 11th was right about that way of doing it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Zio Savage, followed by Marie Rodriguez. Hello. I'm here as a Jewish person asking you to please agendize the resolution that was presented to you earlier to call for a ceasefire and to also combat the rising Islamic phobia and Arab phobia that our fellow community members and students are facing every day as it increases. And thank you. That's all I have to say. Thank you. Marie Rodriguez, followed by Rasha. I'm here to request the agendizing of the proposed ceasefire resolution. Additionally, the attempt to issue a cease and desist order against Councilmember Addison Winslow for openly discussing public business is a concerning act of political repression, distorting the intended purpose of the Brown Act. Upholding the public interest requires candid and open discussions by policymakers, a commitment Winslow strives to uphold. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Rasha, followed by Shahira. Good evening. My name is Rasha. I am Muslim Palestinian American. I've been in this town for 30 years. And I've been in America for 40. So this town and this country has been my country longer than the country I came from. I'm here to ask you to please agendize the resolution that was presented to you earlier as a Palestinian. As Palestinians, we have no choice. We come because we're forced to come. But we do as best as we can in wherever we're sent to. It breaks my heart that my own people who I grew up as I was born in Palestine, I came to this country when I was 11. So as I was saying earlier. . . This country has done a lot for me. It has done a lot for my family. It has done a lot for a lot of Palestinians and a lot of foreigners. But you in this room are here to serve us as humans. Your last part of the pledge of the legion, it says, liberty and justice for all. So what makes this country great is the people that live in it. What made me come here, because this has been my home. And whenever anything happens, I'm the first to stand and say, no. I stand with the kid who can't speak for himself. I stand for the people who left their homes in paradise because their homes burned and they had no one to help them. And they chose my mosque for refuge. The first person that came to me when the fire happened. Was a military guy. And his first word that came out of his mouth was, assalamu alaikum. Which took me by shock. I thought he spoke Arabic. But he knew how to greet me. That's time. Thank you. I'm here to be a voice for the children of Gaza. So please. Extra time. Please. Thank you. And thank you for the time. Okay. Our next speaker is Shahira, followed by Laina. Thank you for moving. I'm Shahira. Hello. My name is Shahira. I'm a student here in Chico. As a town that revolves around the university and its students, I'd expect a little more support from our council as we ask for a safer environment as our schools refuse to do so. After 9-11, high school students here in Chico were given a task where they were asked which of these is a terrorist and had to choose between Sunnis and Shia, two branches of Islam. Your Muslim students had to choose between Sunni and Shia. But they are now facing the same Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese! Japanese Japanese Japanese last time and I'll say this again we have had to take on your labor to ensure that the city of Chico is safe for our students our voices will not be dismissed and your silence will only mean one thing will continue to grow will continue to mobilize and will continue to make an impact because if our schools don't support us our council doesn't support us our only option is to turn to the community rejecting this proposal and refusing to agendize it will not result in our silence but further mobilization we want to come back from break to a community where we feel safe we feel supported and we can just focus on our learning and we hope that you'll consider agendizing and passing this resolution thank you Elena, followed by Annette Jefferson hello my name is Lana and I am a Palestinian student I was born in Chicago but was raised in Chico from the age of four Both my siblings were born in Paradise and raised in Chico. My nieces and nephews were born and raised in Chico. My family has been... My family is here. My family is in Chico. But my other side of the family lives in Palestine. My grandparents... We are all members of your community. At the last meeting, we were told by the council that adapting the resolution is not within their purview. Yet we watched other cities adopt the same resolution. At the last meeting, we were told that the council is not here to discuss issues that is a secondary connection to. But this is not a secondary issue for your Palestinian community. We are here. We live here. We are a part of your community. As Chico residents, the 16,000 deaths of Palestinians in Palestine are not a part of your community. The death of our people right now is something that impacts me, my family, and the Palestinian community in Chico every single day. This is not a secondary issue. We are not secondary citizens. And we are pleading for a ceasefire to stop the relentless violence against our people. By refusing to agendize and pass a ceasefire resolution, the city of Chico has blood on its hands. Thank you. Thank you. Annette Jefferson, followed by Danielle Hildago. Is Annette Jefferson here? OK, we'll move to Danielle Hildago. I'm sorry if I mispronounced that. Thank you. Please agendize the updated resolution that you have been presented. A resolution that aims to support and protect our Palestinian American, Israeli American, Arab, Muslim, and Jewish community members here in Chico. I'm a professor at Chico State, and I'm speaking up for my students who have, for the last two plus, nearly three months, continued to be impacted by the devastating atrocities we're witnessing in Gaza, and hope you will seriously consider the resolution. Thank you. Thank you. I have to relate your comments to the city of Chico and what is happening here. Thank you very much. Our next speaker is Yamo Hakwa, followed by Rain Share. I will read the documents in DIA. These are meant to go with that document for your review. Last month, you were presented with a resolution, a resolution that's been adopted by even more city councils across the country, and the same exact text that you're presented with has been presented in Congress by Cori Bush, the same exact text that we presented you. So, other things that you're presenting with, I'm going to read them to you. Other city councils around the country are showing that, in fact, this is within our purview. This is how the government works. Civics, there's levels of government, right? Our local government, you definitely do things that are supposedly outside of your purview. You talk about paradise, you talk about things. It's my time. I understand it's your time, but it's also the community's time. So, comments relative to local issues. Exactly. We do not. Do you talk about... You've been presented with a resolution. That's my right. Yeah. Okay. It's my right to present a resolution. It's not your right to present a resolution. It is, in fact, your right to speak on topics within the purview of the city council. Exactly. Doing resolution per our rules, unlike other cities who don't have those rules that they follow. In our rules, it says very clearly that we are not to do resolutions on issues outside of our purview. Okay. So... I'll talk about your rules. Talk about our rules. Talk about local issues. Yeah. That's fine. Talk about what's happening internationally. That's not our purview. So, unlike other city councils that I've been at, right, there are many, the majority that I've seen, and across the country, obviously do take into consideration. This council has, in fact, taken issues outside of their purview, and they do it all the time as of now for other... Yeah. Places like Paradise. That's not in your purview, but yet you take positions on that. You do moments of silence for that. So, this also, usually a city council to agendize a resolution, which is absolutely the right of the public to present to you, usually takes one council member to propose it and one to second it. Yet this council has its own set of rules, special set of rules, where it takes four of you to even put something on the agenda, which is incredibly undemocratic. Okay. It's silencing of your people here. You should be going the other way, where it should make it easier for the public to bring issues to you and you discuss them. But there's obviously a political agenda that is amongst particular political affiliations amongst you that want to make sure that nothing you want to talk about gets put on the agenda. That's quite obvious. And I hope that we can vote some of you out. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. A brain share followed by... Excuse me. So, hold on one second. Okay. No snapping, no cheering, no clapping. Please. Thank you. Can I sign or is that illegal? Ma'am, please do not make another outburst. And if I could please cue up the next speaker, which is Mohabin. Thank you. Go ahead, Rainn. Okay. Okay. So, I... I have been in Chico since 2004 and I have been a local small business owner since 2014. I have been a community advocate and volunteer for many years. I am here to ask you to agendize the community proposed resolution for a ceasefire. I am a Jew who was born in Jerusalem. I am both an Israeli citizen and a US citizen. A central value of Jewish tradition is called Tikkun Olam, which means repairing the world. It is our duty to speak up for respect for all lives. Both here and abroad. In addition to agendizing and adopting the proposed resolution, I also urge you to be proactive to meet with local educators and faith leaders to address the real experience and concerns here in this community of the rising racist harassment that particularly Muslim and Arab and Palestinian members of the community have been facing. This is a matter of public safety and that is certainly within the city's purview. Actually, it's... Central to the city's purview. If you actually read the resolution that has been proposed, it speaks for the protection of both Israeli and Palestinian lives. That speaks to our local community here, which includes the Palestinian, Muslim, Arab community members as well as Jewish community members. This is something that would actually take very little effort on your part to do, though you seem to be really resistant to that. And it could make a really big difference in the overall environment. Okay. I think it's very important to address the general public safety to make such a statement. I think it's very important to address the general public safety to make such a statement. Thank you. Muhammad followed by Shandana. On Thursday, November 16th, you, Mayor, came to Chico High School and answered some of our questions. One question I asked was why can you guys as the city council not send out a resolution or a statement? I think it's very important. when cities like Richmond did. But you told us that Richmond was the other side, meaning they're pro-Israeli. So I did my research and I found an article by the Los Angeles Times titled California City First in U.S. to Officially Back Palestinians Accuses Israel of Ethnic Cleansing. This article shows the Richmond statement for Palestine. Don't you think it's frustrating when you're told something but it turns out it's otherwise? This is all we are asking from you guys as the City Council is to adopt the resolution and send out a statement. I truly urge you guys to establish a resolution as perfect as the City of Richmond did, which we gave to you guys already. One last thing before I end this off is neutrality supports the oppressor. Continue. Thank you. Okay, Shandana followed by Ramzia. Hello, my name is Shandana and I'm a student at Chico High. I'm frustrated, as we all are, dealing with racism and discrimination in schools and other public areas. This is a direct issue in Chico because I'm dealing with this and so are my friends who go to Chico High. Mayor, you came to our school, Chico High. I asked you. I'm in the end of the club. I asked you if you as the mayor could write a statement for us Muslim and Arabs because we do not feel safe here in Chico. You said the other council members did not agree with the idea of writing a statement. We're frustrated with the ongoing cause and the effect it's having on all of us. Why can't you write a statement knowing it will make us feel more safe in Chico? Or do you just not agree with doing a statement to make us feel safe? We are here asking you again. Knowing you have that right. We have the power to put out a resolution and a simple statement. We're facing a lot of discrimination against our face and just by how we look like. Again, we do not feel safe in school or outside of school, which is why we're asking for your support. This is our last resort. Otherwise, we wouldn't be asking here. Okay, Ramzia followed by Bill Monroe. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. with rising Islamophobia on campuses and public areas in Chico. I have been called bombers and having my hijab almost ripped off. Our cultures and religions are being associated with terrorism instead of empathy. The city council responds with borderism. The school tells us they can't do anything. The council tells us they can't do anything. So where are we exactly supposed to turn? The direct link between the rise in Islamophobia has been experienced for the last 60 days of violence in Palestine. And adapting a resolution would support your students and community by bringing a halt to the justification for this Islamophobia. Over 50,000 women in Palestine are pregnant. They are having surgery without any... medications and the... immature babies are being killed. So again, relate... Yes, they're being killed because there's no electricity, there's no food. And it's not within the city of Chico's purview. It has to be within the city of Chico's purview. Ma'am? It starts off... Okay. We're going to take a 10-minute recess.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We now have district elections. I think this is a very important thing. I think that people who have, without indicating, people who have issues that are of concern to them and they live in a certain district should contact their district representative. Edison Winslow is mine. He is in District 4. The others are all in different districts, depending on what part of town you live in. And that's a much more effective way, I think, to email and contact and speak with your individual district folks if you want to get something done from the council. And that being said, I was kind of shocked and amazed to see the article on the front page of the ER today in which Edison was subject to a cease and desist order or some kind of craziness, in my opinion. And... I find that very... He is my representative, and I think that he was treated very disrespectfully and inappropriately by this council in closed session. Thank you. Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Ann Harrison. And if you could please line up in the middle corridor. Hello again. So I want to talk about safety. I want to thank you for the encampments that are shrinking around town. We still have some hot spots, of course, but I'm very impressed at the swift noticing that happens directly upon conclusion of another. So things have tightened up there, and I think our community very much appreciates it. However, there are RVs and other vans and folks posted up in neighborhoods who are making messes with trash and other, and we're dumping raw sewage. And so people are calling that in. Tags from 2004. So, and it's not a non-op. He drives around. And this happens with other vehicles too. I feel like there is like a different classist thing happening here, where if you're homeless, you basically have a free-for-all pass. And I know that that's not the city's intent. That's like DMVs involved too, and others and people not being willing to accept large vehicles in tow lots. However, it is a big problem. And there's a safety issue happening too with some of these folks. The other is the city attorney. It would be great if we could please implement something where you can actually start doing the civil part related to the prosecution. And I think it's just a little bit of a challenge to just go through the process of executing or maybe it's the criminal part when there are issues instead of millions of citations that go nowhere. It's been very frustrating for very many years. And again, some people are treated differently just on status. And then the other element of safety for me, I want to bring up that the local Jewish community has a Hanukkah celebration downtown in the city Plaza. This Sunday at 4 o'clock. that looks like an open invite and I think that would be the appropriate venue where we can come in support of them and I do feel for Palestinian folks as well that feel that their People are unsafe too. So I hope we come together. Thank you Thank you Ann Harrison followed by Ann Palavka Hello, I have put together a list of action items that the council can take to address local issues within our community Number one you can meet with local educators and school officials to discuss ways to address the experiences of racism that students have shared Number two, you can reach out to community leaders including those of community centers Nonprofits and religious institutions to ask what they are experiencing in the community Work with them on a plan to provide support make sure to include Palestinian voices during this time number three Educate yourselves on local racial disparities And income health care police violence and school disciplinary action Number four stop shutting down the voices of those who are the most impacted you cannot speak for those you who you have never listened to Please agendize the resolution for ceasefire, which was presented to you. Thank you And Palavka followed by Monica McDaniel Hello council members I'm speaking as somebody who's lived in Butte County And Chico for most of my life worked here for years for decades and I'm speaking to the matter purview What's the purview of the council I've noticed over the years that I've lived here that we've had a history here in Chico of? affirming and solid solid affirming and expressing solidarity with those that are militarily involved in international struggles as examples the photos on Huge posters huge banners along East Avenue that have been decorated with the photos of young girls and men and women serving in the Armed Forces And that's a way of promoting and honoring the military and those who choose to serve their country in international military Adventures and Chico has adorned the front of this very building with a statue of a Hmong general deemed a US hero in the Vietnam War Again a promotion of the military in the militaristic way of resolving international political problems And now local Chico people are asking the council to affirm support and solidarity with those that nationally and internationally Are asking for an immediate ceasefire and an anti-us military funding of Israel? So I ask also in support of Council resolving to support immediate ceasefire and an anti-us military funding of Israel to protect lives They're being snuffed out by the illness bombing and that Instead those funds be redirected towards support as some of Chico's and Butte County's especially Chico's because we're Chico here basic needs for housing mental health care and addiction care, thank you Thank You Monica McDaniel followed by Florence Good evening council I am the liaison between the Chico Arts Commission and the Chico arts and culture foundation and I've been asked to just come and let you know We're having a year-end Mixer and we have invitations for you and you can make it great if not we wish you happy holidays and a Happy New Year Thank you. Thank you Florence followed by Gina backs Hello, I am a local Chico resident my whole life and I'm here to support the resolution That Chico adopt to support a ceasefire. This is a resolution to local Palestinians local Muslim community in need of your support and you can do these things that if you don't want to do this resolution you can show your the constituents your support in other ways like Anna was talking about talk to your community leaders talk to the religious leaders here and see why there's so much racism and Economic disparity in Chico and see what you can do as city council members to change that. Thank you Thank you. Gina backs followed by Patrick Newell Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council want to thank you for your continued dedication for the city of Chico and the work you do to improve the quality of life of its residents. I'm here to request you continue to make the city a safe place for all members of our community, especially to those who might be feeling threatened by some of the anti-semitic chants we have heard at past meetings and also all over our community. And please give the same opportunity to all to speak as you are doing with this group here. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Patrick Newell. Good evening and thank you for this opportunity. My name is Patrick Newell. I live in Chico and I'm here to speak on behalf of funding by the city for the libraries. I'm sure that you have heard that all the Butte County libraries are on the chopping block for next year's budget. To temporarily curb this, the county supervisors approved six new funding projects. The first was the one-time bailout, spending contingency funds that pay for three additional days the county library branches would be open each week. This was a one-time bailout, using contingency funds to supplement the general fund monies until June, at which time the libraries will be open three fewer days per week. In order to keep the library branches open, financial support is needed from both the cities the libraries serve as well as the county. The public library in Chico was once funded by the city's city of Chico. In previous funding downturns, the county took over funding all of the libraries from the cities. As the city of Chico works to develop its budget for the next year, please include funding for the Chico public library branch. I urge the members of this council to work with their counterparts in the county and with the county supervisors to collaborate and secure ongoing funding for the libraries. We seek a return to full funding that will keep our library branches available to the community at least five days a week. Thank you for your time. Thank you and that was it for business from the floor, excuse me, public comments. All right, item four, public hearings. If we don't have any, move me on to our regular agenda. 2.1 resolution, city council, the city of Chico determining the preparation of the active transportation plan. And I believe we have a presentation from Mr. Ottoboni, director of engineering. Chair, are you on the stand? Chair, are you on the stand? Chair, are you on the stand? Chair, are you on the stand?

If adopted, this plan would supersede the existing bicycle plan and continue the city's eligibility to apply for active transportation program grants. I would like to introduce Summer Lopez and Todd Tregenza from GHD Inc., our consultant who helped prepare this plan. Summer and Todd will give a presentation highlighting the development process of this plan and some of the main content of the document. We're happy to answer any questions after GHD's presentation. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Council members. My name is Todd Tregenza. I'm a transportation planner with GHD. With me, I've got Summer Lopez, who's also a transportation planner with GHD. My name is Thomas Thomas. We're looking forward to presenting our plan to you here tonight. We'll certainly be here for any questions and answers at the end. Try to keep the presentation snappy. We want to talk a bit about the background and goals of the plan. Why are we updating this plan? Why are we creating this plan? We want to talk a bit about some of the highlights, the prioritization, the improvement projects, the top ten, kind of what next steps and what we believe that this plan accomplishes. And where it takes us from here. So what informed the plan? This plan rests on the shoulders of a lot of recent efforts that the city has undertaken. These include even the city's bicycle plan in 2019. We've added on to that. That plan strictly was for bicycle modes of transportation. This new plan, as the name implies, is all active modes. So that includes pedestrian modes as well. So that includes pedestrian modes as well. We do include some policy recommendations for the city to consider, perhaps when updating the circulation element of the general plan in the future. It also includes some non-infrastructure programs. And again, it rests on a lot of a wide planning foundation of citywide documents, including the general plan and local roadway safety plan. The goals of the plan are, as you might imagine, to encourage active transportation. These align with a lot of the state and regional, as well as local goals and funding strategies, funding criteria. So something you'll hear from our presentation is that we wanted to ensure to align the plan. One of our key drivers was to align the plan and make the city eligible for funding opportunities down the road. We wanted to also build on your investments. You've made a lot of investments in cities' active transportation system, particularly trails. And paths. And we want to make sure we connect those and maximize those. I'll talk a little bit about how we do that in the presentation. So this is our project schedule. As you can see, we started our project last spring in April and had a lot of engagement throughout that time in this last year. We released our public draft plan in October of this year and are now here tonight to talk about the final plan. Engagement was very critical to the development of this plan. All of our recommendations were guided by public feedback. And the reason that it's such a high priority is because it really helps the city to successfully receive grant funding in the future if their engagement is very strong. And one of the reasons for that is many grant programs, especially the highly competitive and sought after active transportation program, requires that engagement be not only robustly conducted in the community, but also that it's written about in the application. And this plan achieved that. So all comments that we've received during the public draft period, as well as any comments we received tonight from you or any public comment will all be included in an appendix after tonight. This is just a couple of photos from our community engagement. From left to right, we have our workshops, which is workshop one through three. These are some examples of our boards. You see a dot board. I just wanted to give an example of how folks engaged with us and kind of telling us about what types of facilities they were going to be using. And then on the right is the comments that we received. And this is just one image of many that we had from maps of little post-it notes that people left comments on these maps during our workshops. What we did with this information, we then took it back and digitized the comments onto our website, which I'm going to talk about now for a moment. This was what our project website looks like. It gave folks an opportunity to get involved, to learn about project background, to kind of follow along with the project. To kind of follow along with our schedule, what our public events were happening, and of course, download any important project documents. We also had a survey. And what we did with the survey was we presented it for folks who attended the early workshop, but also anyone that maybe didn't get a chance to attend a workshop. It gave them an opportunity to kind of have some questions, to mull over and think about what type of feedback they wanted to provide. And for those that did attend the workshops that also took this survey, it just kind of gave them a little bit of extra food for thought. If they weren't able to attend the workshops, they would have to go back and do it again. So we did that. And we also had a survey that was really helpful to provide us all of their comments at the workshop. In total, we received, I believe, 152 survey responses. And, yeah, this is what that looked like. We also had an online interactive map. This was in the very early phase of our workshops and our public engagement period. We actually received over 1,000 comments on this interactive map. And some of the themes that we got through these comments were a desire to see the world. A desire to see more trails and the connectivity of Bikeway 99. Enhanced trail amenities. Better bicycle and pedestrian connectivity. Improved and safer crossings, especially at intersections. Improved maintenance, which specifically addressed things like potholes or the actual condition of bicycle pedestrian facilities, as well as, like, leaves in the bikeways. And, of course, lots of comments around safe routes to school. Pass it back to Tom. Thanks. We're going to go back and forth just one more time. I want to do a quick reorientation to the types of bikeways that are in this plan. Some of these are things that you're already familiar with. The city has a number of them already. Class 1 shared use paths are outside of the street. They're a separate right of way. They can be used by cyclists and joggers, pedestrians, people with strollers, all of that. Class 2 are essentially bike lanes. These are pretty standard. You've probably seen. You have definitely seen a number of these around the city. And then there's an enhancement to that called the buffered bike lane, which is on the right of the screen, which adds a little bit more physical separation through paint between the cyclist and the motor vehicles. Class 3 is a shared road. This tends to be on a low-stress street, so a neighborhood street, some facility with less traffic, less conflict. A lower-stress environment for the cyclist where they can share the space with the vehicle. It's kind of the least separated facility type. And then the lower three are new to this plan. And these are Class 4. And these are similar to bike lanes, the Class 2. But they are physically separated now, not just by paint, but by bollards or a curb or a planter box. And so these are becoming a new tool in the bike planter toolbox. And you will start seeing these pop up more and more frequently where appropriate. So just some numbers on what the plan accomplishes. You all already have a good amount of bicycle infrastructure, but the plan really increases a lot. You know, the Class 1 trail system that I think you all already should be very proud of. It's more than doubled. And the plan. So the plan at Build Out would more than double the amount of Class 1 shared use paths. It would also more than double the amount of bike lanes. And it would more than double the Class 3 shared bike and road environment. There's also an enhancement to that called a bike boulevard. We can get into that if you have any questions. But the last one is perhaps the most significant where you already have a short Class 4 bikeway today. But it's a new one. It's called the But we call for a total of 25 miles of that. And one thing I'll also note is that these recommendations, they were prepared. We were looking at the entire city. And so it was a relatively high level study. These enhancement these project recommendations may be bolstered or modified during the delivery of the project. But we wanted to at least have a preliminary recommendation based on the data that we had and the constraints that we had identified. But new constraints. new opportunities will present themselves as the projects do materialize and continue down the development phase. This is one of my favorite slides, and it kind of answers the question, you know, why are we doing this? And I hope that you can see it on your screens a little bit more clearly than I can see it on that one. But on the left, there's a map of what we call the level of traffic stress, and that's where we basically put every street, every facility into one of four buckets. The lowest stress, which is where you would feel comfortable taking your kids of all ages, they can ride, it tends to be, you know, shared use paths or streets, maybe neighborhood streets with very low traffic volumes to level of traffic stress for. These are the red lines on the map, and these are the ones where really, unless you're the most avid and confident cyclist, you're not going to be showing up on those roads. Those include things like East and Eaton, you know, your major arterioles. Highway 32, Park Avenue, things like that. So then the middle image is your low stress network today, and what you can hopefully see is that there's lots of pockets of low stress. These are your local neighborhoods, and what's preventing connectivity between them, so people need to get across these red line barriers, and they can't, right, because there's these stressful networks that are breaking apart the stuff they want to get to. Whether they want to get to work, school, church, whatever it is, right? The improvements that we get from implementing the bikeway is the map on the right, and you can see all those pockets are connected. So we, the plan at build out, which albeit is a large build out, it will take many years to build the entire thing out, but at build out, we've planned for a connected system that eliminates those barriers, those stress islands, those low stress islands. Anyway, sorry, geeking out on that a little bit. But I also want to talk about the pedestrian mode. This was new, this was added. Pedestrians can obviously benefit also from the class one, those shared use paths, those trails. There's more than 120 crossing improvements, so we want to make sure that we include projects in there that make the city eligible for funding for like flashing beacons, bulb outs that bring pedestrians closer, you know, bring it, tighten in the crossing distance, and more than six miles, which is a modest number of sidewalks because frankly you have sidewalks in most places, but we did want to close those gaps we identified. So this is our recommendations development process. As you can see, we held outreach and engagement throughout this entire process. We began with the needs assessment that helped us look at identifying the gaps in the bicycle and pedestrian connectivity, collision history, the LTS analysis that Todd just mentioned, as well as looking at public comment. We then moved into our project recommendations phase, and then prioritization, which is our methodology for determining how to score these projects. We also did a stakeholder presentation series, which was a mini-presentation series with the Chico Active Transportation Technical Advisory Committee, Chico staff, BCAG, in-L 오, and the school districts. And then we finalized all of this as part of the draft plan, taking it back out to workshop three. This is our methodology process, and its purpose was to really help us dig in and discover which projects would rise to the top of the lists. And all of this came from grant language or requirements, and it will really help the city to write narratives for grant applications that are strong and competitive. And the things that we looked at included safety, connectivity, gap closures, public comment, multimodality, safe routes to school, and equity. There's themes here kind of going on that we've found throughout our entire public engagement process, and we wanted to represent that here. It also really, like I said, mirrors the criteria or the requirements in grant program language, specifically the active transportation program. And then just how this will work in practice is we ended up actually with one list of priority projects and realized that we really needed to separate it into two. There's kind of low-hanging fruit, achievable projects, that added on to a maintenance project may only be in the tens of thousands of dollars. So we had these low-complexity projects that we wanted to pull out and separate from the bigger projects. The bigger projects are pouring new concrete, whether that be a class one or the class four designation that I mentioned earlier. Those tend to be the more expensive ones. And again, this is high level, but it's a first raw cut of the prioritization matrix in play, and it allows us to start grouping things together. We see some of the things that we've done in the past, we've done some clusterings that are shown here in the green of like a downtown project. We can start assembling projects together here and adding in when you are putting together your grant application, some of the node improvement, the intersection improvements as well. You can start assembling these packages that are going to be very highly competitive based on this kind of raw high-level priority prioritization effort. And then these are the higher complexity ones. As you can see, they're almost entirely class one or class four bikeways. So bigger projects provide a lot of benefit, but clearly more expensive. We also have proposed policy recommendations, and these really cover the five E's of non-infrastructure. Including these does not mean that the city is immediately adopting any new policies, but rather they're here to really help set the city up for success in receiving grant funds. And what I mean by that is that these are kind of quicker to implement solutions, and they also really help to build the infrastructure. They help strengthen an infrastructure application, which I'll talk about in just a second. But these policy recommendations under these five E's include things like training programs, hazard reporting, bicycle detection, and then signage to indicate that bicycles are in the roadway, or pedestrians are coming, etc. Those are just a few examples. We also have non-infrastructure as part of this plan. And again, this is also a very powerful tool to pair with an infrastructure project. Specifically in the active transportation programs combination project type, which blends infrastructure and non-infrastructure together in one application. Overall, historically, those projects tend to score higher and receive more funding more often than other projects that are standalone, such as non-infrastructure only or infrastructure only projects. The strengthening piece of this, the reason that this makes projects stronger, when you include things like those policy recommendations or non-infrastructure as part of an infrastructure application, is because it shows commitment by the city to include active transportation at all levels and for all people. It also helps to teach and encourage the public to use active modes, which is really important in shifting ideology or shifting behavior change, getting people out of their cars, all of that stuff is really important, especially when the city makes such a strong investment in actually building infrastructure. We want people to use it. So these things help do that. So what does this plan accomplish? It identifies and documents challenges and problems. It provides a plan for priorities. It describes all types of projects and proposed recommendations. It provides an achievable strategic plan for implementation. And it includes grant-ready content that will kickstart future funding applications. Ultimately, we really want this plan to lead to real, on-the-ground projects that enhance the quality of life for Chico's residents and creates a safer and connected bicycle and pedestrian network for people of all ages and abilities. To do that, again, the city must be successful in doing so. We want to be successful in receiving different types of funding, specifically grant funding. And so that's really why this plan exists. It's here to help set the city up for grant readiness and ultimately to be successful in actually receiving funding. That's all we have. So I think I'll turn it back to Brendan. Nothing further from me. Great job. So I guess we'll toss it back to the council for consideration and open up for public comment. All right. Questions from the council before we go on to public comment? Mr. Winston. First, I just want to say, great job. I don't know that I've ever seen, like, such robust public comment and engagement through the whole process. And I just kind of went to the workshops, met you guys there, and seen a whole lot of people be involved. And it's a really high-level project that involves a lot of details about our streets. And people are familiar with them. So we got, like, a lot of really good information. I have all the public comment right here. And it's just like, yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot. There's a lot. It's even denser than it looks, really. You mentioned that Class 4 ‑‑ no, sorry, not Class 4. Class 3 is a bicycle boulevard. And that that's ‑‑ you know, what I want to understand is you say this is an achievable plan. And I want to make sure that what is achievable about it isn't held up by what you think is feasible up here, that we're not going to hold up a more ambitious plan for making our streets more safe. So could you explain what a bicycle boulevard is? How it differs from a Class 3? And why we would in certain places propose just a Class 3 and not a bicycle boulevard? Yeah. I think I'll start. And then, Todd, if you have anything to add. So bicycle boulevards often include traffic calming measures as a part of the actual, like, Class 3. And, again, we didn't really get super into it. But the reason that we might propose a Class 3 would be on a very slower ‑‑ like, a much slower street, like a residential street or something that's lower in that traffic structure. So when we rated the streets for the level of traffic stress, that's rating the comfortability of a cyclist in a roadway. A score that is at a 1 or a 2 is something that's far more comfortable. It's usually, like, less than 30 miles an hour. Something that's just a slow, usually residential street, those might call for a Class 3. And the reason that we might want to suggest a Class 3 boulevard versus a ‑‑ just like a Class 3 bike route, we would do that because it might ‑‑ you know, it might be a little bit more comfortable. But it might be a street that ‑‑ maybe it's something that's closer to downtown. Maybe it's something that's on a residential street that needs to be slower, that needs to maybe have some speed humps or something else to kind of slow the traffic down. In addition to allowing the road space for bicyclists to use. Do you have anything to add to that? Some minor things about bike boulevards is that you tend to reduce the amount of traffic control for the cyclist. So if there's stop signs, you want it to be on the side streets. You want to give the cyclist a little bit more space. You want to give the cyclist priority. And then they often include some sort of way finding. And it may be really useful in closing the gap between a trail system. If you have a nice local street, you can continue some way finding, you know, this way to Bidwell or something like that. Yeah. So one of the examples ‑‑ and I know that we could get into so much detail on this because even just that, like, proposed bicycle facility map or pedestrian project map is very ‑‑ I mean, it's the whole city, right? We're looking all over the place. But one, C and O, this avenue goes right by Pleasant Valley High School. And this is where a post class 3 bike grow, but not a bicycle boulevard. And that's the kind of thing I'm like, well, you know, maybe we can bump that up with something I had in mind. But a couple more questions about crosswalks and protected bike lanes. So in the ‑‑ in that survey, the 152 responses that you mentioned, in crosswalks, we had people ‑‑ 62% of people said they were more comfortable with high visibility markings. And after that, pedestrian refuge islands and a little piece of concrete in the middle of the street that ‑‑ and flashing beacons at 55%. And so you guys are the consultants, so maybe it's not even a great question for you. I don't see a policy that, like, really has a hard improvement on current policy with regard to crosswalks. It's a concern of mine because of a few recent projects that have removed painted crosswalks. An intersection is still a legal place to cross a street, but it just becomes less safe. So I'm just going to go ahead and answer that. So on Park Avenue, 15th Street, 17th Street, 18th Street all had crosswalks prior to the rehabilitation. And then they're lost. And I wonder, I mean, do you think there's anything in the plan that would prevent something like that from happening again? That's the question I asked. Or can a policy be added to this? Is this what I'm looking for there? Yeah, I'll take that one.
