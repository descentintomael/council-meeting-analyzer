 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Please.  Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  All right.  Madam Clerk, can you do the roll, please?  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  And Mayor Coolidge.  Yes.  All right.  Welcome, everybody.  Speaker Card Announcement.  Anybody wishing to address the Council on any matter listed on the agenda should first  complete the Speaker Card.  Found back in the room on that little table.  Turn it in to my left, to your right, to the City Clerk here.  Once all the Speaker Cards will be taken in the order received, and then,  once the first Speaker has been called, we will not accept further cards on that particular item.  So, and then we have our Closed Session Announcement from City Attorney John Lamb.  Good evening, Mr. Mayor, City Council.  Earlier this evening, the City Council recessed in Closed Session.  All Council Members were present, with the exception of Councilwoman Tandon, on Item 2.1,  where she recused herself with respect to the SEIU Union item.  On the Item 2.1, Council was briefed.  Council was briefed.  Direction was provided.  No final action was taken.  Item 2.2, City Council was briefed.  Direction was provided.  No final action was taken.  And Item 2.3, the Council conducted, continued their evaluations.  Direction was provided.  No final action was taken.  That concludes my report. I will tell you this is one of  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And the reason why is because I had a distant relative called Calvin Coolidge, who was president  way back when, but nobody remembers.  And he said, the business of America is business.  And I think that rings true for our city as well as other cities.  So I've got this proclamation for Small Business Month, May 2024, whereas America's progress  has been driven by pioneers who think big, take risks, and work hard in the small business  community is at the very core of our history history history history history history  history history history history history history history history history history history  history history history history history history history history history history history  history history history history history history history history history history history  history history history history history history history history history history history history  Whereas California's small businesses account for over 99% of the total businesses in the state and are global leaders in innovation and economic competitiveness and embody the entrepreneurial spirit that drives the economy of the Golden State.  And whereas Governor Newsom proclaimed May to be Small Business Month in order to recognize the vital importance of small businesses to the state economy, and whereas Team Chico, the local economic development collaborative, provides various businesses and workforce services to help small businesses thrive in the city of Chico,  and whereas the city of Chico supports and joins efforts to help small businesses do what they do best, grow their business, create jobs, and ensure that the community remains as vibrant as ever,  and that small businesses are as vibrant tomorrow as they are today.  It would be a result from the City of Chico City Council that we do proclaim May 2024 Small Business Month and urge each individual in the community to patronize a small business shop local, and I would say support Chico businesses, but I'd also say get it in Chico.  Get it in Chico.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mayor, Council.  On behalf of the Chico Chamber of Commerce and the Team Chico organizations, including the Small Business Development Center, the Alliance for Workforce Development, the Downtown Chico Business Association, thank you for this proclamation.  But most of all, we just want to thank all the small businesses who choose Chico to do business.  People may not realize there's probably over 4,400 businesses in town.  About 90% of them have 20 or less employees.  Small business is the engine that drives Chico.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll move on to the consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda can be considered routine in nature and therefore can be enacted in one motion.  Do we have any speakers?  We have none.  no votes or just politicians? I wanted to poll 2.6 and then just register a no vote 2.7.  All right. So no, I need to recuse myself on 2.2 and 2.5. All right.  Any others?  I'm a clerk. Let me know if you have any other limitations.  Okay. And so that was a no vote by council member Winslow on 2.7.  Okay. Thank you. All right. Was there a motion?  No, not yet. Okay.  Okay.  Okay. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Morgan. Yes. Council member Tandon.  Yes. Council member Van Overbeek. Yes. Council member Winslow. Yes. Vice mayor Reynolds. Aye.  Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carrie 7-0. All right.  2.6 was polled.  That's right. Okay. 2.6. Go ahead.  Yeah. Often I would just vote no when I don't think it necessarily needs discussion. But I  thought about it and I decided it was worth giving a little bit of an explanation as to  why and not just dropping it out. So this is pay increases that were negotiated in closed session  for the firefighters union. And I looked at it and I just thought, I don't know exactly how we  got here. And we're doing all these negotiations,  piecemeal. And we're looking at percent increases. And the reason I think some members might be  surprised that we're willing to settle on the sum that we did settle on. It's $4.2 million over  three years. And I say that because I had a conversation with some union members last year.  And they told me that they're not looking to ask for more higher pay for themselves. But they  pitched to me the need that we have for certain infrastructure projects just to provide better  level of service to the city. Whole areas of the city that aren't well covered by a fire station. And so we need to look at budgeting appropriately for as a whole. So I think that's what I was saying.  thing but history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history  s a good reason for us to  consider paying increases we'  re going to fail writing  services we'  re not going to fill  these positions unless we give  these pay increases I'  m not seeing that  consistently applied across the  board. In addition to that we'  re making big promises here  based on money we have right now  but we'  ve considered that measure  h is at risk in November and  these multi-million dollar  obligations in the future when  we'  because we are needing some  necessary infrastructure I think  we should consider more strongly  where we put our money there.  I think it would be worth it for  us to take this back and discuss  it further.  Chair Kite- I move to approve.  Chair Kite- I'  ll give you a second.  Chair Kite- Motion by  the vice-chairman. Second by  the history history history  on request made under this section of the agenda how many people do we have for public comment  all right three minutes okay i'll call the first two speakers and if you could go ahead  and line up in that middle aisle nicole nava followed by sam barber  good evening tonight as a private citizen i wanted to recognize our city of chico public  works employees for their dedication in tirelessly cleaning out the endless homeless encampments  and the hundreds by now thousands of tons of garbage and awful public health hazards like  the hundreds of needles they recently had to pick up and other biohazardous materials so i want to  leave this certificate of appreciation from us at save our chico administrators with director  gustafson so he and his staff has have a physical document to reflect that there are people who see  and acknowledge their hard work  you  this is a nearly thankless and iterative task and can be so discouraging because they barely get one  spot cleared and another one pops up instantly needing attention it's never deemed fast enough  by community members who are equally frustrated and disheartened at the rinse and repeat nature  of this issue hopefully we all recognize that this is a federal and statewide roadblock we face  in cleaning our cities and people getting actual help because without a change in policies that  strengthen laws to make crime not  not  history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history !  I hope they engage in services  and what we can do is to address  any of the violations of our  ordinances exactly as we would  with anyone else in this  community. Smoking and alcohol  are not permitted in our city  parks nor is starting fires in  non-approved areas or cutting  down saplings or trees. Hold  them accountable. Let'  s staff up our park rangers to  appropriate levels and ensure it  remains at a seven day per week  schedule getting covered. We  have to hold the line where we  can. Let'  s also be clear that while some  deem the pallet shelter a  success, the operators doing the  best they can within the confines  of the settlement and the  challenges expressed by the state  and federal unwillingness to change  and hold people accountable, this  model is not nor will ever be  truly successful unless we can  compel treatment. They had an  being built by 1668 shelter  occupants of which 18 were  placed in some type of housing  situation. As we get closer to  the sunset of the shelter in  three more years let'  s remember we do not  have to continue that venture we  don'  t need to feel railroaded into  maintaining it. It would be one  thing if they were full and had  to get treatment but that'  s not the case.  I think we need to be respectful  of taxpayer funds and balance  things and again I want to say  thank you very much to our public  service workers.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  on our window, in which a certain individual expressed it makes their whole body excited  to witness Gazan buildings being bombed and destroyed and left his home address on the  note that he left us.  Meanwhile, I've watched and listened as you write what are essentially blank checks to  the police department, giving them a raise they didn't even ask for some months ago,  and on one occasion, giving them a $40,000 signing bonus to laterals.  Some of you expressed that it isn't your responsibility to question these representatives  of the police department, while only one of you asked any meaningful questions.  When asked, the representative could not say if it would actually help them bring in new  officers, that you gave them the money anyways, and even joked as if they shouldn't have  that information when asking for more money.  I am also very uncomfortable at the fact that the police have munitions capable of  liquefying human flesh, and I'm concerned at how they will conduct themselves if college  kids choose to exercise their right to protest.  I have watched as you again and again go after the most vulnerable people in our society,  even attempting to criminalize homelessness for up to a year.  I have watched as you acted instantaneously to file a cease and desist to a fellow council  member for daring to speak to a journalist about a closed door meeting you had.  Might I also add, this council member is the only renter on the council.  Last time I checked, the citizens of Chico were not concerned about the council being  less transparent to their constituents.  In fact, you should be working on making sure you are not.  You should be working on making sure you are as transparent as possible, and not deliberately  try to keep information from the public.  One of you expressed that if somebody cannot live off the stipend for council members,  they don't belong on the council.  This is a blatantly classist and pompous statement to make.  I can only surmise that the fact that all but one of you has taken money from the same  political action committee is interfering with your ability to be an effective community  leader.  We will continue showing up, we will continue to hold you responsible, and we will not  forget your inaction during these times.  If you do not change course, we will not let you go.

reform passed on a state level was just a lot of work you know you  got to get everybody to call your local representative and get it through all the  different different levels that it did and we did get three of them past these last three years  care court it's going to come to sb 43 soon to be called mark's law and prop one boy was that a  nail biter but i tell you what i i really appreciate living in a town like chico and  that all these people do rise to the occasion when they have to and have to do what they have  to do to get these things passed i also noticed this park over here is empty and thank you you  know i care about people and i know you do too and when we have to walk out and see the people that  sleep on it sleep on the ground on a daily basis you know that's kind of discouraging but these  last few years man you guys did a great job you know helping pick that up and start trying to get  people help and i appreciate that and so do the people that i represent thank you  thank you our last speaker is katie posey  good evening um i want to share something that i brought up at a recent board supervisor  meeting so if you were at that meeting then you're going to get a repeat but this is related  to transparency this is related to that recent report that came out from the california inter  state fund for homelessness and it was about tracking how the state money was being spent  now i'm bringing this up here because even though a lot of the funds that go towards homelessness  i realize are from the state or federal level i still think this is in your city so i think it  would be in your interest right to know how those funds were being spent and if they're being spent  in the most efficient way so the audit as you know show that california's homelessness  population had grown 32 over the last five years and by 53 over the last 10. so i'm questioning  what your role is in ensuring that funds that are go that these non-profits and other organizations  are using are being audited effectively and can that that audit the results of that be shared with  the public in a meaningful and transparent way how do we know that the programs that are being  funded in the city  towards this problem are moving towards measurable sustainable and verifiable results so i did  read that the state's spending the rough equivalent of the median american salary on each and  every homeless person annually so what was i can't remember the figure over 20 billion  that they had stopped tracking in june 2021 so if the problem's only getting worse with  the spending of money it seems that maybe we should look at if the money's being spent  in the most efficient way and i don't know if you there was a quote  from  somebody a spokesman from that agency where he said the blame is with local governments that are  primarily responsible for implementing these program programs and collecting data but i think  that is a little bit unfair because they should be putting pressure then on the right they should  be saying okay you got to give us that data so i'm running out of time here so i'm going to speed  this along um so basically yeah i just want to ask about accountability are is that something that  you're asking for and i'm going to ask you about accountability is that something that you're asking  about that you're getting um i was advised to go and look at the butte county continuum of care  website i did go on there and saw that there was a 10-year report uh to end homelessness in 10 years  that was from 2013 or 2014 then okay so then my last thing is to say again the library we need  that open another day i know you're probably not going to do anything about that but i did want to  put that on the radar and also this month is jewish american heritage month and i wanted to remind you  history history history history history history history history history history history history  history history history history history

nuisance ordering abatement removal  Setting a deadline for abatement and providing assessment for the cost of abatement and we have a report from code enforcement  Supervisor Charlene jerky welcome. Thank you. Good evening mayor vice mayor council members on April 16th council adopted a resolution  Which declares weeds rubbish and debris to be a public nuisance that must be abated  This is part of the city's annual weed abatement program, which is in accordance with California government code  After the April meeting a notice regarding tonight's hearing was mailed to owners of the parcels which are listed on your staff exhibit  Tonight staff recommends adoption of the resolution before you which overrules any objections to the previously adopted resolution  Establishes Monday, June 3rd 2024 as a last day for voluntary abatement direct staff to ensure the abatement of any items that are not voluntarily removed  Maintain an accounting of the costs that are associated with this effort and provide counsel with a report of the costs that are to be recovered  from property owners at the July 2nd council meeting  Alright questions  Actually have a question. So I know that that there is like cost recovery whenever we do abatement we charge them for it  But I noticed it's like the same a lot of the same properties owned by LLC's every year when they're on this list. Are they already?  Being are they already being charged for?  So the list that you have is all of our vacant lots in town that are on this list  We work to get  voluntary  compliance  We usually have a handful a year that are not and it's it's kind of different every time  Yeah, but it's kind of I mean, yeah, I guess it's the same vacant lots that show up every year  But it's not all you need to go out there and see that the weeds are there  You just know that they're vacant and they probably have weeds growing  We when they're vacant we do we make sure that they are cut by June 1st, right?

At the April 16th City Council meeting,  Council accepted the recommendations made by the Internal Affairs Committee  to move forward with the code amendments as presented.  Council approved the following recommendations,  excuse me, recommended amendments to the Chico Municipal Code  relating to the commercial cannabis businesses.  One, to allow for the additions of Type N and Type P manufacturing licenses.  Two, requiring a permittee to begin business operations in the city within three years  or January 1st, 2027, whichever occurs later, of issuance of a commercial cannabis permit.  Three, to allow for minor amendments correcting typos.  And four, amending the Community Benefits Agreement  to require the 5% minimum of commercial cannabis.  The next item is the !

The city so  far has received two years worth  of payments from the opioid  settlement case in fiscal year  2022-23 the city received  approximately $220,000 and in  fiscal year 2023-24 we received  approximately $115,000. Based on  the payment amounts the city  staff recommends entering into a  memorandum of understanding with  butte county which will authorize  the city to allocate $119,000  annually for a three-year term  towards the operation of the  sobering center. Staff believes  this time frame and the amount is  reasonable given the current  payments received. I'  m happy to take any questions  the council might have and I would  like to let you know that scott  cannelli the director of butte  to answer any questions the  council might add.  questions from the council?  none. I drove all that way just  to see this. thank you.  do we have any speakers on  this? we have one george deeds.  well why stop now do it.  history history history history  history history history history history history  history history history history history  history history history history history history  history history history history history history history  donation from other communities  and how is the process?  good evening we'  re on track for  a july-august opening we had a  $150,000 donation from the  moore town rancheria the tribal  community saw the benefit of the  sobering center we'  re here today to see if the  city council for chico also  agrees to that and we'  re negotiating with the  city council for a portion of  their opioid settlement funding  but assuming everything continues  on track our board of supervisors  hears the contract request next  tuesday and if they approve it we  will be on track for a late july  early august opening.  thank you for the update.  we have a motion from vice  mayor reynolds a second from  council member tantan.  when you'  re ready madam clerk.  council member bennett.  aye.  aye.  aye.  aye.  aye.  aye.  moving on no items added after  the agenda'  s posting item 6  reports and communications the  following reports and  communication items have been  provided for the council'  s information no action can be  taken on the items under this  section of the agenda unless the  council agrees to include it on  a subsequent agenda.  item 6.1 city manager'  s report.

April 17 finance committee report  is attached as well as the financial  report and budgeting monitor reports  council member requests.  I know I have got one but has  anyone else got one?  Mr.  bando.  I have one.  I think everybody is aware of the  changes that are happening in  the city of peterson memorial  drive and south park drive and  lower bidwell park.  I would like the council to  consider amending chapter 12 r  dash .32.070 the chico municipal  code to prohibit motorized  vehicles and allow two way  bicycle and pedestrian traffic  on peterson memorial drive and  south park drive and bidwell  park.  This would no way impede access  to ball fields for example.  I was walking in the park on  Sunday and there'  re just a lot of  people in the park and it'  s not consistent with the  use the way most people are  using it to have cars and it'  s time for us to change that.  I love that.  I think we brought that up at  the state of the city.  I think it'  s a great thing.  I would happily second that.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  carries 7-0  And it was also mentioning the state of city one of the things I'd like to do so I  think it makes sense the bike path behind between Chico State and  Pacific Railroad has been a long time playing area. We have cameras there  I'd like to turn that over at least on a long-term lease if not permanently to Chico State who has some grandiose plans for  I think it makes sense to have them control it and take care of it and I think it would ease our obligations there as well as  the  New Highway 32 opening that goes pedestrian traffic into the university now just kind of a dirt field  Students cross Chico State's also looking at possibly beautifying that area and that's city land  So we could do possibility of turning that over. So those are two things  I'd like to explore Chico City Council discuss what was the second one? So it's actually the so it's they're contiguous  So it's the piece of property where the bike path crosses from highway 32 the new bike  That's not the bike path the pedestrian crossing where we put on 32  Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was across and it's got open area on both sides  of it which the city owns which got a nice side entrance into the  University and that's what they've looked at it for so yeah and just so you're aware of the bike path that parallels the railroad tracks  That's actually railroad property not city property. So the railroad  So that bike path is actually owned by UP. We have I think we have an easement. Yeah  so  Makes perfect sense for Chico State to you know, we really have no need to be there. Okay  So I want to talk about that  I'll second that  Madam Clerk  Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Morgan. Yes. Council member Tandon. Yes. Council member Van Overbeek. Yes  Council member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Any others?  I would like to thank the SEIU folks for turning out and all those honors.  I'm sure it's look very fashionable. Yes. Thank you  Thanks for being here. All right, and with that we will adjourn and we'll see you back  at the next meeting.  Thank you.
