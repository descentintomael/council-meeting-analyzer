Okay, we won't have a 1.3. That has been postponed or canceled. And on the consent agenda, we don't have any consent items, do we? No, Mr. Chair, but I'd like to make a correction to the minutes of August 3rd, and that is to revise, excuse me, in the first sentence where it says, Commissioner Wolfe moved to deny the minutes from the June 1st. And so forth. Instead of, I would like to strike deny and then put revise. And with your permission, we'll make that change to the minutes. Sounds good. And are there any speakers for the consent or for the minutes? Seeing none, we'll ask for a motion to approve the minutes, two separate motions, one for June 1st and another one for August 3rd. Move to approve June 1st. Second. All in favor? Aye. Aye. Okay, approved unanimously in August 3rd minutes. Move to approve August 3rd. Second. All in favor? Aye. Okay, public comments.

Okay. Thank you, Chair Wall and members of the commission. The item before you tonight is located at the north side of Wisconsin Street, and it is the northerly property boundary is Little Chico Creek. The property itself is zoned R1 with an overlay of SD6, which is the Chapman Mulberry Neighborhood Plan zoning designation. And this project is a proposal to subdivide an approximately 1.3-acre site into four parcels for single-family residential development. Again, located just south of Little Chico Creek. In fact, the parcel includes it. The average lot size that is proposed is 10,189 square feet, the range of lot areas from 7,061 to 13,103. There are 81 trees on site, and 19 are proposed to be removed. That is for the public space. And the property is located on North Star Street. That is the one access point from Wisconsin Street, terminating and a cul-de-sac to the north. The issues on this particular property, there was a boundary line modification in the past, and when the Chico Redevelopment Agency purchased the property some time ago, there was also an environmental document at that time. And during that time, they foresaw a potential for eight residential parcels on this property. And the project is not of that size. It is only four lots. So the original CEQA document, the Mitigated Negative Declaration, there haven't been any circumstances that have changed to warrant additional environmental review. And the proposed conditions of approval include those mitigation measures from the original environmental document. The issues would be, there would be cultural resources, essentially if there was any type of architectural or archaeological discovery on the site, and there are biological resource issues for the elderberry bushes that are on site that would be avoided by the proposed configuration of the proposed map. In addition, the top of bank, there would be a 25-foot setback. From that point, the przeg, the przeg, the the przeg, przeg, the przeg, the przeg, the przeg, the przeg, the przeg, the przeg, the przeg, the przeg, the the the przeg, przeg, przeg, przeg, the przeg, the przeg, neighborhood to the south of Long Wisconsin Street. There was a neighborhood meeting for this project back on March 2nd, and the neighbors did ask for another neighborhood meeting, but considering that their issues have really been addressed in the site design and that there isn't a way to forego the actual public street improvements that are required for any type of new development, we thought that this would be in the best interest of just having us out in front of the Planning Commission having these discussions. So the public improvements that would be required would be the sidewalk and parkway, and there are some modifications from Title 18R that development engineering could go into more details about that, but it's the horizontal alignment I believe, and the parkway itself gets wider and narrower in certain parts, which isn't necessarily standard. So those would be the only modifications that are requested. In summary, again, the project is consistent with all of the requirements for CEQA from Title 18, Title 19, and Title 20. Again, the project, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, project and adopt the required findings contained in the agenda report, approve the parcel map subject to the recommended conditions, determine the projects within the scope of the MND, and that concludes staff's presentation and I'm available for any questions that you might have. Thank you very much, Tina. Jumping back to the very beginning here, I want to make sure that it gets in the record. This is the City of Chico Planning Commission regular meeting of Thursday, August 17, 2023. And as far as speaker cards go, anyone wishing to address the commission on any item listed on the agenda must first complete a speaker card, which can be found at the back of the chamber. Once completed, please turn the cards in to Nicole over here. Speakers are taken in the order the cards are received, and once the first speaker begins their comments, no additional cards will be accepted on that item. Okay. Commission, do you have comments, discussion? I have a question. When the neighbors asked for a second meeting, were they informed of tonight's meeting? Absolutely. Notices went out to all of the neighbors that received the notice for the original neighborhood meeting. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, when did you see, say, the original neighborhood meeting? When the original environmental document went out. Let me double check that date. I'm looking for the initial study that we did that mitigated negative deserts in the main, or what I really see in the monitoring program. I do have the initial study. I don't actually have it with me here. I apologize for that. Do you know when? Because I can... It was approximately 2011. Sorry, I don't have the date in front of me. Okay. Cool. And then the other comment, I would say the riparian buffer is really measly. I would like to see a bigger riparian buffer, but I do know that can be difficult. I just, I went by the property today. It abuts a waterway, so I would like to see that, but that's not always feasible. Okay. I have a question about . Because it is so close to a waterway, and I did briefly look through to see if I could find if that is in a flood zone. It is, in fact, in a flood zone. Okay. So the home, future homeowners would be required to have flood insurance? That's correct. Okay. Any other questions? Any comments? Okay. We'll open the hearing for public input. Ms. Nicole, do we have any speaker cards? Yes, we have the applicant, as well as the engineer and architect that would like to speak. Good evening. Thank you all. My name is Nicole Ledford from North Star, and I'm available to answer any questions regarding the layout of the project and the planning process that we've gone through so far. I've worked with Tina on a lot of the items that have come up through the process, and they were great to work with on this project. We have Habitat from Humanity here with us. If you have questions for anything regarding the homeowners and how that process works, they are aware of the flood zone, and they are willing to help. And I have prepared for that in their process. If there's any other questions, I can answer. I have a couple questions. Thanks for being here, Nicole. I recognize that this is probably a challenging parcel with a lot of different aspects on that. And one of my concerns is the tree removal of number 25 and number 26. Yes. And the trees are what look to be like substantially sized oaks. Could you speak maybe to the design there and if there is any opportunity that we would have to save 25 and 26 or why we might not be able to save 25 and 26? So 25 and 26 are right in the sidewalk path. This particular entranceway is thin. And so getting a sidewalk that goes along that. And still allows for a parkway strip. Is challenging. The entrance that we put in on Wisconsin, it only has so many options to fit within the right of way that exists there. So that's part of why the sidewalk was removed from the eastern edge and just maintained on the western edge. And that's really the main reason for those two is the grading and the sidewalk itself coming out. And then would that be the case, and I'm not proposing this, but would that be the case if you had less parcels? Would you still need to have 25 and 26 removed? Yes. So regardless of how the parcel itself is, we need the fire truck turnaround that's that cul-de-sac shape. We played with a couple of the other options for a fire truck turnaround. But the cul-de-sac actually takes up a lot of space. And that means that it's going to have less room than some of the other options. And is easier for drainage and stuff to be collected through. So that's one of the reasons why it was used. But it doesn't really affect the parcel count itself. Okay, thank you. Any other comments? If not, we'll open the public hearing. And now do we have any speakers? We have one speaker. Her name is Janie Lawston. Janie, would you come up, please? Hi, my name is Janie Lawston, and I live on Boucher Street. And this particular parcel backs right up to our back fence. I have no issue with homes being built there. My concern is how far is it going to be from our fence to their houses? We discussed that, and I think it's 15 feet is what I understand. And I'm also concerned about the oak trees, as the one planner was, the commissioner. And at this meeting that we had back in March, I think it was, yes, March 2nd, the discussion came up about there's an existing plan from about 15 years ago. I'm not aware of it. I just moved here three years ago. That there would be no sidewalks because Chapman Town right now doesn't have sidewalks. That was a question that was asked, I know, at the meeting. I have no issue with this project. So I want you to know that. But I am concerned about how far away from our fence they're going to be and the trees and the sidewalks. So, and, yeah, it's definitely a flood area. Because we pay a hefty flood insurance. So. Could you clarify, are you on Wisconsin Street or Everett Street? I'm on Boucher. Boucher. Okay. On the corner of Boucher and. And Wisconsin? And Wisconsin, yeah. Okay. 1215 Boucher. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Tina or Bruce, could you address your concern about the 15 feet? Yes, Mr. Chair. It appears to me that. Okay. That the pad area, there's a side setback at least. So there's at least a five-foot setback. And you should, you're an R1, should probably have at least a minimum of 15 feet of a rear setback. Is that how far back your backyard is from your house to your back property line? It's at least 15 feet. Do you know how. Exactly. Yeah. It's at least. So you're going to have. There's going to be five feet on this, on the subject property. And then whatever separation you have on your property. But that doesn't necessarily mean those, the building would be positioned right on the setback. Okay. I'm not, it's too, we don't have the designs yet. We just identify building pad areas at this juncture. Okay. Well, we are concerned about how close it's going to be to our back fence. Because we went through that with the. We, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the the Sidewalk issue because there is no sidewalks in Chapman Town So I think we can show you the sidewalks on the aerial of the project I think I might even have a copy yeah, so if we can But there definitely will be sidewalks is that what you're saying yes one sidewalk It's on the west side of the road I'm just going to pull this up. Excuse me just to get sure that particular slide so everyone's looking at it Okay So it looks like there will be sidewalks just in case anybody asks and just so I'm aware I Appreciate your time. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming tonight. Yes, I I'm glad you sent me the notice it looks like We have another Neighbor, but not too many people showed up, so Thank you so much Please keep us informed Anybody else done okay? We'll close the public hearing bring back to the commission for some comments and a motion I'm just have a few things to say I'm Nicole Bateman.

I didn't get a sorry fast enough Sorry, can we make a motion to reopen the public hearing just so we get that in the minutes because you didn't close it Yeah, okay, so I move to reopen the public hearing Sorry I just want to say that We actually will be working with the neighbors to me and we've already met with Jamie and Steven a number of times And we will continue to work with them to make sure that we can do our part with The house behind them that will be an ad you behind one of those houses And we we currently do have one other two other three other ad use in the community on Mulberry Street So we've actually done that kind of project before and so this project will just have one ad you but though then there'll be other ones that are not ad use over there and and regarding the flood insurance Just just to let you know we do look at that we have another project on 11th Street that we also did that Along the creek side and we were aware that that required flood insurance as well And so when we develop the loans with the homeowners We keep that in mind so that they are still affordable for the life of the loan. So that's a piece fit as well Thank you Okay, now we're back Anybody want to make a motion chair wall, can I just clarify we're gonna close the public hearing Okay Okay, I move that the Planning Commission adopt resolution 23 dash zero seven determining the project is within the scope of the MND prepared for the Wisconsin Street acquisition And pursuant to CEQA section 15 162 no subsequent environmental Review is necessary in approving the tentative parcel map application 22-0 one habitat for Humanity, Wisconsin Street parcel map subject to the recommended conditions second Okay, we have a motion in a second any further discussion if not All those in favor aye Any opposed Apparently not so that item is finished We have nothing on the regular agenda We have reports and communications which are items provided for the Commission's information Although the Commission may discuss the items no action can be taken at this meeting Should the Commission determine that action is required the item or items may be included for action on a subsequent posted agenda Mr. Chair, I have nothing to report.
