 Thank you. All right. All right. It doesn't sound like it. It's turning. It's green. Hello? Hello? Now? No. There we go. All right. We got it. Thank you. It's Oz back there behind that curtain. We are going to call the Planning Commission meeting of Thursday, May 19th, to order, and we will start with the Pledge of Allegiance. So, salute and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And roll call, please. Commissioner Wall? Here. Commissioner Poulin? Here. Commissioner Goldstein? Here. Commissioner Deremedy? Here. Commissioner Cooper is absent. Vice Chair Ober? Here. Chair Scott? Present. Thank you. And we have a lot of guests here tonight, so I'm going to just chat through what the agenda looks like. And always. where we would love to hear your comments. So item two is the consent agenda. We're going to pass that. Now we'll go to item three, business from the floor. Business from the floor is for you to comment on anything that's not on the agenda. So if you want to talk about potholes or street lights or something like that, feel free to talk to us at business from the floor. If you're here to talk about something that's on the agenda, you'll wait until we get to item four. For item four, it would be great if you want to speak. We have speaker cards in the back. Please bring them up to Nicole at the front. She'll have a list and she'll call those out. So make sure you do that as we're running through items two and three. So item two, consent agenda. We have one item, approval of the minutes from April 7th. Is there a motion to approve? I'll move to approve the minutes. Thank you. We have a motion. Do we have a second? I'll second. All in favor of approving the consent agenda, signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion passes 6-0 with one absent. Item three, business from the floor. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda, with comments being limited to three minutes. The commission cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made by the commission. Any comments made by the commission cannot be made under this section of the agenda. Is there any business from the floor? Okay. Seeing none, we will move to item four, public hearings. I'll start to my left. Do we have any ex parte communication? Nope. And to my right? Nope. And I have none as well. So we will turn it over to Tina Wilson on use permit UP 21-03. The item for you tonight is the Achieve Charter School use permit application 21-03. The project is located at 1494 East Avenue. The general plan land use designation is office mixed use, and the zoning is office residential with an AOC overlay. The project is located at 1494 North of East Avenue and north of Pleasant Valley High School. The proposal is to establish Achieve Charter School as a permanent use, converting the temporary campus that was permitted as part of disaster recovery permit 1802 back in early 2019 and to convert it to a permanent campus serving grades K through 8. The maximum enrollment, which is $2,000, would be 250 students. The site plan shows the existing setting, the gray buildings are the ones that are in place currently, and there are minimal construction at this time. There would only be a covered trash enclosure and the removal of four parking spaces and some landscaping improvements that have been ongoing and adjusted. The project is currently in the process of being completed and we'd like to hear from you and hear from you and hear from students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and students and Section 15301 for existing facilities. It's consistent with this exemption. The establishment of a permanent school campus that was originally constructed as a temporary location under a disaster recovery permit in the aftermath of the campfire involves negligible expansion of an existing use. There was a neighborhood meeting that was conducted in November of 2021. The applicant was appreciative of the feedback that it received from the community. And is open to operational changes that have been implemented since that time. The transportation analysis that is attachment E as part of the staff report that is before you, that was prepared by Farron Piers. And that did not find any significant impacts or violations of any type of city policy. And with operational changes that are recommended. For staggering drop off times, pick up times, and working through that issue, that that was the extent of the recommendation. The project was also seen exactly a year ago by the airport land use commission. And that entity provided a site specific special conditions exemption. So this is within the AOC. And it's a policy overlay. However, based on all of the policy that was looked at and all of the issues in that particular area, all of the surrounding land uses, it was not considered to be a concern. And being located in this particular overlay. The project is consistent with general plan policies. It is conforms to the municipal code. Staff recommends approval. And planning staff recommends that the planning commission consider the project staff report. Direct any questions to staff. Provide comments. Hold a public hearing regarding the proposed project. And adopt the required findings contained in the agenda report. And approve use permit 2103, achieve charter school subject to the recommended conditions. And that concludes staff's report. And I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. Great. Do I have any questions to my left for the board? Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. mean to mention, I'm remiss that I didn't, that there is a memo before you with all of the correspondence from the public as well that's been received. Could you clarify, so there was a temporary permit? Yes. What was the expiration date on that, or is there an expiration date on that? I believe the expiration date is at the end of 2023. I would have to double check the record. So they're being proactive in saying this is something that we want to do permanently, and we want to go through the appropriate channels to make that happen at this point. That is correct. And then since the time that they have had the temporary permit, has there been, or do you know of any communication with city staff on any complaints for any uses at the site? I have not heard of any complaints through code enforcement or any complaints directed to myself who's been processing. Yeah, this is just a unique item for us. Typically when we see use permits, we're going from zero to something. With this, we actually have the luxury of having a couple years of history of knowing the site being in use and then seeing that before us. So I was just wondering if there was any history. That's great. Any other questions? I've got a couple. Tina, this may be for the applicant, but I'll ask you. What is the current enrollment of chief? I would defer to the applicant on that. Okay, all right, great. And then I noticed because on the proposed plan, there's the potential of adding six portables. In my understanding, they'd have to come back for a use permit to do that. So I'm just wondering what the correlation is with what the current enrollment is with the need for additional portables, because that could affect noise and whatever for neighbors. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. everything, all the conditions would be met. So we would review it at that time. Did you have a question? Yeah. I do. I said I didn't, but I realize that I do. And, Tina, the same thing. I have the same questions that Dennis had in terms of, which it sounds like we'll maybe hear from the applicant a little bit more. And you just addressed that this use permit does cover those additional, but the potential for additional buildings being, portables being added at a later date. Yes. And I have the same question in terms of numbers of students currently and then what the numbers projected if, you know, those additional, I'm guessing classrooms, but we'll hear what those buildings would be. My question, though, actually for you, Tina, that you, again, it may go to the applicant, but there was some accommodation made on drop-off and pick-up times, and it sounds like we may talk a little bit about the running of the air conditioner, which was one of the things that was mentioned earlier. It was one of the complaints. I'm wondering whether you could address, and if not, I'd hope that the applicant maybe can, the complaint or, you know, some of the comments about lighting and the fact that there were some accommodations that sounded like were made to try to mitigate the effect of the lighting in people's backyards, but that that hasn't always been the case. And so I'm wondering if that is a condition that's been considered by staff or whether that's something that maybe we can discuss with the applicant. Do you have a sense of, whether that, whether you can address that or whether we should talk about that? I would recommend discussing that with the applicant because they would be much more knowledgeable. Gotcha. Okay. Thank you. Tina, one more question before we open the public hearing. Would you mind going back to the map that's aerial overview? That one. Yeah. So that CVS drugstore right there, do you happen to know if that's 24 hours? I am not positive if it's a 24 hour or not. And then do you happen to know if it has a drive through? It does not. It does not. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, that's right. I have seen that. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Stand corrected. Any other questions? And this might also be a question for the applicant, but is there an existing, what separates the existing church property from the surrounding neighborhoods? Is there a fence or structure or is it just residential fencing or any type of commercial block or anything like that? I'm not positive of the entire perimeter of the church and school property in terms of what's existing. I believe there, there are residential fences, of course, but I don't think that there is something that is more consistent throughout. Okay. Can I, one more question. One of the letters to the commission was regarding the noise and how close the buildings were to, it was a neighbor on Valhalla, which are, they are the closest. Mm-hmm. Am I remembering correctly, or maybe I'm making this up, maybe this is an Area 51 thing or something, but the kind of a bounce effect that noise, you know, when they put up the walls on freeways, if I remember correctly, I was told, and I've heard it more than once, that the noise doesn't affect people as much right behind the noise thing as the wall, excuse me, that kind of deflects and kind of, anyway, my point being, is there any kind of studies, or anything that we need to know about in terms of noise, distance wise from air conditioned units like this? There aren't any particular studies that were done for this particular project regarding that. Right. Okay. I know that there are ways to mitigate noise for units. Right. Did you? Okay. Thanks. Tina, I have one more question, but I won't put you on the spot, and we can, you can answer after the public hearing. Okay. But I'd love to know, so the reason we're seeing this as a use permit is because it's a school and not a church, and there's an existing church there. The hours of operation that would be allowed for a church, and the uses during that time. If you do know that, I'd be happy to. My understanding, I don't know the specific hours, but I do know that they do not operate at the same time. So the church facility operates, during the weekends primarily, and then the school operation is during the week, and that they're not both active on the site at the same time. I think for me and following the logic of the use permit, it would be helpful to know if the school is more intensive in the hours that are allowed, as opposed to if it was church functions and they were having midday Bible studies, or midday youth groups, with the same level of noise. Does that make sense? I can look into it further. I want to make sure I understand the exact. I'm wondering what the allowable times that a church would be allowed to hold events. I think it is a great question. I don't know if we actually limit the time of events whatsoever. I just know operationally from what I have learned of the site, that the two don't operate. They don't operate at the same time. Okay. I've got one more question. The report from Galloway & Associates on the third page, it talks about how they've contracted with Bryan to do a landscape plan. I didn't see this in the packet. However, based on some of the comments in that first paragraph at the top of page three, it sounds like they might, the school might want to try to do some gardening, like on the north side of the swale. The swale is fairly significant. Even though the easement is only 12 feet or whatever I remember. There's a down slope and an up slope. It would put the garden area right up next to the fence. I'm all for green space and whatever. In the north-west corner and the north-east corner, there is a square part of the parcel that might be used. I'm just concerned about the neighbors. and the noise thing, and is that really a necessary thing, or is it something we can deal with in the modification of the use permit? To go back to the beginning of your statement before your question regarding the landscape plan, I did not include that in the staff report itself, but I do have an extra slide that I can go to with the landscape plan. So this shows, this is the landscape reference sheet. And the applicant is here and could probably speak to the details of this particular plan and what is proposed. This part is the preliminary landscape site plan and the planting plan. So this portion, again, I can leave the slide up if the applicant would like to. I'll discuss it further with you. There are some plantings on the north portion that could potentially help with some of the concerns that are being brought up by the neighbors. Yeah, no, this is, and I saw it on the Galloway map, that they show shrubs being installed along that fence. And then, and basically, to me, there's no area in there to really do a garden between the sweat and the rain. And we've seen soil and the, and that planting, but anyway, I just, I think that's something that we need to be aware of it. It might be a mitigating factor for some of the neighbors and in the rear. Okay. I have one more question. One more, okay. Just a clarification, on the map that we have, it's, it's the same as the one that is being presented, but ours says, the top says Fire Lane, where that, I'm assuming, the roundabout, and, and, and, and, and, and, about turn is for pickup and drop off? Or can you show us where the pickup and drop off turn would be? Cause I'm just trying to understand if it's a fire lane, if it's being... This is the fire lane along here. Okay, then where's the pickup and drop off? That's in this area. Okay, so they don't go around the building for pickup and drop off. They stay on the front portion of the building or south side of the building. That's my understanding and the applicant can go into further detail about that. They're both fenced off on either side access to the fire lane. So, yeah. Anybody else? Thank you, Tina. Thank you. Larry, you had 42 questions. Okay, so we're gonna open the public hearing. We're gonna chat a little bit about what that looks like first. So we have some legal... We have some legal responsibility on how we have to run these hearings. So I just wanna make sure everybody understands that. The way that we do hearings here might be a little bit different than what you're used to when you're sitting at home watching city council. So we start with the applicant. The applicant will come up and they have 10 minutes. So we will... They'll present. We can ask them questions. We'll go back and forth. During that time, the applicant's talking to us. They're not talking to, you know, the rest of the... The audience. And there's some interaction there. Then the applicant will sit down and we'll invite people who have turned in speaker cards in to come up and speak. Your comment should be directed towards us. We really don't want any back and forth with anybody. But really that's to maintain a public record. And we are the decision makers tonight. So we wanna have that happen. If you do have any questions of staff, I would love to hear from you. I would ask that you hold those to the end of your comments and you ask them through me. And then we will have you sit down and then staff will answer them. But we don't wanna spend the time doing a dialogue between staff. The very end, the applicant has the opportunity to come back up and address anything that was said in the public that might need to be corrected or might need some clarification for us when we make the decision. And then we close the public hearing. So nobody else talks. So nobody else talks from the public after that. And that comes up to us. Just as a reminder to the commission, if you have any questions of anybody when they're at the podium, please ask them then. Because if we do have to open the public hearing, we'll have to do it all over again with everybody. And I know we all wanna get home. So if you guys could direct your comments to us and then we will make sure that we ask you any clarifying questions before you sit down. Good. All right. So with that, we will start with the public hearing. We'll start with the applicant. Well, thank you, commission. Am I talking into a microphone somewhere? How lovely. Okay. My name is Casey Taylor. I'm the executive director of Achieve Charter School. This is Steve Wright, our principal at Achieve Charter School too. We can answer a good number of your questions. But after I go, Kevin Easterling, our architect who helped us with this project will also present and can answer a bunch of questions also. So I wanna thank you for the part that you might have played in helping with that temporary use permit back in 2019. I know everybody was working behind the scenes to get kids back into school as quickly as possible. And we appreciate that so much. Our campus there behind Life Church has been a beautiful place of healing for us. Our students, our families and our staff over the last three years. It represents growth and we began to put roots down there figuratively and literally. It's a place that has offered security, safety and consistency for all of us. A loss of our campus would be devastating to our school community, not just to Camp Fire survivors, but also to many Chico natives who have put their students in our school this year and more who will enroll next school year. Recognizing the value of our charter school model that focuses on relationship and resilience, the Chico's unified school deadline, the district voted to make us a permanent part of the public school system in Chico. In addition, the loss of our campus would be a horrible waste of millions of dollars of taxpayer dollars and resources that went into building that beautiful facility in 2019. It really is a great school facility and school facilities are sparse here in the city of Chico. We're incredibly appreciative to our neighbors who've been supportive and patient, especially while we were constructing. A good relationship with our neighbors is really important. And we worked hard to listen to them and make as many adjustments as possible. We realized that we still had things to do and we're really hopeful. We're a reactive, proactive, flexible organization that can work hard to meet the needs of our communities. To get input, we held a community input and school plans update on February 25th. We had to do that on Zoom, COVID was rampant. We had one household in the neighborhood attend that meeting. We sent out postcards to the 500 mile radius around. Then we also held an in-person community meeting November 18th in 21. We had three neighbors attend that and Tina Wilson also called in on Zoom. We've had multiple calls and emails with the Rosenau family who's here over the course of the last two years to gather input and share information. And we appreciate that relationship that we've had. Some of the things we've done as a result of those meetings are schedule our air conditioners and heaters to turn off at night and on the weekends. And I realize this, but we're gonna have to do that. Our staff does have access to those. And so sometimes those get adjusted or changed or turn off or on without us knowing it. So we can follow up on that and make sure that that is better. We reduced lights on the campus that were shining into bedroom windows. We're splitting costs of fence replacement with any neighbors who are interested. We've done tree work along the fence line. We reduced student activity and noise on that fire lane. We give neighbors access to the fire lane when needed to access the back of their property for maintenance. And we've made our lane landscape plans as part of our application based on feedback from our neighbors and they're really asking for noise reducing shrubbery along that whole fence line. And we're looking forward to making that one of our first projects. We hope to continue to work with our neighbors moving forward so that we can contribute to our community. I'll just answer a question. We have 220 students there. Those extra portables were originally put there because we also had a high school in Paradise that came down with us and while we were creating this temporarily, we were going to actually put our high school on this campus also. That high school is on hold. It's not operational. It's actually going back to Paradise and opening up in Paradise and it's not coming to Chico at all. We left a couple of places on there just because we have 220 students and can have up to 250. So we wanted to make sure that if we did bring in a transitional kindergarten class or a preschool that we would have a high school. We wanted to have a place to put them. Let's see what else. There is new fencing proposed in our landscape plans and Kevin will talk about that. Steve can also talk a little bit about the lighting. But there is a fairly significant homeless situation going on there. And so while we have moved lights and turned lights off, making that campus completely dark actually isn't safe. So thank you again for your consideration. My name is Steve Wright. I'm the principal. I just want to introduce myself. Because as there's logistic questions, I'm there day to day so I can help answer some of those. But I didn't have anything to present. I just wanted to say thank you on behalf of RGA and the chief charter school to commissioners and city staff members and of course members of the audience here too. I'm a product of the charter school education since the second grade all the way through until I graduated high school. And if it wasn't for people standing up for my education, like people are standing up for me, I wouldn't be up here today for education here in Chico. I don't know if I would be at the place where I am now. It takes a lot of dedication and a lot of perseverance from these folks to ensure that the families and the children that they serve here in the city of Chico do get quality education. So thank you to the chief staff for your dedication to the families and the students that they serve. And then thank you to the city for the opportunity to take this temporary use and turn it into a permanent use. If it wasn't for your dedication and the support that you've had and your dedication and your willingness to consider the project, we wouldn't have an avenue to secure the education for these students and the families. And finally, thank you to the neighbors and the members of the audience here tonight for your willingness to listen and your open mind in this. We appreciate your dedication to helping us make this a reality. Great. Well, if I could have all three of you stay just in case one person can answer a question better than the other, then you don't have to get up and go back and forth. I'll start to my left. Commissioner Wall, do you have any questions? Okay. Commissioner Polin. So you touched on it a little bit on the noise mitigation with some landscaping and shrubbery. So is that going to be, since we don't have the landscape plan, is that going to be along the north and west, or basically the streets, Valhalla and... Do I control the mouse here? I think I do. Yes. Along the perimeter of the project here, there's all new shrubbery proposed here. Okay. And the goal of that was to mix in with the existing trees that are staying, but provide a sound buffer around the entire perimeter of the campus. What would be the mature height of those trees or bushes? Yeah. The size as they are originally planted is a five gallon, and they are intended to grow up as tall shrubs. The exact height of those depends on the size of the tree and the exposure to shade and the conditions in which they grow, but they will be taller than the fence that's currently there. In addition to growing up, they also grow out. That's the purpose. So they kind of get dense and they knit together and form a barrier. I noticed there's no need along Valhalla. That's a good point. I'm actually not sure why Frith didn't put those there, but is that something that we could add? Sure. I was just commenting, I noticed they're not on the Valhalla side. But we would be willing to add them there. That would be fine. There's, yeah. And then I also saw a comment from one of the neighbors about the AC units are mounted six feet above the six foot fence line. So what would, do you have a plan to mitigate the noise from those AC units when they are in use? No, we've just been trying to do that with scheduling right now. But we're open to that. I'm just, yeah, I'm just concerned if it's above the six, if it's above the fence line and then adding shrubs, it's still above the fence and shrub line, then is that noise being mitigated? So that would just be my concern. It's a good question and something to consider as part of that is that the HVAC units are built into the portables themselves. They're not separate units that could be relocated. They're actually physically built into the side wall of the portable units. So if there was a condition of approval that addresses that, it would have to be something that perhaps is added to instead of relocated perhaps. Got it. Additional screening or taller planting. Okay. So it's on the, it's in the portable. Correct. Okay. Again, those shrubs along the fence line are intended to grow taller than the fence height. And I don't know if these photos were included in the submittal to commissioners, but we do have several photos that show the location of those wall-matted air conditioning units. Would you mind giving those to Nicole and then we'll go to the next one? And she can pass them up here. So even though the site of the portable units is tall and it goes up to a roof line, the air conditioning units are located a bit lower. Okay. Hopefully the photos will provide some scale for reference. And I'm still a little confused on the drop off and pick up. They do go around the church or they do not? No, they don't go around the back of the church. So the roundabouts in the front is where the students are dropped off and picked up. And then there's a gate. Okay. So we're going to be closing that. So, I mean, we do access behind the gate. Our trash is currently behind the gate. Our maintenance worker drives his truck back there. Other like loading and unloading. Okay. But everything is. Yeah. Okay. Everything else. Those gates stay locked during the school day. And the fire department has access to those gates through an ox box. The whole reason that that asphalt road around the back side of the project was required was for fire truck access. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. here there's lighting on all of the interior portables and they were shining right into the house which is right back here so we turned we started with turning off every other building and then emailed back and forth and then tried to like put out a couple more sounds like that was effective i mean she's here tonight and can speak to that one time after an event they got left on and she emailed us we turned them back off so you know we have a pretty good working relationship with debbie so hopefully that can continue if that ever happens again the rest of the lights that are bright are on the interior and there's very few lights around the exterior of the yeah and they're hooded thank you any questions to my right nope good uh yeah i got a couple more the paradise school apparently has been reopened and that's where the high school is going to be if that um do you know if there's going to be a significant number of students currently attending the chico campus that are moving back up to the paradise school so that's already actually happened okay almost all of our families who are from paradise are back in paradise so the 220 number represents a kind of a settled or whatever that's right after move kind of thing okay paradise families who are now staying in chico and chico families who've just been in chico forever another question regarding the six modulars potentially on that east side between the fire lane and the existing buildings if um it sounded like you need you wanted one for potentially for pre-k and then maybe one more classroom if you were going to reach your maximum enrollment i'm not quite sure how you're doing all your numbers but is it possible to maybe have to add two and then they might be turned sideways so that they were instead of running east to west they were running north to south so that it would not get so close to the uh um the neighbors unfortunately that would put the the air conditioning units potentially closer so i know there's kind of a trade-off but that's just something to look at i mean i think potentially that might be a question for kevin i don't think we would have any opposition to that i think potentially that might be a question for kevin i don't think we'd have any opposition to doing that and the pad is kind of the pad so they could probably be oriented any direction yeah yeah i went back to this slide to point out unice number 25 24 and 23 there's a separation between 23 and 22 if you can notice that we have been working with the city of chico building department um long time ago trying to make sure that the campus was compliant with fire separation requirements so within those limitations uh there's kind of a grouping of portables so to speak so 14 15 16 20 21 and 22 are one grouping so we have flexibility to either add portables into that grouping or perhaps add them further south on 25 24 and 23. so a little limited flexibility but it could still be done and i wanted to clarify something else with that our enrollment is capped with our charter with chico unified so even if we like had a windfall and can bring in more portables and have like you know more classroom space or something it wouldn't increase the enrollment except for the adding of the pre-k anything else you mentioned the gardens the garden question so i mean we're just in the really early brainstorm on that you know that's kind of one of our hopes like if if there were neighbors that were open to using that easement space we would be open to cooperating with them on that it wouldn't have to be the only place that there could be a garden we could also utilize just places closer to the campus and also behind the you referenced like behind the the bioswale back here you're correct there's really not more much room it would be maybe having some garden beds out in this area or also some of these areas where like there could be future portables that would be an area that they could have also i mean we've also brainstormed just putting gardens inside right around the playground and the students have a lot better access to them so we haven't actually done any planning as far as that goes but we are working with a group that has a garden grant that's going to help us bring garden somewhere on campus next year but it wouldn't have to be anything that interfered with the neighbors this side over here is probably too shady for a garden anyway so maybe only be that that would even be a potential or one more and then i'm done um one of the letters i think mentioned about the uh fire road being used as a track for the pe students is creating more noise is that happening is it something yeah that's happening so and and we talked to some neighbors last year and they were i mean very they were awesome about calling us and letting us know because we had um actually during our end of middle school we have a big event week where they have some competitions and it got way too loud out there so we pulled that off the track we've since just been using it for running and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and adjustments. But when they run, I mean, they, you know, when they're running laps, they run like from gate to gate. So they go, you know, back and forth. So if they get in real good shape, they won't be huffing and puffing at all. Yeah. I mean, if they're making noise and not running fast. Okay. Thank you. And then just a reminder, we will invite you back up at the end. Um, so if there is anything that you hear that you need to clarify, if you just jot down a note, um, and then if we have any other questions, we'll ask you those at that time. Great. Thank you. So Nicole, can you give me the next, the first speaker and then the speaker who will be after that so they can be ready? Yes, ma'am. First speakers, Janet Van Hout and Sarah Lurda. Okay. This is my husband and he comes from the United States. Can you come up with me? Um, he can stand with you if he wants to speak. He can turn in a speaker card. Okay. Yeah. Moral support's always great. Okay. Okay. Um, in regards to the application by a chief charter school to establish a permanent campus at 1494 East Avenue in Chico, we would like to make the following statement. My husband, Eddie, and I'm Janet. Um, if I could use this, I could use this. I could use this. I could use this. I could use this. I could use this. I'd like to thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and thank you and mentioned in number six of the opposition memo from Tom and Debbie Rosenow. Our backyard is small with a depth of only 24 feet from our patio door to our back fence that borders the church and the school. The drop-off pickup turn circle is inches from our fence. The daily noise that starts from anywhere from 7.30 to 7.45 every morning during school from cars continuously, one by one, coming in, dropping off their students, is very disruptive to our lives. Our master bedroom is right there on the back of our house. So you can imagine the noise from cars and students that are coming in and out of our house. Children speaking and the loud cars, some of them are very loud. Trucks, that's loud enough to wake us up in the morning if we're still sleeping. These daily car drop-offs and pickups happen, I would say, three times a day when they're dropping their students off in the morning. Sometimes they're coming again around right shortly afternoon. I'm assuming they're picking up younger children who are ready to go home. And then, of course, again around 3.30 or so. So this goes on all the time. The engine noise of these cars, SUVs, diesel trucks, other trucks is so loud, our dog is afraid to even go out in our backyard when this is going on. As mentioned also in number six, the smell of the exhaust from one car. I mean, this is just a continuous one car. The car comes up, drops off the kids. They turn around, and their cars come within inches of our fence that's right there. If it's in the evening and they're having an event, it's at night, those headlights come shining right into our house. We replaced our back fence last summer, and we had to spend hundreds of dollars extra to build, to have a... We had to have a privacy lattice put above our fence to give us a little bit more semblance of privacy from all of the noise, etc. It also was needed to give us privacy because we have a classroom, that first classroom right there on the left side. I don't know what the number is. It comes into our property, into our area, probably a third into our area. Thank you. And their windows from the classroom could look right down into our backyard. So that's why we put the... We had... We paid the extra money and had a privacy lattice put on the top of our fence. So we at least we had some privacy from that, and therefore they can't look right into our backyard. I will also say, I'm sure someone else may bring this up about the loud, very loud air conditioners, and they're heating units that go on 24... They go on off and on all day, all year. Whether school's in session in the summer, you can't even go out in the backyard and you're trying to have, you know, social time out there. Those units are loud, and they are above the fence line. You can just stand right in our patio and you can see them. Mrs. Van Hout, can I have you wrap up? We're at our time limit. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I just wanted to say that, um, it's a great opportunity to be here. It is our fervent desire that at least the school move or remove the turnaround circle from directly behind our house. We are the original owners of our home, which we purchased new in 2006. One of the selling points for us was the location of the church and the recreation field directly behind our home. Except for church activities, it was a quiet life. We were even allowed to use the area with other neighbors who lived in the perimeter. We were able to use the perimeter of the church property for a place to visit and exercise our dogs on a daily basis. Of course, that all ended with the addition of the school. Unfortunately, we now feel that the value of our home has depreciated because of this addition of the school. You know, anybody who would live in our house would have to realize that they're going to have this noise constant. Thank you. So I just, I wanted to ask a quick question. And I'm sorry. But, you know, we, our time as a commission, we deliberate up here. I have no idea what the will of the commission would be on a decision. But, you know, I have, you started out saying you oppose this. Would there be any, if that turnaround was moved, was that something where you could find yourself in support of the project? Or would you be completely opposed to this regardless of any mitigations that they would make? The turnabout is a major problem. However, I doubt or I would imagine there is not one neighborhood in Chico that has a school that impacts the neighbors so closely as ours does. And we've been here throughout the whole time. I mean, for a whole year, the noise and the dust and the constant while the construction was going on was, I don't know, it was the most disruptive thing in my life. We're retired. We're home all the time. We have nothing against the school per se. It's just where they're located and the promise that was made originally that we would be here only temporary. So we went along with it. We tried to make our opinions be. Put forth, but to have it now know that it's going to be permanent and to hear that there could be more portables, more changes made. That's disconcerting, to say the least. Thank you. Nicole, maybe the next two. Sarah Lurda and Shannon Costa. Hello. Thank you. Thank you for letting me take up some of your valuable time. Some of you might know me from the finance department over here. But you don't know that my twin children go to achieve. They are both autistic and they have IEPs. And I had nowhere else to send them except McManus Elementary. And I don't want to think about where they would be at if they had had to just go there. I live at 1059 via Verona Drive. Which is right off of East Avenue. East Avenue is a four lane, very busy street. And it gets noisy. I live two houses down from McManus Elementary. Achieve has done amazing things for my children. And I would really be lost if they were gone. And my children would be lost. So that's all I wanted to say in support of Achieve. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Costa. It's nice to have you back at the podium. Thank you. It's nice to be here. Good evening to all of you. So I'm here today as the mom of a achiever. My daughter is in kindergarten at Achieve Charter School. And is excelling in all the ways that a mom would hope her daughter would. We love Achieve Charter School because of their focus. Their focus on technology, STEM, art, and music. Their focus on virtues allows students to recognize the good within them. And become world changers, as they like to say. The small student body provides a family atmosphere. Where my daughter's name is literally known by all teachers and staff as she walks through campus. But I do want to tell a quick story about what Achieve means to us. After the campfire, we chose to enroll our daughter at Achieve Charter. Because of the many. Phil. Familiar faces and shared experiences that we would get from the school. Last summer before school started, we attended an ice cream social. Where I was talking with Casey. And I asked her, of the student body, how many families are Chico families? And how many are Paradise families? And she said to me, well she kind of looked at me a little confused. And she said, they're Chico families. We're all Chico families. And it sort of dawned on me that. This is a Chico school in Chico. That you are not approving today. Or considering today a Paradise school in a Chico school. This is very much a Chico campus. The families that attend Achieve Charter live, work, recreate, and vote. And are embedded in this community as much as anybody else is. Chico is our home. And there's no going back to where we came from. As some folks like to say. So. Next I want to express my envy to you as a commission and to staff. For being able tonight to consider. Which is something I've never had the pleasure of doing. A project that exists. As planners we're often asked to predict the future. And plan for the worst case scenario. So tonight you're being asked to consider the permit for a school. To remain almost exactly. The way it is. And continue to be as successful. As it is at this location. You have the benefit of knowing. What is typically unknown. In many situations. So have there been changes to the neighborhood? Yes. But as we know. All vacant lots in the city of Chico. Do not remain vacant forever. That's just the way the city works. I've heard as a parent. Like I mentioned. I've heard personally witnessed. School staff. Extend courtesy and accommodation. To its new neighbors. Working with surrounding schools. To lessen the impacts for pickup and drop off. And I have personally experienced. The well orchestrated process. Of morning drop off and afternoon pickup. Which is really quite something. If you've ever been able to witness it. So today as a mom. I am here today to ask that you would extend your support. Of the staff. To support this project. Just as Chico Unified School District has. And approve the use permit. Thank you. Nicole the next two speakers. Debbie Rosenow and Tom Rosenow. Okay. Hi. Thanks for joining us. We do have your letter. And I know we've all read it. But if there's anything on the letter. That you want to highlight. And I'm sure we'll have questions for you as well. So feel free to take the full three minutes. Great. Thank you. You know we're here tonight. We have a few of our neighbors. You know I have my letter. We tried to say that we were speaking for others in our neighborhood. We have a few elderly neighbors that couldn't make it. Others have some extenuating circumstances. And I don't know if you want them or not. But they also had signed off on the letters. And just wanting to know that they're here. You know they want to support. You know kind of where we are. You know we're not here to oppose a chief charter school. We know they're doing great things. But we just don't feel like the location is appropriate forever. And you know there were definitely a lot of groin pains. You know we tried to address issues that we saw three years ago. You know three years ago is when this was going through. I know it was a scramble after the campfire. Trying to get everyone placed. Shannon Acosta at the time was the one that was our person that we connected with. That we had. You know I have a bunch of emails where like what about this. We had a lot of questions. What about that. They tried to address our concerns. And then after we you know established some communication with Achieve once they were going with Casey and Steven. And they mentioned that we've had a lot of emails back and forth. They worked with us on some bright lighting. Definitely they've you know they've tried to be good neighbors. And they've tried to reach out to us. But there are just certain things that are beyond their control. And it affects our neighborhood and our lives. And we're talking about something long term. We moved in in 1998. There was a lot of we were like one of two streets that were developed. And there was a lot of empty space. And yeah that's right. You know there's a lot of vacant lots that get developed. We've seen development over the time. We've tried to be part of that. And just give suggestions of what would make things easier. So we don't have cars shooting through our neighborhood. And so they made you know bends in the road. I mean the city's been accommodating with how to adjust the lights. And try to help with the traffic and the kids. And our biggest concern was putting another school in where there's already you know almost 3,000 students coming. Between Loma Vista, Marigold and PV. So I guess part of where we are just over time. As I mentioned there are some things that they've tried to address to make it a little bit easier on us. I finally went around to the front of the church. Because I was always I've been on Valhalla Place where some of the other neighbors are. We are not picking on here. But we're at the north side of this behind the school. And so we actually have a little bit further space between us and the school than the side. Over on Valhalla. And when I went to the front of the church and went into that turn circle. I was shocked at how like right on top of that fence that turn circle is. And the impact that they have even probably more so than us. But part of that the air conditioning that's been mentioned. But just kind of this industrial sound that's there all the time. You know trying to go into our backyard. Even just opening up windows at night to cool off the house. You know just being able to relax to have our dogs out in the backyard. You know the dogs if people are kids are coming in a little bit closer. It's driving them nuts. And they know to kind of that they're used to a little more of the noise in the backyard. And in the distance now. But when those kids are coming out and on the track. And you know they're starting doing their jumping jacks. And the teachers you know that you want to get your kids energized and excited. But I'll sit out there at one o'clock having lunch. And I start hearing kind of counting one, two, three. And they're being semi kind of quiet. And then all of a sudden like I can't hear you. And they try to get the kids going. And I totally get that they're doing what they need to do for those kids. But then it's all of a sudden I'm going are you kidding me. And it's just really loud noises. And then my dogs are running back and forth going crazy. And it's kind of just this ongoing you know every day a few hours here, a few hours there. But it adds up to a recess of three staggered recesses. Three staggered lunches. There's three hours in the day of kids out on the playground doing what they do. They play. They scream. They screech. So you know there's just the noise that carries through that's been a concern. And that's not something that can be completely taken care of. Great. Can I have you wrap up your comments because we're out of time. Yes. Does anybody have any? Do we have any questions? No? Okay. And I just you know and originally just maybe you kind of mentioned about the church how it uses the facilities. You know church has like a youth group on Wednesday nights. They did like an adult softball league. This is prior to the school. So there were games back there occasionally every couple weeks you might hear a game. A little league maybe on Saturday mornings. A couple things here and there. Weekends. You know it's just a little bit. But now it's just something every day several hours. And it's just it's been a really big impact. And we're just concerned about more about the. The permanency of where they are. We've been putting up with what's been going on. We've tried to have relationship. There's still some lights that get left on. I don't want to be that complainer all the time. But I kind of let some of it go. But after all those lights are on and you know send an email. I have emailed the church a little bit because there's some lights on the church that get left on sometimes by the school. But sometimes by the church. And now that all the trees were removed it's brighter. And so maybe some of the landscaping could help. But it just it does have a big impact. So I don't know if there's any other questions about that or. I think so. Thank you. Thanks. Next is Tom. And after Tom will be Robin Yant. Thank you for reading the letter. Thank you for considering this. And so we won't talk to the letter so much as. One we didn't know that there was a complaint process. And we're not actually ones to go and call the city planner or anybody else and say they're always noisy. Right. So we've been able to communicate with the school. And that's been great. So there's no record. There's no record of any conversation out there. And the other thing is. Is this really a commuter school. This is not a neighborhood school. So everybody has to drive there to drop their kids off. So it's not. At least Marigold. Mostly near neighborhood. Yes there are form 10 and things like that. Yes there's a lot of traffic with the high school. But the high school has a bigger area. So we expect that. But it's also a neighborhood school in that the kids walk up to it. So we don't see that with the chief. So. And then. Yeah. Noise. I think overall. The issue that we have is the lack of planning. We were. We're not fighting. The concept of the school. I think it's great. That's what they're doing. But it's the fact that. We said this would be temporary. We said that this would be because of the campfire. We did all kinds of exceptions. The neighborhood finally accepted that. And now. They filed for Chico charter. It seems like to me that Chico unified. And I know that you can't do this. But they should be finding an appropriate place. Maybe for all the charter schools. They have property to go do that. Plenty of stuff out there on 20th street. So. Sorry. I don't do this every day. But any case. It. The lack of planning. And the fact that they filed for Chico charter. Seems like they should actually put them in a Chico location for schools. And not behind a charter. But the fact that they're building a church. That yes. There was some vacancy. But it's a softball field. So it's one thing to have a vacant lot. That's on the next corner. It's different to have. Some vacant space behind an existing building. So, and then. If it was residential or residential and office. We probably wouldn't fight the fact that the existing buildings that are offices out there. are your dentist your accounting firms your lab clinics they're there from 8 to 5 Monday through Friday there's quiet this is not that same thing so to say that this is an acceptable use yes are the Chico documentation may say that but we just don't feel that that's true here after Robin will be Veronica Salinas and that's our last speaker hi hi my name is Robin and and I live at 25 22 Valhalla so I'm right next to the van house or I'm the fourth house on the right it is absolutely the worst place to be next to the charter school so my back fence my back area is my back fence and my back area is my back area and my back area is my back area is 60 feet long and we're talking about landscape and stuff they're too close for any landscape so behind my fence and we have really small lots it was the my dream house the first house I ever owned I'm the original owner and when I bought it beautiful softball field the church it was a glorious space there were big mature trees and it was lovely and then the fire came and I was sympathetic the school needed to go somewhere and they crammed an entire school in my backyard which is fine because I want people to go to school I love the charter school I'm not against the charter school I'm just against permanently putting it in my backyard so the difficulty is is so there's 10 feet from the back of my house to the fence and then from the fence there's an eight-foot pavement road and then there's a portable so from the fence to the to the portable and I have three portables in my backyard I can see from where I stand on my porch three portables each with a commercial-grade air conditioning unit so if you can picture this I'm sitting on my porch I used to be able to have coffee quietly but now all three units are humming like crazy to get it nice and cold for the kids so for two hours although they start at five but they're always going full force the sound volume decibels of three of those it's deafening you can't even have a conversation it's so loud it's a commercial unit not meant to be right next to a house and we're on small lots with no border so my biggest issue is the air conditioning units and the I mean it was temporarily put super close and I was like I can live with this I want school kids to go to school I know it's temporary and now Chico is giving them a charter that doesn't mean it has to stay crammed in our tiny space and I read the Chico Unified's support letters and it's all about money but that was insurance money to temporarily put it there they are still portable units that can be moved somewhere where it's not 10 feet from a whole street of people's property whose lives can't function because the sound is 24 7 and you might think I actually thought well they'll go off schools only from 8 to 2 but these These units go 24-7 all the time. If one goes off, another one comes on. I did put in a call, and I never got a call back like a year ago, and I've just given up. I've just given up. And I always had this mind that it was going to be on a temporary basis. So I do encourage you to look at the pictures and see how close. They're talking about landscaping to put up. There's no dirt in between. It goes fence, pavement, portable. You can't do a tree. And the other thing is I have a row of shrubs that were there when I bought the house. There's a row of shrubs that I grow 12 feet tall. Even with 12-feet shrubs, I still see the portable and see the air conditioner. So nothing you build is going to deafen that sound because the sound is above all of it. And it's not a regular. I mean, I have an air conditioner in my backyard. Hardly any sound. It's a home air conditioner. These are. These are industrial units to do an entire classroom at a, you know, really hot or really cold. But they're not quiet. So I don't want to get rid of the school. I just want Chico Unified to find an appropriate place not crammed in a little tiny yard where the kids, where you have to control where they run around in a circle and how much noise they want. I just, I actually think they deserve something better. So I just encourage the council to say no to it. I'd rather have them move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move their own space and move literally is has a house in their backyard you know not a house but a great big huge classroom you know eight feet from their fence and our if i had a great big huge lot it might be different and it's not so bad on the back you can see the space but there is no space we literally have it in our backyard and i just i know it wasn't planned it was an emergency but now we're saying ah they're here let's just who cares about those wallhalla people thanks chair scott we had another speaker card added so okay veronica salinas and then ray yacht okay and then after that we'll go to the applicant yes ma'am hello hi welcome thank you for staying here as you can can see I'm Hispanic, so I will have like a strong accent. So forgive me. I'm here because my two daughters go to a charter school, and they're in second and fourth grade. We used to live in paradise, but after the fire, our lives changed forever. I remember going to work. I used to do home health aid, CNA, so I understand both sides, like having quiet time. I understand that because I see that with patients, but other than quiet time, I see too like when they're close to the end, dying, and they don't have family, how important it is. It's to have kids around, at least to hear the noise, you know, because when you hear kids laughing, smiling, happy, it's like you bring life to them at some point. And believe me, I understand both sides. But after the fire, going to work and not having a place so I can call home because we were in four different houses. I'm so happy to be here in Chico now, be part of this community, and I'm so happy that we find a shift charter school. I see the difference of my girls now going to a shift charter school, how happy they are. They even go to bed early at nighttime because they want to be the next day at school. And as a mother, I think most of us have little children before, and all you want is your kids to be happy, especially in school because you know school is like a second home, and that's the more important as parents to have your kids in a place where you know they're going to grow up, they're going to be happy going to school. Because I'm a mother, I'm a mother, and I'm a mother, and I'm a mother, and I'm a mother, and I've seen kids and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends and their friends see everybody as a family. If I have any problem, I can go to the office. They answer all my questions right at the moment. I don't have no problem like, oh, we'll let you know later, and then they don't call me back. And I just so glad and thankful that my girls are going to a shift shelter school, and that's why I'm here talking. And I don't see my kids going to other school, especially because my fourth grade, I know she will be there three more years, four, and I don't have to worry to transfer her to middle school, especially how everything's going on right now in education. I know over there, it's like a family. And I know Steve. He's very polite. He's very respectful. Everybody, all the staff, even my girls, they love to go in the after school program, and you can feel like everybody united. And I think after the fire, that's very important to us. It's like we're not home in paradise, but at least we can have a little piece of what we used to call paradise. Now, we found that little piece here in Chico. Can I have you wrap up just really quick? Yeah, and I think if I would love to see happy kids, not troublemaker kids, because I know when they grow up, when they be a teenager, they will be someone like you can come with it to change the world. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Ray is our last speaker. Hi, Ray and I've got mixed emotions about being here. Difficult decision that you guys have and I've been on the other end, trying to fight for things. I'm hoping charge school realizes education is very important and we all that live in that neighborhood agree to that. It's just where the location is right now is kind of frustrating to us. As I understand it, and I could be wrong, but I knew that because of the fire they came down the hill, needed a place to stay, and it was only going to be temporary, and then they were going to move back up the hill to Paradise. If that's the case, then this is an example of, you know, you give an inch, you take a mile, knowing that hey, they wanted to stay here maybe all along, and if that's the case, that's kind of very frustrating to us. And I hope I'm wrong, because if that is the case where they want to be here permanently, I can then see in another two or three years, they're coming back and they're going to say, we need two stories. And all of a sudden, instead of hearing the air conditioning units go off, and by the way, I live on Archway, so I don't hear those as much as everybody else, what we're going to have is people looking down as we're eating breakfast. Okay. Or we're sitting in the backyard having coffee or whatever. And so it is very frustrating to us. I think if we had known what's transpiring today, the whole neighborhood would have been here for the original use permit and said, no, we don't want this. But we thought it was going to be temporary. Again, this is a sticky wicket for me because I am so much involved with education, and that's the... What we need. Look at our society today. And so we need to educate, and there needs to be a place. But I'm just not sure this is the place at all. And they talked about landscaping. Please don't put landscaping next to my house. I don't want the resident skunk to be able to hide out even more and bring his family there and make it more for me. And one last word in closing. I just want to say this. You're going home. You're not going to be affected in one way or another by your decision here. But we are. And it's going to affect us until we move along. And then when new neighbors come in, it's going to affect them as well. It's a sticky wicket. It's a tough decision that you have to make. But again, none of us would have been in favor of this original use permit if we would have known what was going to transpire. Thank you. Thank you. Would the applicant like to come back up? There were a couple of comments or questions that we wanted to address. But if you have any questions, we'll answer those too. Are there any questions? Why don't we have you address first, and then we can chime in with any questions we have. First, there was a comment. I know that was brought up a couple times that there's a possibility of two-story buildings in this facility. And I just wanted to be very clear that that's not possible. If there was future construction proposed on this project, we would have to come before you again. The use permit includes the future possibility for those six portables, and that's it. If anything additional to those six portables were to be considered, we'd have to come see you again. There was a comment, too, about some of the landscaping on the side of the project up against the fencing. I wanted to bring up that photo right there at the bottom on the right. That's the amount of landscape potential that exists between that fire access road and the backside of those fences. Clearly a lot more than is actually indicated on the plan, but this is the way that it was built. The possibility to put growing shrubs in there is a real possibility. I just wanted to add in that we've been working with the city and the city council to try to work on the air conditioning thing, and we will work on it more and work on a good solution to that. They really are not the type of air conditioner that needs to come on two hours before the students are in there. They probably need to come on ten minutes before the students enter the room. So I think it sounds like as a school we need to find a better solution to that, but they really shouldn't be running nights, weekends, all those times. So that's a thing that we can fix and need to address. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Commissioner Poulin? Do you have any intention of looking for another site for your school over the next couple of years? We do not. Actually, I'm glad you brought that up. When we were looking of where to put a temporary facility, we went across the whole city. We even went up to Cohasset. We were looking at property on the old Chico Mall site, actually, where there's maybe a, I don't know, pet store. We were actually going to build there. We were talking with Chico Unified about all that property they have on 32, 20th, wherever that is. But it was just like this long, drawn-out process without underground, and it was going to take forever, and it just completely came off the table. There were a couple of other places, too. We were looking at property at the neighborhood church, and this was literally the only site that was going to work for us to get going and move. And now that we've put in millions of dollars into this facility, it's beautiful, and it suits us really, really well. And so we just, I mean, we don't have the, we didn't have the money then. We certainly don't have it now to go invest in and build another facility somewhere else. If you're denied tonight and ultimately by the council, what will you do? We don't have another facilities option. Chico Unified has told us they do not have facility space for us at all. And we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've tried and we've developer to the the reason that we ended up where we are now is twofold that fire access line around the outside was required due to fire and life safety but it also helps separate the the dis separate uses that that separation between the residences and the school was not an accident every effort was made to try and separate the units as far as we could from the residences there was another alternative to put the fire access lane on the inside of the project and all that would have done is push the portable units closer to the residences but we chose not to do that you had mentioned that I think I understood it correctly but the high school is going to be back in paradise does that well I guess yeah some of my concern is maybe that poses some some issues for transportation you know transporting kids that are currently at your current location to paradise and back and forth and so I just wonder how long this site would fit your needs if you do continue to expand is I don't know if you have a junior high there have them yeah we're a k8 school and to answer your question this achieve Charter School Chico is a Chico Unified School our main we feed into Pleasant Valley Chico inspiring Corbut primarily our high school in paradise if and when we bring that back and forth we're going to have to have some sort of a little bit of a! thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you I'm not familiar with how those, I'm familiar with portables, but I'm not familiar with those exact HVAC units. Is there any possibility without decreasing efficiency and causing other kinds of problems with the way that those function, to do additional screening on the buildings essentially, to provide an addition to the landscape, which does look to me like it's possible to do some landscaping along the fence, but is there any way to screen like right near the units themselves, the portables? Unfortunately, you do have to have a bit of separation between them and what we're fighting against there is the proximity of the fire access line directly behind portable units. However, there's a great opportunity on the other side. That fence is existing. I understand that there's been an agreement to help replace that fence with neighbors who wanna cooperate with that. And I think that's the point where additional screening could be. The fence, I'm sorry, to interrupt the fence we're looking at right here. You mean, yeah, okay. Gotcha. Okay. I was just gonna clarify on that. Like that was, you know, we recently started doing that just within the last year and it sounds like we missed an opportunity to collaborate with the neighbor on their place. And that's if there's a way to split the cost of the one from last year, we'd be open to that too. And yeah, like Kevin saying, if there's a way to replace the fence, if that would help with some of the sound also. It really sounds to me like a lot of that is, is scheduling. Yeah. Because it really doesn't have to be, there's not really a reason they're running outside of school hours, except for something's going haywire with our plan. Maybe our schedules get interrupted or something. So updating thermostats to ones that can be controlled remotely or something. So where we can just absolutely control that, like that wouldn't limit the sound, but it would limit it to only school hours. Right. And that does sound like that's was at least one of, one or more of the people we're talking about, you know, specifically those hours, those early and late hours. Great, thank you. So I think that those make sense and ought to be pursued, both the fence, landscaping, and certainly the timing, the mitigation you can do and when those units run. My other question, which I'll pose now, but you may not be able to answer, has to do with the drop off locations, the pickup and drop off locations. Clearly some sort of an arrangement has been made or pre-existed perhaps an easement of some sort through the, what I assume is the church parking lot on both sides so that, you know, families as they're coming in, I'm not sure what the actual traffic flow is there, but it looks like maybe each side of the church to cross that parking lot, use the drop off spot and then pull back out again. I'm curious whether, and this is why it may not be a question for you, whether simply moving with, presumably, the church's, you know, approval, those drop off zones, pickup and drop off zones, further forward into those parking lots, and I don't know how that would work, and so it'd have to be something that both, you know, engineering and, you know, the church folks would need to be involved with figuring out how to make that work, But would there were some of the, you know, very specific concerns about the Valhalla side and that drop off being so close to those homes. Moving it forward, if it was possible, might be able to help with that, it seems. And I don't know whether you've had conversations about what the easement agreement is and what their relationship with the church to pursue that kind of a solution to that one particular problem. It wouldn't take care of all the problems, but is that a possibility? And again, that may be a staff question. Well, we have a great working relationship with the church. I don't think that would pose any difficulties. One of the difficulties is when you move the roundabout closer to East Avenue, you can't fit as many cars in the parking lot. And then the cars are staging in East Avenue. So that was a lot of why it was located where it is. And then as far as like trying to mitigate in other ways, we've just tried to do that with scheduling. So like was mentioned, students are getting dropouts. So we have a lot of students that are dropped off at 730 in the morning. And that goes until 810. And then on the Valhalla side, students get picked up between 230 and 250. And then we do have our middle schoolers get picked up on the other side closer to CVS at 315. We have a pretty well-oiled system, so it goes pretty quick. Like it's only about 20 minutes in the afternoon. In the morning, it's a little more staggered. So it's a more or less constant slow flow. So for those 40 minutes in the morning. And then there was also mention of a midday one. I think that might be in reference to our Friday dismissal is 1230. But we don't have a midday dismissal. We just have a morning and afternoon. But Friday the afternoon is 1230. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Any questions to my right? Yeah. Yeah. First, I have a question about the, I guess the parcel. So this is all on the same parcel as the church property, right? How does that work? You're correct. It's one parcel. The church and the school are on the same parcel. And in our submittal, we identified the, actually it's right here on the slide, the square footage of all the buildings that exist on that property. And pursuant with the requirements of the Chico Municipal Code, the site density requirements are met. The landscape requirements are met. There's just simply enough room to do both on that same parcel. Okay. Does Chico Unified School District lease the, lease the property for that or something? Well, we are, our chief charter school is an independent charter school. So we are our own 501c3. We lease the property from Life Church. Oh, okay. Yeah. And we work with them with some shared space in the buildings. They share our spaces a little bit. And we use the church sanctuary for our assemblies and things like that. We do pay, what is that, fair market value for the lease of that land. Okay. Thank you. One other question. Transportation has been brought up. A lot as far as the noise from drop offs and things. Is there any sort of school bus program for this school? No? Is that, I assume that's not required for charter schools. And is there any intention of maybe having such a program in the future to reduce the amount of cars queuing up and idling and polluting and such? No, that, that's not like an extra cost or maintenance or operation that we can do. We can absorb just a tiny little operation. Okay. Is that something that Chico Unified School District has the capacity to potentially support in the future? No. No. Darn. No. Okay. Interesting. Thank you. I think that's all. Well, I made a note about it and Rich brought it up about the possibly moving the drop offs. Okay. The drop off area. And when I was looking at the traffic study and the map showed queuing on the east side of the parking lot and if it was moved forward to the south, closer to East Avenue, would it be possible to also do a queuing area? I'm assuming people are dropping off in both areas. Is it possible to do a queuing area on the west side because there are the two drive-in areas? That's how we're, I mean, currently students are dropped off on both sides. Both sides. Okay. Even though it doesn't show here, they're just okay. Yeah. Good. And I'm not in, like we've all said, we're not HVAC people or whatever. But looking at the buildings, you can see why the units are placed on the back. And I was trying to look and there's no room to put them in the front, you know, trying to mitigate the noise because my experience and I've had a lot of years dealing with like some really good shrubbery that, like Carolina Chair. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. many, many years ago at Blue Oak Charter School here in Chico. They're directly adjacent to a residential property and the same concerns about noise came up with that project as well. As part of that project's approval, there was a sound study that was created for that project. And the recommendation of the acoustical engineer was to plant shrubbery. It was a two-part process though. They did request that the fence be upgraded and then shrubbery be planted as well. The only thing I would add, there is, in my humble opinion, room to do some kind of plantings that are narrow enough to fit in there and would provide a dense shrubbery. Okay, no, I'm done. Mr. O'Loughlin. Have you investigated any way in which you could move the air conditioning units off the roof into a central location that is insulated and the cooling air be ducted to at least some of the rooms? That conversation has come up a couple times and we thought about different ways to brainstorm creatively about it. Simply put, it's too expensive. It's what? Too expensive. To remove those air conditioners and provide replacement air conditioners in a different location is at least $10,000 to $20,000 per unit. Multiply that times eight. That's a number of units on the site and it's cost prohibitive. If you're forced to close at the end of the school year next year, where will the kids go? They would just go to their neighborhood school, many of who have just come to us from their neighborhood school to get the kind of education that you've heard these parents talking about tonight. Does that mean address? Do you address Chico Unified and a dispersal plan of any kind? No. No, Chico Unified wants to see Achieve stay in Chico as part of its options for families. And it doesn't have facility space for us to use. And so it is very much in support of this location. I just thought I'd mention briefly that in your application packets, there are evidence of the conversation having gone up pretty high in the state here. There's support for the report letter that was written by our state senator and a state assemblyman in support of it. So the value of this project has been recognized not only by local folks here, including the Chico Unified school district, but at a state level as well. Commissioner Fuller, did you remember your question? Yeah, and it's just for my own curiosity. Some of the comments were talking about noise from construction and I know portables come pre-assembled. So what was the noise? Was it putting the portables together or are there permanent buildings on the site? So about $4 million or more have been spent on this site. And it's not just the portables were brought in and plopped down, the entire site was scraped. Of course, sensitive trees were kept. There was a lot of work done with the urban forest manager to make sure that we comply with these trees. But everything from there down was taken up and replaced, compacted appropriately. A lot of tractors moving around, a lot of compaction equipment. And then the underground utilities that serve up there, every single one of those portable buildings. So there's water in the ground, there's fire water in the ground, there's electrical power. Thank you. It was a crazy construction site and it was very frustrating. Actually, we were running schools in all the Sunday school classrooms at the time also, and it was super disruptive to us as we were trying to run school. Last call. Okay, thank you. So with that, I will close the public hearing. Just a brief comment before we start, this might be one of the toughest decisions that we've ever had to make, but I would say that was the easiest public comment. I just want to thank everybody for that. Also thank the neighbors. I feel like you've really stuck to the land use topics and realizing that we've gone and we've gone and we've gone, really made this a pleasant conversation to have, which I know is always difficult when there's disagreement, but it really does seem like we have good neighbors on either side that just disagree. And it's great to see that we can all be in the same room and just disagree. So thank you for that. I really appreciate it. Commission. Yes. I guess, I mean, I have several thoughts. One of them is obviously noise mitigation and not just the items that they've submitted as mitigation items, but also shrubs take time to grow. So what's the mitigation item short-term until those, long-term mitigation items can be fulfilled, I guess is one of my concerns. Another concern is the portables are on an elevated platform. So when you do have a six foot high fence, your portable is going to be much higher. And we heard that from some of the homeowners. So I do agree with some of their sentiment that just adding another fence at six feet is just not justifiable enough. You have to compensate for the actual height of the portable and the air conditioning unit. And I do agree that shrubs can be a great sound barrier, but they're not probably enough in this situation. So I would potentially propose some type of other fence, well, a fence and shrubs. And we'd like to hear their opinion and their thoughts and their thoughts and their thoughts and their thoughts qualities. Like a concrete fence? Yeah, and Kevin's team, I mean, they're the experts at this, so I don't, you know, I just, it would need to be at a height that is reasonable, so the neighbors don't feel like the students can look into their backyard, and then also at a height that would accommodate the AC units would be my suggestion. Talking about fences, and maybe this is, my question might help some in the audience who might not be clear on this as well, as I am not, but, so this is for staff. We've, when the commission has looked at other projects and fences have been part of the conversation, I believe that we've been instructed that the commission has been instructed to do so. I don't know if you've heard of the commission's been instructed that, particularly when we're talking about fences that belong to the homeowners, that a project going into a space really can't dictate, this is a question, can the commission as a, the commission as a condition for the use permit dictate what type and how high those fences are, or is that something that we can recommend, or more appropriately recommend, that the applicant and the neighbors, you know, work on, but I believe we've been instructed in the past that we can't really make a condition of a project be, go down to the very specifics about a fence that ultimately is owned by the property owners. Madam Chair and Commissioners, in answer to your questions, yes, you can or require fencing and any kind of fencing, but there is a limit on the height, I think we have six feet and then two feet above that for a maximum of eight, and the other two feet needs to be like 50% open, so that's within our regulations. There is such a thing as a fence variance and all that go higher, but we haven't noticed that, nobody knew that that was being contemplated because that wasn't what was noticed in the hearing. Thanks for the clarification. That's it. Yeah, just general comments and thoughts on this. First, I appreciate everyone's public comments. Those really added a lot of good information and insight into this project. Yeah, I... I totally understand wanting peace and quiet in your household. I think all of us want that. I also have concerns with, you know, if this were to be denied and students were to lose their school. I'm also, in general, I question the way that we send students across town instead of to their neighborhood schools and that families have to cover that cost of transportation, but that is a choice. But anyway, this is a land use decision and it seems that it complies with the general plan. It's an appropriate use and that the school has done their best to be good neighbors. I think maybe we can add conditions of approval, et cetera, to work to ensure that that continues to be the case. Yeah, and I hope that there is an agreeable outcome for all of that. So those are my thoughts. I have a couple more thoughts. I have a couple more thoughts. I would probably suggest that two conditions of approval in addition to the ones I previously mentioned would be that the applicant install lighting controls so that those lights would go on and off at certain times and then also that they would install some type of HVAC T-STAT control and that they, even if you put a lockable cover on it, just so that they don't get caught in the traffic, that they can't be changed and that they do go off when they're not in use. Obviously, they don't need to be running at night and on weekends. Oh, I'm sorry. I said two, but a third thing. I would also, and I guess this is maybe more for discussion, but the exhaust and the running of cars, maybe a posting that says, you know, no idling cars while waiting for to pick up your students. I think that might help. I think that might help with some of that. Can you repeat the first one, Lindsay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, can you repeat the first one of those? I was writing. Oh, the lighting controls? Thanks. Yes. Just that they come off and go off at certain times and then you don't ever have to mess with it. I think those are good additions. I agree with those as conditions. I think that's a good addition. But, again, we're not really making any changes for the permit, were we to vote in favor of it. I would add, and I'm not sure what the wording, based on the conversation we just had about fences, but I would add a condition that does require that the fences be built to maximize, you know, sound mitigation, noise mitigation. Again, I'm not sure exactly what that language can or should be. But, yeah, I think that's good. Well, this is an important part. I mean, there's a considerable increase in, for example, a solid block wall. It'll attenuate more noise, but it's far more expensive than a wood fence. And I think that's something you need to circle back to the applicant on. Wood fence attenuates some noise. Block walls attenuate much more. Landscaping has more of a psychological effect, but doesn't really attenuate a whole heck of a lot of noise either. But it does have kind of a psychological effect of buffering and separation. Just based on the feedback that we received from the neighbors, and I'm just speaking out loud, if it would make sense to do a CMU concrete wall on a concrete wall. On the Valhalla side. Thank you. The west side. Yes. Where's my map? Thank you. Yes, the Valhalla side. And I guess Marigold Avenue looks like it's fairly kind of the same condition as the Valhalla side. But there's definitely more separation. There's definitely more separation on the archway. But again, and maybe it would require an exception. I would like to know, or excuse me, a variance. I would like to know what the height of the top of the portable units are. Because that would also help us determine what the height of that fence should be, or it should obviously be a little bit more higher than the portables. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and do a quick check. I'm uncharacteristically quiet. I guess the question is, what will two more feet height of the fence do for sound attenuation or anything else for that matter? Yeah, I'm not a noise expert. I really can't tell you. What the appreciable difference be. My understanding is that, yeah, fences will help, block walls will help more solid. Different materials have different characteristics. And I am not qualified to give you that information. I can tell you off the top of my head. Yes, it'll attenuate some of the noise. And it'll create more of a shadow behind it. But I don't know. We don't have a noise. We don't have a noise study. We didn't do that. We didn't get into that. You know. And furthermore, I really think it'd be helpful to see if that even is within the bandwidth of the applicant's capabilities. I mean, I don't, I mean, I don't, they've indicated that they're working. They have a, sounds like they have a program where they were working with the neighbors cooperatively and have an agreement to cost participate in the fencing. So I, you know, I don't know. It is a problem. And then you get into the situation where they may not all want the same kind of fence. And that's what I think that's what Rich was alluding to that we've run into is they say they don't want concrete. You're getting into this kind of thing where everybody has different ideas about height materials and so on and so forth. And what if you just did it on their property and didn't replace the entire fence that homeowners fences stay intact as is, and you just do the fence on the charter schools or the church's property. So you have two fences, I guess. Yeah. Right. But I think we do still get into an, and you know, that, that we may be then causing problems for some of those property owners, aesthetics and other that while we're trying to solve a different set of problems and that's why it gets really, let's say sticky wicket when we try to deal with fences. So I'm not sure that there's a clear answer other, I mean, Bruce just, you know, said the obvious, which is other than to. Yeah, and we've tried to, and we've tried to, and we've tried to, and we've tried to ask parties to continue to, you know, function in good faith and try to solve the, the, that part of the dilemma, you know, through collaboration. Uh, but, but that, I mean, it's happened many, many times in my experience and subdivisions that, um, existing fences, uh, remain on the property owners and then the, uh, subdivide or we'll move it in whatever appropriate distance and so you'd do interrupt two fences. I mean, it's not totally impossible, but, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, but it just doubles or more the cost. I'll make a motion. Now this puts everybody between a rock and a hard spot, but for me, I've got to come down on the side of education for the kids. That's bigger than the rest of us. I for one live in a neighborhood that is surrounded on four sides by educational facilities, schools, offices, that sort of thing. So I just have to come down on the side of the kids and the education that we need to provide for them. So I'll move to the Planning Commission, adopt resolution number 22-02, approving the conditional use permit subject to the attached conditions, if there are any. Larry, can I ask a clarifying question on your motion? So there are the existing four conditions and Lindsay proposed three, at least two additional. Is your motion including those? Well, if somebody wants to make a friendly amendment, I'll certainly consider those. And I'm sure somebody that makes a second will want to consider them as well. Let me get a second on Larry's motion first. Is there a second? I'll second the motion. Thank you. And then Lindsay, if you could just come up here. Would you like to make a friendly amendment with your conditions? Yes, thank you. All right, so I'd like to make a friendly amendment that we vote to approve the applicant with the four conditions presented by the city staff. And then, in addition to those, we would ask that the applicant install lighting controls, HVAC timers that can be lit, and AC meters locked out. I am going to say that they post signs saying no idling cars. No what? Idling. Oh. Yeah. To help with the exhaust and noise. And then I'm also going to propose a CMU wall on the east and west sides of the property to a height of one foot over the portable buildings. And if that needs a variance, then that's what the applicant would have to apply for. And I think that was all in my conditions. Madam Chair, can we ask the applicant if they can live with those conditions? Yes. I will reopen the public hearing on the conditions. Yeah. Thank you. The fence is a great idea. I think there's an opportunity there to introduce some material that can better attenuate sound than what's currently there. You saw the condition of the fence in the previous session. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think we're going to have to make some changes to the fences. They're in no great state to actually attenuate sound. An upgrade to those fences of any kind would be an improvement. To go all the way to a CMU wall for both sides of that property, one, the infrastructure required to put in that CMU wall requires a foundation that goes below grade. Simply put, I don't think there's enough room there to do that. You're talking about heavy excavation on the backside of these people's houses, and I don't think that they want to do that. We could ask them. I think that you can get the same amount of sand attenuation with the same kind of foundation, but with the same kind of foundation, and we're going to with a different kind of fence that we've seen on other projects approved here in the city of Chico. Just off the top of my head, there's a couple different properties. For example, one at Kohl's, there's a shopping center there, and there's houses actually where my parents live direct on the backside of that parking lot. There's heavy truck traffic that goes by those properties every day, and the only thing that they have is a concrete board fence. They're slats made out of concrete and supported by fence posts. It's less intensive in putting in a seaming wall and all the foundations included therein. I think that the requirement to do a taller fence is a good one. I think that the six feet that's already there probably doesn't do enough to go upwards of the eight feet that could be allowed. It might be a good idea to go one foot over the portables. I think it's prohibitive off the top of my head, and I think it's included in the application packet that I handed off to somebody. The height is indicated in there. I think that they're around 12 to 14 feet tall. To do a fence that's about 15 feet tall on the back of somebody's house I don't think is a good idea. However, introducing a fence that is a different material, and like somebody recommended, working in good faith between the applicant and the neighbors to come to a solution, I think is a good recommendation. Thank you. Does that answer your question? I'd like to make an amendment to my family amendment. Is there any other public comment? Okay, with that, oh, come on. I knew this would happen. I just want to make sure that the conditions that you're making are also on the church. They also have their lighting, and they're sharing the facilities, and it's a church lighting that's actually just as bright coming across the property lines. Thank you for that clarification. If they're going to share the facility. Thank you. The school is sharing the facility, so therefore it's part of the school. I just want to make sure that the church is part of it. Mr. Ewing, do you have a comment on that? No. Yeah, I'm coming. Excuse me. I'm planning to come to church. Tina and I were just talking, and it dawned on us that we're not quite sure that we can put the conditions on the church, because they're really not the applicant. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. I'm sorry, but I'd say to explain to me, I guess. Can I? No? No. No, please. You got the letter. Let me ask staff to clarify that. Just for the fact that they share the facility, therefore it's part of the. Okay. Yeah. I understand that. Can you clarify why we can't be conditioning the church? Well, they're different applicants. The applicant is the applicant that can explain. They're two different operations. They were tenants. They're leasing from them. I don't even know. Anybody representing the church has even attended this hearing. So our opinion is that we cannot place this condition on somebody else that isn't asking for a permit. Permits in relation to the school. They're the ones that can fulfill those obligations. So maybe more clearly stated, the use permit that we are putting conditions on is the use permit for a chief charter school. We can't condition any of their. Entity because they are the holder of the use permit. That's correct. Thank you. Can we just get really clear verification of that from the city attorney so that everyone here understands where that opinion is coming from? Yes. I can state clearly that I agree with the characterization of Mr. Ambo and also the chair. So the permit requester is who is before you, and that's not the church. Right. Thank you. But on the lighting controls, just coming from a technical. Standpoint, where is that power being pulled from? Are they on a separate meter? Yeah. And I don't know. And I don't know that we want to keep reopening the public hearing. But that's going to. They can't do. They can't implement their lighting controls if and not implement the churches if they're not on separate meters. So there is overlap there. Right. Does that happen to shared utilities? Maybe the app. You know, my guess is that they've indicated they can regulate the lights that they're that are there under the control of their facilities. And I think that they can do that. And they've indicated they're willing to do that. And they will do that as it relates to getting into the church and doing other things. I don't feel as comfortable answering that. Since it's outside of their permit. I need to close the public hearing, but I need to see if there's anybody else and then we can continue deliberation. You already had a turn. You may come up, Mrs. Van Howell. And you. Yeah. One and two. Please come up to the podium. There was no mention of that possibly amending if you were to approve it. Moving that turnaround. Area. Because there's plenty of room there. There are not a whole lot of cars on that left side there that are parked there. There is a possibility people could come in and have room to turn around at the church building and not extend it into where they have it now. Where it definitely impacts us very negatively. Thank you. If that could be an amendment. Okay. Anything else? All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And if you could please just nod on our deliberations. But is there any other public comment? Sure. Yeah. All I want to say is to keep in mind is 220 kids. 220 family. And for the first time. For me as a mom, as a parent, it will be heartbreaking like trying to explain my daughters now that school is going to close down. And it's going to be like another drama going through when now they're happy. And I understand their side too. But like I said, kids are important too. They're going to grow up here. They love family. They love Chico. And I know it's a hard decision, but it's 120 kids. Thank you. Anybody else? Okay. I'm going to close the public hearing. We have a motion and we have a second. That's all we have right now. We had some friendly amendments that are just hanging out there right now. But Vice Chair, over. I would, for the public and for ourselves, just to clarify where we are in the process. So as you just described, we have a motion and a second. And I don't know that the motioner or the second has accepted or which of the friendly amendments. So I think the process we need to go through right now is to figure out which of those are part of the motion or do we need to start over again and have a replacement. I don't think we're ready. We need to start over. We need to start over again. But let me just, so everybody knows where we're at. We have. You can't just start over again. You have to. No, I said I don't want to start all over again. But let me bring the audience up to speak. Because we usually don't have public hearing interrupting deliberations. So just want to make sure everybody knows where we're at. So right now we have a motion on the floor from Commissioner Wall that planning staff recommends adoption of resolution number 22-02. Approving the conditional use permit subject to the attached conditions. So those are the four conditions that we had in our packet that you've all seen. So Commissioner Wall motioned for that. Commissioner Goldstein seconded. And Commissioner Poulin offered a friendly amendment which has not been accepted at this moment. So that's where we're at. Right. What would be the will of the commission at this point? Because I need to know if the maker of the. Yeah, I'd like to hear. Yeah, I think. Could we read. The friendly amendment. Yes. Okay. The friendly amendment is no idling cars. Signage stating no idling cars. Okay. So the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to have to make sure that the the HVAC units on the portable unit or on the portables have to be on a scheduled time and in locked out so that people can't change them. And those scheduled times would have to coincide with when schools in session. Lighting controls would have to be implemented. And. A. Wall. Would be constructed in the form that Kevin Easterling described. On the east and west sides of the property. To a height. That is the same as the top of the portable units. Can we say fence instead of wall? Yes. Thank you. Just to clarify. I think we're hearing that it can't that there isn't any way by code. For that fence to go to the top or above. Certainly those buildings. So I think what we need to say in the if I can. Sure. Please. Offer is that that condition be that that fence be constructed to the maximum allowable height and other. Permittable. You know, design standards to maximize the mitigation of the noise. If I know that sounds like a bunch of gobbledygook. But there's there are ways that the permit code can be enforced to really maximize that fence and still take it to the top. And keep it to be allowable. To be constructed. So I don't think we can dictate that it go up to that high. Well. Bruce. What is the maximum height we could get out of the wall for this project? Six feet solid and then two feet that has to be 50% opaque or open. Okay. Okay. So my friendly amendment is going to still be a fence that Kevin described. But. That goes to the height of the top of the portable units to cover the HVAC units. And they will need to ask for a variance to construct to that height. If they don't construct to that height, then there's not going to be noise mitigation. Can staff clarify? Is that allowed to build a fence that high? Or did you already? It would require a variance. Okay. So we would have to notice it as a variance. If somebody, you know, who knows would have been interested in that topic. Probably all the neighbors that are sitting here tonight. Okay. We haven't. We haven't. Yeah. And it's. I don't. I'm not familiar with requiring somebody to apply for a variance either. That's. I'm not totally comfortable with that. Maybe the city attorney can jump in here. I don't know if we can really require them to. Okay. So. You know, because what happens if it's not approved? I mean, it's a discretionary action. I just. So can I amend that and say not apply for it, but just have an exception so that it. A height exception so that it is to the top of the portable unit so it will cover the HVAC. We can't recommend anything that doesn't meet the municipal code requirement. If there's a limit, then that's what we can recommend. But a variance is also in the code. Okay. So, I'm just wondering if you can comment on that. Yeah. But I can't tell you it's going to be approved. Yeah. Yeah. I can't. Wait. You don't have the consideration of a variance before you now. That could come later, but you don't have it now. So, if you want to consider it at another time, it would have to happen at that time, but it's not before you now. But if they don't. If there's no submission and approval process, how would we get it before us at another time? They're going to have to. If we say. If we say that they have to. We can't go against the code. So, they would have to ask us to go against the code. We can't make a decision that goes against the municipal code. So, I'm going to ask in my amendment that they go against code to mitigate the sound of the HVAC units. I'm concerned that if they don't go that high, then it's not going to mitigate the sound that they're concerned about. I've got a question there, Bruce. Is it possible to. Is it possible to put an insulating fence around the units on top of the buildings? I think the applicant responded to that. I think one of their answers were that they were pressed for space in the fire lane to screen, and then the other, I think another question is posed is if they could relocate them, and I believe they indicated it would be prohibitively expensive. So, and furthermore, staff wouldn't. I think the applicant would support allowing the fence to go up to 12 feet or whatever the height is because that's not permitted in the code. Yeah, I have to say I disagree with that last defense amendment for a lot of reasons, and I. Both of them. I agree. I think that's a setting point of view and from a structural point of view, the code aside, I just, I can't support that. So, one other comment since I, are we open to. Let me see. And I think you guys followed enough, but let me see what Commissioner Wallach wants to do on the current friendly amendment, and then perhaps we could consider a secondary friendly amendment if he doesn't want to accept this. Okay. I'll accept as a friendly amendment items one, two, and three, the idling, the air conditioning scheduling, and the lighting controls, but not number four. Okay. Great. And the seconder of my motion there. I will accept that. Okay. So, we have one, two, and three as a friendly amendment. Are there any other friendly amendments that we would like the makers of the motion and the seconders of the motion to consider? I'd like to make a friendly amendment. In regards to the fencing, we've talked about doing a different kind of fence. I would propose the concrete fence to the height of six feet and with two feet of permissible 50% visibility, whatever. On the west side of the property, I don't know why, that's, excuse me, I don't know why, but I think it's just on the west side of the property. Thank you. Okay. And to clarify, Dennis, but when you said concrete, just so everybody understands, you mean as was described? Yeah. I've had some, yeah, exactly. It's a concrete slat. I've had experience with those, and they're fairly easy to put in and not as expensive and don't require the... Would the fencing extend the entire length of the property or the school part of the property at the brick wall or the... Yeah. But would the neighbors have the cement fencing or would the neighbors have the option of saying, no, I really don't want that concrete thing in my backyard, that's my fence? Two good questions. The way I imagine it would be inside their wood fencing. Would be what? Inside the wood fencing, so it'd be on the church property. And what was your second question there? Oh, how far? Yeah, just down to the last... The most southerly neighbor... Right. Property line on Valhalla. Commissioner Wall? Yep. Okay. Thank you. Sounds good. Okay. I think we're there. So let me just read this out to make sure staff has this, to make sure we have this, to make sure everybody knows. So I have a motion right now that planning staff recommends adoption of resolution number 22-02, approving the conditional use permit subject to the attached conditions. With the additional conditions that there be signage at the drop-off pickup locations that says no idling, that the HVAC units would be on scheduled timers that align with school hours, that there would be lighting controls, and that there would be the instantiators. And then there would be installation of a fence that would go inside of the wood fence that would include concrete slabs similar to other projects that RGA has worked on in the past. Got it? Okay. Any further discussion? Regarding the amendments or anything else? Anything else. We brought it up, and I just wanted to make sure that we weren't... We're leaving it out in our excited discussion here. About the moving the turnarounds or the drop-off areas. So any thoughts? It strikes me... I don't know if you were asking me, Dennis, or not, but it strikes me that that actually ends up, you know, falling in the same kind of a category as we were talking earlier about the lighting, where, you know, that's not part of... Isn't in the control of the applicant by themselves, and it isn't part of... You know, the church isn't here to address that. So I think probably I would just, you know, encourage the applicant to consider that. But I don't think that we can... You know, certainly we can't, I don't think, put it in the, you know, as a condition of the... No, that's good. So I just think it's something... My neck was stuck. I was in... I've been looking all over. Sorry. I was looking at Lindsay. Yeah. Before we vote, I just... I did want to... I just want to comment again. You know, this is... I think this is why we have a planning commission. This is a really tough decision. Definitely an interesting land use decision. So I really want to thank the neighbors for coming out, and I appreciate hearing your concerns and trying to make this the best project possible if it is approved. I really applaud the school for being good neighbors, for trying to make the best of a site that probably isn't ideal for a school. But you have really maximized, I think, the use for this to make it compatible with the neighborhood. And I think Ms. Costa summed it up well. Most of what we see, we're really projecting what the impacts could be. I recognize that there are negative impacts of this project, and one of the things we have to do is weigh the benefits of that with the compatibility with the neighborhood. And that's honestly tough. But I'll support the motion as it is. That's how I'm planning to vote. And while I'll make my decision and not go home and live near it, I still live with it. And I think every single one of the commissioners up here, carry our decisions very heavily. And there are some decisions that I've made eight years ago that still keep me up at night. So this is not a decision that I think anybody up here takes lightly. And I think you have one of the best planning commissions in the state up here that are really concerned about Chico. And Vince sees a lot of cities. I think we're his favorite. But I really, you know, I don't know where our individual politics lie. But I do know we all care about this city, and we all care about the way it looks and the way that our residents feel and the uses are compatible. So thank you for what was a bit of a sticky meeting. But this is a great commission. So I'll call for the vote. All in favor? Of the motion that I've restated about 10 times, signify by saying aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion carries 6-0 with one absence. And I'd invite you guys all to stay just until the end so that we can make it through this without any ruckus. Item number five, regular agenda. We have none. Item six, reports and communication. Bruce Ambo. Yes, Madam Chair. We gave you hard copies of the... the housing element. That'll be on for June 2nd. And there was some problems with pagination and one of the appendices that we've included in your copy right now. So everything should be ready to go. That's set for June 2nd. And, you know, we realize it's a lengthy document. The document's also available on our website if anybody would like to review it. That's chicohousingelement.com. I believe it is. chicohousingelement.com. Yep. Thank you, Bruce. Hey, quick update for us because I know we have people who probably have some summer plans. Is there... I know we're going to be seeing a use permit or a zoning regarding a hotel project. Right. When do we anticipate that will come? We're targeting that hotel that's proposed at Bruce Road and Highway 32 for July 21st. July 21st. Okay. And that date has shifted several times. It may again because there's a lot of moving parts and there's a big consultant team and a lot of information that's coming in on it too. Okay. But right now that is our tentative target date, July 21st. All right. And then, Nicole, if you wouldn't mind, I know I can't direct staff, but if you wouldn't mind sending out an email this week on that, I think one of the... It would be great to have a full commission here if we can for the 21st. And one of the things that is my pet peeve of being a commissioner is ever getting a tie vote. So I'd really like to make sure we have the full commission here if that's possible. Okay. Will do. Item seven, adjournment. Thank you all. I just want to say I appreciate Commissioner Scott does a great job as chair. And I think she's a great person. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. to the other two. This is a record. This one. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The favorite group. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll get you there. Awesome. My car is in my, my car is in the right. So they all move up once I set the car off. Then one car moves. No irony. No irony. So then they all have to start. Yeah. Yeah. We can have it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good night. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a... There's a... I was like... I don't know. I was looking at Sharon. Thank you, Bruce. Thanks. Thanks for reading. Thank you. Thank you. All right. All right. All right. Are you coming back down in the morning? All right. All right. I'm going to carry my stuff. I'll walk you guys. Yeah, I'm heading back in. I got to grab my things. Oh, thank you. Yes, I was sharing. Yeah. All right. All right. Nicole, do you need anything in here? No. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
