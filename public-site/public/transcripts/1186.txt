This is two items that are distinct yet related, the Bellmere Special Planning Area dissolution and the Autumn Leaf Estates subdivision.  And tonight we're looking for a recommendation from the Planning Commission as these applications all have to move on to the City Council.  And we're targeting a future date for that at City Council.  My presentation tonight I'll talk about the general plan amendment and Rezone, which is affecting the application.  Then I'll also bring up the general plan land use program within the Planning Commission.  Then I'll also bring up the general plan land use program within the Planning Commission.

The special planning area framework in the general plan says that these areas are to be  comprehensively planned, annexed as one, so we kind of know the full package of what we're getting.  And that's problematic for this particular SPA because there's over 150 different parcels and  just about as many owners out there. And we've talked about this before. I'm just kind of rehashing  the history to catch up anybody who wasn't around for the prior round for this Orchard Creek Estate  subdivision. So that's featured here in the bottom right-hand corner. The planning commission  back in January did recommend denial of that project because of several issues. And then we  went on to city council for that as well. And the city council did approve that. However, they  directed staff to come back with amendments to the general plan to deal with this special planning  area being difficult to master plan. So when we took it to city council, we articulated  all the details of the project. And then we went on to city council for that as well. And the  remove all these issues for the council, which were coming out of the planning commission's  deliberations on this Orchard Creek Estates project, including removing the site from the  Bellmere SPA. And they picked up on some of the same things that the planning commissioners did  in that asking the larger question of does this even make sense as an SPA because of this  splintered ownership and various different motivations of people who live out there.  So they ultimately directed staff in April to come back with amendments to remove the  Bellmere SPA from the general plan to pre-zone the entire site, designate the site R1, low density  residential, which is the city's most common zoning, and to study infrastructure needs. And as a quick  aside there, they followed up with an allocation of $300,000 to the public works department to look  at those infrastructure issues. And now they will be incorporated into the storm drain master plan,  the sewer master plan that will be coming out later, as well as they'll be keeping an eye on  the traffic to see if any of the intersections in the area warranted. And then we went on to  also put a ban on PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA PVA  photograph that goes along with that and this is about 14 years old the picture here and so we have  updated that on the next slide and that's more what it looks like now and we've added the city  limits in the big black line so keep track of the big black line that's where the city limits are  you have to be adjacent to that to ask for annexation it this this picture better shows  the development that's occurred out there in the county the one acre minimums there's some that  have been already developed some are under construction if you've been out there recently  you've seen a bunch of stuff under construction and there's others that are still in the works  and look like they're definitely heading toward county development so we've colored them in black  so you can kind of see how that patchwork is filling in north of where the city boundary is  here's the zoning the city's zoning for this area is spa special planning area the spa  zoning is a special planning area for the city of california and it's a special planning area  for the city of california and it's a special planning area for the city of california and it's a  placeholder zoning it doesn't allow development and it's basically sitting there waiting for a  plan to come along and give it actual zoning that you can then use to develop like r1 zoning or some  other zoning that you can develop under so that's the city's zoning the county's zoning  is vldr one acre minimums so i'm aware that you have been forwarded all the comments that we  received during the process here one of them was a petition from lots of the neighbors saying  hey we want to keep our one acre zoning and we're going to keep our one acre zoning and we're going  to keep our one acre zoning and we're going to keep our one acre zoning we're not we don't we don't  support higher densities don't change our one acre zoning so the the county zoning would not change  we're just taking the city's placeholder zoning and giving it the city zoning of r1 which is  higher density than the vldr but it's um i just i feel like those things might have been a little  bit confused in the communication so back here we're looking at the spa zoning and the project  again and we're going to move into the proposed zoning  also with respect to the general plan also with respect to the general plan also with respect to the  general plan also with respect to the general plan also with respect to the general plan text would be changed to delete the parts that mentioned the Bellemere SPA, so that won't come into play in the future. And then there's appendix C of the general plan that would also eliminate the special planning area for the Bellemere site, because now we have the zoning. If you're contiguous, you could ask for annexation if you have a subdivision or something, some other projects that the city can approve on that site.  city can approve on that site. Moving into the subdivision, here's an aerial photograph to see  some of the context. The site immediately to the south you can see is under construction  for the Orchard Creek Estates project. This is a pretty recent aerial.  Adding the subdivision map to that, you see that there would be a new street created off of  Henshaw that goes in and into a loop street. All the 68 lots of the subdivision would be  addressed off of the loop street. Then there's another little outlet over here on Nord Avenue.  We'll zoom in a little bit further here. You can also see here where we've added the  Orchard Creek Estates project with an opposing street creating a four-way intersection there.  Here's the subdivision map. That storm drain parcel is in the bottom left-hand corner.  The one tree that would be retained is behind the garage here on the entryway street. Situated  over on the side of the road like that. The intention  is to have that be a street tree.  It'll be in the parkway strip.  A street will be constructed on one side of it  and it'll be in the public right-of-way  so we can keep that tree.  And there are conditions of approval  that we've included to try to make sure we keep that tree.  We did the initial study  and mitigated negative declaration, like I said.  And out of that process,  we have mitigation measures for potential nesting birds,  sensitive bat species,  any cultural resources that might be dug up  that we don't know about,  hazardous materials and tribal cultural resources.  Again, we don't know what might come out of the ground  during construction,  so we have those as a protection against that.  We also have additional subdivision conditions  that would require disclosing to all the future owners  that agriculture uses occur in the area.  It's above and beyond what the code requires  because the nearest agricultural zoning  is actually over 1,000 feet away,  over on the other side of the Green Line,  which is on the other side of Highway 32 from here.  We are not close to the Green Line here,  except for at the north end of the site,  the special planning area.  And another condition to complete annexation  within 36 months,  and all of the mitigation measures  become conditions of approval as well.  There's the standard keep tree conditions,  even though we don't really expect to need them  for any sort of mitigation.  There's no qualifying trees  that would be coming out with this subdivision.  So that brings me to the last slide,  where we are working on a new plan.  We are recommending that the planning commission  forward a recommendation to the city council  to adopt the mitigated negative declaration,  approve the general plan amendment and rezone,  and approve the subdivision subject to conditions.  I will answer any questions you have.  go ahead.  this might just be an administrative thing,  but I' m wondering why we,  if there is any sort of reasoning  why we have these items together  instead of having them together  and having the city council  you said you were going to  have the general plan amendment  and rezone as one item  and the project as a second item.  well, they kind of came in together.  they were literally,  the application for the subdivision came in  simultaneously when we were responding  to the city council's direction.  we didn't want to show up with another subdivision  saying they want to carve themselves out of the spa.  because we also know that we have council direction  to get rid of the spa.  so that' s how they became merged.  and we also had to do an environmental document  on either, both of these projects  and combining them together  they are in the same area  made a lot of sense in preparing the environmental review  to kill two birds with one stone  if you will forgive that.  and because it will all go to the council together  instead of having agenda item one for us  the general plan amendment  and then we would be in conflict  with that if we had the project separate.  if we pass that first tonight  and then pass the project.  if the general plan amendment failed  then the project would be impossible to approve.  it wouldn't have the right zoning.  do we feel, I guess  do you feel we have enough  recognizing that' s 378 acres  the project we have in front of us  is 26, 27  but the environmental documents  that we have  were done on the 27 acres  right? not the 370  no, those mitigation measures  will, what will happen  is if we get another subdivision  in this area, we will say  we have the industrial study we did for the special planning area  do the mitigation measures  and the analysis in that document work for this subdivision?  I'm pretty sure there is no wetlands out here  you have the similar issues that we identified  we will probably need a bird condition  a bat condition and those same mitigation measures  so if it is useful  and covers the environmental  potential impacts of that new subdivision  we will use the old document  that we hope gets adopted by council  here with this project  so it can keep being used as long as it is useful  okay  and then is it possible to pull up  the map that you had  where you overlaid the subdivision  okay, yeah  so I'm guessing that's  the north end  with like parcel A  and 17, yup right there  usually  we like to see projects  or the city likes to see projects  that have the ability to connect  to future roads  it just kind of  what's the thinking there of  not having that  possibility with having those parcels  actually be designated for homes  there is a slide the applicant is going to  show that will further articulate  this I don't want to steal all the  information off of that but  this is a one acre subdivision with a street in the middle  to the north  so there is no ability for future connection here  there is actually a subdivision here  under construction right now one acre minimums  and that's also not going to provide a  connection because the road doesn't go to the edge of  this subdivision  this five acre piece is the only piece we could  stub into potentially with this  project and  I don't know if it's worth it  okay  thank you  anybody else  yeah I wrestled too  with the combination of the two things  into one item and you know  I guess that procedurally  if it were necessary we could separate them  and handle them but  Mike could I ask you to go back to the slide  you had that showed  the parcels that were under  review by the county with the blacked  out parcels  thank you  now are those properties that  the county is currently processing  subdivision maps on  or do we have a sense of where they might be  in the process  well approved  these on  nord are all approved  and under the county  yeah and some of them are recorded you see the lots  there where they've been recorded  the only one that's just an  ad is  these 30 acres over here  and  I was told today by a developer that they are in  negotiations to develop in the county there's no  way it would pencil in the city because they have to drag  sewer so far up to get there  it wouldn't make sense in the county or in the city only in the county and they are pursuing the  map but they are in the early early stages  I wouldn't want to over represent that  alright so it looks at this point  that the  parcels we are seeing here in the black are going to  be developed under the county at a  one acre density is that where  things are headed okay  thank you  anybody else  can I ask another hypothetical  question with the county okay so  the city has  the bell mirror SPA which is  basically just holding saying any  location that comes before us  we wanted to  have that to have some sort of zoning  but like we had a project before  it could come before us and we  could approve it and  just keep approving things here  that don't align with the  general plan  I mean the city overturned what we did  I don't like the sound of that no  we don't want to keep approving things that don't align with the general plan  I mean that's essentially what the city council  did correct  but at the same time  they sent it back  this SPA is not a great idea  we're not going to hold up this subdivision because  the whole picture that we're painting here is that  this SPA is slipping through the city's fingers  as it continually develops as this county  so they took advantage of the opportunity  to allow orchard creek  to go forward  and at the same time  said and get rid of the SPA so future  subdivisions don't have this problem  okay and subdivisions  that are currently going to the  county still  follow the county rules  regardless of what we do  on the city  but the neighbors are concerned that  we'll eventually  have some city zoning  on that that could change  is all we're doing tonight  lifting the SPA or are we actually putting in  city zoning  regulations  like annexation  yes we're not annexing anything  except for there will be a proposal  at city council to annex  this subdivision site the 20 acres  anything else will need to show up with  a subdivision that's consistent with  the R1 zoning that is also  contiguous with the city  and then that  can proceed  so we are applying city zoning  pre-zoning to this area in the county  that could  then be developed  if somebody wants to propose a subdivision  get that approved pursuant to  R1 pre-zoning and then get annexation  and I think that's  the important distinction is that while the  pre-zoning is going to occur across the whole  area it doesn't have any  effect until such time as the  property is brought into the city  so for the interim  it just remains under from a  regulatory standpoint under the county  zoning thanks that's what I wanted both  of you to say so thank you  anyone else  okay  we'll open the public hearing  at this time do we have any cards  clerk  the first would be the applicant  Chris Jimpally  hello good afternoon  Chris Jimpally Epic Homes  local home  our family has been building homes  in Chico for the last 40-45 years  I hear the questions about the  SPA being joined  we had a project  we went through  city council in April said we'd like to  have the SPA removed  and it ponied back on our project  and it wasn't my decision it was  what the city decided to do and this is  what we came through with  I understand  why because exactly  the areas that are around  highlighted in the black all of that's  in the county right Tony  so even to the  west if you can look at my cursor  everything to the east of  Cusick from  Cusick over is also county  so it  our project happens to border the city  and that's the only segue  supposedly once these one acres  get built it's going to be  almost landlocked to be able to  do something north of there  I think it's important  also that the city  recognized  putting together  300,000 bucks  for studying the area  I think when Chuck brought his project  through there was a lot of concern  about I think number one was traffic  and with that money  the sewer master plan is supposed to come out  next month the storm drain master plan  came out this month  and traffic would be the next thing to look at  and I think the areas that  I heard Andrew  and Casey Reynolds at the city council  the conversation was more on east avenue  between  Gwin, Alamo,  and that would be what should be studied  as things move forward  and they'll be able to say how many  rooftops are out there that needs to trigger that  and off we go  so that was good  and I think we're  look at the  the  the  the  the  the  the these are two units to the acre and then Roxbury Court is three units to the acre  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the park is a long term out  length right now. I will let  her allude to that but she asked  if our project would help with  the maintenance long term  maintenance and perpetuity and  the replacements cost so our  proportionate share of these  houses will help the maintenance  of that park being put in next  year. The park is over here  next to the school and the  school is still something that  that maybe in 10 years will be  happening but it'  s a long term out  length right now. As far as our  project goes again we'  re 3.4  units to the acre which to the  means of the city is probably on  the low side they typically like  to see it higher but we tried to  match not one acre lots but we  are in the middle side. These  of space between 70 by 125 deep  and 80 by 125 deep. It allows  us to put a house between  1700 and 2600 square feet and  have enough room on the side to  put a boat or trailer and have  enough room for a pool. You  don'  t see that too much on the city  lot anymore but again it was  trying not to go with a lot  higher density and trying to fit  in out there. We would only do  a lot of the  construction and the front  looks different. You will have  one house that will have three  different fronts and you never  notice the same house. We try to  integrate that into our projects  to not look like this typical  boiler plate. We also volunteer  to put in 18 foot well we in our  projects use 18 foot tall light  post. They'  re English style with fluted  poles and English style lantern  looking not using the typical 30  foot tall and out being in the  country a little more. If I had my brothers there would be no lights but the city is a little bit more !  I know you had concerns with  the other project but we  dedicated another nine feet along  north avenue and the idea of doing  that is so we can provide more  landscaping so you have a curb  six and a half foot parkway strip  sidewalk and then you have nine  feet of landscaping before you get  to the fence. At the same time we  like to meander the sidewalk back  and through so it'  s not just one straight shot.  of the fence. We have also gone with an  upgraded fence along there which  would be a board on board fence  that is a lot stronger and longer  lasting plus we will be staining it  so it will have a good look long  lasting in there with a lot of  landscaping to go and buffer it.  We do have a detention basin in  the corner that is green here  which we will landscape as well. The  fence would be a little bit !  All of that would also along  Henshaw you can see as well as  along north all of this would be put  in a maintenance district that the  city of Chico which our home buyers  would pay for.  So it is assessed on their lots.  The last this is an example we built a  project called sycamore creek mountain  vista out there off of eaton road and  floral avenue.  This is kind of an example of a  linear park.  You can see the curve nature of the  sidewalk.  You have a little more that is  that board on board type of fence.  This picture was taken this morning.  The fence was put up seven years ago.  The landscaping is maintained by  the city but paid for by the  homeowners.  That is about all I have got to say.  There is a big old oak tree that  was built in the middle of the  street.  saved and we are going to save.  It will be one of our accesses to  the main point of the subdivision.  When we come in it will be back over  here.  You can see it is here and we moved  the street around just to accommodate  this oak tree as we come in.  We think it will be really cool.  This was an orchard and the prior  property owners took the orchard off.  Anyhow if there are any questions  I would be more than happy to answer  them.  Maybe just one quick one on  the sycamore glen project and the  fence there.  In that case was the fence part of  the maintenance district or is that  up to the abutting property?  That is a good question.  Typically that comes with the  homeowners.  I have a quick question.  Do you have a price range in mind?  Would you want to sell some of them?  I would like to sell  My idea is this will be 1700  square foot houses to 2600 square  foot houses.  Barring what our improvement costs  are this could be in the low fives  to mid fives and probably up into  the mid sevens.  On 2600 square foot house.  If I could get it lower I would  but they are pretty big lots.  Anyhow thank you.  All right.  Next speaker is  the next speaker will be  Keith Dalio and then John Dunbar.  Good evening I'  m Keith Dalio with roles  Anderson and roles I'  m the civil engineer on the  project.  I think that most of what I had  to say people have been saying  already.  A couple things maybe to add.  The project is surrounded by other  single family development.  Really I think of it as it'  s really just an  infill project.  It has access to utilities,  it has streets, it'  s compatible with existing land  and it'  s consistent with the general  plan.  And I guess lastly as has been  said I think it'  s important that the one acre  lots really still can be developed  out here and that the county'  s zoning will still be there.  So that doesn'  t change anything.  So and then if we look at the  project I'  m going to ask if there'  s any technical type questions  or any questions at all I can  answer them.  Thank you Keith.  John Dunbar filed by Katie  Toma.  Good evening.  I appreciate the opportunity to  share a couple thoughts with you.  So my name is John Dunbar.  We live on Alamo Avenue.  We'  ve been there since 1986 and  we'  ve watched the area evolve over  the years.  We love the area and we'  re interested in keeping it kind  of the way it'  s been.  I mean I realize that the  orchards are no longer viable  for a variety of reasons.  But we are not interested in high  density.  So I wanted to share with you  some of my thoughts that have  already been shared.  But I wanted to make you aware of  a couple things.  So I wrote a letter.  It' s in attachment F.  At the end the best for the last.  The last thing in the report.  I shared in there some petitions.  There are 35 signatures from  property owners in and around the  Bellmere area there that I surveyed.  And in the process of doing that I  learned something.  There are two things.  One, many property owners had no  idea what was being proposed.  I know you've seen that on  mailing.  It seems that when the county  residents receive a piece of mail  from the city of Chico they assume  it's a mistake because they don't  live in the city and so they  discard the mail.  This fact it seems to me may cause  you to incorrectly assume that  property owners are generally  supportive of what's being proposed.  I've been in the process of talking  to neighbors and property owners.  With very few exceptions I've found  zero property owners in and around  the Bellmere area that are in favor  of what's being proposed.  The densities and the traffic that  will be generated.  The only exceptions to this were  non-owner occupied properties or  property owners that intend to sell  their property, make a big profit  and then leave.  They're not really invested in  the Bellmere area.  They're going to leave.  I have no problem with land  developers making a profit.  I understand the risks and costs  associated with land development  but I do object to them profiting  at the expense of those of us  where this is our home.  I hope that you will honor the  one acre minimum zoning even for  the autumn leaf subdivision.  Had you not approved the other  one just to the south then that  wouldn't be contiguous with city  and it wouldn't be allowed now  because it's not contiguous with  the city boundary that got extended  in favor of the last subdivision  that you approved.  Please honor the one acre minimum  zoning in the county and allow  that area to develop that way.  Thank you.  Katie Toma followed by Annabel  Grimm.  Good evening planning commissioners.  My name is Katie Toma and I have  lived in Chico for a total of four  to six years.  In reviewing the staff report for  the Belmere SPA designation  dissolution I found the petition  submitted by the neighbors a bit  disheartening.  I have lived in the avenues for  over 35 years and owned a home  there for 28 of those years.  I chose to live in the avenues  because of its character.  This nice size lots, big trees,  accessibility to schools and  downtown.  In the last several years we have  seen the changes in the  many ADU's and junior ADU's built  in the neighborhood along with  infill projects.  It has changed the dynamic of the  neighborhood.  For me it's a little claustrophobic  but I get it people need a place to  live.  I understand the objections of the  neighbors but it isn't reality.  The reality is Chico needs housing,  and I encourage families to realize  the dream of home ownership just  like them and just like me.  Yes the neighborhood will change  just like my neighborhood has changed  but I embrace the change.  Especially when I see my neighbors  out walking their dogs, kids walking  to school, college kids trucking  through the alley late at night  after enjoying a fun evening downtown.  I believe the avenues are richer  for these new neighbors.  I encourage the planning commission  to remove the Belmere SPA designation  and planning requirements as  identified in the general plan.  Thank you.  Thank you Katie.  Our last speaker is Annabel Grimm.  Good evening commissioners.  My name is Annabel Grimm and I am here  to express Chico area recreation and  park district cards support for the  autumn leaf estate subdivision.  This project along with Chuck Chitro's  project that was recently approved  represent not only the responsible  development of much needed housing  but also a commitment to maintaining  our communities parks and recreational  resources.  Currently there is no maintenance  district to support Henshaw Park.  Epic Homes and Chuck Chitro have  voluntarily joined a maintenance  district to help offset the ongoing  maintenance and replacement costs  associated with the park.  As you may know the park is set to  go to design in a few short months.  This is a prime example of how  developers and the community can work  together to ensure that our public  spaces are maintained and continue to  serve future generations.  Green spaces and recreational areas  like Henshaw Park are essential to the  overall health and well being of the  community.  Studies continue to show its benefits  to physical and mental health.  For families these spaces provide safe  healthy environments for children to  play, neighbors to come and play,  and for all of us to enjoy the  natural beauty around us.  Parks play a crucial role in fostering  a sense of belonging and shared  responsibility within these neighborhoods.  They offer more than just a place to relax.  There are spaces where community can  gather, form long lasting connections  and create vibrant healthy lifestyles.  Establishing long term care and  maintenance of 4 Henshaw Park,  the Autumn Leaf Estates and Chuck  Chitro project are setting a standard  for the community to enjoy the  developing for development that benefits  not only residents of these new  subdivisions but the community as a whole.  I encourage the commission to support  this project not only for the housing  it provides but for the investment in  the health and vitality of our neighborhoods.  Thank you for your consideration.  thank you Annabelle.  that was our last speaker.  that was it.  we will close the public hearing.  we will now move to the  I don't really have a question but  I just want to make a comment.  Chris had said do you want to sell  some of these homes?  I would like to address that I  think we all know we have had a  housing shortage for quite some time  and that prices have skyrocketed  all over the country.  That in my opinion began after the  crash and builders have been playing  catch up for the last five to seven years.  I think that is part of the reason  why prices have gone up.  Which has caused our property taxes to go up.  Now our homeowners insurance has gone up.  We have to try to control in my opinion  the cost of housing.  If we could chip away and get some  more inventory if you will  even in this price point.  This is sandwiched between what  Orchard Creek Estates is and  one acre parcel.  That is an average of a $1.1 million home.  I think that is a huge  I know I can't afford that.  I think that is maybe a 4% of  what we sell in Chico is in that price point.  I can certainly  understand Mr. Dunbar  and his neighbors.  They probably feel like they are  taking one for the team.  I completely understand that.  I think it is for the better of all.  Hopefully we can get some control  on the what I call  insanity of the cost of housing.  That is my two cents.  Thank you.  Anybody else?  I would like to propose a closing.  Mark did you want to say anything first?  I was just going to say  that I think it makes sense  from a planning standpoint  to dissolve this SPA.  There just wasn't the critical mass  there to make it really ever possible.  I totally support that part  of the proposal.  I think I would just like to say  I think it is a great proposal  and I generally don't support  blanket zoning for low density  but it seems like this would be higher density  than what is.  It really does seem like this SPA  is a hot mass.  I will be supporting it.  Paul did you want to make a motion?  I would like to make a motion  and I would like to say thank you Epic Homes  for they stepped up the game.  I think that is really nice.  I would love to hear about the park coming in.  That was a big concern. Last time I was like it could be in 15 years.  I would like to propose a motion.  I move that the planning commission  adopt resolution number 24-12  recommending that the city council  adopt the mitigated negative declaration  and approve the general plan amendment  rezone and tentative subdivision map  subject to the attached conditions.  Second.  I have a motion and a second.  Nicole would you follow along?  I will.  I will.  Commissioner Wolff?  Yes.  Commissioner Scarpa?  Yes.  Commissioner Poulin?  Yes.  Commissioner Laffins?  Yes.  Commissioner Cooper?  Yes.  Vice Chair Scott?  Yes.  will it go as a combined item as well?  That is the intention.  Yes.  I guess one thing that I would like to see  I know there is noticing requirements  and everything  but the way of removing an SPA  designation feels a lot heavier to me  than approving a subdivision  and I understand the reasoning for tying those together  but  I know there is write ups that go in the newspaper  and kind of advances  having really that public  way in on what was a  very involved community process  of designating an SPA  and what we just did tonight  and then what is going to the council  feels like it should be  honored  in a way that gets community engagement  on that if people want that.  So I don't want people to read the item  just as a subdivision approval.  It would be nice  to also honor what  we did tonight  if that makes sense.  Sorry.  I mean didn't city council already  direct to remove it in March  so this is just like  our recommendation is really based on direction  by something that has already happened.  Yeah.  To be honest with you  we have already run the notice for that meeting.  Okay.  So it doesn't matter.  We are prepared to run that notice  so we don't want to pull it at this time.  Thanks.  Anything else on that item?  Okay.  Bruce do you have any report  for communications?  Yes Mr. Chair.  Excuse me. I would like to report out  on a project that we reviewed at one of our last meetings.  It was the Skyway Travel Center  on Park Street  and Carmichael.  And I just want to let you know  that that project was subsequently  appealed by the school district.  And when we got into the  further analysis of the project  we found out that  there was an easement that  existed on the site that staff had no  idea existed.  And so we went back to the applicant  and we found out  that this easement did exist  unbeknownst to staff.  Had we known we would have  not gotten as far as it did  and would not have gone as far as  it did to the planning commission.  So the applicant has subsequently  withdrawn the project  and the appeal went away  because the project was withdrawn.  And the applicant is currently working around  the easement to see if they can redesign  the site to make it work better  respecting the easement that exists.  So I just want to let you know  that happened.  There was a little drama afterwards  but the project has been withdrawn  and it was relevant because you just saw it at your last meeting.  So if they can work around it  then it may come back to us.  That's right. But they'll start over again.  We'll do an environmental document.  We haven't heard back from them.  So we'll see.  Is the easement on the  east side or the north side?  It's right in the middle.  It's like an inverted C that runs  right in the middle of it.  What's the nature of the easement?  Is it a utility easement or an access easement?  It says for access  and drainage purposes.  And we couldn't find out much more  about it. Other than that  it's clear the easement does exist.  We have the documents.  We had  and it's the applicant's responsibility  to let us know those things.  And that's one of the things they put on the map to begin with.  It just missed.  But they've withdrawn it  and we'll see what they come back with.  That's all I had though. Thank you.  Thank you.  We are adjourned to the adjourned regular meeting  of Thursday, September 19, 2024.  Thank you.
