Okay. If those aren't answered tonight, then I'll be asking them. Perfect. And then any to my right? All right. So we will go to item 4.1, housing element update, which we are all anxious to hear. And thank you, Marie, for starting us off. Yes. Good evening, planning commissioners, staff, and public. I am Marie Demers, housing manager. And this evening we're presenting the draft 2022 housing element update of the general plan. It's also known as the sixth cycle housing element. Nineteen months ago, community development department staff and our consultant, housing tools, embarked upon this update process and all that it entails. Tonight we have Sherry Murgato, James Coles, and Jessica Candela. They're here from housing tools, who is our consultant, to lead us through some background information and an overview of the housing element. They have a presentation to share. And following that, we're available for questions and discussion. With that, Sherry Murgato is going to begin the presentation. Good evening, everyone. And again, my name is Sherry Murgato. I'm the community development manager with housing tools. And I'm going to go over a few slides to provide some background and context for the housing element discussion this evening. So first I'm going to do a little bit of an overview about the housing element itself. We're going to talk about the regional housing needs allocation known as the RHNA. We're going to cover major legislative changes that have happened since 2014, which impact the housing element. We're going to talk about the adequate sites inventory, some of the key actions from the housing program, and then we'll go to the questions and comments from commissioners and members of the public. So a bit of an overview about the housing element, beginning with its purpose. So the housing element establishes the city's priorities for housing its citizens, and this happens in eight-year cycles. And as Marie just mentioned, this cycle for this housing element is referred to as the sixth cycle by the state. It sets goals for the allocation of funding, program coordination, and zoning efforts to support the production of housing. And these are the items that are within the control of the city. It is one of the mandated elements of the city's general plan. It must be consistent with the general plan, and the general plan, of course, has a 15 to 20-year timeframe instead of the eight-year timeframe. So to go over the planning cycles, the current existing getting ready to expire housing element period covered the four main areas. The first is the time from 2014 through 2021, and your new housing element update period covers the period 2022 to 2030. A little bit about state oversight. So oversight of housing element development and implementation statewide is administered by the State Department of Housing and Community Development, and we refer to them as HCD. HCD approval of the housing element provides access to state funding through a variety of grant programs. Since 2014, the state has amended the housing element law through numerous bills, and these place additional responsibilities on local jurisdictions to adequately plan for and facilitate the production of housing while removing as many constraints as possible. And some of these new laws are going to be further detailed in this presentation. I'd also like to note that HCD sets the deadline for the submittal of each jurisdiction's housing element, and Chico's is due by June 15, 2014. The next meeting will be held in March of 2022. There are some mandated topics which must be addressed in each housing element. Briefly, these are the public participation process that was used to garner the input for the development of the housing element. A review of the city's previous housing element progress. A needs assessment that looks at a variety of both quantitative and qualitative data elements to determine what the housing needs are in the community. An adequate site and site assessment. A site's inventory to establish whether or not the city has enough appropriately zoned land to meet its RHNA. A financial inventory that looks at the resources that are available to help the city in its progress toward meeting its RHNA goals. A constraints analysis that looks at both governmental and non-governmental constraints to the production of housing. An assessment of fair housing, which is a significantly increased responsibility on the part of local jurisdictions, and we're going to talk about that as well. And then the housing program, which consists of goals, objectives, and actions that the city is committing itself to undertake in order to make progress in meeting the housing needs of everyone in the community. So now I'm going to talk about the Regional Housing Needs Allocation, or the RHNA. So this is really the foundation of the housing element process, at least when you look at the information that comes out of the state. This is about determining the amount of housing that the city needs to have. And then the housing that must be planned for to accommodate future growth. And this is segmented by income levels. This RHNA is set through a partnership between the state HCD and each regional planning organization. In Butte County, this is BCAG, or the Butte County Association of Governments. Using demographic data from a variety of sources, HCD and BCAG each arrive at their own assessment of what the housing needs are. And again, this is a future look. BCAG then coordinates with HCD. And then the housing needs are determined by the housing needs. But we're also looking at the housing needs of the city, taking into account factors that aren't captured in the state's standard calculations to arrive at a final figure. And this final figure is the Regional Housing Needs Allocation. BCAG is then responsible for allocating this housing need between the cities and the county, and BCAG does this through a Regional Housing Needs Allocation plan, referred to as the RHNA plan. So I wanted to go over in this chart the city's RHNA allocation plan, and what we're looking at here is the regional housing needs allocation plan, or the RHNA plan. and production. So this is looking at the period from June of 2014 when your fifth cycle housing element began through production of December 2021. We've included here January to June 2022 projections. And the reason why we did that is because the way the annual progress reports are done with the state, they go to the end of each calendar year. But we thought it was important to account for what the city is thinking is going to happen in the first six months of this year as well since your housing element actually goes through June of 2022. So you can see here the income levels are broken down extremely low, very low, low, moderate, and above moderate. What the RENA allocation was, so this is what the state allocated to the city of Chico as their estimate of future growth needs from 2014 through 2022. The units that were produced during that time and what percentage that was of the RENA, and then the additional planned, we've added in the additional planned units through, as I mentioned, from January to June 2022 to get you at what we believe will be the percentage of RENA produced and planned through 2022. What you can see here is that for extremely low, the percentage is estimated to be at 41.9%. You're very low at 90.8. Low income at 49.9. Moderate at 47.3. And you're above moderate at 219.7. Some of those numbers, the moderate and the above moderate are actually the same as the December figures. So we know that those are the units that have actually been produced. Now looking forward to the housing element update for 2022-2023. The RHNA here is a little bit different. You can see that the very low income is 1,101. This includes 551 extremely low income units. The state has actually changed the way they do their RHNA allocations. They don't break out the extremely low income separately anymore, but they want jurisdictions to plan for 50% of your very low income to be extremely low income. Then your low income production would be 507 units, moderate income 770, and above moderate income 1,110 for a total RHNA of 3,488. Now I wanted to cover a few of the major legislative changes that impact this housing element. The first one has to do with accessory dwelling units referred to as ADUs or junior ADUs. ADUs are the units that are used for the housing of the housing district. I've got the laws listed here. There were a lot of them since 2014. Basically, these laws limit local agencies' ability to restrict the development of ADUs in a variety of ways, and they provide for ministerial and streamlined approvals for ADUs and JDUs. Every housing element adopted after January 1, 2020 must certify that the jurisdiction's code is in compliance with the ADU laws, or it must include a program to bring it into compliance. Chico has been doing a lot of work on ADUs in the last few years, and you're in very, very good shape. AB 671 also requires every housing element adopted after January 1 of 2020 to include a program that incentivizes and promotes the creation of ADUs that can offer affordable rents for very low, low, or moderate income households, and we have included that program in this housing element update. Affirmatively, the housing element is not a program that is used for the creation of and delivery of financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and financial aid and of the housing element document, as you've probably seen, especially in Chapter 4. The AFH must address five key fair housing issues, fair housing enforcement and outreach capacity, segregation and integration, racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, disparities in access to opportunity, and disproportionate housing needs and displacement risk. It must also evaluate the adequate sites inventory relative to the AFH, identify contributing factors to any fair housing issues that are noted, and establish goals and actions within the housing element program to address those findings. The adequate sites inventory and no-net loss. Again, we had a number of laws pertaining to this. Effective with the sixth cycle housing elements, changes were made to the required sites inventory components, including the capacity calculation, density requirements, infrastructure requirements, the suitability of non-vacant sites, size requirements, locational requirements, rezone program requirements, non-vacant site replacement unit requirements, and sites identified in previous housing elements. Along with this, SB 166, known as the no-net loss law, also applies to any housing element adopted after January 1, 2019, which requires that each jurisdiction establish a monitoring program to ensure that adequate sites are available to accommodate its remaining unmet RENA by each income category, at all times. This impacts the ability of jurisdictions to reduce a parcel's residential density, and it dictates certain actions if a parcel in the site inventory is developed with fewer units than that which is shown in the housing element. So now I'm going to talk a little bit about the adequate sites inventory. So the adequate sites inventory for 2022 through 2030, again, we have the number, we have the affordability tier, but we also have the number of units that are available to accommodate the cost and cost delivery and cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery cost delivery plus of 1,345. Some key actions in the housing program. These are actions that are new or significantly different from the current housing element. In goal one to improve fair housing choice and equitable access to opportunity, this has been greatly expanded because of AB 686 and the affirmatively furthering fair housing requirements. This now includes seven policies and 18 actions. These are covered on pages 48 through 54. Goal two is to increase collaboration with other governmental entities and organizations in Butte County to address the long-term impacts to housing from the Camp Fire and other subsequent fires and natural disasters. This is a completely new goal that was added. Goal three is to support production of housing that is affordable to low incomes. This was expanded. The new actions that are included here are now actions that are required or encouraged because of new legislation. The action to update the city's density bonus ordinance from 35% to 50% per AB 2345 with the note that 100% affordable projects can receive an 80% density bonus. This is action 3.3.1 on page 55. The new actions required by AB 686 and AB 545 are to increase the availability of housing and the cost of living and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost delivery and cost per acre if a minimum of 15% of those units are deep restricted to be affordable to low-income households. This is action 3.3.6 on page 57. Goal four, promote construction of a wide range of housing types. This was expanded to include an action to implement the no net loss requirements through an ongoing unit production evaluation program. Action 4.1.1 on page 57. Goal six, to improve, rehabilitate, and revitalize existing homes and neighborhoods. This was expanded to add an action to provide funding to support rehabilitation of existing multifamily affordable housing projects with city affordability covenants. And that's action 6.2.2 on page 60. And then goal eight, remove governmental constraints to the development of housing, emergency shelters, and low barrier navigation centers. This was expanded to add actions relating to state legislation. Goal six, to improve, rehabilitate, and revitalize existing homes and neighborhoods. This was expanded to include an action to implement the no net loss legislation. First off, actions regarding emergency shelters to both limit parking requirements and to identify an additional zoning district where emergency shelters are allowed by right per AB 139. This is actions 8.1.1 and 8.1.3 on page 62. And then an action regarding low barrier navigation centers to be allowed by right in areas zoned for mixed use and non-residential zones permitting multifamily units. And this is per AB 101. Goal seven, to improve, rehabilitate, and revitalize existing homes and neighborhoods. This was expanded to include a housing element on page 62. And then an action 8.1.2 on page 62. I wanted to point out that we do have a housing element website, and I hope everyone is visiting it. It is chicohousingelement.com. And all of the housing element information and resources are posted on the website. You can find all of the resources from the community meetings, the draft housing element is there, and lots of background information about the housing element and the state law. So I guess we're going to go ahead and get started. I'm going to go to Brendan now. Yeah. Good evening, Chair Scott, Vice Chair over, and the commission. Brendan V., Community Development Director. As I'm sure you're aware, we received a couple of letters today and yesterday, and they were passed along to you. So I just want to let you know, first of all, that staff really appreciates the thorough comments that we received. These are a very meaty, complex document with a lot of opportunity for people to find things that are relevant and that we need to address. So after a very careful review today by staff, I'm going to go ahead and get started. Again, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, use and office mixed use i believe such amendments would be consistent with the way that staff has implemented the overlay most recently an r3 zone parcel on nord avenue which supported a four-story project known as post on nord so we have been implementing it in the way that we've represented it in the adequate sites inventory although the comment received you know took us to a more careful review and it doesn't read as clear as we'd like it to and so we think an additional action would clarify that and make that consistent with the analysis of the adequate sites inventory also there was a couple of locations where they mentioned the a home on a larger parcel suggesting that some of these sites weren't vacant the one that i really thought stood out to me was a very small 0.6 acre parcel zoned r3 in the esplanade near dagarmo park where again the commenter house sacramento highlighted the presence of a triplex on the parcel and staff agrees that either that parcel should be completely removed or at least a portion of it should be removed that's the one where mike and i after kind of a careful analysis completely agreed but i do want to highlight that the loss of that very small area in no way affects the conclusion of the adequate sites inventory that there's an adequate supply of appropriately zoned land to meet our housing needs over the next eight years and that further um you know with the addition of a lot of the areas that we did not include in that adequate sites analysis barbaryard and valley's edge again there is a significant buffer that isn't quantified in the adequate sites inventory but that suggests there will be more than enough land to meet our needs and all of the categories and then finally uh there's a lot of questions about the text and the uh and the adequate sites inventory and the sites listed in the text and then also um referring back to appendix b and so i think you should direct staff and the consultant to carefully review consistency of the language found in the text with that found in appendix b again that site's inventory form in uh attachment b is something required by the california department of housing and community development and so again we are very certain and comfortable with the text language we do believe however in some recent consultation with housing tools who provided that kind of after the fact appendix it was an earlier version of the appendix from even over a year ago it had gone through many iterations and matured i believe we do have a fairly accurate version of appendix b that we could have provided tonight but i i instead want to just pause not kind of throw a new you know huge uh appendix at you and instead direct us to really make sure the two are consistent before we were to submit to hcd so those were the three areas in particular um after review of all the comments that we see some direction from you uh we're of course happy to answer any questions related to the comments or your comments um and uh we're here for you tonight thanks brendan um before we go into uh and i'm kind of putting you on the spot here but we rarely get to see our community development director um before we get into commission questions i'm wondering if you could just give us kind of really broad and i'd like to hear from you and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and cycle and documenting that. There's all the information that needs to be in the document. And then there's the provision of, you know, you can see a lot of energy is put into that adequate sites inventory. And that's one of the areas where I think if you saw in the staff report, we shared that we engaged HCD on a courtesy review. And we got some feedback from them. Initially, we were kind of hanging our hat, for instance, on the past affordable housing projects, the densities that we were seeing those projects come in at, and relying on our old zoning. And they didn't buy off on that. And they said there's some statutory requirements that based on your new size as a community of over 100,000, you need to have this test of 30 units per acre. And so that's when we kind of did a combination of, well, we will come up with this new footnote, this new change to our code where projects that have an affordability component will by right be able to come in at 30 units per acre. We also believe there's a lot, there's a story we also told in there, though, because we have projects going forward right now, affordable projects that are well under 30 units per acre. We had some back and forth with them regarding density bonus. So to get back to your question, we believe that what we have in front of you is a document that meets all those needs, that provides a program that can policies, actions that are, have the right bandwidth with our resources, both financially as well as staff related. And that are implementable. And so that's what we're here to talk about. Now, we're happy to hear of other thoughts and ideas for actions and programs. But in some cases, it's not as simple as just saying, spend more money and build more affordable housing because that money has to come from somewhere. And so, again, your role tonight is to take the public feedback, provide your own guidance to us, and let us know if you think we've met that mark. We believe HCD thinks we have a, an approvable document right now. And so, we're just looking for some guidance from you. Great. Any commission questions? Maybe I'll start, we'll just go down the line. Well, I have a fair amount of detailed questions in the housing element itself, but kind of following up on Tony's question about, which was I think well stated about government role. My question is a little bit more about the specific process in approving the element before getting into some of the details of the element itself. But, so, I guess I'm a bit concerned and wanting to reflect some of the community concerns that are represented here and that I've heard about timing. And whether there is any wiggle room on when we actually forward this on to the agency and the council. And the reason I'm asking that is, you know, this document has only been available to the public for, as might count, 21 days. And the June 15th deadline, I probably just missed somewhere. I apologize if I did, but I was not aware that we only had until the 15th to actually approve it. That feels very, very tight for something as critical, especially in this community these days to, for the Planning Commission to move this along without giving full action to the, to ourselves, let alone the community. So, my question is, if we were to not approve this tonight, what happens? We're looking for a recommendation for you to the council for approving the document. The June 15th deadline is not in stone. There are jurisdictions throughout California, I may have housing tools share some stories of other communities they've worked with that haven't been able to meet that expected deadline. We've had communication with HCD, and they've acknowledged that, yes, a lot of jurisdictions are struggling. Makes it sound like it's hard to meet a benchmark. There's a lot of inconsistency in feedback with HCD. There's a lot of interpretation of the new legislation that make it difficult in the back and forth and implementation and creating these plans. So, is there wiggle room? Of course. We're not going to meet the June 15th deadline, but we want to be as close to it as possible and show a good faith effort of getting it to them as soon as possible. Thanks. For now, I think that's good. I really am anxious to hear from the public and I do have lots of specific questions. Nope. Yeah, I also had some process questions and a lot of other questions, but like Rich, I'll try to save some of them for after we hear from the public. Yeah, so, first of all, exciting to be here. This is an effort that will guide us for the next eight years, so I want to make sure that we are doing a great job of ensuring we build a community that can house us all. So, it's exciting to be working with staff and the community on that. So, I think Brendan already answered a good amount of my questions on that process. I kind of, I agree with Rich that I was a bit confused by the timeline. We've only really had this document in front of us for a few weeks and it's hard to know how we're supposed to direct staff and things like that. So, I guess my question is are we tonight able to shape this document? What is our role? Do we make conditions of approval if we have things that we want to add to it? Is there any further room for what we're doing? Are we workshopping it? Things like that? I would suggest that as part of a recommendation, if you wanted to shape it, for instance, you could make recommendations through a majority of the planning commission for addition of something. That would not be individual shaping. It would be by a majority of this group. And then we would bring that to the City Council and probably weigh in on how we felt about that recommendation. As far as workshopping, in essence, that's what we're here, we're doing tonight. We are taking comments on the document and you're providing that feedback. We've done workshops and outreach, surveys and the like. So, it's not like starting over with that kind of public engagement. And then the review period is 21 days as of today, but by the time it gets to the City Council, it will be beyond the 30-day public review period. Honestly, I think we'll continue to see comments coming in as it makes its way to the City Council. Okay. Thank you. I guess one thing that I was a bit confused about was we've had workshops on the concepts presented in the prior documents for the housing element, but nothing that's quite like a conversation for members of the community. It's a little more formal public hearing setting. So, my understanding is that we're only having a public hearing and getting comments from the public. And then we can make those recommendations to Council based on what we hear from the public. And that's correct, right? And I guess an order question for that is how do we make those recommendations? Is that something we include in our final motion? Yeah. In the same way, I hope that you would take some of the suggestions that staff has provided. You could kind of go along and put them on the same line. Okay. Thank you. I have a question. A couple. Yeah, a lot of time and energy and effort went into this document. And I think we received it two weeks ago at our last commission meeting. And it was tough. It was a lot of reading to do in two weeks. And as I started to go through it, I had to stop and kind of question myself, wait, are we being tasked with just a, we're checking the box because this is a state requirement, we have to do it? Or do we actually want to meet these RHNA numbers? Because I kind of agree with some of the sentiment here that the goals and actions that I see presented to me as a project manager where I take problems and solve them, they're not solvable in the way that it's written. Let me rephrase that. They're solvable for some of the affordability tiers, but some of them, it's no way. So that was kind of my main thing to the board was, is this just a procedural thing or do we actually want to make an impact? Out of the six cycles, how many of those cycles has the city met their RHNA goals? So I just want to tell you that the RHNA goals are typically pretty much across the state, very difficult to achieve. They're usually very high numbers. Often, and you'll see in this one that the goals for the above moderate, we have well exceeded. Because that's typically the private sector building market rate housing. The extremely low and very low often, I mean this last, I would say that over the last year, two years actually, with the influx of funding due to the campfire, our numbers have jumped up remarkably. And again, it's because of money. And typically, that's where you're going to see the resources is to assist those extremely low and low income. The folks in the middle, the moderate and then the low are much more difficult because it is the missing piece in terms of financing. So that's... And I guess that's where my main concern is, is your moderate to above moderate is actually a majority of the housing allocation needs. But there's really not a whole lot of quantifiable goals in here. So, how do we reach those numbers if there's no path to get there? So the struggle is what Marie just shared, is jurisdictions have financial constraints. And I will say that we are seeing the state is taking very seriously, or more seriously, than in the past, this demand for housing and this need. They're still trying to push a lot of that responsibility down to the local jurisdictions, but the funding sources are becoming more available. And I guess I would look to housing tools perhaps to maybe chime in and share if they believe that's an accurate statement. But, you know, campfire did bring a lot of money in, but there's been other sources, and there are a lot more on the horizon. But just generating a new funding source? Well, and I guess that's where I would expect to see some of those goals and some of those ideas is meeting I think one of my questions was what are other cities that are kind of similar to Chico who are meeting the arena goals or getting closer than we are? What are they doing differently that we're not doing? Or what are some of the creative financing that's out there? Basically, long story short, it focuses on the low-hanging fruit, and I think it needs to focus on the opposite. It's how do we get to the numbers that are hard to achieve? Well said. That's the challenge. I would just add to that that the state has put a lot of money into affordable housing over the last five years. That has been targeted to predominantly very low and extremely low-income households, which is why you see a little bit more progress in those areas than the moderate. And as Brendan was alluding to, the moderate is more of a challenge in that there are fewer federal or state funding sources to address that. The above moderate is there's been quite a bit of progress. Again, the private market is meeting that through the development of market rates, single-family homes, and the city has more than doubled the arena in the last planning period for meeting that need. So, as far as I'm not sure what you're referring to as far as low-hanging fruit, but I guess, the most challenging income category to meet is the moderate. There are very few funding programs for that. So, you know, that's just, I guess we're just being honest that that's more of a challenge. It's easier to make progress on the very low, extreme low, and the moderate. Yeah, and just from a personal perspective, that's where I would expect a majority of the goals to be catered around. Well, I would also add that HCD puts a real emphasis on the hardest to house. So, that, you know, even though there's been progress in extremely low and the low-income categories, there's still great need. Oh, absolutely. So, there are various requirements in the housing element law that we put a lot of focus in those lower income categories. And, you know, the HCD priorities. Honestly, they put a lot less focus in the requirements on the moderating. And that kind of lines up with where the funding priorities have been. Right. But if our priority is flipped, where we actually need more moderate and above moderate, then I would expect, you know, the amount of effort to be equatable to the needs that are presented in the RHNA numbers. So, I guess the thing is, you can use all the words you want to, but it's money. Right. It's that simple. So, we can't just create a lot of more words to get something. And that's the challenge statewide. And it's about funding resources. And that's the... And I think that was kind of setting the initial context of Brendan when I asked the role of the city and local government. We are, you know, when we lost... We did have a redevelopment agency at one point and we did have funding. And so, maybe at that point, we could have been home builders or you know, land holders. But we're not. And so, when we talk about policies, that's really what we have control over. We don't have control over market conditions or supply costs or we can't go out and build homes as a city. So, really what I would be looking to the public and the commission are, what are the policies in here that help us help businesses and organizations and nonprofit groups build the housing that we need? Because we can't do it. And I think we have the need certainly, but we as an entity aren't in that business. So, yeah, I guess I should have... When you opened up that initial question, yes, the city itself is not in the business of building homes and owning them. So... Any other questions before we open the public hearing? Turn on. Mine are simple. Page 15, the surplus deficit, the RENA numbers. So we do have a surplus of those numbers, correct? On page 15. Yeah, on page 15, figure 40.5, that's showing the RENA for the next planning period from 2022 to 2030, what those RENA targets are by income. And those are all surpluses. And then there's the sites inventory. In other words, the sites that have been identified that can meet that need and we're showing a surplus for those categories. In other words, there is adequate land appropriately zoned to... meet that need. Again, the city is not a housing developer, but they're creating the conditions, making the land available that's appropriately zoned where those units could be built. Thanks, James. Also, I missed it somewhere maybe, but very low, low, what are these income levels? I mean, is low $10,000 a year? Is moderate $30,000 a year? Is it... I'm just trying to put these into brackets. It's interesting, this kind of unique aspect of the housing element law. I mentioned that for the sites inventory, state housing law uses density as a proxy for affordability. It's typically lower densities. Housing built in lower densities are more expensive than higher densities. So, say, above moderate income category, those are your low density, residentially zoned properties, typically six units per acre or less. Moderate's about six to fourteen units per acre. And then very low and low would be the highest densities. 22, 30 units per acre. Also, I don't know if this was part of your question, but as far as the state income categories, we had that on figure 27. What are they putting this group into? Now they have very low. Right, so extremely low. It shows on figure 27 for the Butte County area what those incomes are. So they're either from like 14,850 for a one person household to 31,040 for a five person household and so on. Median goes from 49,500. Is it on one of these pages? Yeah, so this is on figure 27. And I can find the page number. Sorry, there was a lot of paper that I found. You don't have to tell me at all if it's on one of these pages. It's in chapter four and I'll find the page number for you. And that's all I really had is just good job. Page 198. And that, I'm glad you asked about that because that figure is really helpful to provide context of what we're talking about when we talk about these different income levels. Page what? Page 198. I have 198? It's figure 27 right there at the top of page 198. Perfect. And I appreciate this is a lot of work and a lot of effort and I get it. You can't, the state might be poor next year. This might, you know, we don't know what's going to happen. I can't find stuff. It takes eight months to get something so it'll be a tough one. So. I do have another process question. I would love to know historically what the planning commission's role in the housing element update process has been because I've heard that it used to be different and I looked in our code of ordinances and the description of the planning commission functions includes that we shall prepare and recommend for adoption by the council a comprehensive long-term general plan and any amendments thereto. This code section includes elements, which includes the housing element. So I guess I thought that we would be more involved in preparing the document and my concern is yes we had the opportunity to take the survey and now we can give some recommendations in the final stages of the plan but I would like to know if in the past that role has been more comprehensive or not. Not in my experience the last four housing elements that I've been involved with. It's come to the commission in a draft form after all the work of the consultant and staff working with the community, looking at the past housing element and then again they're in a position to make a recommendation to council, make a recommendation with proposed amendments. So that's been the past practice. Same with the housing, same with the general plan itself, same with other elements and amendments to the general plan. Okay, thank you. Okay, and I can reserve some questions for later. Okay. I was thinking I was going to reserve this for later but we've been already talking a fair amount about some specifics on RHNA and projections, etc. in some specific pages so I feel like maybe it is appropriate to go ahead and dig in just a little bit. And I'll try to be very succinct without jumping all over the place but so on the report on page 36, for figure one, which is the RHNA numbers with the projections, so this is the 2014 to 21 report with January to June 22 projections. And I guess what I'm looking for is clarification, maybe particularly on the projections part of that because that becomes very, very important when we flip back later and look at the expectations for related to site availability but also what we're projecting is going to happen. So my specific question, the numbers that I was able to find for looking at this figure one table, so the numbers that are here range from extremely low, which I understand is a category that sort of doesn't exist anymore, of 142 all the way up to above moderate at 2599. More importantly really are the percentages. So once you include the projections, which is really all this table does, it says reality plus projections, if I'm reading it correctly, then we're at 29.2% of extremely low was produced up through 2022. 39.6% produced up through 2022. Very low. I looked back at the numbers that were reported in the last RENA that I believe was made available to the public, and the raw numbers was what I made a note of here, and this is what gives me pause. So as of the last concrete numbers that we had in the very low category, from 2014 through 2019, 15 units were produced. So that's not a percentage, but 15 out of what was expected to be needed of 193. So I didn't do the math to know what 15 out of that's, you know, 6, 7, 8%, something like that. So I'm concerned, I guess I would say, maybe confused at least, by how we got from that actual number, adding in then projections that get us from a single digit percentage of what was produced, to a percentage that actually looks kind of healthy in the community I don't think would recognize of nearly 40% of the need having been met. Likewise in low, last numbers I saw as of 2019, we had produced 9 units out of a projected need of 114. Again, low single digits of what was actually produced. And now we're saying that somehow we got to 17.7 percent. So I understand that there's a lot of data behind this, and I'm not really questioning that, but we're not seeing it here to really know if we're expecting, if we're making our decisions for the next, for the phase 6, for the 6th version of this, based on what we now think we accomplished, which looks a whole lot better than it did the last report that we had, then we start, I feel, to get into an area where I'm not sure that the commission and I as a commissioner, more importantly perhaps the public, can have really concrete faith that we're really actually going to get there in these numbers. So my simplest question is, how solid are these projections that suddenly make those low and very low numbers look way better than they did a little while ago? Okay, I can answer that. So the way they are counted for HCD is if you pull a building permit. So it's not necessarily a complete unit, a CFO, but it's a building permit that's been pulled. So as I mentioned, there have been these disaster tax credit rounds, 2020, 2021. So quite a number of units, they have already pulled building permits. And we know, and then the projected beginning of this year, 2022, we know that they are, well actually by now they have pulled their permits. So at the time of this writing, we knew that they were going to pull them in this first six months of the year. So that's where it is. It's not actual units completed. It's building permits. Although you're accurate about 2019 to now, but this is reason for optimism more than anything. These units, these building permits have been pulled, and these projects are being built. They're moving forward at breakneck speed southwest area like I've never seen before in this community. But they won't get counted in the building permits. Those that are pulling building permits do count in this housing cycle. The one we're in right now. Okay, so they count as being pulled, but they don't count as being constructed. They count as being produced. Is that correct? Yes, so toward our RHNA number, they count toward our RHNA number. So all of these that have pulled a building permit by June of this year, that counts toward our fifth cycle. Whether they've been constructed or not? So I think that's kind of Rich's point is lots of people pull building permits. We had a rush of building permits being pulled to beat the code cycle. Some of those people aren't going to build for years, but they just want to beat the code cycle to a certain extent. You have to start to build by a certain time. So how do we know? It's like we need a couple more columns. What the RHNA number is, the number of building permits that have been pulled, and what has actually started construction and broke ground. Because then that would help us, you know, look at the goals and say, are these goals adequate enough to actually produce these units? And if they're not, then we've got to go back and say, okay, these people aren't building like we had anticipated. Granted, I get that the RHNA numbers are, they don't care if you construct or not. It's just if the building permit has been pulled. Well, in addition to that, in our annual, so we do have an annual report that's required. And in that, actually, there's a lot more that's required. It's when was that development entitled? When did it apply for entitlements? When did it get its entitlements? Did it pull a building permit and when? And then CFOs. So it's not reported in any of this, but it's definitely reported to the state and it's available through their portal. And I would add that these aren't folks pulling permits to get in within a building cycle. They're pulling permits and then they're hitting the ground and moving forward with construction. It's happening right now . Yeah, just to add to you, to provide a little information on the affordable low-income units, it is extremely rare that they would pull permit and not be built because they are required by their funding sources and they're often heavily subsidized to complete their construction. Otherwise, they lose all their funding. They lose their ability to compete in future funding rounds. So I think you can be pretty confident that if a low-income affordable unit pulls a permit, it's going to get built. Yeah, I appreciate that very much and I appreciate the explanation about the, you know, that this is based on permits being pulled and intimately aware of what's in the pipeline right now, what's under construction right now, and what's being planned in the way of actual low income affordable housing where it involves Section 8, etc. I think we're coming at this from a slightly different perspective. History would suggest that we should have a lot of confidence in the fact that over 200% of our moderate and above moderate housing is going to get built. It always has been. I don't have any reason to doubt that people will continue to do that unless you know, unless the climate changes a bit. History would also, though, suggest that we really, really struggle cycle to cycle with maintaining any kind of momentum when it comes to low-income housing. So, I think where we might be coming at this a little bit differently is I don't have much concern about whether we might hit more than 100% of the target for, you know, moderate or certainly not above moderate housing. Just look at the numbers. Historically, when you look at the numbers for low and extremely low, we've failed miserably at that when you talk about hitting single-digit percentages of what the arena target has been. So, that's the reason I'm pushing a little bit on that is that I hear you on the permits and I know what's going on right now. We're looking at eight years worth of needing to address critical need in the community and I think the community needs to trust that this element, you know, is going to continue to push on that momentum and make it actually happen. And I don't, again, I'm not worried too much about the above-moderate housing actually getting built. But I am very concerned about hitting these numbers and continuing to hit the numbers that it looks like we're making some incremental improvements on. So that's why I wanted to drill in on that a little bit is that I kind of want to reflect the community concern out there is we're, you know, we need to maybe do a better job of educating them of what's going on right now, what is actually happening and what's about to be made available and what's, you know, coming in the future. But, you know, I think the, well, I've said enough on that. I think it's a concern. And I want this to reflect that as much as possible to give some assurance that we're going to address that concern. What would happen if we hit all of the RHNA numbers? Do we have to do a seventh cycle? I'm sure we do. I just have another question. Just for a little context, it's, I'm not aware, we've worked on a number of housing elements and I'm not aware of any community that's actually hit its RHNA numbers. It is challenging given the cost of the housing and the funding that's available. I can say that the city of Chico has made more progress than any of the other housing elements that we've worked on. We've worked across the North State on housing elements. So it's challenging but particularly I think when you look at this recent two years and what's in the pipeline, it's actually quite unique and extraordinary what Chico is producing compared to other communities and what's been done in the past. And again, as Marie was alluding to, a lot of that ties to the money, the funding that's made available. Of course, there's a huge need because of the campfire but there's also been resources made available because of the fires. And that's where you're seeing that connection between the recent construction of pulling permits and also we haven't talked about what's in the pipeline very much but we had looked into this and working with Marie that there are 1,347 extremely low and very low income units currently in the pipeline to be developed between 2023 and 2025. So that I think is unprecedented at least in recent history. In Chico, the 1,347 units are currently in development stages. You were part of the departments behind Torrey Shelter, correct? Were you part of that one there? How hard was that and how long did it take to build 20, how many units are there? That's the Valleyview apartment complex and actually James was at the front end when we still had RDA. That was supposed to be funded with RDA and then it went away. It just missed the cutoff. So that actually well, that began six years I think. It took about six years to get those units from start to finish. Just showing the and I think that's what I'm I guess I'm sure it's not easy to do this. It's very hard, very difficult and I've seen that first hand and so I just I think that maybe it's just, it's a nightmare. The state does not make it easy. I looked into I was like, why don't we do this and we'll have, you have to have so many ducks in a row and it's just, so it's a big nightmare. So the city can't force people to build and build it, right? And that's really where we're No, the city's not in you know, the business to build homes, but the city is the steward and the one that can help guide people, you know, they can lead them to water, right? But then that's kind of where this ends. So we have our sites inventory and we have these goals, but then who actually you know, besides the once a year check-in, is there a steering committee with, you know, industry professionals that actually help move this along and look for those resources to, you know, meet these goals? How does this get implemented? So that's part of the housing division's responsibility is implementing the housing element goals. So basically we're looking at, that's partly why we have to make it realistic too. We're looking at the projections of financing that's going to be available. We're going to look at and basically like one of the actions is, you know, we look at the funding every year that we have available. I got to tell you that since RDA has gone away, it has been extremely difficult with the exception of these last couple of years due unfortunately to the campfire. And so it's something that we have to track and that's what we do. So if we see, like for instance, we knew that we needed senior housing. The Creekside Place apartments across from Marsh Junior High were, that was pre-campfire. That was something that, you know, we worked with the developer to say, okay, look, we have this need, we need seniors. Where is the land going to come from? The city had land that we could rezone. We made that happen and obviously worked with the developer to obtain additional financing needed. And then they did get to benefit from the disaster credits, which that round of funding allowed for less rigorous requirements and constraints and so that facilitated even quicker development. Typically, yeah, these things take three to five years on a normal cycle. These disaster credits definitely sped up. You guys definitely have your work cut out for you and I, with the RDA, it's unfortunate that that went away. One of my questions was what other programs have come to the surface to kind of replace that? Because I was able to buy my first house with that. So it's unfortunate but that's kind of where we have to be creative to solve these gaps. And can't, you know, Marie can't do everything. Well, I think I'd love to hear from the public, so if we could, but I would really like to encourage us, and I think James kind of hit on this perfectly of what I see our role is, and this is not definitive, I'm just, my personal opinion, what I see our role is as the Planning Commission and as city government is, are we creating the conditions that aren't restraining us from hitting these RHNA goals? So there's a lot of factors and a lot of things that are going to impact whether we hit these goals, but what we can control is are we creating the conditions to allow that? Does this document go far enough to create the conditions? You know, we, I think we use words like encourage and promote and increase. And those are words that I think are, look like we've done in the past. Do we as a body and do we as a community think that goes far enough? And if it doesn't, then that's where I think we have, we give direction to city staff and to the consultants of maybe we think we can leverage this. I think we have an amazing city staff who have been very proactive within the policies that we already have to get units. And I would venture to say that jump from 2019 to 2022 on those pulling of those building permits are because of Mike Sully and Brendan Veague and the way that they have made our policies accessible to people who are building low income housing. So I guess in the comments I've got a couple of questions. I'd like to hear in what we're doing, are we really, do we meet the conditions? Are we creating those or do we need to go further? And I think that's what would be really helpful for the city council to know. Because ultimately it's going to be their decision on our recommendations. If I may respond to that, it is not because of staff. It's because of the money that came down from the state that made it available. And a whole bunch of affordable housing projects. We're looking at this side over here, we're looking at that side over there. And staff, what we do is we get out of the way. We get out of the way. The planning commission doesn't see a lot of these projects because they go through the architecture review board. That's the only review most of them need. But you see in our staff reports, we recommend approval. We try our best to get out of the way so they can use that funding to build the projects. We provide the land zone properly and we try to get out of the way when they show up with money. But it's the state's money coming down that really spurred all of the money. So we're looking at all this development that kind of caught us up a bit. Okay, so I have a policy that I don't argue with city staff and planning commission meetings. But I know personally that there is a project that you very much got out of the way and helped to facilitate within the boundaries of city. But that's you, Mike. That's not funding. Mike's not good at compliments. No, he's not. But I'll take it and say thank you. I will also say it's been an all hands on deck for every department. From housing to public works, you know, the tree, urban forest, everybody's working these projects and doing everything we can to make them succeed because they have incredible timelines and time frames. Well, and to get them in front of us, and I think that's the thing. You guys are working over time to get these projects in front of us, to get them in front of the ARHPB, to get them in front of the city council. That's the getting out of the way. I don't know many city planners and cities that would put in the hours that you guys do to make sure that we see the projects so that they can get in the pipeline. So that's it. All right. Brendan, do I have any legal requirements on this public hearing as far as time? I think it's your prerogative as the chair. Okay. But you have your own standard practices. I'm not sure what you do. I'd say, commission, we typically allow three minutes. I'm wondering what the nature of this if we allow five minutes. And if there are any comments that anybody isn't able to give in five minutes, this is a public hearing on a public process that is continuing. So this is an opportunity for you to share your comments that staff are going to have in the ultimate document. As Brendan mentioned, the review period continues after this hearing. So if you do have comments that are longer than five minutes, I would recommend that you jot them down and send them in and they can be included. Does that work for you guys? Well, my one question with that is, although the public can continue providing comments, isn't this kind of like our opportunity to direct staff and then it just goes to council after that and there wouldn't be really any meaningful opportunity to change something from the public after that, right? Even if they submit a comment directly to staff. Is that the case? I think the comments that are received by council, they'll have the same ability to direct changes that they feel are appropriate. Okay. That's a good clarification. Thank you. Five minutes. We're good on five minutes. Okay. Nicole, do you have any speaker cards? I have two. Okay. If you don't have a speaker card and you'd like to speak, if you could bring those down to Nicole. Nicole, who is our first speaker? Our first speaker is Addison Winslow. And next, is Katie Toma. Okay. Thank you. And then do we have a timer going or should I keep a timer? I got a timer. Okay. Great. Thank you. Hi. I could definitely spend a lot more than five minutes talking about this. There's a lot of issues here. I'll have to skip my profuse thank yous to Mike and Marie for guiding me in some of this. And then just very briefly that I'm here on behalf of Rymel Council. We are a long time environmental organization that probably most of you are familiar with. And the mission is to protect the land, air, and water of Chico. We understand that to mean to allow people to live rich and fulfilling lives without, with minimal impact to the physical environment. And that has a lot of crossover with these concerns here. Fair housing, allowing people to live in walkable environments in particular, where they don't rely on automobiles. Especially in a similar way, the state recognizes that density is a proxy for affordability. Density also has these spillover benefits of there being more of a market share for commercial neighborhood retail that people can walk to. It allows the city to have better finances. It can support public goods that everybody can benefit from. Yeah, so we'll start with the concept of governmental constraints and this idea of if we don't have the money then how are we going to get low income housing? And I think at a certain point, we do have to understand that density as a proxy is the best that we can do. But the city also can do a lot better than that. And one of the constraints I don't feel was properly analyzed, and in my experience, it's pretty much absent from the community memory, is that in the recent past, somewhat recent past, Chico allowed much more dense housing in our central areas. If you look at a map from 1985, zoning, you can see that besides that little area north of Bidwell Park that's always been very prestigious and very exclusive, everything west of the 99 in Chico was either medium density, medium high density, or high density. And we have areas like the Barber neighborhood that were medium high density before the 1990s that are now low density. You can see about everything off Park Avenue being excluded from new apartment growth. Myself and many people that I know, we live in that era of development. This is the affordable housing that Chico has naturally, is in these neighborhoods where it incrementally developed. Throughout the neighborhoods, you saw conversions of single family houses into multiple units, you saw small apartment buildings and that, as it's aged, has become affordable and that's where a lot of the working class of Chico lives today. But that is, in this housing, in past housing elements, my best guess is in the 1990 general plan it happened that that incremental growth was suppressed. So since then, we've tried to orient development and the 2011 general plan, the current one, made great strides towards encouraging more high density development in Chico. However, that the way that development was set up is primarily through the corridor opportunity site overlay and we're looking at redeveloping underutilized transportation corridors. What that turned out to be is we put the areas that are underutilized because there is environmental problems with them. North Esplanade compared to Esplanade between the Lindo Channel and downtown is a great example. There's limited accessibility around it on the east side of Butts up to the 99 and so it's no coincidence you have a high segregation poverty area there and that's where we allow high density development. We do not allow high density development in the area with the nice street trees that everybody loves, the world class boulevard. And when a developer is going to consider investing millions of dollars into a piece of land, they definitely prefer to have a higher opportunity area with more public benefits around. And that's one of the areas that Chico has very much failed to act is we incentivize development in the areas that are lower opportunity just by virtue of this. And this is before we had a mandate on all public agencies to affirmatively further fair housing. And I think now that we do and now that we've seen for 11 years since the general plan was passed, very lackluster results in these corridor opportunity sites, I think it's time to reassess that. If I'm not mistaken, the most development that's occurred in corridor opportunity sites on Walnut Street. Walnut Street was not originally included in a corridor opportunity site. It was a rezone there. And all this development has occurred along the railroad tracks primarily. And that's where Chico has historically since the 1970s seen the majority of our high density development. This is the opposite of fair housing where you have an area, because it's next to the railroad track that is not desirable for other uses, it becomes high density housing. And you see a really similar thing for example at the Oak Valley subdivision. The city council made a call to require them to condense the development in that to not have more impact on the view shed higher up in the foothills. And what the developer opted to do, given the option, was to put high density housing along the highway. And so we have a lot of these affordable housing projects which we're getting by virtue of this very unprecedented downpouring of disaster relief subsidies in the lower opportunities areas, like exposed to more noise pollution, exposed to more is that five minutes already? Jesus Christ, yeah, there's no way. Could I, um, could you give us maybe something concrete that you would like to see, a goal or an objective or some wording where you see that the densities would be addressed that's not in here? Well, given that we're talking about one thing here, and there are several other things for the corridor opportunity sites overlay, I think we ought to extend it to all areas on transit corridors. In particular, along with the state guidelines for high quality transit, it's been a half mile of a transit stop. We could at least say a quarter mile is an area where we can incentivize higher density development, but extend that to all the areas like 8th and 9th Street and the Esplanade that are excluded from the corridor opportunity site program. Did you author this letter that we have in front of us? Yes. The one from Viet Nguyen Council. Yes, okay. Are the rest of your comments captured in here? No, no, I'll have them done by the time the City Council comes out, but there's a lot going on in here. There are a lot of constraints to development that aren't addressed. There's a lot of issues with the firm really furthering fair housing. There are a lot of new state laws that are difficult to interpret. And so there's certainly large questions that aren't addressed. I tried to condense that actually, as much as I could, hoping that last minute you all would read it before the meeting so that you'd be aware of some of these things rather than counting us to explain them in five minutes. Thank you. Okay. Next is Katie Thomas and Elizabeth Devereaux is next. Welcome. Got the timer going, I'm sure. So, good evening. I'm Katie Thomas and I'm the Executive Director of the Chico Builders Association. And I had prepared two sets of words for one minute and for three minutes because I thought this place would be jam-packed full of folks tonight giving their input to you. I just want to start off by saying is sitting in the audience this evening your questions that you've posed to staff and to the consultant are extremely thoughtful and those were some of the same questions that I had so I, or we had so I won't get into that too much. But I did send a letter this afternoon on behalf of the Chico Builders and you, it was late this afternoon so you probably just received it. I don't know if you've had an opportunity to read it or not, but I'm just going to kind of give you the high points of it. But first off, we do want to thank staff and the consultant. We know that this is a huge undertaking getting this through. And we do understand that this is a state mandate and one of the questions, one of the comments you made, Lindsay, is this just a check the box thing or is this really a document that we're going to take seriously and we're going to implement it and we're really going to try to hit those goals. So thank you for making that comment. So reading through the housing element, which is very long and very arduous in some of it, but we noticed that there were significant references to housing for very low and low income households, but found it very interesting in the report a figure 30 of the arena allocation for 2022 through 2030 shows the greatest number of units allocated were for moderate and above moderate income households, but there's no mention of how that would be. And there are no strategies, which is something you've already talked about, noted to meet this allocation. Also the need will be higher as it comes to And also because there's some development that's going on in the city. For one, medical center is developing their cancer center. They're expecting to bring in 100 new people into Chico that will require either moderate or above moderate housing that I don't believe was taken into consideration. And one thing I wanted to add, we just went through the development impact fee increase with the school district, and the numbers that they're using and you're using don't match up at all. They see an extreme, they see a decline. So I thought that was kind of interesting. Also the housing element doesn't address housing market conditions. So with the business and developers, so the folks that are going to build these units are faced with many challenges including conforming to state regulations. And Lindsay, you know all about that. And Paul, the ongoing increase in impact and user fees, high material costs, and the lack of labor. So we're talking about private developers, those that won't be likely doing the low income because they can't afford to do it. So one of the, we did a calculation, and for a multi-family unit to be built, that in order for it to pencil out, that it has, you have to charge at least $1,000 a month in rent. And the only one that can afford that is the moderate or over, can afford that type of rent. So it makes it very difficult to build because for low and very low, because of the cost of building. The report again doesn't address any strategy. And unlocking the local housing market. And when I talk about unlocking the housing market, generally how it works is you move into maybe a low cost type of apartment, and then maybe you move into a high cost type of apartment. And then you move into a higher level apartment as you're moving along in your income. So you free up that spot. And then you move into, you're able to purchase a low income, you know, a low end home. And then once, you know, you get, you start moving along, and then you're going to move into your forever home. So as you're moving along, you're behind you, you're leaving vacancies, and people can get in on that stream as well. But because of the way the market conditions are, we're told that you're going to have to totally stalled. Folks who thought their very first home was going to be their starter home has now become their forever home because they can't afford to move into a bigger home, maybe with more space. So we need strategies. How do we unlock that? To free up some of those lower rents, or those less expensive homes. And so I guess that's pretty much all I wanted to discuss. But it would be nice if we could have more input, or more time for input. I know that you've gone back and forth with HCD. It took them a while when you did your peer review, is that what you called it, when you sent it back. So I agree with you that that's not a lot of time. I think that's a great indication by the fact that there are not a lot of people here tonight. Giving you input on that is, it's a complicated document. And if you're not a sophisticated person in this arena, it takes a lot. And it can be very intimidating. So I just want to thank you again for the comments and the sensitivity to that that I'm hearing from the commissioners tonight. Thank you. Thank you. I think we had Elizabeth and then Susan. Okay. Good evening. Good evening. I'm Elizabeth Devereaux, architectural glass artist and very involved in Smart Growth Advocates. So, I think one of the things that was really interesting for me was to read the House Sacramento, which gave input to the document. And the last thing they say is recommendation number two, infill housing as a climate policy. We strongly support the city's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We recommend adopting policies and program actions that facilitate housing which reduces per capita greenhouse gas emissions. As Susan said, we also recommend especially those from transportation. In particular, we recommend a policy which supports the inclusion of infill housing throughout the city as a means of facilitating a lower carbon lifestyle for all residents. And that's pretty much what Smart Growth Advocates is about too, is building in such a way to create what Addison was talking about in terms of, I mean, and this is nothing new, I mean, this is done all over the world, where mixed-use housing and wide sidewalks, walkability, and public transit is available to people so that they don't have to get into cars and have carbon emissions. That's really the future it is also the past. I think we don't have to look too far to see where it was done before successfully. And I think the other thing that occurs to me is as we look into the future, you know, there's a lot of millennials and Gen X, they don't necessarily want two, three bedroom houses and they, I have heard that they actually prefer to have low-money homes and low-mortgage. And where they can have a simpler way of life, they can run into their friends on the sidewalk, or going to sidewalk cafes, whatever. And I think, you know, with public transit, especially small electric buses, we can actually do without having a car. I mean, a lot of the big metropolitan cities are considering those things using Uber and other means of transporting people than everybody having a car. And so, I think we need to start really looking into the future. What are the needs of the next generations who actually cannot afford what we have thought of as the American dream? I mean, they don't even want it, a lot of them. I'm not saying everybody, but I'm saying we don't in Chico have the alternative of mixed-use housing, wide sidewalks, walkability, public transit. We don't have that. And we did put it, a group of us in our general plan in 94, actually put it into the plan. It was in there until 2011, and then it was split up a bit, but there's still good elements from 2011 in that. But it needs to be put back in, and opportunity sites need to be focused on before we do, you know, large special planning areas. Because that's where this kind of low carbon emissions can take place. So I say let's look towards infill, let's look towards opportunity sites before we go into you know, large housing and urban sprawl. Thank you. Elizabeth, before you leave, quick question for you. As an advocate for smart growth, part of what you were just describing, especially right there at the end, having to do with opportunity overlay zoning, this concept of applying that, and this would be perhaps a specific change or addition or adjustment in the housing element, to apply those to existing transit corridors, I think Addison may have mentioned this too, is that something that you would advocate as an actual change in the element that might begin to address at least part of what you're talking about? You know, I have to tell you, 300 pages is a lot, and I didn't get to read all of that. I know certain aspects of it, but you would know better than I. Well, I'm just being conceptually, so that if you take the concept of smart growth, which you know better than I do, and you, in the housing element, we've got this opportunity for opportunity overlays, where and if you, right now they're only in certain areas in Chico. Right. If you, if the housing element have the goal of applying those overlays to every existing transit corridor and future transit corridors, which you all hope for, is that something that aligns with smart growth? Absolutely. But also, places like Park Avenue that have totally underutilized spaces would be easy to develop, and are very close to downtown. I think when we were on our general plan in 94, we drew a circle around the downtown. And those places that were closest to downtown and required the least amount of carbon emissions, or driving, were the ones that were selected to develop. And it hasn't happened. It's 27 or 28 years, so I hope it happens before I'm out of the picture. Thank you. Thank you. And Susan, our last speaker. Good evening. My name is Susan Trudy. I am also a part of Smart Growth Advocates. I co-host Dicotopia on KZFR and convene the Environmental Coalition of Butte County, so environmental concerns are among my top concerns. I think I have three comments. You know, sometimes they grow. But my first comment is that I was, during the process of the development of the housing element, I was disappointed in the community involvement in the housing element. The questions that we were asked were pretty restrictive or restricted. And there wasn't much of an opportunity to talk about what is your vision for Chico? What do you see this community looking like and being like? And I feel like we need to be more visionary in our thinking about what do we want our community to be. My second comment is about that vision, about kind of thinking in bigger terms about the housing element. And how we want the city to develop. I think that we should have bigger questions rather than, okay, what's on the ground? What's here right now? Where might we rezone for mixed-use development? Where might we I think Chico needs a redevelopment plan, a big picture about where there are underutilized places, where there are places where we could do mixed-use development that are deteriorating or no longer used. So my second point is I think we need to have a bigger picture about what's possible and not be restricted by what we see right now. And then my third point is, and this is typical of a bureaucracy and I don't know that there's anything that you can do about it, but I really see a need for thinking about the elements in terms of each other. And so I think we need to think about the climate action plan in terms of the housing element. And now we're in the process of developing the environmental justice element, which is going to be a huge part of shaping the city. It totally has to interact with the housing element. Right now there's an existing conditions report that's out from the environmental justice element in process. And that tells you a lot of the same things that the housing element does that we need to think about when we're talking about very poor people. Where we're going to stick them. Where they're going to have to be. Where it's healthy and unhealthy in Chico. Where the parks are. And so I will finish with my plea to have a bigger vision that looks at bigger questions and looks at the elements of housing in relationship to other elements of the city. Thank you. Thank you. Any other speakers? Anybody else want to speak? Alright. With that I will close the public hearing and bring it back to the commission. Maybe as a first topic point, we did hear from a couple speakers. I know I've heard from the commission on a, some commission members on a will to continue conversations. And maybe just kind of take the temperature of the commission. How many feel like they are ready to make a recommendation tonight on approving this? I definitely want to move something forward in terms of direction on it. My, if I can, Bryce, I didn't mean to interrupt you. I'm not ready to recommend moving this to the council. I think we're hearing pretty clearly and I think it was Katie's comment about you know, that we all kind of walked in expecting that we would have a lot of people here to provide feedback and we were surprised that there weren't. And there could be lots of explanations for that. And there's no guarantee that by delaying we'll suddenly get an outpouring from the community. But it'd be nice to give them the opportunity as well as those who did put some energy into coming and talking and still didn't feel like they'd have the time to fully vet the document itself. So I, you know, I would prefer to find a way to delay forwarding this and if that's moving to do so, then I'm willing to make that motion. But if there's another mechanism to move forward, I would like to instruct staff to take the comments tonight and maybe provide another opportunity at the commission level for this discussion to continue. I'd like to see that happen. I'd like to go ahead with his three, which I tried to write down, Mr. Beggs. There's too much to write down, but I think he had some great ideas to move forward. To me, to me, there's too many factors to control here. This is a good guideline. We could, someone could pick this apart for years, I think. But I think with some of the direction that he asked us to give him and for them to review more details, I'd be ready to move forward and make a decision. But, and let the council go more and give more people some more feedback time. But I don't know if it's possible for us to have another meeting and re-review this. To follow up on what I had said, I would like to be able to make recommendations in some form, whether that's tonight or we can continue making recommendations or, you know, comments to staff. I'm just not sure if that's like allowed in the process. Maybe you or staff could help us. How much are we going to get you in trouble if we continue this meeting? Well, I would think you'd have a sound reason for why you want to extend it. So, I would not just to hear from more people because I'm not sure that that's what you'll get. The question is, are there some things that you need to think about or formulate? I mean, you have all the evening tonight to discuss ideas and suggestions. You know, as there was a conversation early on about we really need to do more to get at these reading numbers that are so hard to get at. And we're trying to share there are some limitations and it's not just the creation of words. I mean, there has to be some sound, new, innovative action that no one in California has been able to figure out. It's that challenging. And so, I guess the notion behind extending the meeting or going to another meeting would be for the purpose of and then fill in the blank. For the purpose of and I don't know who the key players are yet, but for the purpose of providing strategies to meet these goals. I don't know. We have an obligation to meet these numbers and if we're not if we go into this knowing that we're never going to hit these numbers, then we're not doing our job as commissioners. So, I don't know how to put that in words. I honestly, this is a lot of information and I can only imagine how much time you guys spent on this. And I think if it was actually streamlined and you took out some of the language and stuff and just got it down to how do we get from A to Z? And these are the avenues that we go for. I mean, just in my notes, I had a lot of identify finance, financing for developers, identify subsidies, ask for public land contributions, participate in home investment partnership programs, business backed first time home buyers program. I know I didn't like it in one of those things, but I have ideas on why it could possibly work. And I don't feel like we have the right people in the room to discuss all of these ideas. That's why I kind of said it almost needs a steering committee with these industry professionals to say this is how you reach these goals. And I'd actually like to work backwards from it. If we need a hundred low income homes or we need a hundred moderate homes, then we work back from that goal and the steps we have to take to achieve it and the avenues that we have to explore. That to me is strategy. So here's just some perspective. You had mentioned the ad hoc housing committee that the council set up following the campfire. Those people that you mentioned all got in a room over three meetings and then there was a conference held. The recommendations that came out of that were recommendations again provided some guidance and a framework those things were all pursued. They did not however result that was a lot of energy and a lot of focus a lot of people from our community from affordable housing developers to for profit and everyone in between and brokers and folks from Sacramento came up. Again, just like the housing element, it's a framework a mosaic of opportunities. There is not a clear and simple road map. It's just not possible. You don't know where the funding is going to come from. You're just not sure. And so you try to reduce, construct constraints, governmental constraints. You try to create incentivized programs and you have language that directs us to keep looking for those opportunities as they present themselves. James had shared with you previously that the state is throwing a lot more money at affordable housing. Thank goodness. It does come down to money. If there's any bright, new, brilliant idea that we haven't been able to find through research of other communities from our consultants who are looking at other communities, please provide it. But I don't know that there's going to be just this meeting where we're all going to come together and say, yep, we figured out how to work backwards and get to those points. It's just not how it's going to function. And I appreciate that very much. And I think that in my opinion, what we will have here is the thing that we work backwards from. And we then, how that will work is that this, as you just very eloquently described, will provide some framework obviously goals and strategies that will then go, will be the living document that the community and importantly the city staff will use to execute against actual projects that come forward and money that comes forward and things like that. So I believe in that process. What I'm looking for is not a magic bullet that will come out of some future meeting. I'm looking just to provide a little bit more time for both the commission and the community to have one more public hearing, one more opportunity to come back, digest, and then out of that, what I would be hoping for to speak, I think it was your point, Brendan, things like this concept of applying the opportunity overlay zones to existing transit quarters. That would be a very specific thing that could be an addition, perhaps. And that might be something that would happen at a future meeting. Tonight, I don't feel like we know what all of those possible things are, other than the three that I totally agree are completely appropriate that you started with. There may be others. I just don't feel like 21 days is enough time for us to do that. Madam Chair, I didn't mean to cut you off, but before we get into that, I think what might be helpful is if we were to look at some of the goals, policies, and actions, I think once we get into those, they're going to, really, I think we're going to harvest all your good ideas, and they will find a place and reside within these goals and policies. We didn't even talk about that, and this is what I'm hearing from everybody. It's like, we've missed it. It's in here. And if there's something in here, all the things that you've mentioned are addressed in here. So I think we can get there. And to follow up on your comment too, Commissioner Roeber, I absolutely believe if you feel, you don't have to get into a whole lot of energy or background, if you feel, you know, that and other people have brought it up, that it makes sense to, why don't we get a little bit more robust with our quarter opportunity zone or overlay program? Well, that's a fair question. I mean, and that could be the direction, and we could take a closer look at that. And I don't think there's any real doubt on the downside to heading in that direction. To what Bruce is saying, you could say add an action to take a serious look at the quarter opportunity site overlay and applying it to other areas of the city. That's direction. And that could be an action that we would probably support, we'd be able to counsel. And then, within the next year, that's done as part of other, so you don't have to define it exactly tonight and say it has to be the north of Mangrove, because that's takes time, and that takes energy, and that takes analysis. But if you give that general direction, like we had for the general plan, we tell ourselves to do things, and then it might happen in the year, it might happen in two, but the framework is there. I don't think you'd find any resistance from us to expanding the quarter opportunity site to reasonable additional reasonable locations. And that gets ferreted out through another planning process. Yep. Makes perfect sense. I totally agree. That's one example is my problem. I don't know what the other examples that I, as a commissioner, or the community, as the community has expressed, that they haven't had time to give all of the other examples, and I believe that giving one more opportunity for the commission and the community, opportunity for the community, to go through that process, and uncover what may be three others. I'm not wanting to rip this thing apart, or extend this, or make it, or go into an ad hoc, not talking about that at all. I'm just simply saying I don't think there's been enough time to uncover what others of those examples might be. We're not here to push you, and I agree. This is your journey, and it's a major document. And some of the issues that people spoke to tonight are in the general plan. They're in the land use element. They're in the transportation. It exists. Those policy frameworks and those directions about infill. But this is a very important element. It's the only one that requires us to update it on a regular basis as mandated by the state. So, if you guys need more time, you have more time. Just go ahead. We're not here to push you into a corner. Yeah, and I think I I mean, I tend to not want to take more time. I don't, I think I've pretty much been opposed to extending any conversations. But that is usually if the commission hasn't done their homework. And I think the commission has done their homework. I'm looking across there. There's sticky notes. There's highlights. And when we hear from the public, we don't have enough time from the few people that are here. I'm honestly disappointed with the turnout that we had tonight on something that is so important to our community. I think city staff and the consultants have done their job. And at this point, the community needs to do their job. And we need to hear from more people. And I hope that we create a welcome environment here. And I would love for this to be the avenue where people can do that. Where maybe sitting in a five hour long city council meeting doesn't seem as welcome. And so I guess I don't want to bank on the fact that we'll just hear from people at the city council meeting. I'd love to have, create that environment here where people could speak. So if you'd be willing to all join us again at another meeting, that would be where I would lean. Madam Chair, if we have to, we can continue to our next meeting, actually, if that works for you. And then maybe you can we can agree that there's some things that we're going to look at and expand upon in the goals, policies, and objectives, or action plans, something like that. The other thing I want to kind of remind you is, this is a general plan element. So we're trying to, we're also talking in general plan language. It is unique in the, to the extent that we are identifying action programs. But it's still, we're not going to get down to real precise detail because it is still a general plan element. And we want to have the flexibility to interpret that rightly. Well, and I think probably where I differ from everybody on my left here is I don't think I'm going to come up with any brilliance or any strategies between now and then. I just simply want to give people two more weeks to be able to, if they want to share, to share what they have. And if they don't show up, then we did our part, at least, to try. Exactly. Do you need a formal motion? I guess you could just move to continue the meeting. Right. I'll move that the Planning Commission continues this meeting to the next regularly scheduled or when staff's available to reconvene and continue this hearing. Second. Got it. So we... Am I allowed to ask a question or make a substitute? Yes. Well, first, I really like the suggestion that we provide some direction for staff to come back to us with more information, too. Can I make a friendly amendment to include that? What would you like? And we'll see if the motion maker would be okay with that. June 16th. I have June 16th. Bruce, would that work? That is correct. June 16th. Bryce, are there certain items that you'd like to come back? Well, I have a long list, so I don't know how to do that. Can I ask a procedural question? Sure. If people have a short or long list or whatever, is that something we can submit to the City staff? We would appreciate it. So we can all work individually to come up with things that can be addressed and then when we meet the next time? Absolutely. Okay. I think that's the way to do it then. We'd appreciate it. That'd be great. Just echoing what our chairperson said, I'm not sure what my list will be, if there even will be one personally. Again, mostly I'm wanting to just give everyone who needs a little more time. Can I make a friendly amendment? Just ask for One Direction. If we can include some of the city-owned land that qualifies in the site inventory, and specifically the parcels that were submitted in response to the request for information back in 2020. I think there was some good information back then and it's not included in this. Can you clarify? Because there was an effort where the City did put out a request for information. They shared city-owned properties. They are very limited, of course. Most of them are right-of-way parks, open space, creekside greenways. Right, obviously ones that are zoned correctly. Or developed. And there was a couple of sites. One, I think, is at the corner of Humboldt and Bruce. But I believe the recommendations that came in, there was no support for that. And in fact, that land in particular is called for for other uses. But I mean, we can just share with you that they exist. But what would be... Well, if they exist, then I'd like them included on the site's inventory. Well, we're fairly comfortable. The reason we didn't include it is we are comfortable that it's not land that will be available well, it's on commercial. We don't know that the City will have... It's hard because I think this is a property that is in flux. How about that's all I can say? Sure, sure. Yeah. I guess I just was expecting to see maybe some City-owned property on there and I didn't see any. Well, Marie spends a great deal of her time trying to identify City-owned land that can be utilized and provided to the development community. That's what she had mentioned, the Creekside place where we took an open space 2 area and zoned it RF4. Cut off a portion of 4.9 acres. And so those are perpetually being... Coals that are just being raked over. We have land that I don't think we included because it's going forward with a... Or maybe it was included for the Habitat for Humanity project. So there's limitations on... There is no City-owned property I guess is what I'm trying to say. We can provide a... We can share with you properties that are available but in most cases I think they're going to be zoned something for a reason that is not consistent with the development of housing. Yeah, I guess... I don't want to say... I know to your request but I'm just... I just want to see the big picture. Is there an opportunity where maybe we need to rezone something so it opens up an opportunity to build housing? It might behoove the Commission to hear some words from the professionals that know this better than me about the purpose of the site's inventory. Adding a property on it. What does that do for that property or likelihood of development of that property or anything like that? Yeah. I could comment on... Just because a site is on the site's inventory doesn't mean it's going to be developed. It's an exercise that the State requires that jurisdictions go through to demonstrate that they're making adequate land available that's appropriately zoned. And the City is required to only include land that is residentially zoned, that's appropriately zoned for residential development. So certainly if an opportunity arises where a city-owned property could be rezoned during the planning period, that could be done. Housing could be built and those units could be counted towards meeting the RHNA goal. But for the purpose of the site inventory, there are various constraints on what sites you can include and if it's not appropriately zoned or it doesn't have a... we have to show that it could feasibly be developed within the planning period. Those are some of the factors that go into why we include those parcels that we do on the site's inventory. So I think what we did quite a thorough review of various parcels and no city-owned parcels rose to the top of the list of being feasible to develop within the planning period and that are... were appropriately zoned. But again, I think as Brendan and Marie were stating, I think we're encouraging... see, the state encourages the city to constantly look for those opportunities as they become available. And then you can count those units towards... going towards the RHNA as you're reporting annually to the state. And if I could just add another key point, to the opposite, sites that aren't included on the inventory do develop with affordable housing. And so just quickly, if you go to page 243, figure 40.1, where we were doing that analysis of projects, where we're trying to get at a density where we think affordable housing can be developed, I can guarantee that the Lava Ridge, the Deer Creek, the Bruce Village Commons, and 1297 Park at a minimum, were not on our inventory to meet our affordable housing needs. But through working with, using our code, as Tony said, facilitating opportunities, and in some cases it's redevelopment, we get those units. I always try to say, don't look at the resource inventory as something that's biblical. It's just going through an exercise, an important one, albeit, but it doesn't dictate where we're going to see those units. It's built where we might not. None of them were, Brendan. All 10 of those sites were not on the previous inventory, but they all had the affordable housing projects built on them. I would love to take a vote on the motion. So, we have a motion and a second to continue this discussion until June 16th. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? If you're going to oppose it, you didn't vote. I need you to vote. Okay. So, that goes 6-1 with one absent. I'd like to give everybody on the commission some homework before we meet again. If there's somebody who is not in the room tonight that needs to be in the room, or did not submit any comments that we want some comments, even if it's a pat on the back that this is perfect, I would encourage you all to reach out to those people and make sure that they comment. The other thing, and I'd like to draw your attention to page 6 of 9 of the staff report. Those are the goals that Bruce is talking about. Some of these goals can be explore future strategies related to XXX. We're not going to be able to say, you know, explore future sites, explore city-owned sites. We can make those goals. So, I would really love to come into our meeting in two weeks and really focus on have language that is set around these goals. We're not going to solve the Chico housing crisis in two meetings, but we can start to put out some strategies of what we will explore in the years to come. So, I think this is really the tangible piece that I'd love to have the commission and the public's direction on. And how we frame up what we want the city council and city staff and the planning commission to go forward with over the next several years. That's it. Where am I at? Do you got an update for me? No. Okay, so we will see everybody Thursday, June 16th. Anybody who is in the audience who would like to come back and have another five minutes, we'll definitely look forward to seeing you there. Bruce or whoever is appropriate to do this, we all get an invitation to the June 16th the Sierra North Valley Realtors are saluting local government. I think we, as a common courtesy, should let them know that we have a meeting that night and a number of people from the city will not be able to attend that. Just so they know. I can let them know if that helps. Sure. Could we start at 7? No. Every time they've invited us Every time they invite us, we have a meeting. They never They don't want us there.
