 Yes, welcome everybody.  We called this just Marathon Part 3, but we will call it the regular Chico City Council meeting, May 2nd, and we'll call the meeting to order and start with an invocation from Pastor Keith Jarrett from Living Fort College.  Thank you for being here.  Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, thanks for having me, members of council.  Lord Almighty in heaven, I thank you for the grace of living here in this beautiful city of Chico, for working here and serving along so many of my fellows that are here today.  I ask for your grace upon this meeting.  Lord, I thank you for the governing officials that we have.  I ask for a blessing upon their decisions, and I pray that what they decide would be in fairness and equity for all.  That righteousness would be upheld.  And Lord, ultimately, I pray that your name be glorified and that the kingdom of your son, Jesus Christ, would be expanded.  Amen.  Thank you very much.  Please stand and join me in the pledge of allegiance.  What?  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.  And to the republic for which it stands.  And to the nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right, Madam Clerk, you roll, please.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  All right.  So a couple of announcements at the beginning here.  There's a little.  Usually outside your phone.  I'm thinking click off.  That's supposed to call the screen.  Just make sure it's off.  So we don't have to.  Especially you, Ms. Morgan.  All right.  We were going to opt for the two minutes for everything today just because we have had some things on our agenda that have been pushed and pushed.  And we don't want to see them pushed again.  But instead of doing that, we're just going to ask for, you know, brevity.  If you don't need to talk the whole three minutes, don't talk the whole three minutes.  We'd appreciate that.  We want to get to some of this stuff that we've had to push off.  So I'd ask council as well as the community to do that.  Just keep it brief when we need to.  So with that, we will move to a closed session announcement from City Attorney Vincent Yu.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  The City Council, City staff met in closed session regarding the listed agenda items.  No action was taken.  Direction was given.  That concludes my closed session report.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate that.  Moving on to the consent agenda.  All matters on the consent agenda are to be considered routine in nature and therefore can be enacted in one motion.  Do we have any council disqualifications or no votes?  Any speakers?  All right.  Entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Motion from Vice Mayor Rounds.  A second from Council Member Morgan.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  We'll move on to business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the council at this time.  On any matter, I'm already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes.  The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have seven.  All right.  Get rolling.  And you'll do the three minutes?  Okay.  So I'll call the first two names.  And if you could line up in the middle aisle.  Chris Daniels followed by Eric Hart.  And again, if you were called a second, just so you can line up the items.  We can move through everybody quickly.  We'd appreciate it.  Welcome.  So it's Chris Daniels first.  Hi there.  Thank you for being our council people and caring about our town.  I'm here today to talk about the condition of our downtown.  Chris, can you tell us a little bit more about the condition of our downtown?  Yes.  Can you speak up?  A little louder?  Okay.  Yes.  Thank you.  I'm here to talk about downtown and the condition thereof.  I've asked and talked to several members of the city in regard to two things that are  very concerning to me.  One is the unsightly garbage cans that are lined along the street, especially on 3rd  between Salem and Broadway.  I have counted up to 20 garbage cans.  Now at this point, it's not too bad because it's kind of cool, but here pretty shortly,  it's going to be terribly  smelly and our patrons, our customers walk by that.  So I'm just going to ask again that somehow we find a way to put in a common garbage can  for us all to use so they're not littered along the street.  The business owners do not have space to keep them in their business for a variety of reasons.  The other thing my concern is, is the city garbage cans.  They're broken.  They're falling apart.  Our downtown looks terrible.  We have been talking about this for literally years.  New garbage cans for downtown.  The other thing is the condition of our buildings downtown.  The empty vacant buildings, the broken windows, the unsightly awnings, all those things I know  fall under a city ordinance.  And I'm just asking that the city council take a look at those kinds of things and help  us get our downtown back in order so we can have a flourishing downtown and a beautiful  place to shop and bring our children.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Eric Hart, followed by Graham Hutton.  And Chris, you might want to talk to Mr. Goff's son during our break because he, we actually  did approve new garbage cans coming to downtown.  So they're on their way.  That's what I said.  You can talk to him.  Fire away.  Hello, my name is Eric Hart.  I'm a downtown property owner.  I've been downtown owning buildings since 97.  And so I've spent a lot of time down there.  I'm really concerned about the, just our condition of our boarded up buildings.  I don't think we've ever really done anything to help our town.  I think we've done a lot of things.  You know, some have been there for over a decade with open windows.  And I don't recall back in the day when it first came downtown, there were code enforcements  that were actually, actually people got cited for things like that.  And now we're looking at decades of boarded up buildings.  And I look at downtown as kind of like a giant shopping mall.  You know, if we have boarded up businesses, people aren't going to want to go down there.  So if we can maybe do something about it.  And forcing property owners to invite businesses, maybe present their storefronts in a cleaner  manner so they invite businesses instead of scaring them away.  So that's what I want to talk about.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Graham Hutton followed by George Deeds.  Mayor Coolidge and members of the council.  My name is Graham Hutton.  And I am speaking on behalf of a number of property owners of apartments in the Depot  Park area.  I personally own the loft apartments with 24 bedrooms, only a half block from Depot  Park.  As property owners, we have had many complaints from tenants who do not feel safe living in  the immediate area of the park.  Garbage, feces, foul odors, drug paraphernalia are daily facts of life.  Also, I'm not a fan of the  many stabbings and break-ins.  If tenants were not encumbered by leases, I am sure most would move away.  Plenty of potential renters are frankly horrified by what they see and look elsewhere to rent.  Parks are supposed to be places of relaxation and enjoyment.  Depot Park is not.  I use the term park loosely only because it's on the sign.  Parks are supposed to be—sorry.  I'm sorry.  There are many student apartments in that area, and those not rented by summer or before  will likely be vacant all year because of the proximity of Depot Park.  Some property owners have had to reduce their rents by half just in order to rent their  apartments.  Landlords have mortgages, insurance taxes, and other expenses.  We implore you to make Depot Park your biggest priority for the next cleanup.  Time is of the essence for the rental market.  We are committed to providing housing to students who want to call Chico home.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  George Deeds, followed by Don Walker.  Hello.  I want to thank you on behalf of the California Advocates for Severely Mentally Ill.  You know, that letter didn't get in there in time, but that's okay.  It passed 11-0, SB 43.  There was 28 opposite votes.  I was in the opposition in 340 for it.  It was quite the experience to go there and be around those advocates, and it was really  good knowing that I came from a town that was just backing it all up.  You know, it's just beautiful.  A lot of you have been working on this mental health issue.  I want to thank you again for the families that I represent, the families that I'm going  to represent, because I'm still going to try to get everybody together on one page.  And thank you for clearing up the camps.  Have a good day, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Don Walker, followed by Margaret Zwick.  Don Walker, and we own the property, 1019-21, 1021 West 5th Street, right across from Depot  Park.  And Graham has said just about everything I was going to say.  The only thing I would add right now is I know Depot Park and the next one's up for  clean out.  And I would encourage Depot Park, as it's right next to the college.  We have parents coming there.  We have a hard time right now at our units because of the look of the park.  Our tenants complain of, well, they're afraid of the stabbings that have happened there.  And also, there's constant yelling at night and stuff.  And so with that, I would encourage you to look at Depot Park.  Go by and look at it for yourself and let me just help take care of things.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Margaret Zwick.  Margaret Zwick is our last speaker.  Good evening, Council and Chief.  With all the fixable problems in Chico, our roads, our deteriorating downtown, our unfunded  pension liability, under your leadership, we have instead invested in military equipment  with state-of-the-art, high-tech military technology.  We have invested in the  tactical gear.  None of that old 1033 program equipment, those hand-me-downs from the feds.  Now Chico has new tactical military-type gear, such as armored personnel carrier, submachine  guns, drones.  The list is long.  But for what purpose?  Who is the enemy?  Where are you going with this?  What is your vision for our city?  What is your vision for our city?  Unfortunately, our Council voted to accept the military equipment policy before a community  engagement meeting was even held.  That timing overruled the democratic process and the intention of AB 481.  The Council voted before the public had the opportunity to participate in a community  conversation.  And, thereby, citizen input. Again and again we remind you, Chico residents are not your enemy.  great  great  great ! ! ! ! !  fo !  active leaders in the tragic arms race taking place in our country. Your vote  for more military equipment on the streets of Chico only intensifies the  armed race at the local level. I fear that our Council took the path of least  resistance, the easy path to the continued detriment of our city. Thank  you. We do have one additional speaker. Carlton Lowen is actually our last one.  Hi, I'm Carlton Lowen and I've been involved with the downtown area as a  commercial broker and owner and a lot of committees over the years to for the  downtown area and I am personally worried as are many commercial  brokers and commercial brokers in the area that we're not able to get the  workers and land or property owners downtown. Some of the things that we  know for sure would be that retail has changed forever. Tenant categories for  landlords are dwindling. Student enrollment is down and tenants looking  for Chico space or families doing the college tour with their children are  are seeing way too many buildings boarded up.  Again, other than retail and just where the world is today,  there's many things that can be done that are achievable.  To Eric's point, what we have is probably close to 400,000 square feet  of retail space downtown.  It's a mall.  And you need to take a look at the competition for downtown.  And when North Valley Plaza was involved and Chico Mall and so forth,  we had all these meetings on, geez, this is competition.  Now, Dan's done a fine job at Merriam Park, and that's competition.  And you have different type of buyers.  And so everything has changed, and the city needs to take a look at that.  You just can't take downtown for granted.  And we have all the boxes are checked for being right next to the university  and so forth.  So one of the things that I would be willing to get involved in is to rally  the real estate brokerage community and the ones that are actively involved  downtown and have them come up with a single message marketing plan for  downtown.  And so when we market and promote downtown,  it's in all of the Chico State brochures for families coming to town to look  at it.  And people driving through on their own,  they drive through,  they drive through the town before they call a real estate broker about space.  So we need to put on our best suit and make the place look pretty,  and it really is achievable.  So thank you.  Thank you.  That's it.  All right.  Thank you very much.  We'll move on to item 4.1, hearing on resolution planning.  Mr. Mayor, before we do that,  may I ask the city manager a question related to the topics that were raised  in the business from the floor?  Sure.  We typically try to hold that over for the discussion item,  but go ahead if you have something to put.  I know that there have been,  you and the city attorney have done some work on revising the code related to  blighted buildings downtown and to the extent that you can talk about it,  can you describe for the people who were concerned about that where we are?  Yeah, well, first of all,  share the concern about some of the buildings downtown,  some of the buildings that were described and in some cases have been in a,  let's say an out of compliance state for some period of time,  years in some cases.  So yes, we recognize that the code,  particularly our nuisance code,  was in very serious need of an update.  It hasn't been structurally updated.  I didn't even try to figure out how long,  but it's very clearly deficient.  So we are working on some pretty comprehensive,  overhaul and we expect to have that too,  not next month, the following month.  And that will give code enforcement a lot more ability to have  some encouragement to get some of the corrections that we see done.  That doesn't change the economics, unfortunately,  of owning a downtown building,  which many folks have pointed out is challenging these days.  Thank you.  All right.  So come on then.  We've talked enough about code enforcement.  You might as well have an expert,  but this is a hearing on resolution,  declaring weeds, rubbish, refuse,  and the release of public nuisance,  ordering abatement and removal,  setting a deadline for abatement and providing assessment for the cost of abatement.  Before you start, Ms. Turkin,  I just want to tell the audience too,  is this is almost like an amphitheater for us, for you.  So if you're talking,  we hear you talking because obviously it's set up so you can hear us talking,  but we also get the feedback as well.  So,  just if we could have respect for those speaking,  we'd appreciate that.  So fire away.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor and Council members.  As you recall, on April 18th,  the Council adopted a resolution which declares weeds and rubbish  to be a public nuisance that must be abated  as part of the city's annual weed abatement program.  After the April meeting,  a notice regarding tonight's hearing was mailed to the owners  on the parcels listed on exhibit A of your staff report.  Tonight, staff recommends adoption of the resolution before you,  which overrules any objections.  To the previously adopted resolution,  establishes June 1st, 2023 as the last day for voluntary abatement,  direct staff to ensure the abatement of any items that are not voluntarily removed,  and to provide council with a report of the costs that are to be recovered  from any property owners that did not comply at the June 5th City Council meeting.  And I'm here for any questions that you might have about this annual program.  All right, questions?  Thank you.  No speakers to entertain motion.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Tandon,  second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right, I have a report going to hearing to review  and approve the 2023-2024 annual action  for the use of federal community development block grants,  EDG.  Almost got it right.  And home investment, partnership grant, home funds,  including proposed funding for public funding.  And we have Ms. Simmers.  Welcome.  Good evening, mayor, vice mayor, and Council members.  This is the final public hearing for the 2023-2024 HUD Annual Action Plan  for the use of federal community development block grant funds, CDBG, and home funds, including  a review of the public services  funding recommendations as directed during the first public hearing held on April 4th.  As a recap, HUD funds must be used to benefit low-income households and neighborhoods for  activities that meet the goals of the 2020-2024 HUD Consolidated Plan.  These are affordable housing, homelessness prevention, homeless services, neighborhood  revitalization, and economic development. This plan allocates approximately $1.4 million in each  CDBG and home dollars to address these goals. The draft plan was presented at Council's April 4th  meeting, included the Citizen Advisory Committee's recommendations for funding for public service  requests. The requests were for 233 percent  of the city's housing and neighborhood revitalization and economic development.  The advisory committee recommendations are to fund six agencies as follows.  This was the matrix that was provided on April 4th and in the draft plan,  which Council did have some concerns over and requested some information on the  recommendation process. So per the approved  administrative policy and procedure, staff proceeded and utilized Council's Finance  Committee-appointed Citizens Advisory Committee to review, rate, rank applications, and to make  recommendations to the Council. Council may accept the recommendations or consider other options.  A few options include removing funding from one organization to then give it to another,  dropping slightly below our minimum grant of $20,000, and award funding to an additional  agency. Here's a chart of what that latter would look like funding seven agencies.  Okay, let's see. So at the conclusion of tonight's public hearing, the Community Development Director  recommends reviewing the, actually I would say before the public hearing, reviewing the 2023  recommendation process, consider revising public service funding recommendations,  or revising the 2020 recommendation process, and consider revising the 2020 recommendation process.  And then hold the public hearing and approve the annual action plan to be submitted with any revisions to HUD.  This concludes my report, and I'm happy to answer any questions.  All right, questions?  Thank you.  First of all, I owe an apology to Mary Jo, because I was rude to her when she came and made this presentation last time.  For those of you that can't see, Mary's smiling. I guess this is a good moment.  I get it. And that was born out of my frustration of this process.  It had nothing to do with Mary Jo or the report.  The process being, and I forget the exact timing, but two years ago, we changed that committee.  This time, we heard from some of the people that didn't get funding that were frustrated by that.  They didn't think it was necessarily fair.  I talked to a couple members of the committee that said they didn't think the process was actually wonderful or fair,  but they also said staff was working.  They were working on it getting better, and that it was getting better, and it would continue to get better.  So short of this council sitting up here and dividing the pie,  and I'm sure would have just as many people unhappy with anything that we did versus what the committee did,  I'm not going to make a recommendation yet.  I'm just going to caution.  I'm really talking to myself.  Be careful when you criticize before you have all the facts, which I didn't.  I learned more about it.  It's still a frustrating process.  It must be frustrating.  It's frustrating for both of you.  I'd like to see it get better.  I don't know exactly how to do that.  And if the finance committee can help, we will.  And if the finance committee just gets in the way, I'm sure you'll let us know.  So those were my opening comments.  And this was born out of frustration, I think, of a few of us that were disappointed that the city's greatest partner in battling homelessness received nothing.  And depending on how the committee goes and how things are followed, that can happen.  It cannot happen.  It doesn't.  It doesn't mean that there was anything malicious.  But that's where I think some of the frustration started.  I think there are a couple of issues here.  One is the process, which strikes me as, given the amount of money, as overly cumbersome.  And the second is how the money is allocated.  So I think in interest of getting through this meeting in a reasonable period of time,  I think we should accept one.  One or the other of the recommendations.  And then deal with the process at some future time.  And I'd like to make a motion to accept the alternative.  We have to have public comment.  Well, we have to consider revising the public service funding allocations actually first.  And then hold the public hearing.  And then consider any public comment received during the hearing.  And then approve the annual action plan.  So we have two different votes that we need to do.  Madam Clerk, just for clarification, do we need to make a vote?  On the first, on item two, which is the consider reviewing the funding applications?  Or we just kind of move through on consensus?  No, that's what you're actually doing.  And so, I mean, you could make a motion on that.  If that is where you're going to go with that.  You can do it as one motion and direct it.  Okay.  So let's just do public comment.  Okay.  Hold on.  You would probably want.  I would probably want to let people know, the public know if you're going to change it.  Because what you're voting on is the actual full plan with any revisions.  So you could suggest, I don't know if it would have to be a motion.  But at least let the public know what you're intending to do.  So it's hard to give the public an idea.  So if I heard Mr. Van Overbeek correctly, your intention at this point is to move forward with the plan the way it is.  And work on fixing things.  And work on fixing things later.  Which we can't necessarily take a vote on.  But let's the public know that that's maybe where we're leaning without looking like we're leaning.  How's that for vague transparency?  Yeah.  Well.  I got a head nod.  Let's just do public comment.  If I understand.  Can I go back to that PowerPoint?  So I think I understand the motion that you are wanting to make is for the alternative funding.  Which would fund seven agencies.  Which is presented here.  No.  Yeah.  Not that particular one, right?  The first one.  This is the alternative one.  Or then the first one that was presented as part of the plan is this one funding six agencies.  We have a different version.  This is the original one.  That committee or the Citizens Advisory Committee.  Okay.  So I was going to make a motion.  I would be leaning towards the original plan.  Okay.  And part of why we need to know the direction is because our annual plan, it's actually the budget.  And the bulk of that document is the budget for all those funds.  So.  Well, either way, we can take public comment.  Yeah.  And we can vote on.  So it doesn't matter which way we're leaning.  Okay.  That'd be like telling the cannabis people I was opposed to them before I listened to them.  Oh, wait.  I did that.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So if you could open and then close the public hearing, we have no speakers at this time.  Okay.  So that'll be.  That makes it a lot easier.  The public hearing.  The public hearing.  Okay.  Now we can move forward.  Yes.  Entertain a motion.  There was no public.  Okay.  So it was a moot point as it was.  I would like to make a motion that we accept.  The alternative continuing care public services award matrix.  To find that.  The alternative being which one?  The seven.  They are identical except in the alternative one, the Jesus Center is included.  And the first.  Nineteen.  Okay.  It was not.  That's reducing the funding for six applicants in order to fund a seventh applicant.  Exactly.  I'll second it.  We have a motion and a second.  Motion by Councillor Van Overbeek.  Second by Councillor Morgan.  Madam Clerk.  I got a comment before we get to the vote.  Okay.  As I, you know, we have this committee, I believe Councillor Van Overbeek and I both applied to the committee and didn't get on it.  That's to relieve the finance committee of the.  No, sir.  No.  Oh, it's a citizen committee.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is pertaining to why we would change the funding.  Okay.  The point of the committee is.  To relieve the finance committee of the obligation to go through all these applications and make those judgments.  So I, being not even on the finance committee, was going through these applications recently to try to prepare for this meeting now.  And I noticed that the Jesus Center application was completely blank on it, which was apparently an error in there.  So we just got the Jesus Center application now.  And I just would say that we should lean towards following the process that we have established, given that we have a lot of work to do.  So we have rules and there were standards and we had a committee and they made these recommendations and so I will support the original recommendations that were made and not make modifications up here.  And offer substitute motion to approve the original committee recommendations for funding.  Right.  Substitute motion.  Do we have a second?  Do I just relax for a second?  Final question.  Madam Clerk?  Okay.  Okay, just give it up.  Okay, that's on the substitute.  So back to the original one.  Council Member Bennett.  I believe it was the substitute.  No, it failed for a lack of a second.  It's the original motion.  That's what I thought.  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  I'm going to go with a yes on this only because we absolutely need to revisit this process before next time.  Okay.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Can I make one more comment?  Sure.  A further apology to both of you for having to come back to 3.  We have three meetings to get this done.  But that's not really my fault.  All right.  Another hearing on resolution amending the city's fee schedule.  And we have Smart Administrative Services Director.  Welcome.  Thank you very much, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of council.  Before you tonight is our annual request to amend the fee schedule according to budget policy and municipal code.  Fees are adjusted annually by certain inflation indexes as outlined in our staff report.  You can see what index is used for each fee by looking if you look at the exhibits and the yellow column in the exhibits they have initials and those correspond to the initials that are on the different indexes that are in the staff report.  Exhibit B lists the fees that are required at public hearing.  And those are presented there according to the indexes.  And then exhibit A lists any new fees and any remaining fees.  Exhibit A lists fees that are being requested changes of fees by departments.  The memos in A1 and A2 of exhibit A explain the new fees being requested by the different departments.  Just to note, you'll note in exhibit A there are two memos that were actually from last fiscal year.  When this was presented last fiscal year we had a transition of staff and two items got missed along the way so we just wanted to make that fully transparent and put them in there this year for your information.  These changes were discussed and we'll be moving to them this year.  and presented at the Finance Committee meeting  on April 19th, and the committee recommended  that the fees be forwarded to the City Council  for approval.  If the fees are approved,  they will go into effect on July 3rd.  And I'm asking that you open the public hearing  and approve the fees as presented  and recommended by the Finance Committee.  Take any questions.  All right, questions?  No.  Ms. Martin?  Yeah.  Can you explain the process?  Some of these increases are pretty eye-opening,  a few of them.  Yeah, anything that is not directly related  to the indexes that are outlined here,  so the between six and 8% of the different indexes here  are actual requests by the departments.  And if there were anything of significance,  they were outlined in the memos.  I think the only items that are really significant,  there was a change in the format  of our negative declaration fee.  That one is the one that I see here  that's got a $9,000 change,  and it's actually just,  instead of having a flat fee,  we're asking for a real-time deposit.  In other words, the customer deposits money,  and then staff charges their time against that deposit  to recover those costs.  And then if we require more money along the way,  then we ask for more.  So it's just the deposit piece of it.  I don't know if there's any other specifics, Lee,  that you're looking for.  That was the one that stuck out.  Yeah. Yeah, thank you.  All right, further questions?  Yeah, Councillor Morgan, Chair of the Finance Committee,  did you receive any...  public comment on these fee increases at all?  Yep, at the Finance Committee.  Yeah.  Was there complaints against them?  I don't know how to assess these areas,  so I was wondering if you could summarize  any bit of public input received.  You're asking me if there were complaints  from the development community about increases in fees?  Is that a rhetorical question?  I think I can almost say verbatim.  Katie Thoma of Chico Builders Association came and spoke,  and she was very eloquent.  She had a handout for everybody.  She asked us to put the increasing the fees off  for some amount of time.  We got emails from Mr. Gianpoli saying,  how come things always go up and never go down?  And then the Finance Committee looked at the skipper  and said, there's a new...  What are you guys working on?  Fee study.  A new fee study that's gonna ferret a lot of that out,  and it would be, let's see if I can quote you right,  said, it'll be six months to somewhat longer than that  before we get it done,  and then there was the request by the CBA and Katie Thoma  to put it off to that point, and we didn't want to do that,  and since there weren't any large increases  other than the ones that Ms. Martin just explained  to the Finance Committee,  we approved it to send to the City Council,  and I would say of the five to six fee increases,  maybe three to four fee increases  I've been through in Finance Committee,  this is probably the biggest increase I've ever seen.  This is the first time that there weren't massive members of the development committees.  There are communities sitting in the audience throwing daggers at us.  So this was probably the most smoothest it's ever gone,  and I think that that has little to do with the council  and a lot to do with what's happening with the staff on the second floor  and the leadership from the third floor.  That's very impressive.  Your memory is that good.  Thank you, sir.  Very eloquent.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You thought I wasn't paying attention.  I have another question.  Do you have a goal for recapturing?  So you look at your total budget for building a building apartment.  Do you have a goal for recapturing?  What percentage of the fee income offsets that budget?  I'm sorry, what percentage of the budget is offset by the fee income?  Well, our general goal in the development fee funds specifically  is the original intent was to have a 90% cost recovery.  And that we do a general fund transfer every year to those development fee funds.  But that's a nine or 90, 90, 90.  Yeah.  And then for the development impact fees,  those are full recovery to pay for future costs kind of a thing.  So it depends on the fee.  And so at last year, how much were we recovering?  If 90 was the goal, do you know what we recovered?  Actually, I don't know the exact.  I mean, we do have a fund balance in those development impact.  Or not the development, the development fee funds  that are related to the private development funds.  That's something that's again going to be vetted through the user fee study.  They're going to look at the fund balances and see what that cost will be going forward.  That's kind of what the purpose of that is.  I mean, next year when this is done, I guess I would like to see what percentage,  what the goal of recovery is and what we actually did just to make sure we're not overcharging.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Never, never the goal to overcharge, always to recover costs.  Thank you.  All right.  Further questions?  Thank you.  All right.  With that, we will open the public hearing.  And I assume we have some speakers.  We have one speaker, Bill Webb.  Come on now.  And I'm not going to complain.  Chris was going to show up.  I was going to let him do that.  Bill Webb, Chico Builders Association.  I just wanted to add a little context to fees when you're considering,  raising them and in this case, 5% to 8% kind of across the board.  So I'm going to play a little game.  I'm going to pose a question to you.  If you want to answer it, you can.  If you don't, that's fine too.  So let's assume you own a piece of a parcel in the city of Chico and you want to build  a 1600 square foot home.  You hire an architect.  Maybe it's RGA, maybe it's not.  You need a structural engineer.  You need a fire sprinkler guy to design a plan.  You need a solar guy to design your solar array.  You need Title 24, which are energy calcs.  Then you take that and you give it to...  You pay a plan check fee.  They approve it.  Then you come in and you pay your permit fees.  You go to the school district.  You pay their fees.  How much do you think that costs for a 1600 square foot home?  20,000?  Casey, you want to answer?  I'm going to guess 60,000.  You're pretty close.  It's in the neighborhood of 50,000 and I'm probably on the low end.  So it's probably 50 to 60.  That's quite a bit.  So now you've got your money.  Most chances are there's not a parcel in Chico that you're going to be able to find and buy.  So maybe you want to come and buy a lot from me or another developer, which we're not selling  lots, but we would for Casey.  And you pay $120,000.  So now you're into that for $170,000.  Then you've got to hire a contractor that's not going to build for less than 200 bucks  a square foot.  So now you're at 170 plus 320.  You're at $500,000 for your 1600 square foot home.  This is what I'm going to kind of promote myself.  I'm selling that same home for 400.  I'm going to sell it for $430,000 right now.  So I'm building affordable housing.  That has nothing to do with the fee structures.  I get that.  That's policy.  We work long and hard on some of these things with Mr.  O'Boney and Mr.  Vig, the former planning directors that were here.  Just want you to consider that when you're talking fees.  I know it's 5% to 8%.  It doesn't sound like a lot, but it does go to the cost of a home or an apartment or whatever  retail center you may be building.  Okay.  So, city, probably government in general, tends to spend a lot of time developing fee  systems or fee structures.  Spend little time working on processes and policies to help streamline the system, make  it more convenient, expeditious, timely to where we can produce housing at a higher rate,  at a less expensive rate.  So that's the shift I would like to see.  And I am excited that we're going to start seeing some of that here.  Okay great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  I see an internal memo that says it's 100%.  That's time.  If it's 100%, that's not what you got certified.  Thank you.  All right.  No more speakers?  Okay. Entertain a motion.  Will it count?  I'll move to approve.  Clear.  Just for technical terms, close public hearing.  Sorry.  All right.  So we have a motion and a second.  And you want to read the resolution technically or?  You don't have to read resolution titles.  Councilmember Bennett?  I would just like to thank Mr. Webb for his comments.  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Reluctantly, yes.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Moving on to our regular agenda finally, we get to item 5.1,  which is Airport Commission Employment Action Commission  Appointments Continued from the last seven meetings.  Anyway, Madam Clerk, if you'd take four.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  If we take action tonight, this will actually be the culmination  of the biennial recruitment that started in fall of 2022,  and it is for the Airport Commission and Climate Action Commission.  The Airport Commission has five members, so we'll use the balloting process.  You'll have a blue ballot in front of you.  Some of you have already turned those into me, and we do that because that's the policy  for five-member boards or commissions.  And then we have the Climate Action Commission, which had individual nominations that need  to be confirmed by the full body.  And those individual nominations were Katie Toma, Bryce Goldstein, and Britt Cooper for the four-year terms on the Climate Action Commission.  So if council could first, well, and if we don't have any speakers at this time, so I don't know if you want to, I mean, we don't have any cards.  So if you would first fill out the blue ballot, and Danny will come up and pick that up, that is for the Airport Commission.  You need to vote for three people because there are three spots that are open.  And as soon as someone receives a majority vote, then I'll confirm to you that they received that confirmation.  So we'll do the Airport Commission first.  All right.  So we'll just take a minute to do this.  It'll take just a quick second because it's...  Okay.  Hopefully we've got this down.  And so those individual candidates for the Airport Commission were Mike Antelock, Roger Fremski, Raul Hernandez, Bill Perini, and Loretta Ann Torres.  Thanks.  Thank you.  While you're tabulating those, I'd just like to thank everybody who applied for all our commissions.  And certainly we couldn't do the work of the city without the efforts of those who apply for the committees and also for the folks who have applied for both of these committees as we tortured them quite a bit, taking quite a long time to get that decision made.  So thank everybody for their patience on this and looking forward to moving forward.  Thank you.  Okay. And I believe that Eric will have a special commission meeting so that we can swear them in and get them on board to start helping that airport commission. Now in relationship to the Climate Action Commission, those are individual nominees. And again, it was Katie Toma, Bryce Goldstein, and Britt Cooper.  Okay. Now in relationship to the Climate Action Commission, those are individual nominees. And again, it was Katie Toma, Bryce Goldstein, and Britt Cooper. And so I would just need a motion and a second to accept those, that slate of nominees or have the council discuss what you want to do.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  at that end of that discussion, then I just need a motion to either move forward with them or move  in some other direction. I would move to approve them. Second. I have a motion from I.S. Barron.  Second from Council Member Tandon. And that is to accept the nomination slate. That is perfect.  Thank you. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor  Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. So we have three new appointees for the Climate Action Commission as  well as for the Airport Commission. And just to let the Council know, we will be setting up our  orientation for the new Board and Commission members. And that's June 22nd. And we'll make  sure that we get notices out to everybody to hold that date. That is a mandatory requirement  of serving on these commissions. So thank you.  All right. Thank you. And then what I will say is what I always say after this is thank you to  everybody who applied. If you did not get on one of these commissions, that does not mean that  we don't have love for you or want your service. Certainly try again. Commissions as well as this  Council are filled with people who had to try and try again. So we'd certainly appreciate you  putting your name into the hat as we move into the future.  So thank you. All right. That was way quicker than I thought it would be. Item 5.2, consideration of  participating in a long-term fee option for the Vinet Groundwater Sustainability Agency. Mr.  Goess. Welcome. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Appreciate the opportunity to speak to you tonight.  So good evening, Councilmembers. This item is consideration of participation,  in a long-term funding fee option for the Vina Groundwater Sustainability Agency,  as we know it as Vina GSA.  As you recall, Vina GSA was formed in 2017 between Butte County,  City of Chico, and Durham Irrigation District.  Up until this point, each member agency funded the Vina GSA operation  and contributed to in-kind staffing support to make sure things went smoothly.  We also received about a $1.5 million grant from Department of Water Resources  to develop the Groundwater Sustainability Plan, which is complete.  And that grant funding, though, runs out in June.  To continue operations, the Vina GSA board,  which Vice Mayor Casey Reynolds represents the Council on,  thank you, Council Member and Vice Mayor Reynolds,  approved a funding option that's before you tonight.  So at this point, I'm going to introduce the Butte County Water and Resource Conservation Director,  Kemi Lozier.  To present a brief presentation on this item.  She's been living and breathing this for some time and does an excellent job  and is all things Vina GSA.  And then I will come back at the recommendation point.  So if you will, Kemi, thank you.  Just there.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, Council Members,  as Eric indicated, Kemi Lozier with the Butte County Department of Water and Resource Conservation.  And tonight, also serving.  As the Vina GSA Administrator.  So controlling my slides.  I'm going to give you a little background about the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.  Kind of the road map to where we've been and where we've come here today.  And hopefully not be too long winded because it seems like you might actually have a short meeting if I stop talking.  So just some background.  So the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, you'll hear me refer to as SGMA,  was passed in the early 2000s.  And it was passed in 2014.  And it gave local agencies the authority and responsibility to manage our groundwater.  And to create groundwater sustainability agencies, so GSAs.  So hence we have the Vina GSA.  And as part of that, part of SGMA was to develop groundwater sustainability plans.  Which we did and was adopted in 2000 or 2022.  And included in the GSA was the Vina GSA.  And the GSA is the GSP, or Groundwater Sustainability Plan.  I'll refer to it as GSP.  Lots of acronyms.  So hopefully you can catch on quick.  We also identified projects and management actions to achieve sustainability.  And it requires SGMA compliance.  You'll hear me refer to SGMA compliance tonight.  Which includes monitoring and reporting every year.  As well as updating the GSP every five years.  With the goal of achieving sustainability by 2042.  The GSP looks at six or more projects.  And we have to make sure that we have what we call undesirable results.  And that's what those little triangles are there in the bottom right.  Which is about lowering groundwater levels, reduce storage, seawater intrusion, which  is not a problem here.  Degraded water quality, land subsidence and surface water depletion.  Just to give you an overview, there are three subbasins, groundwater subbasins in Butte County.  Vina subbasin, which includes the Vina GSA.  The Butte subbasin is the Vina GSA.  basin and we have the Wyandotte Creek sub basin and so that's the picture on  your left and then on the right is the Vina sub basin which is includes two  GSA's the Vina GSA and then the Rock Creek Reclamation District GSA and both  of the GSA's work together to prepare the groundwater sustainability plan that  was adopted just to give you a little background on land and water use in the  Vina sub basin so you'll see there the in the managed there's three different  management areas at Vina north the Chico management area and then Vina south and  then there's the land uses the little teal blue there is rice orchards is the  brown and we have some other crops as there's also some idle land and then  developed which is mostly the city of Chico and then some native grasslands  kind of to the east  and then there's also some other crops as there's also some idle land and then  to look at all three of the sub basins together with Vina butte and Wyandotte  Creek as well as our neighbors west of the river and the Calusa sub basin  you'll see that areas in blue are predominantly groundwater users and then  the areas with the green is a lot of surface water irrigation and then  there's some mixed groundwater surface water in this sub basins just so that  just gives you an idea of the groundwater use so what you do see here  is that Vina sub basin is predominantly groundwater use where especially like  the Butte sub basin has a lot of surface water as well as the Calusa sub basin  Eric touched on this a little bit so the Vina sub basin or Vina GSA is made up of  three member agencies which through a joint powers agreement which is the Butte  County the city of Chico as well as Durham irrigation district and that  forms the Vina GSA you'll hear me talk about the  program manager in a minute as you see in that little blue circle so so three  member agencies and a five member board so the GSA has its own board made up of  three elected officials vice mayor Reynolds is one of those as well as  supervisor Kimmel Shu and one Durham irrigation board member Raymond Cooper  and then we have two directors one representing the ag community  and one also representing domestic well users we also have a stakeholder  advisory committee that we call the shack and that's made up of ten members  representatives from various stakeholder groups and that's those are appointed  members and then we have the management committee which is representatives from  each of the member agencies and and Linda and Eric have been representing  the city of Chico and a couple people including myself and others from my  department and then the board of directors and then the board of  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great Again, the GSAs were pretty much formed around 2017 to 2019 with the intent of preparing the GSP. And again, that was adopted in 2022. In January 2022, we submitted it to DWR and it's undergoing a two year review period.  In January 2022, we submitted it to DWR, and it's undergoing a two-year review period.  So hopefully you will know by the end of the year how we did on our GSP.  And so moving forward, we have to achieve sustainability by 2042.  And then after that, we have to maintain the sustainability for 30 years.  So we got some work ahead of us.  So up until now, as Eric indicated, the GSA has been funded by member agency contributions,  $5,000 from each member agency, as well as the GSP was funded by grant funding.  And so most of the work has been through in-kind services of the management committee  or the member agencies have essentially provided in-kind services.  So we've been running the GSAs that way.  In addition, the BUCS.  The BUCS, the Bucs County Board of Supervisors, did give the GSA some, or my department,  additional funding, one-time funding to continue managing the GSAs to get us through some critical tasks this fiscal year,  which included some grant applications.  So we have applied for some grants, as well as preparing our annual report for SGMA compliance,  and now this, to be able to do this funding mechanism.  So essentially, we do need this long-term funding.  Two.  We need to achieve three things, which is GSA administration,  GSP implementation, and managing different projects, and as well as SGMA compliance.  And so that equals our revenue needs for the GSA.  So there's different ways, as many of you know, to fund agencies.  There can be a fee, an assessment, or a tax.  We're focusing more on the fee with the Prop 218 process for cost of service is what,  how we would be able to do that.  So we'll be raising fees for the GSA.  There is a Prop 26 process, which is a regulatory fee,  but it doesn't really apply for what we're trying to achieve at this point.  Plus, usually the best way to do that is charge meter well fees and usage, water usage,  and that just sounds like a nightmare.  So developing a fee under Prop 218, what we've done is we have identified costs  and confirmed the revenue.  We've identified the revenue needs for the GSA.  We've developed alternative cost allocation methods, which I'll talk about shortly.  And we have prepared a technical memorandum.  We have a consultant assisting us with this process.  And so the GSA board just reviewed the technical memorandum at their last meeting.  And what will happen after that is this engineer's report for a fee study will issue a notice  of the fee, which is a 45-day fee.  So that's what we're doing.  And then we'll have a public notice period.  And then we'll have a cost allocation and fee approval public hearing,  and hopefully the fee will get approved.  And then it'll be put on the assessor's tax roll.  So this is a really shortened timeline.  Usually we'd like to have a much longer process, but given the funding from the board of supervisors  and needing to get something on the assessor's tax roll, by August 10th, it's been really compressed.  But what is important is that we have to make sure  here is that this is a public process. We have had some public meetings and we will continue to have  public meetings and workshops throughout for the next couple months. So part of one of the things  that we did do as part of the management committee and consultation with the stakeholder advisory  group and the board was identify some options for managing the GSA. And so we had three options. One  was that the county would hire or retain a program manager in my department and it would be funded by  the GSA. So we also looked at hiring consultants to manage and operate the GSA or the GSA could  hire its own staff. Right now, the joint powers agreement, the JPA says  that the board should be able to hire a program manager and the board should be able to hire a  program manager. So that was the option that was considered in the technical memo and will be  considered in the fee study. So we did identify revenue projections. This is very small. That's  why it says.  And then we also looked at the technical memo. So you can go through the technical memo and see how  we arrived at some of these numbers and the various funding options that we did look at. And  ultimately, the technical memo looked at some fee options that were considered as ways that we could  charge this fee. There were also numerous options that were looked at that were kind of eliminated  from further review. I was a CEQA person. So that's the technical memo. And then we also looked at  the cost of the fee. So we looked at three primary options, which was a uniform cost, a fee per acre,  irrigated and non-irrigated lands, which would kind of share the cost a little differently between  those land uses and then a land use hybrid option. What the VINA GSA board decided to do was just to  look at the uniform cost fee per acre.  And to be charged to all the parcels within the VINA GSA. And that is what will be considered in the fee study  that will be reviewed and approved by the board in May. Just to give you an idea of the cost. So as part of the  revenue projections, the proposed uniform fee would ultimately result in $3.07 per acre. You'll see the  amount of revenue that will be included in the fee study. And then we also looked at the cost of the fee.  The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great.  The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great.  The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great.  The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great.  The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great.  The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great. The bonds were great.  amount of water resources will tell us in July, before July, actually June, hopefully. We also  looked at what that fee would be if it were annualized each year. So it's about $2.90  an acre per year. So we also, just to give you an idea of what that cost would be for various  lot sizes, so a 5,000 square foot parcel would be about 33 cents a year. And I don't know the cost  of a stamp anymore, but that's essentially less. I do remember when they were 32 cents. I don't  know what they are now. And then again, annualized over the five-year period. So if there was an  8,000 square foot parcel up to two acres and so forth, it is prorated for the size of,  would be prorated for.  So that's just to give you an idea of what that cost would be.  So the timeline that we're looking at, and on May 10th, the VINA GSA board will look at the  fee study and approve the fee. And again, there's an, on May 23rd or so, give or take a day or two,  we'll send out the public notice of the fee. And there's again, that 45-day review period.  We anticipate having a,  public workshop on June 14th. You know, we try to do a lot of outreach, but it's only when someone  gets the notice in the mail, as all landowners will, then they'll probably pay attention.  And so we do want to have an opportunity for people to come ask questions and understand what  the fee is truly for. And then on July 12th, a public hearing and a free fee protest ballot  hearing, and then hopefully getting everything together for the,  the,  county's assessor tax roll.  Just so you know, we do have a website, and this is the homepage here. So it's a VINA GSA.org.  If people want to go look at when the meetings are, there's ways that they can look at historical  documents or contact us directly. And we try to keep that up to date. And then this slide says  where you can send public, people can send comments to. There's a frequently asked questions  on that webpage.  And then also a fact sheet. And then we also have a regular email listserv that people can sign up for to get notifications.  And I think with that, that's, that's it. And I'm going to pass it back to Eric so he can.  Like to thank you for your time. And maybe you can sit up there with me in case anyone has questions.  Mr. Gobson, you have anything further?  Thank you, Mayor. No, no, nothing further. Thank you, Cammy. Appreciate that. And so, yeah, with,  with the relative amount, our recommendation is that city council approved participating in the VINA GSA  Proposition 218 process to fund the VINA GSA from a long term perspective.  All right. Question?  I have a couple too. Fire away.  So I was looking, first compliments on the logo. It looks really good. It's like it's a water park or something.  Just a very fun government agency. And secondly, I was looking at those alternatives for the structure of the fees.  We're looking at a per acre basis, which I understand how that's the most straightforward.  But if cow water is to be believed, it's something like the city uses 7% of the draw in the aquifer,  and the agricultural land surrounding it is about 93%.  It's municipal and industrial.  It's just 7%.  So does this fee, even though it looks small on a yearly basis,  is this shifting the cost from the large-scale water users to those of us who just live in modestly used water,  or drinking, even having a swimming pool, you don't compare to an orchard owner.  So I'm wondering if this is in our city's best interest to adopt this style of fee.  So one thing to consider when you look at the revenue projections,  it really is the base amount needed to run the GSA,  including just the everyday activities of the GSA, as well as the SGMA compliance activities.  And so that's just the everyday activities.  Then there are projects and management actions that are identified in the GSP.  And some of those are the things that we went after for grant funding.  So we did go after some of the everyday SGMA compliance activities in the grant funding,  but then we also applied for various projects.  And the projects are the things that would be implemented,  that those costs would be shifted more to the, let's say, the agricultural users.  So any implementation of projects.  Even if we don't get grant funded,  or if there were subsequent projects that we identified that we wanted to implement,  we could actually go do another 218,  where the people that benefit from those projects directly,  those would be the people that would be charged.  So kind of looking at this is the base fee that everybody pays for groundwater management,  and then special localized projects would be charged to those users.  Okay great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great  agency starts hiring staff, it just ends up going on and on forever.  But, you know, just to understand this, this is obviously a state-mandated thing that we  have to come up with, which, of course, they're not funding, pushing off to a local level,  so we're very used to this routine and circus from our legislature.  But it seems like the county's bearing the brunt of the responsibility in moving forward  with this.  So it's really just giving them our blessing to move forward with 218.  We don't really have to, you know, go anything further than that.  Well, with the 218, it would be the GSA running it, but yes, ultimately the county.  But the county, yeah.  But I will say that, you know, Linda, without Linda, I don't know how we would get our minutes  and agendas done, but yes, the county has done a lot of the work.  And she won't have to do that anymore, right?  Well, she'll retire and then...  No.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  So thank you for the presentation.  Certainly great.  Further comment?  Okay.  Do we have public comments?  Entertain the motion.  I will move to approve, and I would just note that I think for the average homeowner in  Chico, this is what we figure out about $2.25 or $2.75 a year or something like that.  So it's if even that.  So I think to deal with the state mandate.  That's probably the cheapest fee we're ever going to see.  And let's hopefully we can get to the point for some projects.  And if you thought that presentation was grueling, I totally invite you to come to our meetings  on Wednesday nights.  It's super fun learning about water for two hours.  Anyways.  Second.  Move to approve.  All right.  Second.  From the Vice Mayor Reynolds, second from Council Member Bennett.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Buren?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Yeah, because Evan's making us.  Aye.  Carrie 7-0.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Reports and communications, nothing added after the agenda.  Reports and communications, following reports and communications items are provided for the  Council's information.  No action can be taken on these items under this section unless the Council agrees to  include it on a subsequent agenda.  Item 6.1.  City Manager's Report.  Mr. Norton?  No report.  All right.  Thank you very much.  We have item 6.2.  Council Member request for a statement.  P1010.  Council Member Winslow?  May.  That wasn't me.  May.  Propriately request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating that the  item would be of enjoyment to the Council voters in need in order to staff to agendize.  And we have a Council Member request from Mr. Winslow.  I have two.  Should I do one at a time?  So the first one we have is from Council Member Winslow.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  This is a relic of a former policy or interpretation of the policy we had when they were written  requests in.  So it's been so long because this has been put off.  So thankfully I did write it down.  The request to discuss a pro-housing designation, this is something the State of California  has come up with as a way to incentivize local jurisdictions to incentivize housing in their  area.  It comes with grant funding attached.  You qualify for certain grants if you are a pro-housing designation.  An increasing number of jurisdictions in the Sacramento area have received this.  Chico already gets some awards for like our building division.  So I think that we're on track to getting something like this.  But it would at least having the discussion and if we were, I would ask to direct staff  to look at the application and see what we would need to do, what our policy option would  be to achieve this designation.  And yeah.  So I would like to just open up the discussion of that.  I don't know if Chico is becoming a pro-housing designation in the future.  Next in motion.  Yeah.  I think I looked at it not carefully and it looks attractive.  Unfortunately, whenever the state offers money, there's always gotchas involved.  And I want to make sure we clearly understand what we're giving out.  So it's not just whether or not at this point we are agendizing it.  So you're certainly welcome to second it.  But we shouldn't have a discussion on it now.  Okay.  I'll second it.  All right.  I have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  No.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Second.  Carries 5 to.  I do have one comment if I could make it.  Without that, you don't want to make it about that because that's actually what comes  up in the next meeting.  But if you want to make it about the motion or something along those lines, you're welcome.  Okay.  All right.  Move on to item B. Council Member Van Overbeek requests pedestrian signs for downtown.  Before we do that, I'm looking, I'm confused.  I think this is a good question.  I'm looking at 6.2, council member requests pursuant to AP 1010, council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting.  Where do we do that?  So right now, so the next one is your request for pedestrian and way signs for the downtown.  And it was continued from the 4-4 meeting and also the 4-18.  Right.  And if I have additional ones, this is where I would.  Okay.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Okay. So one of the, you know, our downtown needs some love.  We had speakers in the business from the floor.  One of the elements of revitalizing downtowns that other cities have done is to make them more pedestrian friendly.  And an element of that is creating way signs.  And I think there's a very good model over at the university where they have pedestrian way signs to direct you to various campus locations.  And I would like us to, I would like to.  See if we can work with staff to create a pedestrian oriented way sign program for downtown.  And that's my request.  All right.  I have a motion and a second.  Can I ask one question?  Because I think it's relevant on how I vote on this.  Would this be pointing to actual businesses?  It would be, that would be something that we would be looking at.  I think it's something to be determined.  The idea is it would be public places, but also businesses that wanted to qualify at a significant destination, the Diamond Hotel, and were willing to pay for it, for example.  Can I?  Would be included.  That point of discussion that we have when we actually discuss.  Okay.  So we have a motion and a second.  Who was our second?  Council Member Morgan.  There we go.  Madam Clerk, on your right.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  I'm going to abstain out of just extreme caution.  Okay.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  It carries 6-0 with one abstention.  Mr. Mayor, may I introduce my?  Yeah, please.  Go ahead.  Or should I give somebody else a chance?  Anyone else?  Okay.  Okay.  So the next one has to do with the regulation of type 48 licenses in the downtown north  zone.  So downtowns have become entertainment districts and places where people go to for entertainment  and eating and drinking.  And Chico's code, 19.44.40.  Limits the number of type 48 licenses.  These are licenses for bars in the downtown north area.  And I would like to propose an amendment to 19.44.40 to add a paragraph D that would  state that the city council may approve additional type 48 licenses in the downtown north zoning  district.  And I would like the staff to study this and come back with a recommendation.  Point of clarification.  Mr. City Manager, can we already do that?  No.  Don't we already do that?  No.  No.  There's a hard prohibition for additional.  This is a reference to hard bar licenses as opposed to type 47, which is a restaurant  that happens to serve alcohol.  Oh, okay.  Specifics.  Okay.  Okay.  That was a motion as well?  Yes.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  No.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  All right.  Carries 6-1.  Thank you.  Sorry.  Jumped the gun there.  Item 6.3.  Monthly financial.  I have one more.  Oh, we have more.  I have one more.  Okay.  And Council Member Tandon has one too.  So why don't we let her go and then back to you.  Yes.  I would like to agendize to revise the application for the commissioners because it seems like  last time, in the last meeting, we did heard some concerns regarding non-disclosure of  one of the candidates about the biased relationship they have with the commissioners.  So I would like to ask the commissioners to provide some more information about that.  So the commissioners have already been in contact with the city on various, on different  incidences, but there is no place to disclose it on the application.  So if we can maybe revise that so that way in the future when we have a situation and  an applicant might have worked with the city on any project for or against, they can disclose  it forward if there is conflict of interest, but the application doesn't say in the past  if you had a conflict of interest.  So I think it will make it more transparent for the future.  So I would like to see if we can address that or any other feedback on that selection process.  All right.  Is that a motion?  Yes.  All right.  Second.  Motion and second.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  No offense to my colleague.  No.  Carry 6-1.  All right.  Mr. Van Overbeek.  All right.  So I think it's no secret to anybody here that we have a dramatically understaffed police  department, and particularly in the city of Wichita.  We have one traffic officer, Lonely Sergeant Todd Lefkowitz, for a city of 100,000 people.  And we've had nine traffic fatalities last year, right?  Is that right, Chief?  And anybody who drives anywhere in this town, the red light running is rampant.  And so I've investigated the red light camera systems, talked to—they've had one in place  in Redding for 15 years.  I talked to their chief.  I've also talked to our chief and the CPOA people.  These systems are self-funding because of the ticket—the revenue from the tickets  pays for the system.  So I would like to put on the agenda consideration of installing red light cameras on busy intersections  in Chico.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  It carries six wins.  Massive legal problems.  Don't like the government that much in my life.  Anyway, any more?  All right.  Item 6.3, monthly financial report and budget monitoring report.  Sorry, dash for information only, and we will adjourn.  Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for your presence here.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.
