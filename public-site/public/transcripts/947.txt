 Is this a quorum?  Two, four. We only have four.  Four quorum.  Yeah.  Seven, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, because we can't.  We want to start.  I'm in 6-0-0.  Okay.  Yeah.  We could start.  We could give it a minute.  Is that four?  You should put them in that book.  Oh, okay.  But we'll keep an eye out for him, and we'll let him in.  Okay.  But he usually calls, though.  I can see both doors.  And are John and Rich not showing up?  Is that what they said?  John Allen won't be here.  Okay, great.  So we're only waiting for Ken.  Okay, well.  Should we just start and see if Ken shows up?  Or we can wait a few minutes.  Any recommendation?  I'd like to.  Okay.  I'm not in a hurry, but probably a good idea to start soon.  Well.  6-0-5.  We want to get 6-0-2.  We want to try 6-0-5.  Yeah, we could.  If we haven't heard from Ken, we could give it until 6-0.  6-0-5?  Fine.  If that's okay.  Just don't want to have to repeat any information if he does show up.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. We want to see our grandkids in LA. Almost time. All right.  All right.  Finish up your conversation.  All right.  All right.  It's 6.05, so I'm going to call to order the Planning Commission regular meeting of Thursday, March 18, 2021.  Our first item on the agenda is the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.  So if you can please stand with me and salute and pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right.  Thank you.  Moving on to the roll call, can we please have staff call the roll?  Commissioner Verlede?  Here.  Commissioner Scott?  Here.  Vice Chair Amah?  Present.  Chair Bolstein?  Here.  Commissioner Gilbert?  Inaction.  Commissioner Howard?  Inaction.  Commissioner Seed?  Inaction.  Thank you.  All right.  Item two, consent agenda.  We just have approval of the minutes.  So.  If we could get a motion to approve the minutes.  I move to approve the minutes from March 4, 2021.  Thank you.  Are you reaching the second?  I'll second.  Okay.  All in favor of approving the minutes, please say aye.  Aye.  Okay.  One abstention.  Any opposition?  All right.  So, looks like one abstention and three ayes.  I don't know if that might not constitute as quorum for passing the approval of the  minutes.  I'm not sure how that works.  I believe it's a present quorum.  Okay.  Cool.  Then the minutes are presumably passed.  Okay.  Item three, business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed  on the agenda.  With comments being limited to three minutes.  The commission cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section  of the agenda.  Do we have any speakers who want to speak at business from the floor?  Madam Chair, the only two in the queue are here for the item tonight.  Okay.  Good to know.  So, then I think we can move on to item four, public hearings, unless there's any sudden  wish to speak.  Okay.  All right.  Seeing none, moving on to item four, public hearings.  So, looks like we just have item 4.1, amendments to exempt governmental signs in chapter 19.74  of Title 19 of the Municipal Sign Code.  First, any ex parte communication?  Don't think so.  Although I did speak with somebody from this company that's mentioned in the staff report  for work a while ago.  Okay.  So, anyway, our staff report is next.  Do you think you can hear me at all?  Mm-hmm.  Can you get this microphone?  Yeah.  This microphone works.  Is that a little bit better?  Sure.  Good.  Okay.  As you announced, Madam Chair, these are the items that we're going to be talking about.  the  Sign Code amendments facilitate governmental signs.  These are pretty small strategic code amendments.  They just involve a couple of features that I'll discuss briefly.  The first thing is that it includes new definitions.  The new definitions include what we're turning informational sign kiosk, and the other new  definition would be a governmental sign.  And an informational sign kiosk is included with the new definitions.  So, it's a governmental sign.  And then, the other feature of these amendments are that we would create a new exemption for  governmental signs.  And governmental signs are pretty much any sign that the City Council has approved, and  they are located within city right-of-way or on city property.  And then, just in terms of cleanup, we've modified the definition of electronic reader  board to clarify.  That an informational sign kiosk is not considered an electronic reader board because it has  a digital display within the system itself, and it's not a reader board itself.  And lastly, we realized that we didn't have any sign regulations in the PQ zoning district,  the public, quasi-public zoning district.  And in terms of cleanup, we added some review parameters that we're going to be adding to  the PQ zoning district.  And then, we added some review criteria to give the director the ability to review sign  into the PQ zone.  We didn't have any regulations in there at all.  So, we just put something in there as a basis to give them some review criteria.  And then, I just wanted to mention, too, in the copy that's in your packet, we omitted  33 extra pages of signed text that didn't have any changes whatsoever because it just  went over all the signed regulations in a rezoning district.  And we're not making any changes to those.  But in your packet, if you can refer to it in your staff report, there's a, I think  it's in exhibit B, you can see the name brand SUFA signs, and there's some illustrations  of those.  And I don't have, the PowerPoint isn't working otherwise.  I'd show them to you.  But these are pedestrian signs.  They're not readable from passing traffic.  They're not accessible.  They're meant to be read by pedestrians on the street standing next to them.  They're 100% solar powered.  They have digital news feeds that can be updated pretty frequently.  You can put community events on there.  It includes pedestrian wayfinding to different destination attractions in downtown.  You can include parking information in there.  You can include information on historic buildings or any other kinds of community information  we'd like the Chamber's interest in putting on there.  Or, and they even do pedestrian traffic counts.  The other exhibit you have in your staff report, exhibit C, shows the location map where the  downtown signs would be located.  There's, you can see that.  There's space interspersed throughout downtown.  And then from an environmental standpoint, these ordinance amendments are categorically  exempt from CEQA under a couple of different exemptions.  But in conclusion, we're recommending the Public Works Director and Community Development  Director are both recommending that you adopt these ordinance amendments by opening and  holding this public hearing.  And then adopting the resolution recommending that the Council adopt these same ordinance  amendments.  With me today are Melody Bassett from the Downtown Association, who's been a partner  in this project and initiated this.  And with Public Works, and I think Bikram Kalan's here too, in case you have any other questions.  But I'm here now too if you have any questions that I can answer.  Thank you, Bruce.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Oh, is yours still not working?  Oh.  Darn.  If you really need to, you can just like grab mine.  Darn.  Like.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  sure. Is the PQ zone  with the informational kiosks, is that tied to that or are those two separate things  that are happening? Two separate things.  Okay. All right. It was clean up. When we  realized there were no standards, that's the only reason why we did it.  They're not related. And the language that is  up to the, I think  it's the community development director's discretion.  So I know in government, sometimes we do things only  for us and that's okay. But it seems  like there's no  application process or permit process for these signed kiosks.  So do we run into any problems when we're  essentially passing an ordinance that would only benefit  a certain organization?  I guess I ask because the example we have in here  is a bank. It's a for-profit.  So it's not like anybody in the downtown area is going to be eligible  to put these up, correct? Well, my answer to that is  we would require, it would trigger a signed permit  but we'd give them some review parameters or  canons, if you will, to review the request.  So we didn't exempt,  we didn't have signs in the PQ zone.  There's still, I mean, signage in the PQ zone.  We just didn't have any regulations governing them.  So I think my question is more the downtown kiosks.  Oh, okay. So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 potential ones.  Are those locations that are up for anybody to put up a sign  or would it just be for a particular applicant or just for this?  City? And then the city decides who gets the sign?  I think it would be at the city's discretion  working with the downtown association.  But I can give that question to Bikram or Brenda and Odeboni.  It's their program.  Okay. So if they,  I don't want to name any,  but if there was a for-profit business downtown  that let's say is not a part of the downtown Chico Business Association,  do we run into any issues that we're not allowing them to be on these signs  or they don't have the ability to apply for a permit?  I think that you're getting into the administration of the program  and I'll gladly hand that off to the downtown people or public works people.  Okay. And I guess I'm just asking because there's nothing in here about a,  in the language about a permit process.  So if we needed to add that.  There isn't.  For this, I don't know.  We just, we exempted that.  The presumption is that the, if it, if it is,  if it classifies as an informational sign kiosk,  which is also a governmental sign, then they're exempt.  That means it's something to presumably the city council has approved.  So if they're participating through that program,  I suppose the answer would be yes,  but I'll defer to, to the downtown.  I would ask them when we do that, I think and if they could address when we have  that question, the thing that I'm wondering is,  is if there are businesses that are featured,  which would be great, you know, this is what would stocks is doing this week,  or the band she's reopening and this is, these are the specials.  Seems like we would unfairly allow for advertising for one company, but not another.  I think, I think that's the responsibility of downtown association.  I think they can answer that.  Okay.  Yeah, I guess I have more questions, but I think I'll listen to the speakers first.  Sorry?  Sorry, I have some questions, but I think I'll listen to the speakers and see if they get answered first.  Okay.  Thank you, Bruce.  Anything on the ordinance, though, other than what I've just addressed?  Hmm. Not at the moment.  I think we're good. I think we can move.  Yeah, I think we've got them on here so that they can answer those questions.  Mike, we have those folks on the line.  Okay.  Yes, we have Melanie from DCBA.  Sure, yeah, let's open it up to her.  Okay, so we're going to open the public hearing up here?  Sounds good.  Here we go.  Melanie, go ahead.  Okay, can you hear me?  Yes.  Yeah, good evening.  First of all, I just want to thank Bruce for his time on this.  And so I've been collaborating with the city and Suplik Science on this exciting project for some time.  And I think it's also, I don't know if that was in the report, I can't remember really now, but it's also been a really cool development that we brought the great artist Jake Early on board to do something creative, which I think will be really fun.  So I also, these times are going to be a huge addition to downtown.  You can keep information very fresh about what's going on downtown, where it can go for what, maps.  Parking is a big issue.  You know, we are starting enforcement again downtown, but all the lots, round downtown are free.  And even though you put out press releases and you put out information, people don't know.  So, you know, there's 10 or 12 different things that we're going to be doing.  And all of these that we're going to have located downtown where people can get good information.  So we're working with Suplik on the sponsors because you can pay for, pay to sponsor the, you know, the kiosk as well.  So all of the businesses in downtown have an opportunity to participate in that.  But I do want you to know that the DCA supports the signage ordinance amendments that really will help facilitate that.  And I think that's going to be a big part of this exciting project.  And I might say, Toni, to your point is that there's like 400 plus businesses in the downtown that are all part of the association.  So I think you were saying if there was a member that was outside of that, how would that work kind of thing.  Is that what was, were you asking that?  Yes.  Do you, actually, do you have any, do you want to wrap up your three minutes and then I could ask you some questions?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  So that was more just, and it's not, I think these are fabulous idea and, you know, everything that we've been doing as far as city for creating that sense of place and the way making.  So I just wanted to make sure on the side of a policy, if that, if we, what that process looks like.  But that's really helpful to know that they're all part of the association.  And that there would be sponsorship opportunities, which is really important.  And that there would be a lot of things that we could do to help keep up with the maintenance of these as well.  Right.  Exactly.  Okay.  I think that's it.  Thank you.  Dennis?  Yeah.  I have a question for Melanie.  When you talk about sponsorships, is there a set time so that there's some kind of rotation through with over 400 members in the DCBA?  Yeah.  Can you tell us about that?  Yeah.  You know, I don't have the details for you on that.  That's sort of the next phase.  Right.  So, you know, we have a lot of sponsorships that we have to work on.  But, you know, we, as an organization, these sponsorships for all of our events and for all of our events that we try to, you know, make sure that everyone has an opportunity to be a part of that.  I'm sure people will really, really want to be part of these kiosks.  Because they're going to be just really good looking and a place for all of our visitors downtown to look.  So I think that the next step is to really look at your organization.  And how that sponsorship would work.  I don't have the details on that for you tonight.  But there will be rotation for sure.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I also had some questions in my mind about the sponsorships or the advertising.  And I'm glad to hear that it sounds like the advertising will be for businesses that are in the downtown.  I was going to ask, is the city still in the downtown?  going to be regulating what kind of advertisements go on to this?  Is it going to be done by the company that manages the signs? Is it the  DCBA? Who will be in charge of that? It sounds like it'll be the  DCBA, but I'd like to clarify that.  It's really the three of us working together.  So probably Vikram, Brendan overseeing it, but  as well as Shelly from Super Signs. So  that's how we've been coordinating everything and  that's what works best, that collaboration. So I would say  all three of us will be bringing that together.  Okay, that's good. And that definitely makes me feel  better about all of this that we would be having local downtown  advertising on our signs and not, you know, something  else. Okay.  It would be useful and  appropriate and representative of our  downtown. I just don't know what that notation  point is. Okay. And exactly how, you know, what the levels  would be. And that's the next piece of our work is  to figure that out. Okay. And it sounds like you're still figuring this out, but I  was wondering, you know, do businesses pay into this? Or is it  like every business in the DCBA already pays a fee and gets their  advertisement on there? You might still  be determining that. But if you have any insight, let me know.  Okay.  Yeah, I guess to phrase that more clearly, you're still working  on a pricing structure for advertising or is it  going to take some other form?  So we have to decide what we want to have on signs.  Like Ruth just shared, we have various ideas  of things that we think would be great. It's, Jake is doing,  he has designed work. And then we need to just talk about  what the sponsorships will look like, what the pricing  is that would be on the rotation, just all the pieces that  would go into that. Okay, thanks.  And the sponsorships, I know that the sign companies  tend to use advertiser money to maintain the sign.  Will the city make any profit off of that or does it just all go to  maintenance?  I believe it goes to maintenance.  Okay, thank you. All right, that answers my questions for now.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Anybody else?  Yes. Hi, this is Lupita. I'm probably going to ask the same  question, just probably a little bit differently. So on the kiosk,  I think it's a great idea. No one will be excluded. You indicated  that everyone downtown is part of the DCBA. That's 100% of the  100%? And then will 100% of the businesses be on the kiosk?  No, not at one time. There would be different sponsors from different  businesses.  So when I think of sponsorship, I'm thinking of like, I think of like  the bus terminals, how we have, we buy advertisements and we promote  business.  It's all great. I think that what I'm getting stuck on and I need to kind of  like get past it with your assistance is there an opportunity for people to be,  for small businesses that don't have a high income to be left behind somehow?  No.  Okay.  You know, our goal is, so yeah, I know it's a little tricky when you're, you know,  sponsorship slash advertising.  It's really advertising.  And so, you know, we would want full representation from all of our businesses.  And we try to do that anyway.  Of course.  And so frequently for the events that we do, there's tears, but we don't want anybody left behind.  We have all of our businesses are important to us and we want them all to be successful  and to get the attention they need.  So we'll, we'll do that.  So definitely put together a system that makes sense and can have great representation  from small, medium, large, you know, there's always this sort of push pull with restaurant  versus retail.  So we try to create a balance.  Thank you.  I appreciate that question Lupita because yeah, I definitely would like to make sure  that if these are public signs that we have access by all businesses to have the opportunity  to sponsor and have advertisements.  So I'm glad you asked that.  Okay.  Doesn't look like we have further questions at the moment.  Thank you.  So do we have a second?  Yeah.  Do we have a second speaker, Mike?  Okay.  Here is Shelly Price.  Hi.  Shelly, would you like to speak to us?  Yep.  Okay.  Thank you all for taking the time to consider this and not only I can't thank you enough  for speaking so positively about it and Bruce and all of your staff.  You have spent so much time on this and I can't thank you enough.  And I am here to answer any of your questions from the SUPA side obviously.  But I actually can speak at some of them that have come up as well.  Our role with our SUPA signs is to be a community of people who are not just a part of the  community of people who are not just a part of the community.  So we want to be a community of people who are not just a part of the community.  And we want to be a resource for all of our local businesses.  And we want each of the signs to have sort of as you described hyper-local content.  So we want your local businesses on the signs that are near them to be directly in front  of each sign to go to your local businesses.  And to that point, we want the advertising space and a lot of the other portions of the  screen to be accessible to businesses of all sizes.  So we offer space on the sign for as low as we can, no cost, all the way up to the  local sign sponsorships, which we aren't necessarily pushing for here because we love  the idea of having J.D.'s artwork on the signs.  But we do offer e-options as low as $90 a month to speak to the typical writing structure.  And we would work very closely with Melanie and the entire group of visits to downtown  to make sure that that actually fits.  And that we're prioritizing as a fit for the community.  And actually on the question about how the revenue from advertising goes toward different  costs, we take care of installation and maintenance entirely on the super side.  And then 20% of the revenue that we get from advertising we share back to the city.  Or to Melanie.  You can figure out how that structure should be.  And then we're kind of still in the workings of the increment.  But we do want this to be something that provides a resource in more ways than one  to the community.  So 20% of it.  And Melanie and I actually were actually on the call when we discussed that.  So I hope that's a pleasant surprise.  And then we also offer a few different portions of the screen that can be resources for local  businesses to post or read.  Especially right now during COVID, we're offering what we're calling the Woods Bookman  Athlete.  And we're not going to have a lot of public it's called something different if something's  better for Chico.  But a lot of cities are using that for businesses to post for free to say, you know, these  are the ways that we're adopting, we're adapting during COVID.  For instance, you know, we're out on the street now.  Or we've got these different hours or these specials.  And so this is in post to it to say, you know, we're still open.  And we're hoping to help them save their money in terms.  It's obviously been a crazy thing for everyone.  We are honestly the whole company is really excited about Chico.  I'm not sure if, you know, the staff that actually implemented this.  But we've actually moved away from the no cost option.  But we're keeping it for Chico because we think it's such a good fit.  We know there's such a cool community.  We know that the engagement with the signs would be high.  And it really would be a community resource first.  So we're really excited to offer it to you so it can be at no cost with a revenue share.  And other than that, I'm just thinking, you know, for people who can consider the exchange and all the work that's led to it.  I'm happy to wrap up and answer other questions.  Thank you, Shelly.  Do we have any questions, Commission?  I think you've answered our questions so far.  All right. Thanks.  Mike, do we have a third speaker?  There's one more speaker.  I suppose.  I don't know if he wants to speak.  I solicited him to raise his hand.  He did not.  But we may ask him now if he's ready to speak.  If he wants to.  Talking is permitted now.  If you want to speak to us, go ahead.  If not, that's fine, too.  All right.  Then I suppose not.  Okay.  So no further speakers.  Any further questions?  Any other questions for people?  Oh, Tony has a question.  First, I'm sorry.  So I think my question, I don't want to get into the, I know what we're doing is a land use policy.  So the sponsorship and things like that.  I think the reason the question's coming up for me is, like, typically when we're doing any sort of updates to the municipal code of conduct, we're going to be asking questions about land use.  And so I think that's something that applies across the board.  So, like, if we were doing an update to a sign ordinance, it's going to affect every, on whether somebody can have, what are they called, those signs that hang out.  That's something that impacts everybody within the sign ordinance.  But this would be something that we're making a policy that would just to allow for the city to do something.  And because we're doing that.  And maybe, Vince, this is a question for you.  Do we run into any, I think the idea is great, but there's no open competition for that.  We would be doing that just for us and then allowing a specific use that nobody else would be able to take advantage of.  Is that?  I can take a try at that.  The city can choose whatever vendor we want.  So to be a governmental sign, it could be any product, any vendor that the city chooses.  And then, and the city can expand the area.  It still is a citywide because that's one of the reasons why they wanted to have the ability to do this in other areas.  Fortunately, there'll be other places where this will be handy and it will be thriving and we'll have that kind of activity.  So it's not isolated to this one downtown area.  In theory, it could happen in other areas if there's enough demand.  And it would be this.  I understand it would be the city councils or the community development directors discretion on who gets that.  That's not what we're deciding.  But from a land use perspective, and maybe this is, do we have enough?  Is there enough flexibility here or do we need to be more inclusive?  I'm not sure I understand your question.  I think it's up to you.  Is there enough flexibility for what?  We are making a land use change that solely benefits the city.  Because nobody else would be able to do this in these zones.  So we're making a land use policy that solely benefits us for these right now.  And I'm picturing them as like drive-thrus.  They will run with the property.  So whatever happens, that's our property.  We can decide what we're going to do with them.  But then the fact that nobody else would be able to do anything with that because those signs.  Like those are just in our...  Are you following me, Mike?  They're in the right of way.  They're in the right of way.  So like nobody else could do that except for the city.  And that's okay.  Okay.  That we're making a special exception for us?  It's similar.  The other example when we got in and got into the sign agreements like this.  And this may help you.  I don't know if it will.  But for advertising on bus kiosks that are also within the right of way.  And there was a big deal about the illumination for the advertising.  And we went through a code amendment to allow that.  But that's the same kind of thing.  This is street furniture and it's got a commercial public-private partnership.  That helps me.  The bus kiosks help me.  And then the other question is, are these...  Would we be passing this map along with the ordinance or is this just an idea of what...  I think they don't have an agreement yet.  I think that's up to the council and downtown association.  I think you've heard they're still working on the details.  I think those are the...  That was the...  Those are the locations that they've envisioned thus far.  So I don't know if it's going to be binding, so to speak.  Vince, I think my hangup was we're making a special exception for ourselves in the public right of way that a commercial business would not be able to do.  Right.  Excercise the police power.  Yes.  To do that.  That's the .  Okay.  Sure.  I already had a question.  Okay.  I'm going to jump on this as well.  So I think that the question is we are going to vote on a signage ordinance for the downtown Chico.  And we have collaborated with a vendor to...  And we have a design.  And moving forward...  We're here to approve the project to move forward to let's do this.  And you've selected your vendor.  You also...  I think that...  I think that in the future, should you decide, you have the freedom of the city.  Okay.  Two things.  So I start a business in downtown.  I will be able to...  I will be included.  I will be required.  Because I'm part of the CBA.  Kind of like when you buy a home and you have to pay for whatever that's called.  I can't think of it.  But it'll come.  But you know what it is.  HOA.  What is that?  An HOA.  Yeah.  HOA.  Yeah.  HOA.  So this would be similar to that because this is established.  Just like anything else.  We have ordinances and to be able to follow.  To be able to follow.  So I think that...  I think that...  I know I really like this.  I know I really like this idea.  But I appreciate the struggle in trying to understand what it is and exactly the world  today.  So the vendor issue.  We have one vendor right now.  If you should...  If you want, you could change a vendor if you'd like as a city.  So that should...  And the competition is really to benefit us, yes.  But that's what the city is here to do.  The city is here to promote itself to grow based on the general plan.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I think that's what we're doing here.  And so we're going to approve this, hopefully because it benefits the city of Chico and it  makes it prettier.  Does that help?  Yeah.  Okay.  Vince, what you said was really helpful, that we would be exercising that prerogative and  I think it was more for me...  We are doing something for ourselves that we would never do for an independent community  business if somebody came and asked us to amend a sign ordinance to  or even in downtown if a private business came and said we want to amend the sign ordinance to  allow us to put signs in the public right-of-way we would not do that but we're doing it for us  but i think the leveraging is um when do we use that power um and how do we how do we best  leverage that power and i think we leverage that power when it's for the community good  and this is something that is for the community good um so as much as a private business couldn't  do this um because we are the city we can and we can amplify and do this to make the city a better  place that's what i mean yeah and ultimately i can add ultimately it's up to the council to  decide if they want to use that and so if they don't then they don't play the game so  so  okay and no no i've just you kind of hit what i was going to say at the end but  yeah we're not locked into sofa for example i mean it's all we're doing is allowing the city to  have the option of doing these signs and it's up to the city council to determine  if they want to approve sofa or anybody else correct  good yeah i was a little concerned  um i think that's a good point i think that's a good point i think that's a good point  i think that's a good point i think that's a good point i think that's a good point  reading the staff report that it seemed kind of like the city was maybe shaping or the the intent  might have been to shape the sign code to fit a specific product but i hope we're allowing enough  flexibility that if there was in the future or now like a different sign product company  that would suit our needs and benefit the public good that we could also use that do you think that  that's the case yes i do okay good  that's all i wanted to hear thank you bruce  okay oh and i forgot to say officially closing the public hearing  um so that's closed further commission discussion  or we can make a motion um i hope to adopt resolution number 21-03 recommending the city  council adoption of an ordinance to amend title 19 of the chico municipal code as set forth there  i seconded that  thank you both okay moved and seconded further discussion  seeing none all in favor please say aye  any abstentions any opposed all right motion carries it's kind of like karaoke up there guys  wait you passed that mic i really i'm enjoying that  um okay so we've passed the motion so we're going to move on to the next item  item five regular agenda do we have anything looks like none no okay reports and communications  yes madam chair just to let you know um if you've checked the housing element website we have the  results from the first community meeting up there and so you can see the surveys and the answers  everything's been put on there you can you can even watch the meeting again and i think you'll  like this one of the there's a tool on there now it's an interactive tool  so you check it out you can um kind of put your developer hat on and run through a simulation  where it allows you to have to deal with the cost of land cost of building and funding and layering  all these funds together to get a project to work so that you understand the complexities of  delivering an affordable housing project and so i think that was helpful or at least give some  some folks the ability to have a you know a bit of a working understanding of how difficult it is to get a project to work  one of these things to work but it's a pretty simple easy interactive tool that's on the website  so if you check out housing element under resources um you can check you can find it there  that's all i wanted to say thanks for sharing that bruce i'll have to check that out  in the simulation do you have to uh experience the planning commission and the harsh questions  of the commission that's a joke sorry um yeah cool i will check that out thanks for that um  thanks for reporting that all right any exciting reports and communications from our side  today is right my last planning commission meeting and i want to say that it's been a real pleasure  and an honor to to work with you all and and i know it won't be the last time and thank you for  it's been a great experience thank you lupita i appreciate all of your work  and it's great to work and it's great to work and it's great to work and it's great to work  and it's great to work and it's great to work and it's great to work and it's great to work  and it's great to work and it's great to work and it's great to work and it's great to work  and it's great to work and it's great to work and it's great to work and it's great to work  and it's great to work and it's great to work  and it's great to work and it's great to work  tree maps because of Commissioner  Howlett, so I'm  thankful that we've had your guys'  service.  Yeah, thank you, Lupita,  and we'll also miss John  and his tree stewardship.  Is it, is  Ken returning or not?  Oh, yeah, he had the two-year term.  Ah, well, we'll miss  him too. Darn.  But it'll be exciting times  having new commission members.  Yeah,  and it's probably my last night as chair, so  it's been an honor to get to bang the gavel.  I kind of wish that I got to experience  the rowdiness of having the public in the  room.  Oh, well.  I got to experience the funkiness of the  online public input.  Cool, and thank you, staff, for  dealing with all of the weird online-ness  of the past year, and  all of our shenanigans.  All right, well, I think we can  adjourn then.
