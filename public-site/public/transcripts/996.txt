Anybody wishing to address the council on any matters listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the chamber and turned into the city clerk. Speakers are taken in the order in which the cards are received. And once the speaker is called, no additional cards will be accepted. I will mention, I'm not a member of the board, but I will mention that, of course, other than swearing in and welcoming new council members, we try not to applaud or boo anyone speaking. If you have signs, you can hold them at the back of the room, but not in the audience. And we appreciate your respect towards both members of the council, city staff, and people within our city, too. So please limit your comments in that respect to be respectful of those among us. All right. So at this point, we'll do a presentation by Cal Recycle. Welcome. I'll have to fire up the presentation first. Good evening, mayor and the council members. Welcome. Let me just... We'll get your mic hot there, too. There we go. All right, go ahead and try it out. All right. Good evening, mayor and the council members. And thank you for inviting us to present on SB 1383. My name is Panera Kose, and I am the city's local assistance and market development liaison. This presentation you see up there is an overview, very high-level overview of the requirements for the compliance for SB 1383. Why is SB 1383 important? As you can see in the slide, also organic waste comprises half of Cal Recycle, California's disposed waste stream. Food waste comprises 13% of the state's disposed waste. This is happening while so many Californians go hungry every night in California. Another important reason that this is so important is the fight against climate change. SB 1383 passed in 2016 as part of California's largest strategy to combat climate change. The law was designed to reduce global warming, super pollutants like methane, which is up to 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Landfills are one of the three largest producers of methane in the state. When organic materials break down in the landfill, methane is generated. So we need to move away from landfilling organic waste. SB 1383 requirements. SB 1383 is a statewide target that requires California to, regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation with jurisdictions and other stakeholders over the past three and a half years to complete the regulations that are final as of November 3, 2020. While the regulations take effect in 2022, jurisdictions have to plan now so they can be in compliance by January 1, 2022, which is just a few months away. There are many benefits if we successfully implement California's super pollutants reduction strategy. These include environmental benefits such as fighting climate change, improved air quality, and less landfill waste, providing millions of meals to Californians without enough to eat, and creating thousands of new green jobs. So these are the key implementation dates throughout the rulemaking process. The most important dates to note are the regulations become enforceable. January 1, 2022. This means that starting January 2022, jurisdictions must have their programs in place and CalRecycle can begin enforcement actions on jurisdictions and other entities. In 2024, jurisdictions will be required to take enforcement against non-compliant entities. This slide provides a brief overview of the program requirements that jurisdictions must得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得 provided the service rather than subscribing to it. The regulation standards container colors across the state, and this to be fully implemented in January 1st, 2036, and require a jurisdiction to place a label on each new container or lid provided to generators starting January 1st, 2022. Jurisdictions or their haulers must monitor containers for contamination. Jurisdictions can issue three types of waivers to generators, which are de minimis, physical space, and collection frequency. The regulations also place requirements on residents and commercial businesses. Jurisdictions must conduct annual education and outreach to all generators. This includes informational methods for the prevention of pollution. This includes the implementation of organic waste generation, recycling organic waste on site, and sending organic waste to community composting. This also includes information regarding programs for the donation of edible food. Jurisdictions must also procure certain levels of recovered organic waste products, such as compost, renewable gas, or electricity from biomass conversion. Each jurisdiction will have a minimum procurement target that is linked to its population. There are requirements to purchase recycled content paper and paper products if price and performance is comparable. CalRecycle will notify jurisdictions of their target prior to January 1st, 2022. Each jurisdiction must plan for adequate capacity for recycling organic waste and edible food recovery. Each county will lead this effort by coordinating with cities, special districts that provide solid waste collection services and regional agencies located within the county. SB 1383 extends beyond directing waste management and recycling operations and staff. This slide shows that every department within local government will be affected and have a role to play. Each department will need to understand how SB 1383 impacts their work. Jurisdictions should be thinking and planning for this. This slide shows the role of the local government in the development of the local government.得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得 of existing edible food recovery and expanding existing infrastructure, if necessary, conducting inspections of Tier 1 commercial edible food generators and food recovery organizations and services, which begins in 2022, and inspections of Tier 2 commercial edible food generators beginning January 1, 2024. SB 1383 related inspections of food recovery organizations and food recovery services will be limited to verifying that the recordkeeping requirements have been met. Inspections should be at level or rate to adequately determine compliance with the requirements. Annual inspections of each Tier 1 and Tier 2 commercial edible food generator is not required. Beginning in 2024, jurisdictions must take enforcement action on commercial edible food generators that are out of compliance with edible food recovery requirements. By January 1, 2022, jurisdictions are required to have an enforcement mechanism or ordinance in place. Between January 2022 and December 2023, jurisdictions need to identify businesses in violation of the regulatory requirements and provide educational material to those who need it. Behavioural regulation regulation regulation regulation or NOV, and issue penalties to a generator. The jurisdiction has the flexibility to develop its own enforcement process within these parameters. An early, robust education program will minimize the amount of enforcement action needed. Also, if the jurisdiction is automatically providing service to its residents and commercial businesses, this further minimizes the need for enforcement actions. To reduce reporting, jurisdictions are required to maintain records and keep information in an implementation record. Each jurisdiction is required to report to the department annually on its implementation and compliance with the requirements of SB 1383. In the case of entities such as public universities, school districts, federal facilities which are exempt from local solid waste oversight,得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得 included some aspects of flexibility in enforcement of the regulations that are similar to the AB 939 good faith effort requirements but are tailored to the different nature of SB 133 requirements. Under the regulations if CalRecycle determines that jurisdiction is violating one or more of the requirements CalRecycle will provide compliance assistance such as checklists, model tools and training. Although CalRecycle may begin penalty enforcement on regulated entities starting January 2022 the timelines for the enforcement process are not triggered under the CalRecycle issues at NNOV. Once CalRecycle determines enforcement actions or penalties are necessary CalRecycle will implement the process outlined in SB 1383. The regulations include a compliance jurisdiction, review and enforcement process that allows for extended timelines for jurisdictions under certain circumstances. This could be up to three years from the issuance of an NNOV to come into compliance before penalties are issued. Penalties are imposed as a last resort after all other compliance actions have failed. CalRecycle is helping jurisdictions a number of ways including the recently released four model tools. These include model franchise agreement, model mandatory organics disposal reduction ordinance, model organic waste product procurement policy and model edible for recovery agreement. There are three local jurisdiction service rates study which provides guidance on setting organics recycling rates was made available to jurisdictions in early March 2021. We also have case studies on jurisdictions that have set rates funded infrastructure and education for the public and elected officials. Recently published tools also include a best management practices guidance document for identifying tier one and tier two commercial edible food generators. In early 2021 we released a procurement calculator tool and held an accompanying webinar to help jurisdictions plan and track procurement activities. If you have a regional agency we have a model language for amending a JPA. We publish organic waste and edible food recovery calculator tools to help with the capacity planning requirements along with a webinar to cover this guidance. We also release a survey tool that jurisdictions can use to gather information from food recovery organizations and services about their capacity. We have many other tools that have been released or are scheduled to be released soon. To help jurisdictions with maintaining records on-site we are developing a model implementation record-keeping tool. We are developing a tool for best management practices for conducting route reviews. We're developing series of training videos to support further developing understanding of regulation requirements later this year. We will be releasing department issued waiver forms for jurisdictions that will apply for a waiver later this year. We will be having a new technology review process and applications which are set in Article 2 CARESEC is working with a contractor on a data research for statewide education campaign. The focus is using community social-based marketing to drive changes in behavior. In late 2021, we expect to start releasing many tools and training for jurisdictions. Our staff can also help individual jurisdictions with the implementation tools. We can identify funding resources for companies that want to site or expand their recycling manufacturing operations, and we can answer your questions about the regulations. If there are other tools that you need, please let us know. All right. Thank you. Just one thing. Sorry. Sure. The City of Chico is on its way to implementing a program that will meet SB 1383 regulations, and we would like to acknowledge the City for working on the following efforts. The City of Chico is in the preparation for 2022, working together with the haulers in the county. The City is working on organics capacity planning. Likewise, with the lead of the county's environmental health and public works department, the City of Chico is working on edible food recovery capacity plan to implement the program by 2022. And this is the end of my presentation. Thank you so much. And if you have any questions, I would like to call my supervisor, Robert Carson, in case we have questions. All right. Questions from council? I have a question. So other than hating SB 1383 and what it does to our communities and what it makes everyone do, are there, you know, there's a lot of requirements in terms of what this is for local jurisdictions. Did the wise legislature approve any funding? Right. So there's, there's, there are. There are some discussions about providing funding. I think that right now there's at least one bill in the legislature contemplating that. And I think there was at least something in the budget. So as far as a legislative source of funding, that would be the opportunity to look for funding that way. CalRecycle also provides funding, not specifically for 1383, but for programs that can help be developed to implement 1383. We have grants programs for organic waste development, as well as some of our... There are other grants programs. We have loans programs and others that... But in anything in terms of the jurisdictions? The jurisdictions would be available. We'll be able to apply for those grant programs, certainly. That's all. All right. Yeah. So there are some out there that the city would be available for. Okay. Anyone else? Question? All right. Thank you very much. No, thank you. All right. We'll move on with the consent agenda. The consent agenda is for those... This item is routine in nature and, therefore, can be acted upon in one motion. But we do... We are pulling item 2.5 at the request of staff to be heard at a later date. So if you are here to speak on item 2.5 in the consent agenda, it will be heard at a later date. And then I believe we have one item to be pulled, correct? I'd like to pull item 2.4, please. Okay. So item 2.4 will be pulled and discussed separately. And then... Do we have any speakers? We do. We have three speakers, I believe, for consent. All right. And if you're... We actually may have four now. Okay. So if you're a speaker on the consent agenda, we'd want you to address either 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, or 2.4. So just so you know, we do have business from the floor. That's for general comments. But if you want to speak about a particular item, you need to keep your comments limited to that particular item. So, all right. So we'll start with... Should we move to council disqualifications first? Sure. All right. Do I have any council disqualifications on any item? I'm going to recuse myself from 2.4. Mr. Mayor? Yes. Can you clarify for the public? I'm sure most people know that comments on consent include items that are pulled from the agenda. Yes. So you can comment on 2.5, obviously, even though it's been pulled. All right. So we'll start with public comment now. Okay. So our first speaker is DeJohn Jones, followed by Angela McLaughlin. And if you're the second name that I call, go ahead and line up in the back. So, again, it's DeJohn Jones, followed by Angela McLaughlin. And if your name was called second, if you could just wait in the aisle, we'd appreciate that. Or just come down and get ready. That helps us move a little faster. Welcome. Hello, everyone. My name is DeJohn, like the mustard, and I'm an American. So when it comes to item 2.4, just to be sure, that's dealing with the homeless issue, correct? Okay. I am homeless, but I'm also the outreach director for Butte Community College for Associated Student Government. Before I became homeless, I worked for HHIP. That's the Homeless Housing and Insecurity Pilot Program. We help students who have homeless and housing insecurities receive housing and funding for those housing. 2005, at the age of 15, I went into incarceration, and I stayed there for 13 years to the age of 28. I joined Butte Community College after moving to Chico, and I said to myself, I need to be able to articulate the world around me. I did grade in school. Then the pandemic hit. I asked at the, like, two weeks before school was over, if I could just remove myself due to my mental health issue. I'm computer illiterate. They granted me to remove myself, but I got fired from my job because I had to be enrolled in class. I'm coming today because I developed a program called ASIC Peers, where we provide 24-7 peer mentoring support so that we can be the change that we wish to see. I do not like being homeless. It plays on my self-worth. Two years in society, I mean, it kind of hurts. So I'm asking that. If you have it in you to bring me up so that I can be a vessel to reach out to the homeless community, the mental health community, and be a beacon of light, I would really like that because you, I got one, I want to use all my time. You learn more about an experience by undergoing that experience. And living in the streets, I really see with clear light where I can fit in. So please help me, help myself, help my community. Again, Dijon Johnson. Thank you. Angela McLaughlin followed by Patrick Newman. Good evening. It's alarming that Point of Contact is being awarded a $49,900 no-bid contract. It's clear the number was specifically derived to give them the maximum amount possible without being required to go out for bids. It's worth noting that the number is not the same as the number that was given to them in the first place. It's worth noting that while several of the people involved in this organization seem to have good intentions, their practices have been questionable and in some cases have included posting pictures and videos of unhoused people without their permission. Even calling the police on one man who had the temerity to refuse their outreach. There are many local organizations that have licensed clinical social workers who could provide effective outreach, quite possibly at lower cost. And those options should be explored. In addition, thanks Casey for recusing yourself on this, Casey Reynolds was the one that began Verum Community Solutions. And only recently, in March, signed it over to Lori Maloney. The gifting of nearly $50,000 to this organization feels based on connections to council members and feels that it reeks of impropriety. This item should be pulled and submitted to the Council of Councilors. And put on a future agenda for public comment as well as put out for bids. Thank you. Patrick Newman followed by Anna Meehan. So 2.4, the block grant funding, both the caring choices and point of contact. What we're doing as a community, and this is just for the record because I don't think any of this is going to change. We're systematically deploying the community. We're depriving people on the streets of things that they need. I call it engineered deprivation. And there's a reason for that. And it's in the rhetoric. I've heard it across the board. And it's to make Chico as homeless, hostile as possible. To drive the homeless to other cities if possible. And I think to destabilize the population too. And so we're seeing, I mean I sort of have my finger on the pulse here because every Sunday I'm on the plaza. I spend time on the plaza. I spend time downtown with people. We're also there Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 9 o'clock. I invite all of you to join us. Trying to replace what's been removed with the removal of the Jesus Center. Which was our only no barrier source of food and clothing in this community. So what's that all about? I mean does anybody ever stop and ask themselves what direction we're going here? Why these things are happening? Why we, in a place like Comanche Creek and the other camps, we've systematically deprived people of what they need? When we first went to Shelter in Place, I sent an email asking our city manager and the homeless coordinator at the time for $50,000 worth of materials. I didn't ask for funding. I'm not asking for a paycheck. I was asking for the city to requisition food, tents, tarps. And to go ahead and fund the food. And the toilets. And showers. And all the things that would make these camps livable. We just had a homicide at Comanche Creek. I suppose that's going to, you know, the blame will go everywhere toward our community. Which has made these situations as difficult and impossible for people as they can possibly be. That's not happening by accident. So when I look at this kind of funding, especially the $50,000 for point of contact. I ask myself where $50,000 could go when we're talking about actually alleviating suffering in our community. And if you don't have your finger on the pulse, if you haven't seen the person laying on the sidewalk yesterday and been there, you don't know what the suffering looks like. So, again, I would invite you to get closer to it. Feel it. And then start trying to match up these numbers with what you're seeing. In the middle of winter, a person needs a sleeping bag. These kinds of things. These are things that are really fundamental. And we have to scratch and scrape to find a few dollars to do that. While millions of dollars are spent on things like salaries and things that do not address people's immediate needs. Thank you. And water at Comanche Creek, too. Anna Meehan is our last speaker. Hello. The microphone is just right there. Just a second. I'm just here because I'm concerned. Like Patrick said, Comanche Creek, there was an assault, a murder. And a friend of mine heard from an unhoused. Sorry to interrupt you. Debbie, the timer. Oh, it's showing. Okay. Sorry. Go ahead. I apologize. I'm sorry. You may speak. And it's just really unfortunate. It's really sad. And you can imagine with the heat and the lack of water and just, you know, people have mental health problems. And their needs are being met. And I know, like, people just want to push them away. Push them somewhere else or whatever. But like Gerard Ungerman said once, like, the situation is like a big balloon. You squish them out of one place, they're just going to go somewhere else. But locally. And my understanding about the place by the airport, that just, there's no shade. It's not close to services. So it's like a concentration camp. But not exactly like that. But just like not sending them away. So basically, when I'm looking at this, I'm glad to read that chat has been allotted money. And I hope that will continue. And another thing that I've just heard, I like to ride my bike around this summer. And I've been riding by the Chico Friends meeting. I don't know if you're aware. But they've been having a cooling station there. As well as a safe space during the winter. So I'm really happy to see that. That at least they're doing what they can. But I think as a city, we need to do more. So I have to say thank you. That was our last speaker. All right. So we'll take item 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. And we'll take item 2.3. Together. And why don't we do the vote on that. And then we'll move on to item 2.1. Right. So it would be a motion to approve the consent agenda. Move to approve. Second. I'm sorry. Who was the person who made the motion? Councilmember Cannon. Okay. Actually, yeah. And the second? Second. Okay, I'm sorry. Vice Mayor Reynolds was the motion? That's what I thought. Okay, so I changed that. Apologies. There's more of us now. It shouldn't be a problem after all these years. Okay. Okay. Council Member Bennett. Aye. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. And Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Okay, we'll move on to item 2.4, which was hold. I actually have a couple of questions for Ms. Demers, if you wouldn't mind. Good evening. Hello. You've mentioned that the selection of organizations to support with these dollars was kind of meticulously done. Can you explain the process for selecting organizations to receive these additional monies in this last wave of funding? Sure. There were actually two RFPs put out, one initially and then a second one through our homeless solutions coordinator. Basically, the idea back in May, council had directed that these funds should go toward a resting site. Okay. In the future. And so, toward that effort, the RFP was put out, and there were responses, and then it was decided that they wanted, that it needed to go out again. So it was, it went out again, and then that's the basis for the Caring Choices recommendation. And then, knowing that the resting space is a bit in the air right now. And knowing that we need to move forward. We're not going to move this through, so that we don't lose this funding. What we decided was that it would probably be in the best interest to go ahead and allow a portion of the funds to be allocated to an organization that could get moving right away. And then, the bulk of the funding would obviously go toward the respondent to the RFP, who would then, at that point, we would know where and more specifics of what was to be provided. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. that both organizations will be doing outreach, why wouldn't we allocate all funding to Caring Choices so that the process between outreach, shelter, services is more seamless rather than incorporating a new organization into the process? Your support mentions working with organizations to avoid duplication of services, but wouldn't not duplicating services be the best way to approach that? Right, and that's why it would definitely be, certain areas would be delineated. And again, I think that the point of contact would be able to pretty much hit the ground running right away, and then Caring Choices would basically follow. So is it my understanding that Caring Choices could not begin providing outreach services right away? Well, I think that they would want, they could, conceivably, sure. But I think that we need to have a more robust, we need to know exactly what that agreement's going to be with that organization. Do we know what that would look like with the other organizations? Is that the only condition that is being requested to receive the funding? Yes, because it would strictly be outreach, no additional services. Okay, I have some comments, but if other folks have questions, I yield. All right, any other questions? I have a question for Mr. Orme, maybe Marie. So it's always interesting on the day of a council meeting, everybody wants to talk about everything that's been on the agenda. And so I think it's really important that we have a lot of people on the agenda like Tom DiGiovanni called me today at 5.10. By the way, I'll never call you back if you do that on a council meeting day. So I got a call, actually a couple calls from some people I trust, and they were concerned, didn't necessarily say negative things about Caring Choices, but they're like, wow, there seems to be a lack of experience. There's not a lot of track record there. And it came from someone that maybe could have been a provider. So I said, wow, that would have been really good information, say, a week ago, months ago. So I think it's really important to know where this is coming from. And then they said, well, the RFQ was slightly incomprehensible. And I'm like, again, that would have been good information two months ago. But I heard it from more than one place. So this is not about, I'm talking about Caring Choices at this point. It's not about Caring Choices. My question is, if there was some consternation about how the RFQ went out, how people answered it, and exactly what our strategy is, is there a different strategy other than allocating 500-something thousand dollars to an organization that may or may not be capable of delivering this without, as Marie pointed out, without losing the money? I don't want to lose the money, but at the same time, I don't want to give it to the only people that ask for it. So I'm in a quandary, because if I'm forced to do that, I'll probably do nothing, and then we end up with nothing. I can answer that, Council Member Morgan. And Ms. Demers, correct me if I'm wrong, but you and I actually had a conversation with regard to if a scenario rolled out such as, you know, if a scenario rolled out, and if a scenario rolled out, and the simple fact is, we need to make sure that HUD has the information associated with how the monies are going to be spent. A council at this time doesn't have to actually designate an entity. It makes it easier for paperwork's sake, but it doesn't have to be. What that would then do is, if the council decided to go without identifying the service provider, we would have to then go out for another RFP and do it in a way that's focused purely for service provision. Okay, so then one more follow-up question. I'm sorry. I'm looking forward in the agenda, and we have Hope Street Coalition giving a presentation or consideration of a homeless strategic plan, which seems like it might play into this as well. So I'm just thinking out loud, if we can hold on to the money without designating it anywhere, and then we hear about what's going to happen there, maybe we'll be better suited to move forward than we are now. I guess that was more of a statement than a question. It's logical. Thank you. The only issue is we may run into some timing issues. So we have to use these funds within a certain period of time. But like August 15th? No. No, no, no. But I mean, what is recommended may or may not fit kind of the coronavirus situation. And then I believe it's 2026. We have some time, but we do have to keep you in the loop. Yeah, no, I'm not saying I want to put this off for six years or even six months. And you made a good point with, I forget what you said, but the resting site, what's happening there, what's happening here, hard to offer or answer an RFP or queue if you don't know exactly where we're headed. If we can shore that up, I think some of that might be coming more at a closed session today. Maybe we can align all of our ducks and get even more bang for our buck, which is what I'd really like to see. All right, further questions? Thank you. I have some comments. You got a, oh, okay. Go ahead with comments. Yeah, so I'm actually on the other end of that conversation because I would happily support Caring Choices' proposal, although for such a large grant, it would be great to allow the public to see the larger proposal framework. Councilman Brown, I'm sorry, but it's really hard to hear you. And I know that's partly the mask, but maybe if you could just say that. Maybe you could get a little closer to the mic. I'll do my best. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that said, Caring Choices actually does have a long history in our community. The commitment to evidence and warm practices and a track record of success in their diverse programs and projects. I place a lot of confidence in their ability to manage a large grant and the reporting requirements associated with it. What's more is they'd already submitted a substantial proposal to the city prior to this funding becoming available, so we know what we're getting. I don't feel comfortable committing city funding to the other organizations listed here. Who's only experiencing managing grant funding seems to have come from Butte County at a $10,000 grant early this year. Ms. Demers mentioned in her report that the HUD reporting and accounting processes are strict and to award nearly $50,000 of these funds to a brand new organization who hasn't dealt with these requirements isn't good fiscal management. There are multiple other outreach organizations who've been doing this for a very long time and have built that credibility that should have access to these opportunities, including Caring Choices, who has outreach, listed as part of their services and their proposal. I will vote no if the motion includes just under $50,000 to point of contact, and I'll happily vote yes to allocate that $49,900 to Caring Choices to conduct further outreach to unsheltered populations in Chico or to another organization with a proven track record in conducting outreach to our unhoused community. All right. I'm going to entertain a motion. Thank you. Thank you. New committee. Master Chief. So in light of my earlier comments, I would like to, and Skipper, I'm going to need your help with this, maybe, set the money aside for the things we said we were going to set it aside for without naming anyone. And if that requires putting out the RFQP, whatever we're calling it today, am I right? And let's just make sure it's clear and perhaps have a better idea what our needs are as we move forward with our litigation and our potential strategy. Is that a motion? Yes, sir. All right. I'll second. I propose a substitute motion to approve the funding to Caring Choices and either allocate that $49,900 to Caring Choices to expand outreach services or, or reserve that for an alternative organization. All right. We have a substitute motion. Do we have a second? No substitute motion. Second. That motion fails, returning the original motion. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Okay. Okay. So it was a motion by Councilmember Morgan. And who was the second? I apologize. I was. Okay. That's, I knew that actually. And that was to set the money aside without naming a particular entity. If we have to send out the RFP again, have it be clear and perhaps include the, the ideas as we move forward with the litigation and the strategy. Councilmember Bennett? Aye. Let's see. Sorry. Councilmember Brown? No. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds is recused on this item. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries five with one no and one recusal. All right. All right. Moving on to business from the floor. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not listed on the agenda. With comments being limited to three minutes, or determined based upon the number of speakers. How many speakers do we have? We have 10. 10. Okay. We'll do three minutes. The council cannot. We will not take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. And again, if your name is called second, if you could just, or if you're the next person, if you could maybe make your way to the aisle so you can be ready to speak, we'd appreciate that. Okay. The first speaker is Jessica Giannola, followed by Robin Engel. Council, the council. Uh, I'd like to again ask that the city reinstate the shelter crisis declaration. Uh, we need to have that reinstated. It should never have fallen off the map there. Winter will be here soon. Uh, even if we had a plan in motion right now and executed, hey, let's go ahead and get this plan started for shelter, its going to take months to get that set up and winter is going to be here. another life was lost again due to the unhoused crisis that would not have happened out there at Comanche if people weren't living in a state of survival they're traumatized they're living in the moment with constant attacks from every angle that's where their brain exists it was completely avoidable if we had a plan in action and people and a path that life could still be here today so people are they're living out there they're surviving they have untreated conditions addiction the more we push them the more we take from them the more they're going to in survival mode affect the community so petty crime stealing from cars and houses to try to make ends meet I know we have something going on with the recycling center and that going down well that's an income source so when that only income source goes down where are they going to get money from so we will see the impact we could instead be helping them get into a stable spot so that the community is safer so I do a lot of advocacy and outreach in our city all the time I'm not the only one there's a lot of us that do it and I could tell you that we do it because we care and we're knowledgeable and we make partnerships and we're out there trying to save lives of our community members and when people do that kind of thing it's like a tech it's a catastrophe is what it is so people come in and they can do this for a while and after a certain amount of time but there's an exhaustion there and so a lot of us that were feeling it but we're feeling that the partnership is not here with the city we were no problem with jumping and go, okay, we can do this. We can get water out there. We can get food out there. We can get supplies out there. But we're hoping the whole time that the city is going to step up with an actual plan and literally put effort into helping them, not putting off a decision or rerouting money or not putting faith into established, proven partnerships with the community. We need to have more of you guys, the city, the city and the planning step up and help our city by helping these people. They are our city. Thank you. Robin Engle, followed by Joe Caldialago. Rule by fear and force is destructive to any community, and we see this increasing day by day here in Chico. I want to draw attention to the imbalance of power with our police force. Over 50% of our general budget, approaching 55 and 60% of our general budget does go to the Chico Police Department. This compares to cities of the same size, approximately the same size, Davis at 12%, Boulder, Colorado, 13.7%, and Richmond, California, 18%. Looking at a much huger city, New Orleans,得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得 attack. These are just honest, true facts. And we've heard reports that crime has decreased. Chico is a relatively low crime city. So there's no reason for this incrementally increased amount of funding going to our police department if it's to fight crime, because we're not hearing about crimes. We've heard, in fact, from you, I believe, former Police Chief O'Brien, that crime had decreased several years ago, and that we've heard repeatedly that there's no racism whatsoever on the police department. So if that's true, why do we keep increasing millions of dollars and keep pouring millions into the police? I did read through, I didn't read every page of the over 800-page police report, but I did read through the over 800-page police report. And I think it's in the police manual. But I did not see a mandate for police officer training. I did see reference to a mandate, and I saw many loopholes stated in the manual for getting out of that training, which include vacation or sick leave or other. So I thought that was interesting, the focus on ways of bypassing any kind of training when you're on the police department versus having mandated training. There needs to be a mandate for police officers to be able to train. And I think that's a good regulation. So when I'm in the sanitary department, when I'm in sanitary regulation, when I'm in sanitary regulation, when I'm in sanitary regulation, when I'm in sanitary regulation, when I'm in sanitary regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation I've been very successful with building and maintaining long-standing relationships and helping with getting folks out of the housing crisis. And I just want to say that there are many better options than rule by fear and force. Thank you. So Joe Cotolago, followed by Debbie Adams. Good evening, Council. Joe Cotolago. I'm with Waste Management. I'm just here tonight to introduce a new team member of ours, Christian Garcia. He just started about a month and a half ago as our new sustainability representative. He will be helping out with a lot of recycling education and recycling outreach for business and residential customers. He graduated in 2018 from CSU Chico with a degree in sustainability. So we're really excited to have him on the team. So you'll see him around town helping out our customers and resolving customer issues as well. So we're both based in our Chico office. And so we'll be point of contacts for any kind of customer service related issues or questions. So thank you. Thanks. Debbie Adams, followed by Julie Threat. Good evening. Mayor Fulich, Vice Mayor Reynolds and Council. So my name is Debbie Adams, and I'm here on behalf of Point of Contact. Thank you for this opportunity to have a conversation. Thank you. I'm going to share my connection with you all and sharing with you what we actually are doing out there versus what people are telling you that you're doing. One of the things I want to, a couple of things I want to do is a couple of definitions. One of them is outreach. And a definition of outreach is the extending of services or assistance beyond current or usual circumstances. So think about that. The extending of services or assistance beyond current or unusual circumstances. And I think that's a good thing. And I think that right now we can all agree that Chico is under some very unusual circumstances. And outreach goes far beyond trying to do outreach from behind a desk. But it requires us to go out into the field and have conversations with people under bridges in Comanche Creek, Tigard Ponds, Lindo Channel, and other areas in the community where people are in need. One other definition I want to share with you is squalor. The state of being extremely dirty and unpleasant, especially as a result of poverty, or neglect. Poverty and neglect go hand in hand in our community right now. We know that we have people in circumstances that are there because of situations that have happened in their life that have them, they can't afford housing and whatnot. But we are certainly in a very current emergency state of neglect of our community folks, especially when you look at Comanche Creek and other areas where people are in need. People are literally living in disarray and circumstances that just are inappropriate. Point of contact has been going out since March. We've been doing outreach. We have been going under bridges and we have been visiting Comanche Creek and all the other areas. Back in April when we did a survey for the county, which wasn't our survey, it was a county survey, so I can't share information about that. So please don't ask questions. But during that survey, I came across a woman at the Mangrove Bridge that I became very good connection with and my heart for some reason really reached out to her. And on July 11th, she lost her life to circumstances that we don't really know what happened. But she was elderly. And I think that it could have been prevented. Had some of our folks in this community could step up and be a little bit stronger and be supportive of some of the services and recommendations that are being offered by other organizations such as CHAT and whatnot to get people into housing and help them out of these situations. So thank you for your time. Julie Threed, followed by Charles Withoon. Hi, everyone. I'm the voice positive Glossathel citizen of District 6. So I wanted to welcome Chief Madden and Mr. Bennett to the council. I think it's a great time to just take a step back, maybe kind of regroup on a lot of things. And I was thinking kind of like a big community cleansing of some sort and big bonfire there. Thank you for resting. And I was going to bring my sage, but I figured that would probably be some ordinance rule. So I heard a poem over the weekend that really made an impact on me. And I thought this was a great opportunity to share it. And for everybody in the city or for everybody that's interested in all these very important topics. And it was a very interesting way I heard this poem. And it was on a Tucker Carlson interview. I'm my favorite guy, so it tells you my political bit. But he was interviewing Dennis Kucinich. And Dennis Kucinich, who I didn't really know, other than some crazy guy that ran for president a couple times, that was fascinating. And Dennis Kucinich recited it as he learned it in fifth grade. And so then I looked at the history of the poem. And it's anonymous in the 1800s. But Dr. Benjamin Mays, who was a pioneer in the civic rights movement, was the first one that really kind of made it famous. And he did the eulogy of Dr. Martin Luther King's funeral. And then the U.S. Representative of the Lake, Elijah Cummings, spoke this on his very first congressional speech on the floor. And then apparently AOC last year, when she was giving her one minute, to speak at the DNC, and it really ticked her off. So she spoke this one minute poem and gave it to them online. So very fascinating if you look at all of the different spectrums of the politics. So here it is. Very fascinating. It's called, I Have Only Just a Minute. I have only just a minute. Only 60 seconds in it. Forced upon me. Can't refuse it. Didn't seek it. Didn't choose it. But it's up to me to use it. I must suffer if I lose it. Give account. If I abuse it. Just a tiny little minute. But eternity is in it. So that's for y'all. You got your minute. And we will keep account of it for y'all. I just thought that made a huge impact. And really quick, again, I try to see the positive things. Point of contact, it made a very big impact on me when I saw the story of John a couple weeks ago. Where he made this big turnaround. And again, kind of the viewpoint that Vanner's pointed, they're hand up rather than hand out. So again, I think that there's a lot of impact. And there's always a way that any of these organizations, if we could start sharing the positive things that people are doing, rather than continue negative and beat up on everybody, that would be my recommendation. So thank you. Charles Withoon followed by Mary Kay Benson. Good evening, Mayor, councilors, staff. Thank you for this opportunity. I just need to review. The city's, if the city acted on a shelter plan administered by a local nonprofit, the advantages would be, one, we'd be buying local. Investing in a local nonprofit service provider that will help stimulate the local economy, more local jobs, more local spending, more sales tax income for the city. Two, quicker response time. Local nonprofits have plans that can be implemented. They can be implemented in weeks, not months. Three, more ease with accountability criteria. Local nonprofits with local offices can have faster and more frequent reporting periods. With staffing, when staffing is local, there will be none of the lag time that you might encounter with waiting for an out of towners response time, availability and scheduling. Four, it would be more efficient. Local plans. It would be administered by people who already are in the city. They are experienced in the details of the Chico homeless landscape. And they can hit the ground running. And five, it's more effective. Administered by people who already have developed relationships with the clients that we would like to serve. Especially homeless people in the downtown. The level of trust is critical to being able to communicate or even deescalate. These are important skills and unique to local service providers that will lend success to the local community. So these are the responses that we want to share today. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. Very good responses. and we would have a start on addressing our shelter crisis on vacant city property in a matter of weeks. That's efficient. That's effective. Thank you. Mary Kay Benson, followed by Angela McLaughlin. Greetings, Council. First, let me do the land acknowledgement that this Council should do before each meeting, that we are guests on occupied, unceded Mechoopta tribal territory. Second, I would like to join the untested, unproven groups getting nearly $50,000 each from this City Council for Non-Solutions tonight. My new startup organization will be called Hope Floats, point of no-bid contracts, Chico. Thank you. Thank you. My qualifications are, I am also a partisan coalition of one, operating under a new facade, with my handout for free taxpayers' money, too, just like some of the others on the agenda later tonight. Unlike others, though, my plan does not block the $22 million of federal money on your table, because I do follow the approved federal program adopted since President Bush called housing first. Third, I will speak to the need for a new federal program to be implemented in Mechoopta. I will spend just under the $50,000 you will give me to buy 10 micro-shelters on sale at Wayfair.com right now for each Riverside 10-by-14-foot shelter for $4,699.99 each. Then I will beg the Mechoopta sovereign government to put those shelters on their territory. I will now read my mission statement, which I lifted from a previously published book. Oh, Lord, you are my hope. You hear the desire of the afflicted. You will strengthen their heart. You will incline your ear. If among you one of your brothers should become poor in any of your towns within your land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother. For there will never cease to be poor in the land. Therefore, I command you, you shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy, and to the poor in your land. If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you. Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you. And the king will answer them, Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me. If you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday. Thank you. If you want chapters and verse, I've got them right here. Thank you. Angela McLaughlin followed by Patrick Newman. It's been six months since you oversaw the roundup and evictions of people during the dead of winter, when literally not one shelter was accepting new clients. I was at one of those evictions and saw people weeping and asking where they could go, only to be told by the police, we can't tell you where to go, but you can't stay here. It's been six months since you were warned these actions were not just immoral but unconstitutional, and you chose to pursue them anyway, embroiling the city in another costly lawsuit. It has been five months since you gaslighted the public that you could ban harm reduction and syringe exchange in the community, knowing full well that action was superseded by state law. Chico again has active harm reduction services, and the only thing you accomplished was wasting our time and our money. It has been six weeks since the right-wing extremist group that paid for several of your seats harassed Scott Huber until he was forced first to quit his job, and then the council. It has been five weeks since Cammy Dinlay resigned in disgrace, and it was discovered that she had been living in a family home in Red Bluff since days after being sworn in. Subsequent investigations have revealed she may never have lived in District 3 at all, and she herself made references to providing decoy addresses, something that is patently illegal. And still, you are not calling for an investigation into what actually may have been election fraud. It has been four weeks since you voted, again with the exception of Alex Brown, to openly subvert our democracy and appoint two council members whose views aligned most closely with your own. Today you swore in these council members, and they do not reflect the concerns or diversity of our community. One of them is a former police chief who said he believes we should continue to prosecute laws that have been ruled unconstitutional and illegal. Your other pick was someone who donated the maximum allowable amount to Vice Mayor Reynolds' campaign and significant amounts to Coolidge, Tandon, and Morgan. You didn't make the slightest pretense of representing our community with these appointees. You simply installed two yes-men and rewarded a big money donor. You've made a travesty of democracy in this city. You've done nothing but gaslight the public and pander to the people who paid for your seats. It is shameful, and our city is blighted by your actions. I would ask that you consider resigning, or you may face a recall. Patrick Newman, followed by Nancy Park. Again, just for the record, because I think this is baked in the cake now, but when we profile people, which is really what we're doing when we call it outreach, we're intruding into people's space. And people on the streets have virtually no privacy as it is. And so when I intrude into that space, I'd like to think that I'm careful about how I do it and why I do it. And if we're honest with ourselves and we're trying to make life as uncomfortable as possible for people, then I think that we're going to have to do something about it. And then, yeah, I mean, we can intrude into that space. We can call it meaningful contact. We can profile. We can do all these things. And we can point people to services that don't exist, which we've been doing ever since I started into this seven years ago. People used to come up to people and say, go to stairways. We've been doing this for a long time now. It all comes from a denial of a fundamental problem, and that is that we do not, on the West Coast, have enough shelter units that are affordable to people, who are at the very bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum. And those people typically are people with brain injuries, mental illness, and all kinds of other challenges that make them the losers in the contest. If we can't get honest about that one fact, that we've failed to provide supportive housing for these people, then everything else is some kind of extension of that denial. And that's what we hear over and over again. So the first thing to do is be honest about the problem. And then ask ourselves, how much do we want to punish the people who are kept from having access to housing for all the reasons we know are true? How much do we want to punish them? Is our purpose to punish them and make them go away, or is our purpose to recognize we've got a problem that Judge England said was, look on its face, it's unsolvable, I don't know how to fix this? Do you fix it by continuously demonizing and depriving people of their rights, or by driving and criminalizing the people who are out there? I don't think it's a solution, but I think that's the solution we've been pursuing here for a long time. And I don't think we're honest about the roots of it. And I think as long as we're in denial about the fundamental issues, we're going to go on digging this hole deeper and deeper and deeper, and need more and more oversight from the outside, because we're a city that hasn't come to grips with fundamental realities. So anyway, I wanted to get to talking to Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Bennett, but I ran out of time. I'll come back to you next time. Thank you. Our last speaker is Nancy Park. This is a list of local unhoused members of our Chico community who died in 2020 and so far in 2021. John Snowman, Bike Mike, Bryce Hodge, Wayne, Felipe Ramirez, Truly Jared Gray, Randy Shillings, Eric Euler, Mary Lou Dawson, Leslie Chavez, Scott Walker, Robert Lee, Carlos Iberra, Tori, Michael Gerke, Steven Vest, Leanne Creeden, Gail Kamphouse, Robert Smurf Donahue, James Wedge, Gary Country Titus, Bobby Talk, Curtis Bear Aguare, and these are all some mothers, sons, and daughters. That was our last speaker. All right. Thank you very much. All right. Moving on to item four, item 4.1, hearing order and formation of maintenance assessment district A44, John Jones subdivision. And David, you're subbing in. Subbing in again. We have a pinch hitting for Mr. Audubon in the night. Yes, sir. Good evening, everybody. Yes. So go ahead. Sorry. Good evening. So item 4.1 is a hearing for the formation of maintenance district A44. As a condition for approving the final subdivision map of our property, a property owner, in this case, Chuck Tetreault Construction, is required to provide the means to approve the final subdivision map of our property. The purpose of this is to provide the means to operate and maintain the public improvements made to that division. Formation of maintenance district A44 would comply with that requirement and also provide the city adequate funding to maintain those public improvements. Staff's recommendation is to approve the resolution to create the formation of maintenance district A44. That concludes my report and I'm available for any questions. All right. Any questions on the item? All right. At that point, we'll thank you and open the public hearing on this item. Do we have any speakers? No, we do not. All right. So we'll close the public hearing and entertain a motion. Move to approve. All right. We have a motion. Do we have a second? Second. And a second by Councilmember Morgan. And that's a resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico ordering formation of maintenance assessment district and approving a declaration of maintenance district A44. Behaviour regulation of Behaviour regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation All right. If we can reconvene, please. All right. At this point in time, we're not live. I can't hear myself. Check, check. All right. There we go. All right. So at this point in time, we're going to move on to item 4.2, ARCO A&PM gas station convenience store. I thought this was a sub-order. But it's not. No, it's an A&PM. Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Mayor and Council. As you indicated, this is a proposal for an ARCO A&PM gas station and convenience store in the southwest corner of Esplanade and Eaton. The gas station would have about 3,464 square feet, the convenience store would, and there would be eight pumps. It's important to note that there is a roundabout proposed in one of our capital improvement project plans for the corner of Eaton and Esplanade, and plans for the right-of-way expansion to accommodate that right-of-way have been reserved and integrated into this proposal and the design. In order for this project to go forward, the applicant has requested a general plan amendment from office mixed use to community commercial, a rezoning from... office mixed use to community commercial, a use permit for a gas station, which is required in the community commercial or CC zone, and lastly, the approval of the architecture and the site design for the project. In terms of previous reviews and recommendations, the MAP Advisory Committee approved a minor land division to create this corner parcel back on May 17, 2021, and then the Architectural Review and Preservation Board recommended approval of the site design and architectural review on June 2, 2021, and then the Planning Commission recommended approval of the general plan amendment, the rezone, the use permit, and the architectural review on June 17, 2021. The... From the environmental review standpoint, these amendments are consistent with the general plan environmental impact report, and the project itself is exempt from CEQA, as categorically exempt. Therefore, staff is recommending that you consider the staff report and direct any questions to us, open the public hearing, and then adopt the resolutions, and then adopt the resolutions for the general plan amendment and the use permit, and the architectural approval, and introduce the ordinance for the zone change. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. All right. Go ahead, Councilman Morgan. Sorry, Councilman Brown. So I'm sure I read this, and I must have glossed over it. You're going to put a roundabout at Esplanade and Eaton? That is what is identified in one of our capital improvement projects, and public works may be able to respond to the timing of when that would be, but as projects come through, we try to do our best to proactively prepare for them. Thanks, Bruce. I think that's not what it's intended. So the capital project has not been identified. Intersection control is still going to be evaluated. I think what's intended with that report is to show that of all the alternatives, a roundabout would take the most... space and right-of-way needs. And so that just protects our options as far as what alternatives would be identified during the intersection control evaluation. I'll have to clear that up. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you. I have a quick question. All right, Councilman Brown. Yeah. This is proposed in an opportunity corridor, correct? Yes, it is. Can you explain for the good of the public what that means? The opportunity corridor is provided to stimulate activity, as development opportunities arise. It applies to both residentially and commercially zoned properties. It is a strategy to encourage development in areas where we want to stimulate activity. That was an issue at the Planning Commission. And it was an issue that was raised at the Planning Commission. But in your staff report, I've given you the verbatim description of what the corridor opportunity site is. It's intended to address... And I'll do that... Excuse me. I was going to add something, but go ahead. Is low-income housing or multifamily housing included in that opportunity? It would be allowed. It would also require a use permit because the zoning right now is office commercial. So it would still require a use permit in another approval similar to this. Thank you. I was going to say the corridor opportunity also allows reduced parking standards and increased height and density. Things along those lines. Great. To stimulate what Bruce had said in acknowledging that the corridors provide great opportunity for transit and things like that. Thank you. All right. Any other questions from council members? All right. I've got a couple. Sorry. I did have the roundabout question, so thank you, Councilman Morgan, for asking that. My concern with the roundabout aspect of it, just for future identification, is I know we're putting one at Eaton. What's planned? And I know it... At least it's in the idea that possibly we could have a roundabout on the other side of the freeway exit at Eaton as well. So the thought of three roundabouts on Eaton consecutively is not something I'm really thrilled with, nor is that one on a road that is actually supposed to cut over to Highway 32 at some point, just for future reference. So it's that. My concern is actually with the entrances. And I know we can't at this point necessarily do anything about this, but I just wanted to see what consideration was taken in place for left-hand turns taking place out of and into the parking lot. I know, well, for example, where AMPM sits on East Avenue and Esplanade, that there's some issues with people turning left out of the parking lot on both sides. So are those slanted driveways or to only allow right-hand turns? I don't know if those are identified at this point. I think Public Works may want to... I'll chime in here, but... Sure. In the earlier stages of this, that would be designed with the... with whether or not a median would be proposed. What was mentioned by our traffic engineer as a right out of Esplanade would likely be required. Okay. Yeah, because that was my concern. Right in, right out at Esplanade. Yeah, because when you look at the one, you know, near Jack in the Box in that area in terms of where that AMPM sits, it's the... You know, a lot of people, we try to turn left out of there and it's just kind of a disaster. So I've never done that, though. But it is pretty dangerous. So anyway, okay. So as long as that was taken into consideration. All right. Any other questions? No? Thank you very much. Appreciate it. All right. At this point, do we have any ex parte communications? Basically, have you had any conversations with the property owners or any of the interested parties? Anyone? No? I just had one back and forth with one homeowner on South Prairie Lane. That was an email. With... Oh, gotcha. Okay. Anything besides that? No? All right. And I went and looked at the site both yesterday and today. So, all right. At this point in time, we'll open the public hearing. Do we have any speakers on this item? We have one. I do have a card from Mike Donnelly, but I don't know if the applicant is here and wants to address... Okay. So, the applicant would be given the first 10 minutes. All right. Welcome. Thank you. I don't think I'll need 10 minutes, but I appreciate it. I'm Mike Singleton. Thank you very much. I'm the applicant and the developer for this site. I want to thank staff in getting to this point. It's been a tough road, but we're here. I think we're at the finish line. We're excited about it. Fully aware of the traffic implications. We have agreed to, obviously, in accordance with the MLD, the dedication of the future right-of-way to the city. Upon recordation of this MLD, granting the dedication of the land for that future roundabout when and if it may come. So, that is something we're in agreement with. We're fine with it. We're prepared to go forward, and we're excited about the project. Hopefully, we can get full support and get on the next step and hopefully get some building permits pulled and get a new operation going there. This is going to be probably north of a $7 million investment into your city that we're excited to do, and that's between land and building and all the stuff that's going to be there. It goes along with it. Unfortunately, the costs keep going up, but we're hoping they'll level out, and I'm prepared to answer any questions you have. And I do this up and down the state with a number of tenants, so please feel free to quiz me, question me, whatever you'd like. All right. Any questions? All right. Thanks so much. Thank you. Okay. And then our next speaker is Mike Donnelly. All right. Welcome. I just wanted to voice my support. I am a commercial broker, and I represent the family that owns the property, and I just wanted to say this is a really good project. A lot of work went into it, and it's a good fit. I'd say it's the highest and best use for this property. Over the years, we've had a lot of commercial interest, but very little residential, if any, and I just think there's a high demand in North Chico for these kinds of services, so I just wanted to voice my support. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. That is our last speaker. All right. So with that, we'll close the public hearing. I'll entertain a motion. And you need two, correct? One on each individual item? No? You can do them together. Just one entirely. All right. Just before the motion, I have a few comments to make. I'm going to align with members of the public and city planning commissioners who oppose this project. Multiple reasons, but one of the main reasons is the City of Chico is facing a housing crisis. Our regional housing needs assessment allocation and production report required by the state demonstrates that we are severely underproducing housing for low income. Thank you. We are facing a crisis in very low income communities and even moderate level income housing is suffering while the housing market caters to above average incomes. These numbers are dismaying at best with only 1.5% of very low incomes needed being built and only 1.3% of low income units being built. As a city, we say we have enough space for low income multi-family units based on zoning because we have, quote, opportunity corridors like this one that can be built in higher densities. Then we rezone them like we're going to do tonight to make room for something. That is not as needed. So I won't support that when land in general is so scarce. Secondly, we're clearly planning for the present rather than the future with this issue or with this use. A gas station across the street from another gas station that could in all likelihood go out of business as a result of this action doesn't plan for more walkable, bikeable city. It doesn't plan for fewer cars on the streets, especially gas powered vehicles. And to me, that's short sighted. We should be rezoning to allow more high density housing to be developed in Chico, not less. And we should be planning for significantly fewer vehicles. So if we're going to have fewer gas powered vehicles in Chico, not more. I won't support this item. All right. I would just say that it does have some vehicle charging stations on them. Anyway. All right. Any further comment? Okay. Entertain a motion. I'll make a motion in support of a resolution of the City Council and City of Chico approving general mixed land use diagram, from office mixed use to mixed use for the development of a gas station convenience store, and an ordinance of the City Council and City of Chico amending the zoning classification from office commercial to commercial, community commercial, and a resolution of the City Council and City of Chico approving use of a site design and architectural review for the development of a gas station convenience store. Second. Motion and second. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Okay. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Bennett? Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. And we actually, consultation of our city attorney has recommended that we actually go into closed session at this point in time, and then come back out for item to continue with the regular agenda. So we're going to adjourn the closed session at this time, and then return back out to the public. So, is that just allowed? So, that's outrageous. Okay. Agenda? We're here to talk on 5-1 and 5-2. City Attorney, could you address this issue? Yes, please. I'm not going to sit here until midnight. Yes, you can. 5-1, please. The council may, amongst itself, on a motion, reorganize the agenda. So that's what we're looking for at this time, a motion from one of the council members. All right. Yeah. So. Do we have a motion? We have a motion to reorganize the agenda so we can adjourn to closed session. Excuse me. If the audience could please be quiet. This is a council . So, Mr. Mayor. Yes. Just to be clear, we're asking to adjourn to closed session for the one item and come back. Correct. Not for all the items. Correct. Please, quiet. I'll make that clear to the chamber if not. I'll make the motion to adjust the agenda for one item. Okay. I have a second. A second. I have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk. Okay. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. No. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. We will adjourn in closed session. We'll do it as quickly as possible and return after. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Mr. Morgan. . . . All right. We'll reconvene and start on the regular agenda, item 5.1, and one introduction of an ordinance, adoption of an emergency ordinance, amending titles 9-12-12R of the City of Chico Municipal Code to regulate camping and storage of personal property in public spaces and implementation of the administrative policy and procedure, detailing the enforcement of the same. City Attorney, Mr. Vincent Ewing. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Briefly, the Council met, reordered the agenda and met with the City Attorney and City Staff, City Manager, City Clerk in closed session on Agenda Item 5.1 and Agenda Item 7.2. No reportable action was taken. Direction was given. I will begin my report at this point. Thank you. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the case of Martin v. the City of Boise that governments may not enforce ordinances that ban public camping unless they first provide enough shelter beds to house every person experiencing homelessness within their jurisdictions. The Court ruled that as long as there is no option of sleeping indoors, the government cannot criminalize indigent homeless people for sleeping outdoors on public property. The City's current anti-camping ordinance did not comply with Martin due to the lack of specificity as to the conditions upon which the ordinances will be enforced. The City's current anti-camping ordinance did not comply with Martin due to the requirements of the Martin decision. I recommend that the City Council introduce an ordinance amending Chapters 9, 12, and 12R of the City of Chico Municipal Code relating to camping and storage of personal property in a public place. What you have before you are two potential actions or, of course, no action. The City Attorney at this time, based on the discussion that we had, in closed session, recommends that the City adopt the non-urgency ordinance set forth in Exhibit B attached to this staff report. If you will refer to your staff report at page 3, you can see the clarified definitions of the proposed ordinances that you're considering where words are provided better definition throughout. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. I've attended a couple of hearings with the trial judge in this case, and I've also talked at length with the magistrate judge and opposing counsel. I also received an amicus brief from an organization titled ACLU. I read that brief, I considered it, and I took into account the comments made by Judge England in the Warren litigation. It was very clear to me after considering all of those factors that a cleanup of the city's ordinances needed to happen. And my view of it, and I said it in relaxed or casual parlance, if you have bad law on the books, you need to fix it. So it's my recommendation to be proactive and to fix that bad law to make it pass judicial muster. So that's the purpose of this agenda item. It is not to recommend to the city manager and the chief of police that they go out and start immediately enforcing the ordinances as revised. It's a cleanup exercise only. That concludes my report. All right, questions for the city of Trang? I have a question. Council Member Brown? Mr. Young, these changes seem to be predicated on the idea that the airport site is indeed adequate shelter, low barrier shelter option for people experiencing homelessness. Given that the judge has already deemed the site to be inadequate, doesn't this seem to fly in the face of that? So, thank you, Council Member Brown. When we were doing the cleanup or the revisions of the ordinances that you have before them, we were only able to identify one site where that would be designated where enforcement would not occur potentially. And that was the airport site because that's the only available site. In the Warren litigation, we had a lot of! So, is it unlawful for anyone to camp anywhere on city property or public property if adequate shelter is available aside from the airport site? So, well, right now, we have the preliminary injunction in place. So, we can't enforce our ordinances anyway. And it's my strong recommendation that the city continue to comply with that order. So, back to your question. As revised, could you restate your question again? Sure. Under these new ordinances, under these changes, is it unlawful for anyone to camp anywhere on public property? If adequate shelter is available aside from the airport site? So, unlawful to camp anywhere except the airport site if adequate shelter space is available. So, I'll answer that question this way. The way I, what I would contemplate is that we're going to get to, we, the city, are going to get to the, get to a point where there are going to be other places where enforcement is not to occur for persons. And then, as you see, there's an administrative. Component to this, to this agenda item doesn't require action by the council. And the idea would be to, if a person is camping on public property at a particular location, the interface recommended in that APMP is that the officers contact that individual and follow the steps that are set forth in the, both in the ordinance and also in the APMP. And that is to make sure that there are shelter sites or locations available. Offer those. To the person. And then find out whether or not that person refuses. Sure. And that's when enforcement would occur is if that person refuses to utilize available shelter. And there was a note about transportation in there. I do appreciate the clarity on those steps. The Jesus Center and the Torres Shelter were listed, first two shelters, then the airport site on that list. Do those sites qualify alone as adequate shelter according to your interpretation? My concern being if an officer calls Jesus Center and they say yes. We have beds available or Torres Shelter. They say yes. We have beds available. I'm worried that then enforcement, then that list would be explored further rather than going to the airport site or to a site that is low barrier. So. So I guess to answer your question, are Jesus and Torres adequate under Martin in my view? Yes, they are. And I don't. And although I've. It's been argued by the plaintiffs after talking and after visiting the shelters and talking with the executive directors. I'm not. I'm not aware of the religious requirement that has been alleged by opposition folks. So I talked pointedly to the executive director. I said, is this required? The answer was no. That's what I've I've set forth in my pleadings to the court. And so to answer your question. Yeah, those those two locations. Would be in my view under Martin adequate shelter and then going down the list. And the hope is that in working with the opposition and the magistrate judge that there will be another location or two that we can identify that when the officers such that when the officers do, in fact, have contact with the person, they can go down that list. Find out the number of beds and interface with the person arranged for transportation and so forth as set forth in this ordinance. But again, I want to stress. There's a preliminary injunction in place. It is not the recommendation that the city from the city attorney that that injunction be defied. Thanks for getting into the weeds with me. Thanks. Yep. Right. Any other questions? No questions. But comment after. Okay. So we'll do that after the public. And I do actually have a question. So I just want to reiterate that. So the reasoning behind this is to clean up our ordinances to comply with not only the ACLU, but the judges as well. As well. As the magistrate in terms of everything that's been brought forward to you. So we can have ordinances that are lawful and enforce them when and in fact we are out of the preliminary injunction. Not prior to being out of the preliminary injunction. Yes, I would. I would. Yes. Generally speaking, I, I, the, the, my office considered the comments of the judge, Judge England, magistrate Judge Newman, the amicus brief brief from the ACLU comments from the police. And the plaintiff's counsel, and other comments regarding the, the constitutionality of the ordinances as they were. We took a deep dive into the Boise case. We looked at allied jurisdictions, including Boise. We spoke with their city attorneys, and this is what we came up with. And the, the idea would be to be, the idea is to be proactive and to fix what we deemed bad long books. All right. Yeah. I'm just trying to make the clarification that this is done to comply with all those laws. various sources rather than to defy those various sources. I'm not recommending defiance and compliance absolutely with Martin in particular. Perfect. Thank you. Public comment on this item? Yes, we have eight speakers. All right. Three minutes. Okay. Jessica Giannola followed by Robin Engel. So the wording on this, I read through the whole thing and some things stuck out to me. I would say that there's a line item of five items and there is that the city, it wants to enforce, the wording is so that you can enforce your anti-camping ordinances for the purpose of protecting people's lives and their communities. So you're saying public health and safety in the city's parks, watercourses, and greenways. But I think you mean the people living outside of those areas, protecting them, not the people that are in it because they're not feeling protected at all. Let's see. Because their lives are constantly in danger. Obviously, we've lost another person out there. The second one was number two. It says a current serious and immediate public health and safety issues are acknowledged with hypodermic needles turned about. Yes, we all can agree that hypodermic needles is a concern for everyone, including the people who are addicted. They need your support in having more services brought to them and stability with housing so that they can focus on having their recovery. So this verbiage that I'm seeing here is excluding the actual addressing of the issues. Large amounts of garbage amassed at near encampments. This wording is in here. But we've had nonprofits propose paying for extra garbage so that we don't have it on the ground. But the city has declined. So that's why we are seeing additional garbage on the ground. Grills and propane tanks have been found dug into the ground to start fires. That was the word, start fires. The people are trying to eat. They're trying to prepare meals. So if we could just reframe what's happening and why it's happening, we can better direct problem solving instead of against them. So the last one is number five. And I have the wording in number five speaks to the vision in this city that indicates that we have citizens needing to be protected from other citizens, citizens that are unhoused. We all need protection and safe living conditions. The encampments exist because of our failures here. The city budget is primarily spent on enforcement while prevention and services are virtually nonexistent. We've created our own public threat by ignoring the giant problem without addressing it. So in the end, I just see these, the city budget is just a bunch of garbage that is still focusing on enforcement and not problem solving, not addressing the needs that we need to focus on to get people out of encampments instead of just how do we make it legal to prosecute them? How do we make it legal to push them around? The focus is off. We should be focusing on how do we fix the problem. Inadequate housing services, those are pieces that the city plays in. We, you play a part in bringing those, if you could focus on those. Thank you. So Robin Engle followed by Charles Withoon. If the intent is to comply versus defy the law, then this whole process wouldn't be happening. What got us into this mess in the first place, what has cost us untold lives, untold dollars, human dignity and respect for our community. The first thing that we have to do to protect human rights for all humans is the ordinances that our city attorney created with his firm. And so we have no reasonable reason to trust that you're going to clean it up because you created these ordinances that Judge England has declared are flouting the laws. You have not gained our trust whatsoever. And in fact, to note that the city has not been able to! The airport area land is ready for habitation is highly false. There are no elements that are necessary for existence. There's no food, no water, no actual shelter there. There's no social services. There's no transportation ready to transport people. There's no heating and there's no cooling. There's nothing there to allow for anyone to survive unhoused. There's no heating and there's no cooling. There's no heating and there's no heating and there's no cooling. We also know that there was suspicion of violations of the Brown Act when you were brought in without transparency, without any transparency to be the city attorney. So for you to be the one to fix this all, to claim to meet the judge's requirements, those requirements are much bigger and more extensive than these two concise paragraphs. And those expectations are the judge's, not yours. Again, we have no reason to trust this process. In fact, every reason to distrust that you want what's best for our unhoused community. And this is just so wrong and so illegal. It doesn't take a law degree to see that what's happening is more shenanigans that are not legitimate and not aligned with democratic problems. It's not a process. In fact, we're supposed to be in mediation. The city is supposed to be mediating now. This is not mediation. To take your laws and say, oh, I'll change them. That's not mediation. Mediation involves compromise and talking with both sides. And this whole dictatorship rule by fear and force and whatever you want to do goes is not okay for any of us. Charles Withoon followed by Angela McLaughlin. Thank you. Thank you. Mayor, councilors, staff, thank you. So I'm reading the staff report on 5.1. And one sentence jumped out at me. Got to quote it here. Quote. The proposed changes to the code will allow the city to enable the city to enforce its anti-camping ordinances, including against unsheltered individuals, so long as shelter space such as the newly constructed shelter facility remains available to unsheltered individuals and they have refused the space. Unquote. As difficult a sentence to read as I have read in my life. The judge refused to categorize this space as a shelter. Pitching a tent does not constitute construction. Pitching it in dark asphalt, on dark asphalt covered with chip rock right next to an airport runway, miles from anywhere, even with limited bus service, does not constitute construction. It does not make it available by any stretch of the imagination. I suggest you refuse this agenda item, this ordinance. Because all who sign it on this concentration camp-like facility are asking the most vulnerable among us to bear the brunt of a crisis that has its origins. In major economic factors, major economic forces, government planning, and a stark lack of sufficient mental health services. I suggest you refuse it because all who sign it are by definition being asked to abandon our most basic spiritual ethics. This is a matter of a! Most people believe our parks and waterways are not an appropriate place for encampments. Advocates have never suggested this was an acceptable solution, nor did the previous Council. have asked for again and again are actual solutions. Instead, multiple councils, the city manager, and city administration have failed to implement meaningful solutions. Just the opposite. We've failed to add any low barrier shelter beds, despite the fact that the efficacy and safety of low barrier shelter has been amply demonstrated. Even worse, we now have fewer services available for people on our streets than we ever have in the last 20 years. There's no longer one single place where a homeless person can go to get a meal, get a shower, get clean clothing, or gets help with something like obtaining an ID. Last winter, when you began to evict people, again in the dead of winter, in the midst of a pandemic, and in defiance of CDC policy recommendations, we told you that what you were doing was not only a way to get people out of the city, but also a way to get them out of the city. You were doing it in a way that was not only immoral, but unconstitutional. You knew that people had nowhere to go, that no service providers were accepting new clients. We pleaded with you, again, to provide actual solutions, rather than enforcing punitive ordinances that made being impoverished a crime in Chico. It took a costly lawsuit to stop you from continuing to persecute a minority population that is villainized in our community. The judge confirmed what we said in the last two years. We're not going to do that again. We're going to continue to do what we said all along. These ordinances violated the civil rights of our citizens. The judge also pointed out that the issues with homelessness facing our city are not unique, and suggested you educate your constituents rather than continuing to pander to them. Your ongoing failure to address the judge's suggestions led to the granting of the temporary injunction that further constrains the city from enforcing its laws. In light of these failures, you're doubling down again. Your attempt to gaslight the community and the judge by making a few minor tweaks to the verbiage of these ordinances demonstrates your commitment to indulge the whims of the people that paid for your seats, rather than to do what is right for our community. Your failure to support and implement solutions has led directly to the failure to implement solutions. The regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation regulation Patrick Newman followed by Angela Rysden. Just for reference, Legal Services of Northern California sent you all a letter on item 5.1, also on 2.4 and 5.2. I concur with what that letter says and what's important here at the moment is that there's no meeting of the minds here. And if that's what's trying to be achieved in terms of this negotiation and the magistrate judge and looking for a way to bring Chico back into some kind of compliance with fundamental constitutional principles, which Judge Englund clearly said we were not, then this approach here is to me the legal equivalent of what we've done at the airport. It's not a good faith. It's not a good faith. It's not a good faith. And so what we're trying to do here is to really take a deep look at where we've been and how we need to move in a different direction. So 2013, the first sit-lie law, 2015 and 2016, the offenses against public property ordinances, which is what got me into the plaza. Then you go forward to 2018, reinstating sit-lie. Then the first, one of the first actions of this council is to take a good look at what's been happening with the city of San Diego. take our entire park rules, set of park rules, and put them under the Chico Municipal Code as potential misdemeanors, arrestable offenses. This is stuff like feeding a pigeon we're talking about here. So what Chico needs to do is go back to 2013 and strike these laws, and then go back and rebuild them in some kind of way that's in harmony with what would be decent practice in terms of really honoring what Judge Englund is talking about in terms of the Constitution. What he said was that you have a labyrinth of laws, and this thing here is labyrinthine also, the way that this is written, concerning storage. That labyrinth or network fabric of laws was designed from the beginning to make criminalization of homelessness more possible and to be able to make more arrests. I was there at the presentations in 2015 when Lieutenant Britt described what we were doing there. He said, one of the quotes was, I need this new law, like the limitations on time and the waterways and all the other kinds of stuff so that I can arrest people without catching them sleeping. That's a quote. I need to be able to arrest people without catching them sleeping. So we have this culture, and we have this history, and we have these laws on the books, and if we really want to look deeply at what we're doing here and reform those laws, that would be a step in the right direction. This is not that step. Thank you. Angela Risden, followed by Marty Dunlop. Good evening. My name is Angela Risden, and I go by the pronouns she and her. I'm a registered voter living in the city of Chico, and I vote. Why do I tell you I have voting status? Because I'm not from Chico, a fact that seems to make a difference to the city council as to whether you vote for me or not. I'm a registered voter living in the city of Chico, Why do you see me as an individual worthy of protecting my civil rights? Except, of course, if I'm an untested consultant. Oh, that's another agenda topic. I'll get back to it. I'd like to address the introduction of this urgent ordinance. Instead of working with the various service providers that have provided you with plans to support the unhoused, which you've either disregarded or overlooked, you instead create and revise to the ordinances that will continue to harm rather than help our unhoused people. I request that you stop all action on these ordinances, and I especially request that you not waive the first reading. In the light of some of the things that I heard today about bad laws needing being fixed and the fact that they're being fixed by the same folks who wrote them in the first place makes me all the more that we need to review these much more carefully than we are. Help for the housing is an urgent item. It's an urgent issue. This ordinance is an urgent issue. It's not. What it is is a rush to criminalize humans, to criminalize the unhoused. As of today, helping the unhoused does not appear to be an urgent issue for this council. Still, not urgent, even after 23 local unhoused people have died since May 4th of 2020. In a report that Mr. Oren prepared for another agenda item on tonight's council meeting, he notes that the impacts created by the homeless have contributed to the increase in the number of people who are unhoused. The health and safety concerns of both the individual experiencing homelessness and the residents who wish to enjoy the public spaces. This urgency ordinance does not address the impacts to the unhoused. In fact, it continues to criminalize them. The city should work with any of the local service providers to find temporary shelters for the housing. The impact on our unhoused and the areas where they live would have been significantly diminished. In fact, they had. In fact, it is the city's lack of action on that part that has led to the condition in the camps. The city has refused to allow service providers to provide for basic human needs, such as toilets and hand washing. The proposed urgency of this ordinance also appears to fight in the face of Martin v. Boise. In fact, even in this Mr. Ewing's report, he says that a shelter has to be sleeping indoors. Boise v. Martin describes a shelter as one that is in the middle of the city, indoors with walls and beds. However, the report is indicating that the airport's resting facility is listed as a shelter space. This is just one example of some of the discrepancies that I find in this urgent ordinance that cries for a complete review, not just for the continued harm that we'll do on our unhoused, but to avoid future costs of litigation. Stop stalling. Stop attempting to solve the problem by putting the problem in the hands of the city. Stop passing unlawful ordinances. Roll up your sleeves and help. Or at the very least, stop preventing those who want you to help find solutions. Marty Dunlap, followed by Anna Meehan. I am speaking to you tonight as a public interest attorney who has been tracking the unhoused situation in Chico. I have been a citizen of this community for over 50 years. Is there... Is there a need to protect Chico's parks and waterways? Absolutely. Is there a need to revise Chico's ordinances? Definitely. Is there a need to not criminalize the unhoused citizens? Yes. As admitted, the Chico ordinances, as written, are unconstitutional and will stay that way despite the recommended changes in wording. The city attorney's belief that the ordinances are legal on their face but err only in their application is not... is not substantiated. The judge's comments at the hearing on July 2nd reflect his skepticism of Mr. Ewing's postulated redlining of the existing ordinances. The definition of a shelter under Martin v. Boise is indoors with walls and beds. Mr. Ewing concedes in his staff report that under Martin v. Boise, the city may not enforce ordinances that ban public camping unless they first provide enough shelter beds to house... every person experiencing housing homelessness within this jurisdiction. The only way to make these ordinances legal is for Chico to have the ability to provide shelter beds for 600 to 800 persons. One of the primary factors considered by the court in granting this preliminary injunction is the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits of the case, which means the writing is on the proverbial wall on the outcome of this lawsuit. Furthermore, Judge England has expressed strong frustration with the city and the city's attorney about bringing forth unconstitutional ordinances and then relying on the courts to figure it out. This wordsmithing is only going to perpetuate the judge's annoyance. Yes, the ordinances need to be modified. The city attorney did not get it right when he crafted the ordinances. However, there are local professionals who want to assist in assuring Chico has adequate ordinances in place to protect our waterways and greenways that are legally sound. It is a poor use of the word, Chico, as a legal term, but it is also a good use of our police officers' time to act as ambassadors, as suggested by the city attorney, to make the ordinance seem to be constitutional in their application. In the last three years, the Shelter Crisis Declaration came into effect in Chico. A number of comprehensive plans have been submitted by service providers at the city's request. This urgency to modify the city's ordinances is not truly urgent, but there is an urgency that does require an immediate response by the city, and that is to attend to the basic needs of the underprivileged. The city's response to the emergency is to provide adequate sanitation services to the unhoused population. This lack of appropriate responsiveness, despite offers from the community to pay for adequate sanitation services, is what is contributing to a health and safety crisis. There is no urgency but for the city to go forward in bringing about a plausible solution for short-term and long-term housing for those at risk citizens who are in need of safety and shelter. Keeping ordinances on the books that make those without housing into criminals is unconscionable. Not expending the millions of dollars that are available to the city to help those less fortunate is criminal. Henna Meehan. I would have been happy to yield some of my time to Marty. I haven't been to a city council meeting in a while, and the last time I rode my bicycle down here was to the hands, and there were two city council members who were speaking out. And I haven't, I'm not an attorney, and I haven't read this in its entirety, but I know some people have, and I really appreciate that, and they really put a lot of thought into that, in which case I would appreciate it if Sean Warren was one of the people that were talking while they were talking. That would be more respectful. Thank you. Thank you. But, and so, yeah, now we have two new city council members, and I'm learning that we have the former police chief here, Mr. O'Brien, and so I think he, along with many people, would know that ultimately what we do need are more social workers. And I also believe, like we had before, we need the declaration of a housing crisis, which will get more funds to help people. So that's, those are the things we do need. I don't know about this, but I can say what we do need. I'll just speak from personal experience. I already spoke to, about my friend that was at Comanche Creek, and people thought that he died because a young woman had stolen his bicycle, and maybe the death had something to do with some kind of situation like that. But just today, I go outside on the break, that's why I was kind of surprised that there was another recess, and we wanted to know how long it would be. Well, a woman asked if I was involved with Safe Space, and I have volunteered there in the past. And my folk song group that was called Emily's, Emily Almuth's Band of Narrow Dwells, that I like to shorten us to the Dwells, we used to perform at the Safe Spaces in the winter months. And so I kind of recognize some of the people, you know, from the times there. But, so I have been involved with Safe Space, but she just basically wanted someone to talk to. Her birthday, her 62nd birthday is tomorrow. She's on Social Security. She wanted to get her check. It was supposedly mailed to Safe Space, so she wanted to talk to somebody from Safe Space to get her check, so she could celebrate her birthday, which is for the first time, is not in prison, for many, many years. And she was so frustrated, she just wanted to go back to prison. And what she really needed, I feel, is somebody with more training than I to listen to her, to hear her. And you probably saw the young men that were camping out right here. I invited them in. I encouraged them to come in, but maybe they didn't want to leave with their things or whatever. But anyhow, I'm here. I'm here on their behalf, on all their behalf. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. That's it. All right. All right. Thank you, everyone. All right. Council discussion. Vice Mayor Reynolds, I believe you had a comment. I just wanted to say, while I absolutely agree we need to update our ordinances, I think it's premature. There's so many moving parts right now. I'm personally not comfortable moving forward with this tonight. We have two brand new council members who are just barely able to come in. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. So, I don't want to island them. no? There were no further comments. What's that? Was there no further comments? No further comments. Okay. Madam Clerk, I have a question. Okay. Even to read this in, we still have to read the whole ordinance, right? Even if it's not going to be an emergency? You would read the ordinance title in its entirety. Okay. So I will make a motion that we pass not as an emergency ordinance, but as a first reading. Item 5.1, introduction of an ordinance and adoption of an urgency ordinance, except to now take away the urgency ordinance. Admitting titles 9, 12, and 12R of the City of Chico Municipal Code to regulate camping and storage of personal property in public places and implementation of administrative policy and procedure detailing the enforcement of the same. All right. We have a motion. Do we have a second? I'll go ahead and second. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Just real quick. I don't understand fully what kind of statement this is as it relates to good faith negotiations, and I think, once again, we're missing the point. Rather than doing this well first... I'd just point out where we are in the middle of the vote. I'm explaining my no vote, sir. Okay. Thank you. Well, it should be done prior to the vote. Rather than doing this well first on the shelter side of things, we're doubling down on enforcement. This has proven to be the wrong order in our approach over and over again, yet here we are. I'm voting no. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Could you please repeat the motion? The motion was to introduce the ordinance amending the title, titles, um, Title 12 and 12R. It is not an urgency ordinance. It's the original one. I mean, it's the one that's, oh, is it 9, Title 9? Title 9, 12, and 12R. Sorry, I left off the name. Title 9. Title 9. It's the introductory, and then the second reading would come back at the next meeting. It would not go into effect for 30 days until the date of the final adoption. Yes. Okay. That was a yes for the vote. Okay. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. He carries 5-2. All right. We've had a request for a break, so we will take a short break. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Understood. Understood. Debbie. All right. I'm back on. All right. Item 5.2, consideration of the homeless strategic plan proposal, Hope Street Coalition. Mr. Orn. Yes. Thank you, Honorable Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the council. It's a pleasure to be before you this evening. And as you will see in your staff report before you, this is a homeless strategic plan proposal as requested by the city council. As you'll recall, back on July 5th of this year, you heard a presentation from a Mr. Paul Webster from Hope Street Coalition. City council requested that staff engage. With HSC on developing a proposal to create a strategic plan on homelessness and then bring it back to the council before any dime was spent with this regard. And so here we are before you again. Staff in its recognition of the cost associated with this would delay the filling of the homeless solutions coordinator position to accommodate this need. Obviously, one aspect of this that staff looked at very closely was without a plan for a homeless solutions coordinator to implement. It's probably not going to be a good idea. It's not going to be as advantageous as having a plan and then hiring whatever comes from that plan to ensure we have adequate resources to be addressing the issues concerning homelessness. City staff have largely relied upon community partnerships that have brought forward numerous items throughout the past number of years that I've been here. You'll note on page two of the staff report, there's at least 11 of those items that have been brought forward. And having been here back when we were bringing a lot of those forward, we looked at a comprehensive reducing homelessness plan. That was a regional plan. And really, we're bringing forward aspects of that over the years, trying to find the gaps that existed to try to help the course of action in enabling the private sector, the nonprofit sector, and the county to achieve a higher level of success associated with the homelessness concern. I will tell you, and I highlighted it in my staff report, there are two very vital issues that I believe contributed greatly to the increasing tension of this issue. One was in 2018. In the campfire, there were a lot of folks that came to Chico, not on their own volition, but out of a need or a desire because of what was going on during that time. Extremely difficult scenario. In addition to that, which I highlighted in the staff report, the COVID-19 incident that we currently are still seeing some residual aspects of also created some policy that enabled people to be there. And that also heightened the level of consternation over this issue. I will say that all through this, I've had an opportunity to sit down with Mr. Webster. Council asked me to, to bring back this proposal. He put it together. As you'll see, there are three primary components to his recommendation. One is data collection and informal inventory. He would be able to put through and go through a lot of information, compile it, and bring that information back to council. Development of a strategic plan to address homelessness impacts. There are seven aspects of that, as you'll see within the report. And then also the development of an ordinance or regulatory recommendations and actions for the city council to consider. So contingent upon council's approval of this, what staff would do is go back to Mr. Webster, create a professional services agreement contingent upon what he has recommended, and because he heard the city council, what they desired at the meeting where he presented, and we would proceed with bringing him on board to complete this work. With that, I'm happy to answer any questions. But I'm going to go ahead and close the meeting. I wanted to bring this back so you could give all due consideration to it. Thank you very much. All right. Any questions? Thank you, Mr. Webster. Thank you. Public comment? Let's see. We have nine speakers. All right. Three minutes. Rob Berry, followed by Jessica Giannola. Good evening. I'm Rob Berry, a member of the board of trustees. proposed! We don't know where you're going, all roads will lead you there. I have been closely following the actions of local government here for nearly five years. This is the third council that I have been a part of, or, you know, been involved with. Over that time, the issues we have come to call the homeless problem has dominated our attention, our time, and our lives. and our resources. We can agree that far from improving, the issues and impacts are now worse than five years ago. Regardless of what we determined to be the root causes beyond the physical disabilities, untreated mental illness, and substance abuse, and addiction, and often all three, the City of Chico clearly has some, but as yet undefined, role and responsibility for addressing this issue as it directly impacts the city. As Mr. Orme points out in his staff report, the recent history has left behind many attempts to act through voluntary coalitions, building, to balance the needs of indigent individuals, while the equally urgent need to address the negative impacts on the rest of our citizenry. Yet this has largely been unaddressed, and attempts to act have been met with resistance by well-organized and motivated homeless industry activists, the latest example of which is the pending legal action. In the meantime, the negative impact on the city continues unabated. At the root of this failure is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the facts on the ground. We cannot say for certain we understand any of the most relevant facts. We cannot得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得 the situation and conditions that we are faced with. That is the first priority. We need a fresh, impartial, objective look at this situation before we march off in any direction in pursuit of a plan. Our efforts to accomplish this internally has failed to produce the desired outcomes. And it is the desired outcomes, not the services delivered, that is the measure of success. For these reasons, I strongly support bringing Mr. Webster on board and helping the city navigate through this extremely complex and difficult issue. Thank you very much. CHRISTIE WOODARD- Jessica Giannola followed by Robin Engle. JESSICA GIANNOLA- Counsel, entering into a plan with Hope Street Coalition will be another money-wasting step taken in the wrong direction for this city to make. We should not use city dollars to hire anyone with unproven theories to tell us we have unhoused folks increasing in size by the week in Chico. Our city mirrors any other city in the country in declining wages, declining resources, decreasing affordable housing units, and multi-decade drop in HUD-funded rental units and vouchers no longer available to the increasing poverty-stricken populations. . The Oconee refs and others have already explained our needs and deficits numerous times. You just need to believe them. Homelessness is a symptom of a larger complex problem. The people aren't nomads. They are not out camping. They are barely surviving, some not surviving at all. Affordability is the number one issue here. Our market rate for housing is too high. The fire increased demand, and before that, students routinely impact the supply and demand chain, as well as driving up costs that push area families and single renters further out of the market. Expensive subdivisions cater to commuters, not locals. You have something like over 95% of the bills in the past decade that have been for middle to high income wage earners, not low income, not poor, and certainly not for unhoused folks. The housing trickle-down effect does not exist here. Supplying more middle income housing does not free up for low income housing for unhoused to move into. We need to build it and create it. We need low barrier housing here. I see social media comments that reflect a serious misunderstanding, as to what type of shelters we have available here and who can access it. We need a low barrier that it takes in people off the street, dogs, couples, intoxicated with carts and belongings at all. That's what we need. We need more job training programs, much like we just, which was discounted when we were talking about the funding available from the COVID-19 funding. We need low barrier. It takes people, I already said that one, we need those to get people employed, the jobs, so that they have a shot at becoming more unhoused. We need local access to addiction services, more providers willing to take Medi-Cal, or have access to grants that will pay for services that will help people. If they go untreated, they will continue to exist in limbo and fall into the parks and crates. If we keep pushing homeless to another town, never doing anything to help them, eventually we reach a point where there is nowhere else to push them, and we are faced with a giant, complicated housing and poverty crisis, like that exists now. The city has to be involved with building and zoning. The city needs to spend wisely and cease petty legal shenanigans. The city needs to recognize all citizens and take responsibility for the failed policies and grave misunderstandings about poor people living in the parks. They are there out of necessity unless you have a degree in sociology, public health, psychology, or any other human being in your field. It is understandable that you struggle as a city to understand what steps to take in problem solving instead of problem creating. Just more, but please don't hire this guy. Robin Engle, followed by Grace Marvin. The reason that the housing crisis has not been resolved is you. You refuse to resolve it. You refuse to fix it. And this is another incidence of kicking the can down the road. Paul Webster has not ever lived in Chico. He has no credential. He has no education to his name. He's not a doctor. He certainly doesn't show any degree of education. He agrees. The Hope Street Coalition is not an actual building. It's not an actual program. It's his brand, and that's it. His brand supports only congregate housing or concentration camp style model housing, which is what you all support except for Alex Brown. He has been very clear that he's against tiny homes. He's against Housing First, which is, in fact, the only housing model with a proven track record, which is, in fact, the only housing model with a proven track record, which is, in fact, the only housing model with a proven track record, to serve our community that is without housing and to help them gain the skills to maintain housing. Housing First is, again, the only model, but Paul Webster automatically says that's off the table. And you want to reach for him, this man in Southern California who has no credibility to his name, but because he says, oh, yeah, I like concentration camp style housing, which you want at the airport. So he's yet another excuse for pushing forward with your plan to send 571 or more people to the airport site with no food, water, shelter, heat, cooling, transportation, or social services, nothing that a person needs to survive. But Paul Webster says it's good, so let's go for that. No, it's not okay. Not in my backyard. Not in our backyard. We won't allow it. We won't allow for this. We're not stupid, and we know that this is just a grab because there's another white, rich, capitalistic man who's trying to take advantage of tragedy. And you can say, well, he supports this. And you can pay him $50,000. No, that's way more than I make in a year of my hard work to help lift people's mental health and help them get out of these housing insecure or unhoused situations. $50,000, no. I'm not okay with that. We are not okay with that as a community. Hello. I'm Grace Marvin, as you well know by now. And I would like to address points that I've written down here. But I first want to mention how impressed I am with what, right, what Bob Barry calls the homeless advocacy industry. These people, a lot of the people who are talking tonight, they have been homeless. Some of them have been homeless themselves. They've grown up in poverty. They've not chosen to become wealthy. They've chosen to be of service to other people. And I think that their voice is much stronger than mine can be. But I'm going to briefly read my comments, nonetheless. I'd like you to please consider a different use for the almost $50,000 you proposed to give Walt Webster and Hope Street, since he doesn't even have a record of actual service to the homeless. I'd like you to please ask about that before you vote on it. What is his record? Where has he built homes? What has he done? I haven't seen it anywhere in the records. Arguing about how the homeless need therapy instead of housing is fruitless. And he does that. Instead, be specific in terms of the kind of housing this city can build, how much money should be allocated to social services, including therapy, and what the timeline is for providing those services. Look at other communities who have successfully dealt with homelessness. It is urgent for the homeless to be helped well before the March of the proposed contract with Hope Street. And so much of the fact finding that you want from them is already available. The homeless need solid sheltering now to provide them stability, safety, protection from the elements, hygiene facilities, health and or psychological care, and easily accessible social services. They want to get situated and plan for their, their future. And we want them to do that as well. Consider what happened at Comanche Creek last Sunday. What if someone was murdered in your neighborhood where you had a home that you cannot lock, and you were also in fear of COVID, theft, rape, or suffering from some other violence? You have received numerous housing and service plans provided by knowledgeable local advocates for free. Why don't you reconsider them with us advocates helping and cheering you on? Thank you. Julie Zinner followed by Julie Threat. Okay. And Julie Threat withdrew her card, so Angela McLaughlin will follow Julie Zinner. Good evening, Mayor and city councilors and staff. Please do not agree to waste almost $50,000 on Hope Street Coalition to solve Chico's homeless problems. Hope Street founded only on February 4th of this year. It is a coalition of one. Paul Webster, Paul Webster has no track record of any programs for the homeless recommended and brought to completion. His pathetic website, if you looked, consists of two testimonials, one from a drug addict and one from an individual with mental illness, and one, amicus brief. He was vice president of the San Diego based nonprofit, Solutions for Change, that lost its HUD funding in April of 2019 because Solutions refused to accept the housing first model and would not accept clients with any addiction or active mental illness. How was Paul Webster picked by this council? He did not respond to the request for qualifications. What vetting has he really undergone after his July 5th presentation to the council? Paul Webster recommends that the mentally ill and drug addicted who are not physically ill or mentally ill, be forced to accept treatment by jailing them. This is literally on his website. A great policy incentive. Yet he laments the lack of mental health services integrated with indoor shelter. The exact model of Everhart Village, the collaboration of Arbutte County and CHAT. Moreover, he recommends, that the city be given a $50,000 grant to help the homeless and the homeless. The plan would not be rolled out until April 1st, 2022. Too late to help the homeless through one winter, two winters, and their constant dangers we've recently seen. What a waste of taxpayers' money on top of the mounting legal expenses of fighting Judge England's injunction. The city's !! And the truly travesty of so-called airport solutions. Thank you. Please reconsider what you're doing. Angela McLaughlin, followed by Patrick Newman. Mark Orme's recommendations are stunning in their failure to actually address the issues of homelessness in our communities. He gives the game away early on in this report when he discusses the background, saying, this nomadic-style, nomadic-type lifestyle and living on the streets made the homeless far more visible. This isn't nomadic, and it isn't a lifestyle for the majority of the people on our streets. It's been amply and repeatedly demonstrated that the majority of people living on our streets were local residents before they became homeless. Something that holds true for homeless populations across the country. But never mind. To admit this is a homegrown problem might hint at our collective failure to provide affordable housing, mental health, and other services that would actually address the issue. Paul Webster is the director of financial services at HUD. Financial services. His direct experience with programs addressing homelessness is limited. What he does have in abundance are connections with the far right. This includes an alliance with Robert Marbut, a widely discredited Trump appointee, and an endorsement from Dr. Drew, a widely discredited reality TV snake oil salesman who is also beloved on the right. That he was invited to the council by a QAnon-subscribing disgraced former council member speaks volumes. His organization is a community of people, and the organization has no experience, no successful projects to show, and no evidence of efficacy whatsoever. Chico already has an abundance of privately funded religious slash sober living facilities and transitional housing. Those work well for certain segments of the homeless population, and they're an important resource for the community. However, what we don't have is true low barrier shelter, a livable sanctioned camp, or tiny homes and SROs that address the needs of those in extreme poverty who may need longer term or permanent supportive housing. We don't need more of what we already have, and that is all that Webster is selling. Add to that, if you look at the timeline on his proposal, he won't even provide a plan until March 2022. To throw money to a man who doesn't live in the area, has no experience with our particular set of challenges or resources, no track record of success, is fiscally irresponsible, particularly given the good that money could do locally. We need action, not more partisan obfuscation. We have ready to deliver projects that could house people with appropriate supportive services in a matter of months. Reject this proposal and do the right thing for Chico. Patrick Newman, followed by Nancy Park. Uh, well, I have an uncomfortable suggestion. First of all, why don't we have Suzy Cochum here? Why don't we have a conversation that's open and transparent and go through some kind of inventory of what she experienced trying to be the homes coordinator for Chico? Why not have that conversation? Why not say, hey, Suzy, what did you experience trying to do this? So that we can all learn from that process that we spent money for. For her salary, to come here and try to do this job. Why don't we have that conversation? It would take a lot of courage to have her come up here and say, hey, this is what I saw. But no. Instead, we're going to move, we're going to transition over to Paul Webster, who's at the opposite end of the spectrum from Lloyd Pendleton, who, if you watch his TED talk, you'll see a beautiful description of how Housing First works and what we should be doing in this country. We need to get 500,000 people off our streets in a humane way, which is to provide some kind of shelter. I don't care what it is, but something that's adequate for individual needs. It's not rocket science. We could do this for a fraction of our federal budget. We don't do it. We don't have the services that these people need in order to be successful at being housed. And so we dump them onto the street. They deteriorate. We see behaviors we don't like. And we keep repeating this. And we keep digging deeper. What's Paul Webster's answer to this? It's the opposite of Lloyd Pendleton. He's not saying Housing First, get people housed, and then deal with their demons, which is what I did when I worked with development-disabled adults for 10 years. You house people. Then you help them be successful at being housed. You don't throw people into some kind of situation where they deteriorate and decompensate and then turn around and say, the only solution to the housing problem is to incarcerate more people. We need to put more people in jail. We need to force more drug addiction programs. We need to take away 5150 limitations and actually conserve people on grounds that we abandoned 30, 40 years ago. Those grounds. So we're going to go backwards on civil liberties. We're going to go backwards on human rights. And we're going to listen to Paul Webster tell us that the solution to a housing crisis is more incarceration. And that's really what it boils down to. And so he steers the conversation away from things like tiny house villages, away from the kind of simple shelter that stabilizes people's lives and allows them to recover from the disease of being homeless, which is really what it is. It destroys people. I watch them be destroyed. This guy is being brought in because we don't have the courage to look deeper. We don't have the courage to look at what really might work. But this is some sort of an answer. But it is not an answer. Thank you. Nancy Park is our last speaker. A couple of months ago, the city council formed an ad hoc committee to solicit information and suggestions from a wide spectrum of our community. Business, law enforcement, providers to homeless people, and more. Many of us welcomed and participated in this opportunity. It was a great opportunity to give suggestions about ways to respond to the federal judge's order to provide shelter to unhoused people camping in our parks and greenways. Not only that, but local providers have responded to requests for proposals with suggestions for designated sanctioned campgrounds and other solutions. The result, after all those committee meetings, the location out at the Chico airport barely used because of inadequate facilities and the very real danger of heat stroke in our triple digit summer temperatures. As we know now, the judge emphatically did not accept this as a solution. Then along comes a dog and pony show from an out of town person with virtually no track record and you want to reward him a $49,000 contract? What about all the testimony from local people at the ad hoc committee sessions? What about the many local organizations that already have experience in working with and housing unhoused people? Therefore, to contract with this organization is a major mistake and a waste of taxpayers' money. Behave yourself and don't Behave Behave Behave Behave Behave Behave Behave Behave Behave Behave Behave Behave which is weird. So I've watched this a long time. I've watched this go through trying to do the, I can't remember the name for it now, when Laura and the chief and I were trying to do the renewal center out of the BMX track, which started that whole thing, and we're going to have community court and do all these things, and the judges told us no, and the courts told us no, and one of our best service providers said, this is really hard to work with all these different, not just the city, the different service providers, some people wanted different things, and they went and did something else completely on their own, and other people have done things on their own, and they've stopped and they've started. The city itself has been through two homeless solution providers, both who came from that side of the argument, or whatever you want to call it. I met Paul Webster, ironically, on a phone call when we were trying to repurpose the Paradise Hospital into a mental health wellness center. He was working for HUD. I was working for Dr. Ben Carson. He called me after, and he said, a lot of these things that you guys are trying to do with this hospital didn't relate to Chico. He says, these are the things that need to happen. A lot of what HUD sends money out for, they know doesn't work, but the COCs apply for it because that's the way the policy is written. I just say all that to say this. He's got some experience. He might not have experience in Chico. We've got lots of people with experience in Chico on both sides of the fence, and I think they all skew numbers to their own reckoning. I'll see who makes the motion and how it comes out, but I am interested to hear from somebody outside what's happening locally because what's happening locally doesn't work. Nobody can say it does. Nobody here can say they've got a solution. I'm going to have to come up here and say we don't have one, but I'm not sitting here saying I've got one. No one in California has got a solution. No one in the federal government has got a solution. We've got to think a little bit differently to do what we can to get along because if we just sit here pointing fingers at each other all the time, it's going to look just like this or worse. So I'm interested in something else. I think I heard the skipper say that you would put off hiring another homeless solution provider? Correct. So what we'd do is we'd delay the hiring of a homeless solutions coordinator. I'm going to fill that. Yeah, so basically we would just put a pause on that one until we had a plan so we knew what to implement because the assumption being, and after talking to him, it really pointed to the fact that, we are attempting to be bridge builders when, in fact, maybe we can more strategically utilize resources to create more than a bridge, but to create a better solution. And so by spending money with a homeless solutions coordinator, we're putting money into something when the plan may say we may need something else. That makes sense. And I think some of the other part of that, and I liked and respected both the homeless solutions coordinators for the most part, and some of the things... And some of the things that they can do, and some of the things that both sides of this argument ask us to do are implausible or impossible. And maybe what we need is less, here's how to solve homelessness, and more, here's a strategy that will work given all of the flawed laws of the federal level and the state level, all of the different funding that's available given all the different constraints that you have to fill in. And no one's ever done that. Not here. They've come along and said, okay, given what resources there are, we'll try to make this work. We knew it wasn't going to work. We're trying to do the best we can. I'm willing to hear a different opinion. That's my statement. Mr. Orm, just a follow-up question. When you say build more than bridges, can you give some examples of that? That's what I'm hoping he will, if council goes in this direction, because building bridges has been what we've done for many years. That's really the heart and soul of what staff has brought forward to councils ever since I've been here. It's like, well, here's an item that could potentially build a bridge to allowing this nonprofit to achieve a level of success in this area. And so maybe there is a bigger plan that can be conceptualized. I don't know what that is. And I will tell you, talking to a lot of my counterparts in other cities throughout the 480 plus cities in the state of California, nobody's got it down yet. And so I would say looking at the facts as he's proposing to do may help us. It's up to council ultimately to make the decision. If they're going to build bridges, then we're going to build bridges. So if you don't want to build a bridge, then you don't want to build a得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得 so thank you yeah i'd like to make some comments um and i think i'll probably take my full three minutes on this one since that's a big one i'm fully supportive of strategic plans those plans should be developed by experts in developing strategic plans and using the best evidence available as it relates to the causes and conditions of homelessness not the symptoms i believe in housing and intensive wraparound services as solutions to this crisis because the overarching evidence suggests these two things in combination to most effectively move the greatest number of people to stability and that stability includes the management of mental health and substance use concerns i'm also open to alternative views which is why i voted to approve the presentation i would have never voted to approve the hope street presentation if there was an indication that it was actually a sales pitch for the city of chico by a brand new organization with no track record of developing strategic plans to address homelessness and housing and i think that's a great way to start the conversation i think that's a great way to start the conversation at the municipal level when mr webster provided his presentation to council he suggested that zoning should be used as a policy stick for service providers who don't do what the city wants them to do in addressing homelessness he suggested that the symptoms of homelessness hold more weight than its root causes as indicated by decades of research when we hired two homeless solutions coordinators as we've mentioned they collaborated with local service providers to the best of their ability to identify needs assess gaps in service present solutions to council and to address homelessness and homelessness at the municipal level when mr webster provided his presentation to council he suggested that the symptoms of homelessness should be addressed homelessness and homelessness in the city so these are all things identified in mr webster's report are things that have already been done local service providers already know which funding streams are available and which ones are worth applying to they know the emotional physical mental structural and policy barriers that unsheltered folks face when moving along the continuum of care they know we need detox facilities and even more treatment for mental health concerns to be part of our approach mr webster didn't tell us anything we don't already know during his presentation until in july presented no tangible policy ideas aside from the zoning policy which i adamantly oppose and neither he nor his brand new organization have experience developing these plans for city what this means is that chico would be his first official contract i will not vote to have us be the guinea pig for kick-starting an organization which has no track record in a specific area of policy development and community engagement and which neglects evidence-based practice in favor of ideology and addressing symptoms not to mention that starting our efforts by excluding swaths of people who are homeless but have no need for addiction or mental health issues we are committed to addressing these problems and we are committed to得ш得ш every city with this issue wants that goal to be met. There is a reason that nobody has been able to solve it because unfortunately with this complex issue there are no shortcuts and Mr. Webster is not going to offer us any shortcuts. Hope Street is a misuse of our American Rescue Plan dollars, sorry, of our city funding and I won't support it. All right, any other comments? I just had a couple quick comments. Mr. Orman, thank you for bringing this forward. Somebody who has extensive experience addressing homelessness at the local, state, and federal levels. He has provider experience in leading homelessness service organizations, providing shelter, transitional, and permanent supportive housing. He has intimate knowledge of assisting cities with planning, addressing the needs of the housed and the unhoused. He understands county programs focused on the poor and needy. He has extensive experience in homelessness programs at the policy and the policy at the state and federal levels. Prior to forming Hope Street, Mr. No Credibility Webster was the Senior Policy Advisor on Homelessness Policy and Programs at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. We're fortunate to have that qualified knowledge. His diversity in views and wages and experience in other communities and breadth of knowledge and objectivity will benefit our efforts. My answer to Webster's question is, what about all the local people? Look at how much all our local people have been working for so many years and we're still in the same place. So having an outside view to give us a different perspective, I believe, is worth our investment. All right. Any further comments? City Manager Orman, do you think there's a possibility that the time frame for his proposal could be shortened? I think that every contractor is asking, can you get it done faster? And I think that he's put in there a reasonable period of time in his mind in order to do the due diligence that's necessary. I think that one of the primary reasons why it is what it is, and obviously I can go back and ask him that, should it be council's desire, is, hey, can you tighten this up a bit, is because he has to attempt to get information that hasn't been readily available to council, because I know council's asked for some information, hasn't been as readily available. So I think that's a good question. I know council's desired. So he knows there's going to be some tug and pull to get some of the information together that he needs. But I'm always happy to ask him if he can tighten that time frame up, should it be council's desire. But, yeah, absolutely. All right. Well, council. Make a motion to approve 5.2, and I would make a note to ask Mr. Orman to see if Mr. Webster could tighten that time frame up and move that report back any sooner. Second that. Okay. Okay. We have a motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second by Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Absolutely not. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 6-1. All right. Moving on to item 5.3, American Rescue. Plan Economic Recovery Programs. Welcome Jennifer McCarthy to the podium. Deputy City Manager. Go ahead. All right. Hold this up. All right. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the council. I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager here for the City of Chico. Tonight I'll be providing you information on the city of Chico. We're going to be looking at the allocation on proposed economic development and youth programs to be funded through the local allocation of the American Rescue Plan. I'm going to provide just a couple of quick briefs on the American Rescue Plan because we do have a couple of new counselors with us tonight. The American Rescue Plan with the Federal Recovery Act that is set in place to aid in pandemic response and recovery both from a federal level, a state level, and then also at a local level. Thank you. The use of these funds is guided by the U.S. Treasury through their interim final rule. They propose a variety of different uses, giving the local jurisdiction some flexibility in utilizing these funds, but really putting it into five main categories. And that is to help support public health expenditures, to help with recovery of economic impacts, to help replace lost public sector revenues, to provide premium pay to essential workers, and also to assist in the recovery of public health. We're going to be looking at the得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得得 funds to support economic recovery in our community. Today I will be giving you details on three of these. You'll see in this slide we have five programs listed. One of the proposed programs after reviewing the interim final rule was found to not be in compliance with the rules of the American Rescue Plan so you'll see we have a hundred thousand dollars that is yet to be allocated. The council can choose today to use those for other economic recovery items or they can suggest other uses that meet the American Rescue Plan regulations. And also you will not be hearing about the small business support program tonight. We are still working on the details of that program and we hope that by September we'll be able to provide you some details on that. We're working with three core who is our local partner who has a contract with the county to do a gap analysis to really come to light what is needed with our local business community. We want to make sure that we truly are being responsive to those needs. So I'm not going to go into too much detail on all of these programs because I did provide you detailed information in the staff report but I will provide you a summary of each of the three economic recovery programs that are being proposed tonight. The first is a city tourism program estimated at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The real purpose of this program is to help create an awareness of Chico as a destination and that is a destination for tourism or recreation and for business travel. So as you all know we are part of Explore Butte County which is a regional tourism business improvement district and their whole goal is to bring people into Butte County area. The purpose of this is to take that and really expand upon it and make sure that those people and others have an opportunity to truly explore our city of Chico, spend their dollars here, stay here, maybe consider opening a business here in the future as well. So these funds would be utilized to do such things as develop a website, create tourism assets, create city itineraries, create other information that that we can provide to the public about why people should choose Chico. In addition to that there would be a marketing strategy and implementation of this through social media marketing as well. The second item is a downtown temporary parklet development. This item is at three hundred thousand dollars. As you know when the pandemic hit, our businesses were very very impacted especially our restaurants and our bars and others food establishments that had to shutter their doors. The city moved quickly and created a temporary parklet ordinance that allowed as you can see in the downtown area as several businesses to be able to provide outdoor seating and right now they're around some concrete pay rails. This these funds would be able to put together the design, construction, and installation of temporary parklets. They would be designed with safety and aesthetics in mind. To remind the council of what a parklet is, these are seating areas that are actually in the public right of way. So you have the building, then the sidewalk, and then you have the parklet area. And again these are temporary structures. Temporary meaning that they are in place as long as our emergency ordinance is in place or as long as there is another local ordinance that is put in place or until such time as there's permanent roadway improvements that need to happen in the downtown area. With 300,000 we anticipate that we'd be able to cover the design and construction of up to approximately 8 temporary parklets in the downtown area. The next program is a building enhancement program at 200,000 dollars and this is not your traditional facade improvement program this is more of a paint-up fix-up type of a program. And I say that because during the pandemic, we had a lot of businesses that needed to take their funds and actually put it into the revenues that they were not receiving, right, for their cash flow purposes. They need to put it into changes and modifications to the inside of their business so that they could operate. And so there was many businesses that have been unable to really keep up their business. When we originally talked about this program, we talked about it on June 8th from the downtown perspective, and the council requested that this be brought back and be something that's allowed for any business that's in the city of Chico. And so that is the program that's before you today. Businesses that participate would have to show impact from COVID-19 because there is a requirement that the funds that go towards recovery, we have to actually show harm of a business. So when there's a direct relationship. So there would be a small amount of underwriting that would have to be done as part of this program with $300,000 and grants that could be issued up to $300,000 per business. We could be talking approximately 13 businesses within the City of Chico or more that could receive funds. So that's it from the three projects and that we talked about tonight. I'm asking the council to either approve the programs as they're presented or revise those draft programs or provide further direction on how you would like the funds to be used for the American Rescue Plan. Any questions? I just have one. I usually know better than the question staff because I know how many hours go into putting these things together. But I have to ask the question. On the city tourism dollars, I don't know that we can actually link this to addressing negative economic impacts caused by a public health emergency, but hypothetically, maybe, possibly, could that money be used to help move the BMX site? There are actually funds that were part of the American Rescue Plan that went to council on June 8. There was $600,000 that was preliminary allocated for that project, and I do believe that the supplemental appropriation has gone forward to council. The last meeting, was it? Okay, now you're just showing off your memory. No, that's good enough. Thank you. Okay, thank you. I have a question regarding the parklet. Will that be particular to a restaurant, or it will be open to anybody who can be able to use it? It would be for restaurants. So, what I mean to say is, like, we know there is one by the raw bar, right? But only the people who go to that particular restaurant are able to use it. But when cities are making these temporary ones, is that open to be used as a collective that anybody can use it? Or it will be exclusively for that particular restaurant? That's a really good question. I appreciate you bringing that up, because different cities approach it different ways. The project that's before you today would be for an individual business. And part of the reason is the upkeep of that, the monitoring of that, making sure that there's an eye on customers. And so, to simplify that process, the parklet would be for an individual business, as opposed to just open to the public to hang out. Thank you. I would like to see something more inclusive, you know, where it can help all the businesses who do not have a front where they can make a parklet. Because not every business is on the main road. There are certain businesses who are on the inside, but their patrons should be able to use it if cities are providing it. If that could be accommodated, I'd like to request that. So the program that's being proposed would be for any business in the downtown area. But if I understand what you're asking, is you would like that to be expanded beyond just the downtown area? What I'm trying to say is that it should not be... Like somebody can just go, you know, take a to-go meal from one place. They should be able to sit and eat it there, because it's provided by the city. It's not... But if a business provides it, then okay, like Rob did their outdoor seating, which is just for their patrons, right? But if city's providing, it's more like to be more open. It's something... I understand what you're requesting. Thank you. Just wanted to clarify that. All right. Vice Mayor. The only other question I had on the eight parklets. Would these bill then be the only parklets that will be allowed? It would be nice just to keep the consistency and have everything looking nice. You know, you're gonna spend all this money on this beautiful parklet in one place, and the next place you have your barriers. So are we gonna say we're only gonna allow eight parklets in town, or are we just providing the financing for the eight? The intent was to take whether the parking lot is going to be a parking lot, or the parking lot is going to be a parking lot, and then we're going to have to make sure that the parking lot is going to be a parking lot. What is done now and be able to replace with better functioning parklets that are more aesthetically pleasing. There would still need to be an application process that was part of that because there may be other businesses that are interested and opening it up to them. I propose in there, in the staff report, you'll see the proposal of an application process that has a scoring system. Part of that scoring system, there would be additional points. However, for those businesses that are currently operating parklets successfully in downtown, so that there is that weight on their behalf. And then to address Ms. Tandon's statement, theoretically somebody like, say, the Garden Walk Mall could be an applicant, and it could be outside, and everyone who uses those interior businesses and anybody else could use that area. However, somebody would need to take on the ownership of maintaining it, cleaning it, and so forth. So, if there's a lot of work that needs to be done, and seeing that, that wouldn't be a city project. But if there is a coalition of businesses wanting to take that on, then that could be more of an open-type area, correct? Right. Okay. All right. Any other questions? One more. All right. Another question. Council Member Tandon, then one for me. That's right. Would there be a requirement to see if those businesses were impacted, who would benefit from this program? No. Because it is in the downtown business district. So, it's a lot of work. We can show that the downtown business district was negatively impacted because of the pandemic. Because of the number of businesses that shut down. Because of the lack of activity that occurred during the pandemic in that district. It is the only business district in our area that we could actually say that. If that were to be expanded beyond a business district, beyond the downtown business district, then we would have to have each one of the individual businesses. We'd have to do an underwriting that showed that they were affected. We'd have to do an underwriting that showed that they were individually financially impacted by them. Which they all would be anyways. All right. So, I've got a couple of aspects I just wanted to bring up. I think the city tourism is long overdue. I definitely think that's something great. Parklets, you know, I think are a really valuable program. And a lot of cities have the parklets and they seem to work really successfully. The only concern I have with the building in Atlanta is that it's not a really good place to live. So, I don't want to island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island island and not just in the downtown. I know that's focused all over the city. So what are your thoughts on, because we have that extra $100,000, correct? Correct. So if we were to designate that to, say, the Chamber or the Downtown Business Association, the DCBA, do you think that would fit within the realm of the Recovery Act? If the council chose to do that, you absolutely could. The American Rescue Plan states that loans and grants to businesses and nonprofits that experienced economic harm as a result of the pandemic are eligible for funding. That being said, those business districts, I mean, the Downtown Business District as well as the Chico Chamber, not only could you say, I mean, we would have to ask them and they would have to show us their books to show us that they were financially impacted, right? But once they did that, they could also show a plan towards how they're helping our other businesses recover. So as an example, when I was with the County of Butte, the County of Butte funded both the DCBA and the Chamber with CARES Act funds because of the work that they were doing with our business community to help get the word out about the regulations, to help keep businesses open, to help them understand what grant sources were coming down, and I'm sure that level of work could continue with both of those organizations. Okay. Any other questions? Did that answer your question? It did. Thank you. How many speakers, Madam Clerk? Two. One. All right. Jessica Giannola. Okay. Okay. So the American Rescue Plan funds, we really needed to allocate. Okay. These funds better. Chico's focus needs to be on life recovery and addressing our current housing and health catastrophe. Our crisis could no longer go unignored, but somehow we keep acting like we're going to ignore it, and it's not there. Expenditures put towards building enhancement, tourism. We have people dying here, and they're going to die again this winter. Parking. That all should be tabled to another time. After we put resources, sports, life and deaths issues, housing our citizens that are being shoveled around the city in a failing game of out of sight, out of mind. Housing people will stabilize them, and leaving a portion of our citizens to suffer will only lead to more mitigation costs in both legal and circumstantial casualties. So there's one and three quarters million dollars that the city was given to make wise decisions on how do we help recover from a pandemic, and how do we improve the lives of people here? I can't imagine the people who wrote out that plan was picturing that they were talking about tourism and parking. So $100,000 that doesn't have a name right now, I'm supporting Sean with this suggestion, the BMX. That should have been funded a long time ago, should have been done a long time ago. And if there's money and it keeps stopping it, we've got money here and it should be allocated better. So $100,000. With the downtown park development, that's $300,000. I would nix it. I would nix it. Tourism, 250, nix it. Just bring it back. I do support businesses that do need sustainability and assistance. There are businesses that were impacted, really, by the pandemic. They're struggling really hard. And they do need to have funding so that they can stay afloat, catch back up. Money should go to them for that. But extra stuff. . Thanks, Jessica, for knowing your time better than we did. I didn't know what it was. So thank you. No, no, it's okay. She was close, I think. So we appreciate that. All right. Any further discussion or will of the council? I would say, barring no other comments, we did have, Mr. Ornn, maybe you could remind us how much of the recovery money that we did already allocate prior for other stuff, ballpark it for us, because I know it's a lot. The majority, but there's probably about half of it or so. But I'd have to go back and get you the actual numbers. Yeah. And it did encompass quite a few other things. Correct. A lot of other things, including homelessness items. All right. If no one else wants to, I'd make a motion that we approve the $250,000, the $300,000, the building enhancement program at $5,000 per business, and then $100,000 to be designated between the Chamber and DCVA if we can have them find reasonable means. I will offer a friendly amendment to your motion. Sure. Splitting the $100,000 between the Chamber and the DCVA. It doesn't seem fair. Okay. The Chamber serves the whole city. It's bigger. True. I'll go $75,000 and $25,000. I'm fine with that. I'll accept that amendment. Okay. Make it a second. All right. Thank you. So $75,000 for the Chamber and $25,000 for the DCVA. Okay. All right. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. No. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. It's after 10, so we're not allowed to address further issue. So I think we... Madam Clerk, what's the rule again on the past 10 o'clock? We stop after 10 o'clock, because with the P&P 1010... So we can't do a new item, correct? Correct. Correct. So we will visit with you next meeting. All right. So with that, we will adjourn, or well, hold on, not adjourn, and get back to my agenda. So I've got a few other things to do. All right. Is the voting delegate a time-sensitive thing, or can that wait? Actually, let me check. Okay. Yeah, when's the conference? It's advised council action by August 31st. We may not have a second meeting in August. This is a very simple item, if you're willing to take that up, but then I'm sure the deputy city manager's item was a very simple item as well, so I don't want to... It is... In order to get a reservation and rooms and all of that, it would be important to get that one done. That conference in September? Yes. It is in September, the 22nd through the 24th. So should I click on that item, or are you going to like... You brought it up, Mr. Morgan. What do you think? I think we're going quick. Okay, so very quickly, I just need a council person to serve. Move to extend the meeting or to hear that item. You don't have to actually make a motion to do that. Okay. That would take longer. Yeah. So it is every year you have the opportunity to send a representative from the council to attend the League of California Cities meeting, this convention, and this one is actually in Sacramento this time, so there wouldn't be airfare. The cost would be substantially less. In addition, we usually appoint one. In order to have a voting delegate, there are different resolutions and different things that come up at that meeting that they want to hear from the cities. Your representative would be... The person to do that. In the past, council has sent staff as well as council members. It's entirely up to you what you would like to do. Do we have any public comment on the issue? No. All right. What will the council? I want to nominate two people. Okay. Well, in honor of her new position as a deputy city clerk, or chief, sorry, chief, deputy city chief, I want to nominate two people. What is it? Skipper. Deputy city skipper. Should go as a staff member, and I know that I have heard from Councilmember Brown. She's interested in attending, and I have absolutely zero interest in attending the League of California Cities. So if there's not anybody else who would rather go, I'd nominate those two people. Do we need a second on a nomination? You don't... It doesn't have to be that formal. We can take directions. We can take a motion. And you would want Councilmember Brown to be the voting delegate. Okay. Councilmember Brown, are you comfortable with that? I really appreciate it. Thank you. All right. And if Jen finds value, then Skipper finds value and have her go, fine. But you don't have to. I mean, I can just... The glowing look on your face shows how excited you are. It is close, though. Much closer than normal. So... Just really quick, I want to say I really, really wanted to go and was looking forward to it. However, I'm going to be out of town right prior to it. So it doesn't work good for me. So I'm super happy that Ms. Brown will be there and do that. Okay. So that's enough direction and... Anyone else has anything to say that we've got our representatives? Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. Okay. At this point in time, we'll move on to reports and commissions. Following reports and commissions, our items are provided for the Council's information. No action can be taken on the items under this section unless the Council agrees to include it on a subject matter. Subsequent agenda, city manager's report. Due to the lateness of the evening, knowing that we still have closed session items, I will have nothing tonight to report. Thank you. That's very kind of you. Okay. Item 6.2, Councilmember, request for consent to APNP-1010. I just can't get through that. Councilmembers may verbally request that item to be agendaized at future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority vote of the Council is needed in order for this item to be agendaized. Councilmembers may also submit requests in writing. And I believe we have a request from Councilmember Morgan. It's on there. It's on the agenda item. writing itself on that story. I'd like to discuss it. Alright. We have a motion from Council Member Morgan. Do we have a second? Second. Second from Vice Mayor Reynolds. Council Member Bennett. Council Member Brown. I'm open to discussing it, so yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. Alright, we will adjourn in closed session at this time. Thank you very much. Oh, was there any other? No. Sorry. You're right. There's no public comment for a closed session, and are there any Council disqualifications? No. Okay, awesome. Didn't think so. Thank you. Clerk Preston. Thank you.
