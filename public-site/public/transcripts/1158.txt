I'  ve lost fences in the recent  storm so I'  ve talked to a lot of fencing  contractors recently.  and in those conversations I have  asked them how to incorporate a  tree into a fence line.  and the two common remedies are  the simple and the simple  divert the fence around the tree  or to incorporate the tree into  the fence.  if the trunk is wide enough you  simply use the tree as part of  the fence if you will.  so those were the two remedies  that we offered mr.  duggins.  obviously I'  m not a qualified fence  contractor but that'  s some of the advice that I'  ve been given.  statement of the tree which would  be at mr.  duggins'  expense.  is mr.  duggins here?  yes.  I do have more pictures too  also that will be there.  I didn'  t hear the first statement  about the pruning the municipal  code on that I didn'  t read.  I will read it to you.  the code that I read out do  you want me to reread it for  you?  pursuant to cmc 14.40120 no  tree located in the city  right-of-way or public planting  shall be removed without a  permit or permission of the city  and only in those cases whereby  the tree is dead, dying, diseased  or hazardous.  okay I thought this said  something about the tree  thank you for letting me speak  tonight Madam Chair and  commissioners.  as you know I'  m here to request approval  of this and to harvest this tree  which has been denied.  I ask that you reconsider this  tonight.  the tree is impending on my  property.  it'  s not a planted tree.  this tree is probably from a  squirrel or blue jay putting an  acorn in the ground.  it'  s becoming more and more of a  hazard and a safety hazard also  as the tree has been growing it'  s over the walking path which is  utilized by families unhoused and  others which can be another hazard  of breaking limbs which is  happening as we speak.  I have some pictures there might  be some in there in the pamphlet.  the tree is actually growing what'  s happening is it'  s not a  tree but it'  s pushing my post all the way  forward because the base of the  tree is growing and that'  s what'  s causing it more to fall over  rather than just the branch that  is breaking.  in the email as the minister  over here suggested the different  remedies.  one of them was to approve or  pay for one of your approved  arborists to trim the tree to  keep it healthy.  I'  m a  comisensical guy but I'  s a good thing for me to pay for  your tree by your certified  picked out arborist to try to keep  it healthy.  I think by me harvesting the tree  will keep it it will take care of  the problem altogether.  I know that as a good neighbor if  my tree fell on our fence between  a neighbor and I I would be  responsible for it.  if I'  m driving a car I run into  somebody it'  s my responsibility to pay for  it.  I'  s one thing.  Another thing they suggested was  divert the fence and I'  m assuming that they'  re probably meaning around into  my property not the city'  s property.  That will I believe create another  space for unhoused to hide and  to defecate because that already  happens with the mission ranch  fence it comes down and it stops  right out my property I wish they  able to continue that beautiful fence all the way but my fence starts behind it and so they  already kind of go in there and do their thing i don't have a picture of that unfortunately  so by me just removing the tree is going to settle all this and like i said it wasn't a  planted tree or anything and just for me having to be responsible for something that's not mine  and just doesn't seem logical to me and i could be wrong on that there's some other municipal codes  about that and i just asked that you would reconsider and issue me the permit to harvest  a tree and i'll plant some new trees in my yard in you know in memory of that tree thank you  mr. duggins could you hold on a second please the commissioners might have questions for you  i have  for richie what's your estimate of the age of that valley oak because valley oaks could be  hundreds of years  thank you my microphone's on again um looking at the diameter of the tree um  from similar trees that we've taken uh tree ring counts you know it's it's not that old  it's probably between 40 and 50 years old  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  of valley oaks in that area?  Or what is...  You mean  are there new saplings?  What's  the density of the valley oaks in that  area? Is it scarce  or is it...  Of this age, there's a good overstory  of trees of this  size, but for the  younger region,  you kind of see  it in swaths, if you like.  But, you know,  generally  we're finding really throughout  the range of valley oak that we're  seeing it, a lot of  them seem to be struggling to actually  reach the mature sizes.  You know, there is a recruitment  issue going on that for  whatever reason, be it human  intervention, wildfire,  or, you know, various  factors, that  some folks are actually concerned  that, you know, without  human assistance,  you know, the natural regeneration  of native woodlands is  kind of struggling.  More particularly blue oaks,  if I'm being honest, more  than the valley oak.  But,  yeah, we haven't taken any particular  inventory of, you know,  the age classes of different  tree sizes that are along there.  But generally of a tree this  size, you know, we try and do everything  we can to maintain  the presence of that tree, you know,  it's very rare that we would  remove a tree of this size.  It's really only  trees that really  have come to the end of their useful  life, you know, and there's some big specimens  in Bidwell Park, for example,  that we're looking at closely  because they're, you know, the  risk profile is  kind of getting towards  being, you know, not acceptable, you know,  with it being in such a high traffic area.  But for a tree like  this that really is in the back  40,  really the only person to be impacted  by this tree is the applicant.  So we  generally very much just let the tree  age in  place, if you will, and just let it  provide the benefits that it provides  as a native tree for  wildlife habitat and such.  And from my experience, because I've  had similar situations with city  trees, especially limbs coming  into my backyard,  and when I called the tree crew,  they came and they  mitigated. They took all the  limbs out, they came and cut,  and they did that pretty much in a timely  manner. But they did  tell me at the time that  if I wanted to get a permit  or request the city,  they would trim the tree up.  But I,  you know, I could have taken,  I did some stuff at my  expense, but is there a possibility  that the city could go and do  some trimming on  this tree to mitigate  it, this damage?  It is possible, and what I  would do, if that is  something that the commission wants us to look  at, I would refer back with  Director Gustafson, Assistant Director  Lipsky, and we'll see  what resources  we have in terms of bandwidth  and financial resources.  Because  when we do spend resources  pruning trees,  it's usually the trees that are  impacting many people  in the right-of-way, in the streetscape,  if you like. So we spend  money pruning one tree, there's probably  1,000 people that benefit from that  tree. But in this particular  case, it really is just  in the boondocks, and  as you can see from the photographs,  it does back onto the applicant's  property.  You know, going back to  borrow some of the  thoughts from the Civil Code,  in California,  a homeowner is  permitted to prune  a neighbor's tree if it encroaches  onto their property.  They have to do it professionally,  and they have to get permission.  And that's basically what we're doing  with the permit. You know, we're giving permission  for them to prune  the encroachments, but it's  at their expense.  I understand  that, but I'm trying  to, you know,  mitigate the effects to  Mr. Duggan's  private property, which this tree  is doing, and at the same time  save that tree.  And Mr. Duggan's, is it  your concern  that the tree will continue  to ruin your fence, or  is it the homeless issue,  or do you just want the tree removed  just to be removed? I believe  that if something's not done, it's going to continue.  Like, I'm planning on replacing the  fence, because it's older.  This has fast-forwarded  that, because, I mean, the post  is sitting like this. Boards are falling  off because of the tree.  So, if  I believe, like, if it's not  pruned, because I'm going to be honest,  I'm not going to pay an arborist to come  prune the tree. I mean, it's not  affordable, you know.  So,  lens will continue to break. I mean, they have.  They land in my yard. There's one  leaning on the fence now.  And it is,  it's in a precarious spot, because  of where it is, the walking path  comes in as a curve. And you got  the Mission Ranch parking lot,  and it sits right there.  So, the last,  where the bike path starts off at Mission  Ranch, and then the last business  right there. So, I thought it was Mission  Ranch. I was like, oh, cool, I can deal,  you know, there'll probably be good neighbors  and help me out here and deal with it.  Come to find out, that little  piece of triangle,  right there is the city's. And so,  I was, I've actually  been emailing back and forth  for a few years, actually.  And I asked  repeatedly, can you come meet me  at the spot, and let's  talk about this. And that was denied.  So, I let it go, and I'm  like, well, you know, they're like, we can  drop off some aluminum nails,  and you can hammer the fence  board into the tree,  and then take out boards as it grows.  I'm like, that doesn't seem feasible.  for me either. So,  they didn't do that. So, then,  I found out I can ask for  a permit, so that I've done that.  Then I was denied, so they say,  oh, you can come speak. So, now, here I am.  That's what I did.  But is there a possibility if that  tree was trimmed at the  city's expense, and  that you would be more  apt to kind of  put your fence around it, or  into it, and then leave the tree?  Uh,  I suppose so.  I just, I mean, but that's  one time. I don't see the city  going to continuously come by  and prove them one tree. I just don't.  I mean, let's be honest. I know budgeting.  I know how that goes. I've worked for the county.  It's all about the bottom  dollar, so, and approval.  So, I appreciate you speaking  and asking these questions. I really  do, but I just,  I don't know what the benefit, I mean, I guess  because it's a native tree, but  I don't, it's not benefiting me.  That's for sure. And like I said,  I already have to pay for the fence and stuff,  so I don't, you know, if it continues  to break limbs, then do I,  I don't, I don't  think I'm able to send a bill to the  city. I don't think they're just going to look at them and say,  you're funny. So,  that's why I'm just, like, for me,  I can get in there and cut it.  We can use it as a renewable energy  and heat a house, make some wood stuff  out of it or something, and, you know,  and I'll plant trees in my yard that I will take  care of, you know. And I,  I did hear him say about  the law or the  codes about trimming the branches  that are on their side. I was kind of  curious about that because my thought always  was, your property lines  go straight up to the sky, right?  Just infinity and beyond.  So,  I was thinking, well,  to litigate some of the  tree falling on there, I just  trim all those branches  on my side. Well, then he said  part of that is  that it has to be done professionally to keep it healthy.  So, I don't think keeping, you know,  trimming straight up the tree is going to probably  be healthy for the tree, I'd imagine.  Then he'll probably start leaning the other way  to the parking lot, I'm guessing,  because of the weight.  So, I just, that's just my  thought.  And I know they do come  by and clean up the leaves all the time. I don't know  who's responsible for that. So, that's, you know,  doing all that. But I  just, I would like it to get a  permit and remove. That's, and it's,  I think it's a problem solved.  But if not, then we'll have to  work around it. Maybe you have  some fencing engineers that can  show me some designs.  I mean, if you want me to build  a fence around into the city property, then it'  s my tree and I can take care of it. I'  m happy to do that, too.  Mr. Duggins, can I interrupt? I  think there'  re some other commissioners that have questions for  ritchie and for you.  Okay. Sorry. Thank you.  Vice Chair Nava.  Thank you for the  Some of this I'm directing at  ritchie. Bear with me here.  But I did hear you say that you  believe it wasn'  t planted there specifically.  And, ritchie, would you concur with that?  I mean.  It'  s in a natural area.  So, yeah, probably likely that it'  s a volunteer tree.  Right. So, you know, because I will say I totally am  not a fan of the  t believe that.  I think it'  s a  process improvement note that when we see stuff like that  happen and it'  s budding up really close to someone'  s property line that we would be a little proactive about that along our bike paths and other areas.  I just wanted to do a process improvement note on that.  And just I was a little curious when I heard you, ritchie, say that he would be the one bearing the expense to prune.  And so part of me wondered also then is that an off?  Is it because it'  s like an off cycle request?  I hear you saying we go to where we get the most bang for the buck, which, again, makes total sense.  However, you know, it is a city tree.  And normally we have those on like a cycle for maintenance.  So is there some way also we might consider pairing it with when we get to that specific area for maintenance that that could be conjoined with the work that gets done in like, you know, anywhere that'  s city property along the mission ranch area?  Yeah.  Because like I know when things get pruned in front of mine, it is not at my expense because it'  s in the city strip.  It'  s the city trees.  So I just kind of was curious about that part as well if it was because it'  s like an off cycle type of request.  Yeah.  We do prune trees that are on a cycle.  The peculiar thing about this tree is that it really well, to back up a little bit, we have a lot of !  So one of the factors that we factor in when deciding to prune a tree is something called occupancy rate.  Okay.  And the occupancy rate is how often are people under the tree?  So if a branch fell, what are the chances that it could hit someone?  So most trees that are growing in the street, you know, in the public right of way, pretty much automatically are classed as having a high occupancy rate.  This tree, because of its precarious, it'  s on the curve as Mr.  Duggins said.  It really doesn'  t overhang the bike path.  It really is in the back 40.  Very few people are ever going to be under that tree.  Mr.  Duggins mentioned the unhoused folks that are back there.  They may or may not be under that tree.  But that'  s something that, you know, the city can'  t really factor in.  It'  s almost impossible to factor in.  s almost impossible to try and factor that type of occupancy rate.  You know, we could look at pruning that tree.  But we do have a long line of pruning requests.  And the trees that really need to be pruned for the safety of citizens, they come first.  And this tree, in all honesty, would probably never make the list.  It would be on the list, but probably never make it to a work order.  So I think it'  be pruned.  You know, the applicant has already requested to pay for a permit to remove the tree.  What the city has come back with, what staff has come back with is to, you know, use those dollars to prune the tree, which is obviously a reduced cost.  Probably for the same price of removing a tree, you could prune it three or four times.  And each pruning is usually good for three to five years, you know, depending on the cost.  depending on what work is done.  So there is that dynamic to consider.  You know, even though, you know, this tree is in the back 40,  you know, because it is a native tree,  you know, we do try and preserve them as much as we can.  Had it have been an invasive tree,  you know, we would have removed the tree,  probably without even having to ask, you know.  But with it being a native tree,  you know, it does afford that extra attention  that staff look to preserve the native tree canopy.  Thank you. Appreciate it, Richie.  Commissioner Glatz.  Hey, Richie.  I just had a question regarding this cost issues,  and maybe you can answer this or not.  The city is not necessarily responsible for  if a limb falls on your car in the street,  you call your car insurance.  You don't call the city.  Is that accurate?  I mean...  What is the city liable for as far as  city tree damage to property?  Right.  So if the city's found, you know,  I'm not an attorney,  but I would imagine the attorney would try and answer that question  to do with, you know, if the city's found to be negligent.  Now, one thing to bear in mind is that with trees being,  you know, a biological entity,  we can prune a tree and it can still,  limbs can still fail.  Limbs fall, for example, during the summer,  with that phenomenon called summer limb drop.  We can't control that.  You know, that's very much guided by the weather conditions.  The city isn't at fault if, for example,  we get a series of temperatures where it's 100 degrees  for six or seven days in a row.  We know we're probably going to get lots of limb drop  because of that,  but we can't control that.  the property owner is not  We have to control that.  To my mind I' m not aware that  we' ve ever paid out a claim in  those circumstances where there  has been property damage.  It' s not something we could  have or should have been able  to prevent.  correct.  like some of the trees fell on  the people' s fences on south  park a year ago the homeowner  was responsible for fixing the  fence.  thank you.  I do have a couple of  questions and observations too.  First you did point out and I' m  glad you did the fence to me in  these pictures your fence looks  very dilapidated and rotting.  These boards the fence slats are  rotting at the top.  It does look like especially if  you have issues with unhoused  areas.  There' s some of the  the fence needs to be replaced  or repaired.  the city has given you quite a  few attractive options to use the  tree as a fence slat to build the  fence.  richie our tree expert here  essentially said you can use the  tree as part of the fence which  seems like a really good option.  this tree was planted or not  that has no relevance what so  ever as far as I can tell in  the city code. Also this tree  may not be benefiting you but it  is part of the city'  s urban canopy  it'  s essentially all of our  tree and the city I'  m reading from  their website right now has  has a tree that has a tree that  has approximately 25,000 street  trees so you can see why cases  like this are important because  they set a precedent so if  everyone came and said this tree  the roots are kicking up making  my driveway the concrete in my  driveway they'  re disturbing it.  This tree has limbs that are  falling it'  s making a  mess on my car etc.  sure we have approximately 25,000  of these trees that we can'  allow every homeowner and I'  m not saying this is a  whim because I understand your  concerns but we can'  t just remove  every tree that a homeowner wants  to remove it'  s just not feasible and it'  s not the right precedent.  And the city can'  t afford to  prune 25,000 trees you know that  you live here it'  s a small city with a small budget.  So you can'  see why as far as priority goes this would be low on the totem pole as opposed to the trees the huge trees that are hundreds of years old we have to worry about them falling on a child in midwell park.  So that'  s where the priority lies I think if I understand Richie correctly and the process correctly. Also if you just want to distill this down it'  s pretty simple this tree to me does not  meet the municipal code of  criteria for removal period it'  s not dead it'  s not dying it'  s not diseased it'  s not dangerous.  I think those are my comments.  Does anybody else have a question or comment for Richie or for Mr. Duggins?  I think if no that motion would be appropriate at this time if there is one.  sorry I'  m sure this is getting denied.  you don'  t know that yet.  I know I don'  e but I'  m pretty sure I understand all your points I do I truly do.  So moving forward if this does get denied I should say.  I'  Do I work with Mr. Richie to come up with some plans on how they want me to incorporate it?  Do they have somebody that they give me plans on how to build a fence?  Or going around it or whatever needs to happen?  I believe if we vote to deny your appeal that you could take it in front of council.  Right.  That'  s an option.  Or you could work with Richie which seems like it would be the best option.  But if you would let us please.  I would like to make a motion if there is one.  But I think those are your options.  If we would deny your appeal you could take it in front of council.  We appreciate you being here.  And understand your concerns most definitely.  Do you want to go ahead and take a seat?  I think.  Thank you.  Well thank you very much.  Well thank you very much.  Well thank you very much.  Well thank you very much.  Well thank you very much.  Well thank you very much.  Well thank you very much.  Well thank you very much. t know if anybody else had any more thoughts.  to deny the appeal. I asked any thoughts, concerns? I will make a motion to deny the appeal I guess is what we'  doing. Having said that I would  speak with Richie, he's a good guy, and see if there's some ideas he can come up with to give you.  Because there's many, if you go through the park, there's many  fences that go around trees throughout Chico. And it seems  to be the obvious kind of way to do it. And since the tree's 40 to 50 years old,  there's no reason to take it out. So, anyways, so motion to deny the bill.  I'll second.  Commissioner Blashley?  I vote to deny.  Commissioner Glatz? Yes.  Commissioner Nava? Yes.  Commissioner Shearer? Yes.  And Chair Thomas-Petty? Yes.  And Mr. Duggins, thank you again for coming and speaking with us, and hopefully  you can work with Mr. Bamlett and  Mr. Blashley.  And we can come up with a plan for you.  Thank you.  Okay.  We are now at item  six on the regular agenda.  6.1, consideration of a request from the Chico Community Observatory  Incorporated.  To add an addendum to  add addendum  and the community and the  and the community and the  community and the community  and the community and card to  transfer the existing lease at  the observatory and for those  who may not be aware the  observatory has been there since  2010 I believe it was and it'  s in lot c on the west side of  horseshoe lake and for many  years it offered a lot of  programs and ability and  availability their lease says  that they had to provide for  evenings per week and a minimum  of 12 hours I think they did  more than that when they had a  lot of donors and had also  volunteers and staff and it has  changed hands a couple times it  was the kawanas originally who  built it and right now it'  s now under the chico  observatory excuse me chico  community observatory so I  believe the observatory had  approached card and asked them  if they would be interested in  and they did the lease similar to  what they do at the nature center  in bibble park it would still be  our property it would be leased  by card and from there card did  agree I think they went to their  board and anna bell grim is here  from the card the general manager  and also dan puser is the  director from the observatory as  well but the card would like to  actually reduce the operations to  like three evenings and nine hours  because the lease is not  reasonable given the amount of  volunteers that have to do the  work I think that'  s a reasonable  change if this was to move  forward so again they are asking  that the lease was supposed to  expire in November 2025 but I  think it'  s a good time to do a new  release other than transferring  the lease if it'  s approved by the commission we  I think anna bell and mr.  Puser and I think mr.  Puser would like to speak on this  item.  thank you for entertaining our  request we'  re very excited to be here  this is dan and evie and they are  part of the board of directors of  the nonprofit we'  re very excited to partner  card is really trying to partner in  a better way with different  organizations and why this partnership would be  so valuable and I think it'  s a great time to talk about also to build a programming model that is thoughtful and sustainable and really maximizes the resource. The observatory  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  is  an now I had never been out there before I met evie and dan and it' s an immaculate facility because of their hard work and  the director of the chico community observatory slight correction i think it's been around since  2004 roughly it was built in partnership with kwanas and several others but under a non-profit  organization as i understand it under chris koenig when chris left it was turned over to  the now former director but none of us were business people we don't know really how to  run a business except for abby she knows how to run a business but the rest of us and that's why  she's our treasure but the rest of us aren't business people so last year about this time  there was some severe storm damage i went in there and about the same time our now former  director resigned so we started digging into what was going on about found out nobody had filed any  of the legal paperwork for years the state had you know suspended our non-profit our  our  you  business status our non-profit status we could no longer get liability insurance we are no  longer a corporation legally so we had to shut down for liability reasons besides the fact that  the facility was damaged which another does and i fixed that but it remained though that we were  not willing as board members to be under the liability of something happening without any  liability insurance and we started the process of redoing our paperwork again the state said you know  we are in  we are in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  the city of california and  facilities are running properly  and the areas handle the  weeding and all that kind of  stuff and we handle doing what  we love to do which is present  the night sky. We think it'  s a great option if this  does get denied then we'  ll go  back to our old way and continue  to operate the observatory. It'  interesting though hearing some  people we had no idea there was  a lease or it was coming due or  there was a requirement to be  open certain nights a week. Since  covid we had to reduce down to  one night a week when we were  opening simply because we lost  so many people after covid and  so many people didn'  t come back so we need  to work on a docent education  program which we talked with  card about the whole classes at  a card facility to train people  and the docent education program  the docent out there at the  observatory.  thank you for letting us speak  with you this evening I'  m evie  feldman the treasurer of chico  community observatory and I don'  t know if you can tell but for  us it has been a deep and  abiding labor of love and  everyone who comes out to the  observatory tells us how much  they love it and how much they  are amazed that a city the size  I don'  t know if you'  re familiar  with the facility at all but we  have two permanently mounted 14  inch telescopes out there one of  them is connected to a computer  and the other one you can have  straight through viewing we have  a cement pad out there as well  and we have telescopes in the  observatory that we bring out and  we put them on the cement pad and  there are dozens to help people  view the night sky and we have  an outdoor we call it an outdoor  planetarium and it'  s actually many other small  observatories have taken that  pattern and used it I think our  nearest other one is placerville  because it'  s fantastic so we have people go  and it'  s basically you sit in this big  cement bowl and then astronomers  come out and they do a constellation  tour and talk to you about where the  stars are and what they see and  stories about them or other  astronomical events that they  share information about so we'  re a fantastic facility and it'  s really run with love and if  someone would be willing to take  the part that we don'  t enjoy doing and do that part we  can have all the more energy  available to do the things we  really do love and that'  s really what we'  re asking for thank you  thank you speakers and do we have  any questions or comments for  annabelle dan or evie?  commissioner gadds okay I do  have a question for you all okay  not really a question but I think  this is really exciting too and  I'  ve done a little research in  this because I was interested  in ways to preserve our night  sky here and that'  becoming an issue with  expansion and so hopefully card  can help advocate in that regard  but we have 45 observatories in  california and our huge great  state of california we'  lucky enough to have one here.  I think this is really exciting  and I think it'  s going to be a great  partnership and card has such  great programs I can see camps  there and events and someone  with the resources that card has  can pull off in conjunction with  your knowledge and passion.  What a great idea I don'  t know who thought of it but  thank you.  Okay.  I think we have a couple of  questions.  just for my general knowledge  is the observatory ready to open  to the general public right now  or does it need some facility?  it needs cleaning and needs  the area around the planetarium  around the pad needs to be  weeded.  and we need to do a cleaning on  the inside but generally it'  s great.  we'  tidying up and tidying up in  and then card would take  over the maintenance of the  building?  yes.  thank you.  of course this is a  wonderful thing so don'  t take  this question in any other way.  nature center are you guys happy  with how the nature center is  going that'  s both for you and  linda is everything going  pretty well with this management  in the  nature  center  it'  going  great  right  Okay, good. Yeah, we recently acquired more animals. We had a  Snake day this past weekend and we were absolutely at capacity. We are growing those programs  We're expanding the programs where um, you know updating the facility  We did an ADA walking path for the kids for summer camps and other programs. It is really thriving  We've applied for another furry critter permit  you know our our bunnies of you know, ten years or whatever passed away last year and so we've been  Refurbishing the cages to be able to host some more furry friends and the reptile ones too  I guess some folks like those we had a lot of kids out there this past weekend. It was really amazing  So it's really incredible what not only the passionate volunteers there have been able to do but the program  Programming we have been able to expand  To include low cost or no cost  programs  We recently applied for a get outdoors Chapman grant that will incorporate that facility and provide  Multigenerational programs for free for kids that otherwise may not have access to those programs  So I got you I got chills where we're super excited about all of the things that are happening there and we see that  mirroring  With the observatory, that's where I was going. So now you're setting the bar. She's got to keep  Keep keep keep raising the bar, but thank you for both  For all you guys doing this is great  Any other questions or concerns comments  I  Did have one more thing and this is not a negative at all  But my one concern is that the lease is quite long, but that's  Within the purview of the City Council and not us as I understand it. Yes, they do they do  I think that one's  You know 15 almost 15 years old so I do we do have more newer  Copies and exhibits that we can use it might be a little not as long  So yeah, I just mean the term of the lease the only five years. Hopefully there's  They'll build in review period  Yeah  You typically it's if the way the leases are going and the council's approving our five years initial term and then to five year extensions  Right. So that's the opportunity to review it after that fight every five years  Those five years like the rod and gun club there's was correct. It's very similar  That's that's the model that is being used by the council now for all their leases is the 15 years. We used to have  Leases to perpetuity so but that was changed not to you know with the last city manager in the last previous administration  So it is now a 15 year and then go look at it again in 15 years for sure  Okay, so I think a motion is probably  appropriate if there's one I have a comment slash motion then and I just want to say  Miss general manager Annabelle grim is all over the place. I think it's amazing. I  Love the energy I see coming from card  I'm a card kid myself and my kids were and I'm sure pretty much a lot of people in the room were and I'm missing pickleball  tonight, okay, my beginner league because  Anyways, you're here. Yeah. Yeah, so I just want to thank you for that because I know it's a lot to juggle  but  Like has been pointed out  I think the energy is great and as long as people stay as committed and energetic as you are  I think it'll be fantastic. So thank you and thank you to Dan and Evie for the services you provide  I think that's wonderful as well  So my motion would be to allow for transfer of the lease of the upper part Bidwell Park Observatory to the Chico  area recreation and Park District  aka card I'll second that  Commissioner  Commissioner Blashley  Approve yes  Commissioner Glatz. Yes  Commissioner Scheer. Yes  Vice chair Nova. Yes and chair Thomas Petty. Yes  We are now to item 6.2  Consideration of a request from the Chico area  recreation and Park District card to install a small storage container at Sycamore Field and lower Bidwell Park  Linda Herman. Yes  So before you is a request from card as you know as you know, this is one of those perpetuity leases actually  It's I think it's in perpetuity until either party  Either party decides they don't want to do it anymore  so  so what they would like to propose is to install a storage container and  There's pictures in your packet of what they're considering  It would be you know color-coded to match the natural surroundings. That's available and it's primarily there to  Store the equipment that they need to maintain the fields right now  All that equipment I believe is at Hooker Oak Park and they're having to trailer it and bring it over to  Sycamore Field so this would allow them to I think maybe purchase an additional one and then leave it there at the Sycamore Field  Location so they wouldn't have to do that transferring back and forth  And just the wear and tear on their equipment as well  And it also is available there for the softball league to be able to put their maintenance  Responsibility tools and what they are responsible for maintaining in that shed as well  It would be secured with a sturdy lock ones that they've had success for in other areas of the parks  And so and here again is Annabelle if you have any further questions on  this request  Does anyone have questions or comments? Yeah, I had a question in the picture  It looks like the container would go right on that fence on the split rail fence. Is that right?  There is a like a pink outline so it's right in line with that. It's either before after that fence line  Okay, it looks like there's a blue outline and the one that we have and it looks like it straddles it  So I was just wondering what would happen  I  Don't believe the fence is going to straddle it's going to be on the outside  Okay  Yeah  It would be on the outside with the fence because they need the fence also to make sure no one runs into the storage container  as well  The other thought I had was I liked that you said that it would be painted a natural color  That is a container is an eyesore and that is a you know, obviously a beautiful area and a lovely ball field  So I would just say it would be great if it were painted with a mural  I don't know if there's like a way firm  You know a youth project are members of the community to do that, but it'd be really nice to have that  That's a great idea. We would absolutely look into that  Commission are glass  So I'm gonna take a different point of view  I actually don't think we need another eyesore in the park, any kind of a metal container doing that.  At one point, I thought you guys were talking about building.  This is for the bathrooms.  This is going back a while.  But if something, this is not saying this is the idea, but if something could be built, a shed could be built that looks like it's been there for 25 or 30 years.  It looks like it's part of the natural environment.  That is more aesthetically pleasing, I think, to me than to have a container, even if it's painted green or a mural, which could get graffiti'd.  You just don't know what's going to happen to that thing, and it's going to sit in one of the most traveled parts of the park.  So I'm kind of not digging the idea of a container, a metal container.  I'm not opposed to an idea of some kind of storage facility, but just something more creative for the environment that it's in.  Thank you.  Your point's well taken, Commissioner.  We considered that.  I hate those metal containers as well.  But the fact of the matter is that we can't secure them in a way that is securable because they, I'll give you an example.  Our field house over this past summer, we had a break-in, and the folks that broke in took the time to pry out the window frame.  Not even the window, but sat there and took apart the window frame and put it gently on the ground so it didn't break the glass,  and then went into this building that's alarmed and locked.  And that's a metal door.  And so we're finding that we're successful with these containers.  We have one that is out at our new bocce facility that we've been really successful in keeping folks out.  It doesn't look as bad as you think.  It's a little bit of a mess.  Once we camouflage it, it is not ideal.  But I think anything other than even maybe a brick structure or something that's more permanent would accomplish what we're trying to accomplish.  So we're open to suggestions, though, for sure.  Thank you.  Vice Chair Nava.  I guess my question would be, was any consideration given?  And I get there's an interesting dynamic with CARD having the Sycamore Field, and then the other is not CARD, per se.  So, I mean, my question is, is there a thought to having a cooperative where something like that could more abut the existing restroom building?  You know, that's not always the most pleasant-looking thing either.  But I understand what I'm hearing out here, too.  Because it is such a nice spot.  And, like, honestly, a lot of people sit along the path that's near Cape Raycrest and look in that direction because it's just so pretty.  And it's nice to see people having a great time out there.  So I'm kind of more a fan also of having it maybe abut that building already because a structure already exists and would help kind of modify its impact.  Are you asking that of staff?  Yeah.  Is that something?  The only thing that I could add.  The only thing I could add is they have to unload.  It's a riding lawnmower, correct?  So it would have to have a place that it can unload and be out.  But we can certainly look at other options and look at different if there's a better place for it if you would like.  And we could bring that back again if you would like if we did find some other options.  Yeah.  One of the things that we were thoughtful about is not creating an unnatural path of travel with our equipment.  We don't want to infringe on other areas.  We thought.  We thought about the parking lot maybe like tucked away.  But then it would impact parking.  Again we're open to any of these ideas.  We're just trying to be more efficient and maximize our resources.  Right now I have crews loading, bringing it over, unloading, loading, taking it back.  And so it will be a cost savings for us and a better way for us to maintain that area.  So again we have we're open to all suggestions.  We're just hoping you're open to the ideas.  We're open to the idea of allowing some storage there for us.  I have a question.  Does card have two mowers then?  I mean two sets of equipment?  It'  s my understanding you would still have to move it if you don'  t.  You want to keep one set of mowing or mower there and keep one over wildwood?  Right.  We have several assets that we maximize different times of the year.  But we are field prep there.  Really it would be most cost effective to buy another machine and leave it there.  So card doesn' t currently have one?  We have several that we have now that we' ve acquired.  And we may need another one depending on how quickly we' re bringing on other parts.  So our equipment right now isn' t sitting idle.  We have many crews using different pieces of equipment at different times.  But like I said we did the cost benefit analysis on buying some of this equipment and leaving it there and it'  s actually more cost effective.  okay.  My worry is that this is really kind of I'  m going to bring out some legalese for you here because I'  m an attorney.  It'  s an attractive nuisance to me.  I'  m afraid children would try to climb on it.  I'  m definitely in the current state it would get tagged with graffiti.  I'  m afraid it'  m afraid people will try to break in there and maybe live in there.  I can'  t think of anything else like this in lower park.  And lower park is pristine and natural.  You can'  t really compare it to the bocce court because that'  s not even in the same ballpark as what we'  re talking about here.  And how long has card managed sycamore field?  Does anyone know?  And you'  ve done without a shed for the equipment?  resident of the park for a moment.  for how long?  since 1962.  since 1962?  I understand ease of access and that sort of thing but I think there would be a lot of  blowback if this thing went up in lower park.  I really do and I really don'  t think of this.  I don'  t at all.  I'  m sorry to say that.  I'  sorry to say that.  I'  I think those are all the questions or comments that I had.  Does anybody else have a question or comment?  just one more thing.  I would think that perhaps when you mentioned the bathrooms there'  e the whole back side of the bathrooms but you'  d have to see if your guys it'  s still closer than driving.  But they would have to ride the mower down a little bit but the field is pretty close but maybe there'  e something that could be done closer to those bathrooms because they'  re not the most attractive thing either.  And there'  s the whole back side where people live now anyways.  That could always be used.  So I'  m just saying the idea shouldn'  d be dead but not crazy for the field.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah fair enough.  I think we could go back and work with Linda and team and see what'  s feasible with that building.  Absolutely.  Any other comments, questions?  So I guess would I just say that I think it'  s a great idea to have you come back and work with the staff and bring us your next best recommendation.  Do we first have to just deny this one and then make that as a?  I'  m wondering.  I don'  t know.  I think so.  Okay.  Or just attach that to deny.  Okay.  So my motion would be to deny it in its current form and ask that staff and Ms.  Grimm please go back to the drawing board with an alternative location please and still  trying to work to make it as aesthetically pleasing as possible.  I can second that.  I would second or I would like to have an amendment to that.  Not only a different location but a different style of storage container.  Would that be?  Yes.  A friendly amendment?  I would like the aesthetic part.  Okay.  Okay.  I can accept the friendly amendment.  Okay.  Yes please.  Okay.  She'  s restating her motion.  Okay.  Restating.  I would like to deny the motion in its current form and ask that staff and Ms.  Grimm come back with an alternate location and potentially a different type of storage  unit that would be more aesthetically pleasing.  I'  m going to second that one as well.  Commissioner Blashly?  I'  m a little confused here because  So when you have first and second you'  re supposed to vote on the first and second.  Yeah.  But we didn'  t do that so we just started over again.  Okay.  Well she restated her motion.  Okay.  We'  Okay.  We want to separate them completely.  So what happens, Commissioner Blashly, is that there was a motion and it was asked if  they could be amended and since Commissioner Nava approved that then that just pretty much  replaces that original motion into the motion that she stated which included adding looking  at a different storage container in addition to a different location possibly.  So they'  re denying it.  But at the current location asking us to come back with a different option and also a different  option of what type of storage container it might be.  Okay.  Yes.  Perfect.  Commissioner Glatz?  Yes.  Commissioner Shearer?  Yes.  Vice Chair Nava?  Yes.  Chair Thomas-Petty?  Yes.  Thank you.  And thank you, Annabelle, again.  We'  re now at item 6.3.  I'  m going to give a little update regarding providing lifeguards and concessions at the  Sycamore Pool in the One Mile Recreation Area.  BPPC will receive an update from Staffan and CARD on their efforts to provide lifeguards  and other services at Sycamore Pool this season.  The Commission will also consider a pilot program to provide concessionaires as well.  Linda and?  Annabelle?  Annabelle.  Annabelle.  s the Linda and Annabelle Show tonight.  So, yeah, I'  ll just do a quick recap.  ll just do a brief introduction.  As you'  re aware, that CARD has been helping us out in providing lifeguards since 2015, I think  it was, I believe.  And so over the past couple years, due to COVID and some of the other factors, we have  not been able, actually the last year, have not been able to provide the lifeguard services  that we had had in the past when even during COVID it was a modified schedule.  We are experiencing, which we did too when we were doing the lifeguards, difficulty in  recruiting lifeguards.  And now I think nationwide there' s a problem with recruiting lifeguards as well.  So CARD went back and kind of rethought of what they need to do to improve that situation  and has come forward with a proposal.  They' ve increased the pay.  They have allowed incentives as well as holiday pay.  And they are looking at all kinds of other ways to somehow fill these positions.  It also puts them in a position that now hopefully, yay, that they' re going to have their  aquatic center.  Part of the difficulty I' m hearing from CARD is that these are seasonal jobs.  They' re part-time jobs.  They' ve had to primarily just depend on high schoolers.  And before we used to be able to do the CARD to college age.  But when the Wildcat Center, I think that affected that as well.  So there' s been a lot of factors that have built up over the years that has changed the  landscape so to speak of lifeguards.  And it' s not the most desirable job I guess as it used to be.  And they' re also paying for all the services.  They' re paying for the certifications because before they would have to pay for that themselves.  So that' s a big incentive as well.  So they' ve been, I think you started in January recruiting, I believe?  In December actually.  Oh, December.  So they' ve been recruiting, which they did last year too.  They did, I think I sent an email to the commission with all the, you know, things that they tried.  So this time we' re just proposing that we continue that.  And hopefully this is just an update on the lifeguard component.  And as you' re aware, we don' t have a concessionaire as well.  COVID and all the same sort of factors affected that concessionaire as well.  And so we were thinking about, and CART has this model, they have a row, we talked about,  they do a roving food cart, I guess, food truck, excuse me, program.  So basically they invite vendors to come and be on their list and then they just look at  schedules and they decide who' s going to be where and when.  And it rotates around on their different facilities.  And so the thought they' ve offered to take, offer this as a possibility.  They' ve had a pilot program for us to see how it works at sycamore pool.  They would just rotate the pool into their regular rotation right now.  They only require a $50 application fee.  And that' s primarily to make sure that they' re serious, I think.  And then they don' t take any of the profits.  The concessionaire will keep their profits because that' s also, I think, a concern we  had is we required that they paid us a percentage of their money before.  And with times being they are.  I think that' s another big reason why we don' t see that.  And then we have to see the concessions.  And it' s limited in what there' s no stoves, there' s no equipment.  It was primarily microwaves and different types of food that don' t always fit every  concessionaire, which is kind of like the food truck.  It' s a more limited self-contained area.  So the idea is that they would just rotate.  They would offer different varieties than just one concession and have, we think, just  try it as a pilot program and then see how it works this year.  And then we can go from there if you want, if the commission wants to do something different  after this year.  And again, we just want to bring that positive family-friendly environment back to the pool  and get it to where it was in past years.  Sorry, they also plan to do some themed nights or, excuse me, themed days, kind of like they  did with the ice rink.  And I think that' ll be a good addition, too, to bring kids and families down.  Thank you.  ANA BELAZINGA- Annabelle, did you have anything to add?  ANA BELAZINGA- A little bit, if I may take a couple of minutes.  So with the lifeguard recruiting, what we did is, one, we increased the pay.  So right now, a lifeguard that is new that we pay for the certification and all the training  we would start them at $19 an hour where we were starting them at $16.50 before.  So that' s quite a significant jump.  And then that brings up the pay-for-sales.  We have a pay rate of everybody  else so our head guard or  assistant head guard and some of  the other folks so there'  s a  pay incentive there. There'  s also a sign on bonus so if  they'  ve not been a life guard with  us in the past two seasons then  they'  re eligible for a $500 bonus  so they get $250 when they pass  their certification and then $250  they have incentive for them to  stay. We also have a referral  program so employees and other  affiliate people that refer  someone and they successfully  complete their certification and  successfully stay through the  season they'  re offering $250 for each of  those. That'  s exciting and we'  re seeing a lot of  excitement. We'  re seeing a lot of our ice  athletes that are here with us  re around with us which is  cool. They'  re super excited about the  aquatics facility we'  re instituting a new way to  rotate them through our pleasant  valley pool facility and the  sycamore pool so that way we'  re getting varied experience and  varied levels of oversight. Like  Linda mentioned we'  re looking to do themed things  and different events, special  events also to draw families in  and really create a really fun  atmosphere for them to come and  about doing all sorts of themed  things that all my people that  are amazing and think of all that  stuff are putting together as we  speak. The idea is to invite  families to come back out here.  For sure we'  re going to have one night a  week that'  s family night. We'  ll bring out our yard games and  music and create a fun atmosphere  for them to come and enjoy the  live guarding from noon to 7  p.m. is when that window would be  and then not every other Thursday  for cleaning.  I know commissioner  glatz has a question or comment.  you guys are doing wonderful  things. I want to ask you to  help for something. We also a  long time ago wanted to bring in  coffee trucks to the park.  Perhaps when you'  re thinking about the food  truck in pictures in pictures  pictures pictures pictures  pictures pictures pictures  pictures pictures pictures  pictures pictures  pictures pictures  pictures pictures  pictures  pictures  pictures  pictures  pictures  pictures  the !  I can actually I have already  talked to him about the coffee  cart because I knew that was on  the list and they do have the  vendors already on their coffee  cart list also. We are thinking  of having it right next to the  actual concession building for  several reasons and then we can  drive in there and also have the  ramp but it'  s also I want to have  electricity installed if we can  the 50 amp so we don'  t have a generator running all day which is a noise  concern I' m sure for park users as well as  neighbors.  So I  think it would work and that'  s where they' re used to going it'  s by the restrooms there and stuff. I think we talked  about before we had come to the commission  some of you are new but knocking  down those walls and those changing areas  and making it more of a seating area and  maybe in the future it could be where we can bring in  some collapsible tables and chairs  that can be put away every night and  have an area that can because there'  s really no place to sit down and eat  other than one bench I think on that side  of the pool. So just some  ideas of what we would like to do and  I think it' s just makes sense and then it  doesn' t take up any parking because as you know the  north side parking lot is very popular and  fills up on its own so we don' t really  want to take up that space if we don' t have to.  I like that and a lot  of these food trucks bring their own tables anyways  too and they set up little cafe things  and stuff like that for people to sit at.  Maura is in North Myers  North Myers  North Myers  North Myers  North Myers  North Myers s an entire condo complex within 50 yards or 100 yards of  North Myers  North Myers  North Myers  North Myers within 50 yards or 100 yards of one mile so noise still needs to be. Absolutely that' s something we run into a lot  lot we are doing pop-up events now in our neighborhood parks so like series and oakway  where we we bought this gigantic movie screen and we want to just host little events for the  neighborhood to go and do neighborhood things and so we're really cognizant of the noise level  and then which way it's oriented to try to minimize some of that and then of course um you  know we we plan to end early to make sure that we're not infringing on their quality of life  but thank you again for everything you guys are doing by the way thank you okay that's it  yeah i'm just wondering how these agreements work so does the city reimburse card for all the  lifeguard staff so yes yeah we pay for the lifeguards yes and it's through our um we have  a memorandum of understanding to do cooperative program citywide citywide not just this neighborhood  parks you know any of that so we we have it in our budget and if you look on our budget  which i will probably bring next time or the time after um there's a specific line that says card  expenses and that's what that is for is for the lifeguards and it straddles two fiscal years  because they don't come on until june and then they come back in the so it kind of it's still  the annual but it just the way the funding comes it kind of straddles two different fiscal years  but but yeah they are there is there will be an increase and i think i've put that in the staff  report change times have changed costs have changed and and so yeah there will be a  change in the budget and we will see if we can get an increase in that budget and we did  request it in our budget request whether it gets approved or not we will see on that.  great i just want to thank you for your work to sycamore pool is one of my favorite places in  chico and i love the multi-generational aspect of people who are using the pool you can hear  half a dozen languages and there are very few places in chico where that'  s the case so i just really appreciate all the family oriented work that you'  re doing thanks.  thank you.  thank you.  i was just wondering how you plan to promote the mobile food truck pilot program so it'  s inclusive and those who want to kick in the 50 to apply can do so?  thank you that'  s a great question we currently have 13 or 14 approved vendors in our vendor list already so of course we would start with them.  we don'  t want the $50 to be a barrier to them coming to us and working with us and trying this out so we would ask for a  little bit of  But they're not licensed to be there. So it's a way to control it and then those those  permits get issued  To armed guard and so they know who's allowed to be there  And so they're just managing that for us and our vendors have reported back that they really appreciate that  So it's not a conversation  They have to have with another food vendor that rolls up into the space and now is creating issues  so a  Long way to say we'd be open to waiving that fee for like for our first-time triers  To make sure it's worth their wild and their and their wanting to continue that service  And I will tell you Commissioner Glatz. We've got already three coffee vendors that are chomping at the fit to be out  more areas  So as to the part about how you would market then I understand that you already have some that are approved and like as we've been  Vetted but are you planning on pushing it out publicly to say?  Well, yeah, we are in an in an in an in an in an in an in an in an in an in an in an in an in an in an  the food truck event?  we were working with the fork  in the road people so we were  using their network but I think  a program like this is exciting  so we would probably press  release it and put it on social  media we want to make sure we  get the excitement before we do  any of that I want to make sure  we'  ve got everybody'  s permission.  thank you I appreciate your  answer and I love the idea of  the theme stuff again I'  ve missed a lot of that  happening I think you'  ve got good ideas to  bring some good things back.  I was going to say we would  likely do a press release anyway  so we would announce the life  guards and also announce it  there we also talked about  posting the schedule of who'  s going to be where and what  days so the public can decide if  they want to come down on a taco  day or another day and we will  also have that on our website as  well so that will get the word  out I'  m sure we would have  vendors contacting us we already  do and we will have that on our  once they know that'  s a program  that we'  re offering I think we'  ll get some interest into it.  I had a brainstorm when you  talked about high school students  and college students as the  majority of maybe our applicant  pool and so I did a quick google  I was thinking maybe you could  work with the university or the  high schools and at least one  university temple university  offers college credit to life  guards who work at city pools  so maybe just another extra  impetus to maybe talk to chico  state or talk to the high schools  in town and see if the high  schools would give a pe credit  or something at least one  university and that was my quick  google but I thought what a great  idea.  great idea.  keep it coming she knows I need  a piper.  great awesome thank you.  Any other commissioners thoughts  questions?  and so this is not an action  item or no just informational  okay thank you.  I would just say it'  s a consensus  item.  recommendations that we move  forward with the lifeguards as  proposed and also that we try to  pilot program with the I think  that'  s fine.  it was more informational.  sounds great thank you.  next item 6.4 consideration of  proposed changes to the park  reservation fees for smaller  reservations the bppc will  consider staff'  s proposal to increase the park  reservation fees by 5 to $10 to  reserve park facilities except  caper acres and bidwell park and  other city parks for reservations  that have 150 or less participants  the fees for larger events are  not being considered at this time.  linda hermann.  yes I think the annotation  pretty much sums it up.  we are moving towards an online  reservation system and it'  s one that'  s being used by some locals  even paradise is using it.  we think it'  s a pretty user friendly program  it'  s something we'  ve been on our both shanes and  I do this for too many years.  we'  re really excited about that  and Kathleen has been helping us  get that already and putting in  all the existing reservations etc.  that gives us an opportunity to  look at our fees where fees have  not been increased we did a pretty  increased I think it was about  four years ago three years ago  and we are still in that  we have a lot of fees and the  fee schedules themselves actually  get increased every year by the  cpi increase.  on our books with the council we  have a certain amount that we max  that we can do so we don'  t really have to go to council  we'  re still within that level that  council has approved for us to  approve.  we think the $5 and $10 increase  information out there.  we have a lot of regulations that  you don'  t have a lot of events it'  s not an event at the larger  events it'  s like reserving a campsite or  something you do online you pay  you'  re done you'  re over with it and we get the  notification it gets put on the  calendar the calendar is going to be  visible that'  s something we do not have now  you have to call to find out the  availability of the facilities we are  going to be using the software  better so there are going to be  four blocks now and they'  re 8 to 12, 1230 to 430,  5 to 9 I guess that'  s just three.  three sorry.  and then the full day depending  on how they do it.  I'  m just asking if the commission  will approve our fee increase we'  ll go ahead and get ready and try  to have this online and up and  running by may 1.  any questions for linda?  no?  no?  I just make a motion to approve  the fee increase.  second.  commissioner blashly?  yes.  commissioner glatz?  yes.  thank you.  re at item 7.  reports and communications items  provided for the commission'  s information only.  no action can be taken on any of  the items unless the commission  agrees to include it on a  subsequent posted agenda.  7.1 parks division report.  linda hermann.  thank you.  again this is our monthly division  report and it'  s there for your information  but I'  d be happy to answer any  questions if you have any  questions.  I do have a question.  the fence around the perimeter  of caper acres seems temporary  to me.  is it temporary?  is there a plan to replace it  with something else?  yes it is temporary and funny  you say that shane has been  working on trying to get bids to  build a fence around the perimeter  of caper acres and he actually  reached out to the chico state  construction management like we  did with the swings.  they did the concrete work that  was done at the swings.  the idea is to do it used to  have a concrete border around  it and it'  s all buried now so we would  do a similar concrete border  and mount the rod iron fence on  top of it.  we'  re looking at trying to do  that and that'  s in the master plan.  it is a temporary fence now but  hopefully it won'  t be for long.  that sounds great.  I recently toured the welding  program at butte college and they  have excellent facilities there  including powder coating and things  like that that a different program  does but that could be a good option  too.  i intend to reach out to them.  thank you.  just one question and maybe  it'  s already happening and i just  get the parking fees?  we'  re still working on that.  we need to pay the law a to put  the kiosks in and we got it  ready for last year and then  we ran out of weather to do  that.  we'  re just trying to get all the  parking lots and then we have  the upper park road resurfacing  happening also in the summer so  that'  s all going to hopefully be  together and we'  ll try to get it in.  s still high on our list to get  in still.  we have the kiosks it'  s just a matter of finding  where and getting everybody into  the system.  i just thought of it again when  i had to pay $5 an hour to park  at the beach in florida and people  were complaining about a dollar a  day here or something like that.  it just happens.  thank you.  commissioner blatchley.  i see this lindow channel  is a good example of that.  the contractor went in and  cleared the dead trees and was  that part of it?  yes.  from manzanita to 99.  i want to compliment you.  it looks really nice.  thank you.  the contractor did a good job.  it was terra fuego a non-profit  and they teamed up with the  ecological reserve.  they made a good team and the  ecological reserve went ahead of  them and they did it pretty quickly.  i was happy with the work they did.  maybe we can get some oak trees  planted in that one area that'  s all cleared out.  or maybe naturally they'  ll fall and grow on their own.  looks nice.  vice chair nava.  do you have something?  i want to say thank you linda  for working in all the answers to  my questions and to the report.  i appreciated that.  thanks for asking.  i do have one question linda.  i feel like we'  re back to square one on the  lower park road improvements.  we were presented some designs  and specifications.  i thought we had a consultant  and it seems like are we going  back to?  there were two different  consultants.  one was the traffic study and  circulation to provide ideas.  they weren'  t engineered designs.  they were all built in the  the engineering in itself is  almost a year or six months to  do and then the designs and  bidding it out and then  construction usually follows the  next construction season.  i think the funding was pushed  out a year also.  that'  s why we'  re doing the design this year  and hopefully do the construction  next year.  they will come back.  they will be moved in the  they will be moved in the future.  that'  s what they'  re working on now.  they will be bringing in at that  time.  it was conceptual designs we  looked at before.  thanks for that clarification.  any other questions or comments for  linda?  no?  okay.  7.2.  thank you linda for all of your  I will point out that this report is actually from the  previous month's meeting.  I will present the March report with the next April packet.  I will be happy to answer any questions you might have.  Chico nature center, grove of cedar trees, hot button area.  Let's make sure.  Whatever supervisor is supposed to be there.  I forget the title of the Scott Schuman did reach out and asked  if we can take a look at the little cluster of very tall  trees in between the two buildings.  Kind of outside the classroom building, if that's the correct  description.  One of those cedar trees is a little bit of a  It's a little bit of a tree.  It has a very hard lane right over the building.  And we did prune it a few years ago.  And to see how it responds.  But after the recent storms, they do seem to have moved a  little bit.  And we've had a lot of discussion about it.  But we've come to the decision that it's probably time to  remove those trees.  We've pruned them.  We've monitored them.  But as in my previous presentation on the tree appeal,  the occupancy rate of that building, if those trees fell on  that building, there's a way we can avoid that.  And unfortunately that means removing those trees.  So we are segueing on to another exciting point is that we are on  the verge of appointing a new tree trimming contractor.  And I think it's not too premature.  I think it's not too premature to say North Valley Arbor  Management, or more commonly known as About Trees or North  Valley Tree Service because they are one in the same company.  So we're very excited to get those folks on board.  And we'll be putting together some tree removal and tree  trimming programs.  And that work at Chico Nature Center will be one of the first  jobs that they'll be put to.  And that will be happening in the coming months, if not weeks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Liza Cernova.  I just have one quick.  On the UFMP, like it says targeted, the hard copies would be  created.  Are we pretty close to them finalizing?  Yeah.  I know I keep saying it.  But we're closer than we were before.  They did send us back some another attempt at clearing up all the typos.  That's okay.  We're close.  Okay.  And they got it more or less to the point where we can press the  print button, but we did still find some things that they missed in  the last cycle.  So we've sent it back to them.  I would hope very soon that we will be able to present all of you  with nice coffee table bound copies of the urban forest master plan.  So, yeah.  It's coming.  Thanks for your patience.  I just wanted to know if, like, yeah, did they even give an indication of which month,  which year?  Right.  The final version is online.  So you can take a look at that.  And there is an addendum that shows, you know, what kind of niggle points we have.  So kind of looking at those two things together.  You know, we've started, you know, working with the plan.  But we want that.  Okay.  Well, thank you very much. my desk permanently. So yeah, so hopefully very, very soon. And that will be the last time I ever say that. I have it circled too. I wondered if Dudek wanted to hire me to go through and proofread  Possibly. Any other questions or comments for Richie? Thank you, Richie. And we will then move to  we will move to item 8 adjournment adjourn to the next regular meeting on April 29, 2024  at 6 p.m. in council chambers of the chico municipal center building 412 main street  chico california. thank you everybody for being here and for your hard work.
