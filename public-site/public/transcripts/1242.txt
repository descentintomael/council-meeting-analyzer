 Thank you.  by Minister Chet Rutledge from Chico Church of Christ.  Welcome.  Good evening.  Thank you, Mayor Reynolds, Council, for the invitation.  Will you join me in prayer as we begin?  Dear Heavenly Father, we praise you for your sovereignty  and your creative abilities that you continue to faithfully extend to us  as your people, your creation.  We're mindful of your interdependence.  We're mindful of your intervention at all times  as we look around and see the beauty in this world,  see the weather changing and the trees turning colors and the leaves falling.  We just think of your grand design and our role within that.  Thank you.  We have many things to praise you for, Lord.  We also have many things to petition you with and for.  This evening, Lord, we are mindful of our great country we live in  and the democracy that is fashioned in your nature of freedom.  And we're thankful for this day of elections that are taking place.  What a splendid activity that is that we all benefit from.  We praise you for this country.  We know it's plagued with many difficulties, Lord,  but you're a God of intervention once again,  and you know what's happening.  And we know you're helping and guiding us.  We praise you for this great city that we live in, the community.  We pray for our people here, our citizens.  We pray for our first responders,  those who put their quite literally lives on the line every day to serve and protect.  We ask that you form a hedge of protection,  around them and their families,  so we can better serve you as a community.  Lord, we pray for our educational system and our teachers and administrators  and all those involved with teaching our children and youth and adults, too.  At the college here, we just praise you for these things that you've created  so we can learn more about what you've created.  Lord, we praise you for the things you do.  We pray for you.  We ask you, Lord, to guide and direct our businesses here in the city,  the commerce that's involved,  and so many aspects of work that go on from health care to manufacturing to retail.  It's just so much.  We ask that you continue to make things flow the way they're supposed to  so we can be a part of it.  We ask that you continue to be a productive community and give back.  Lord, I ask that you be with the council tonight.  Give them a spirit of wisdom and oversight,  and their eyes be open and their ears be attentive to the needs of this community.  I ask you to just fill them with a spirit of wisdom  so they can make decisions that can better our community here,  so we can be better stewards of what you've given us.  We pray for a spirit of civility for the remainder of this meeting,  and that your spirit of peace be upon us.  In Christ's name I pray. Amen.  All right. Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.  Salute and pledge.  Pledge of Allegiance.  In the name of Christ, the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  and of the Holy Spirit, and of the Holy Spirit,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Amen.  Roll call. Madam Clerk, can you call roll for us, please?  Okay. Councilmember Goldstein?  Present.  Councilmember Hawley?  Here.  Councilmember O'Brien?  Here.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  Here.  Councilmember Winslow?  Here.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Here.  Mayor Reynolds?  Here.  All right. Speaker card announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the council on any matters listed on the agenda  should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the chambers.  Once completed, turn your cards into the city clerk,  and the speaker card will be handed to the council.  Any additional speakers are taken in the order received.  Once the first speaker begins, no additional speakers will be taken.  Persons demonstrating rude, boisterous speaking on matters outside the jurisdiction of this  city council, or engaging in otherwise disruptive behavior will be called to order.  If such conduct continues, I may call a recess, requesting removal of such persons from the  council chambers, adjourn the meeting, or take other actions if appropriate.  Closed session announcement.  City Attorney, Mr. John Lamb, can you do our announcement for us, please?  Thank you, Madam Mayor.  As mentioned earlier this evening, the city council recessed in closed session.  All council members were present, with the exception for item 2.3, conference with legal  counsel, with respect to Believe in Chico.  Council Member Van Overbeek did recuse himself due to residing within 500 feet of the subject  of the litigation.  That item was briefed to council.  No direction was provided.  No final action was taken.  With respect to items 2.1, 2.2, and 2.4, all council members were present.  the council was brief and  direction was provided no final  action was taken that concludes  my report.  Are we good?  There we are.  We have a proclamation for homeless youth  awareness month. Do we have some?  Alright, come on down.  Alright.  So, whereas California Department of Education  reports there were  286,853  homeless students including  some 1,798  K-12 students  here in Butte County and rural  during the 2023-2024 school year.  And whereas natural disasters  and lack of affordable housing have exasperated  youth homelessness across  California in approximately 25%  of existing foster care  experience homelessness. And whereas  a high percentage of homeless youth have been  physically, sexually, and or emotionally  abused by their guardians and  frequently re-victimized and  exploited while living on the streets and  in shelters. And whereas LGBTQ  plus young adults are  120% higher risk of homelessness  when compared to their peers and  compromise about 40% of the unaccompanied  homeless youth population.  And whereas due to lack of stable housing  homeless youth face  great difficulty in accessing,  stabilizing, and succeeding in school  reducing the likelihood of successful  graduation. Whereas all citizens  are key to preventing  youth homelessness by acting as  mentors, role models for youth,  guiding them towards available resources  and productive choices and  creating opportunities for youth to  succeed and transition into  adulthood. Now therefore  let it be resolved that I, Casey  Reynolds, Mayor of the City of Chaco on  behalf of the entire City of Chaco Council  do hereby proclaim November  2025  Homeless Youth Awareness Month and  do commend this  observance to all of our citizens.  And to you guys. Thank you for coming tonight.  You want to say anything?  No? Okay. Thank you for being here tonight.  All right. Consent agenda. All matters  listed under the consent agenda are considered  routine in nature and can therefore be enacted  in one motion. Do we have  any speakers?  Okay. Any council member disqualifications?

Beau Powell followed by Sam Barber.  You can't it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it  worked at your school district.  I'm a third generation Chico High School student.  My grandmother for the last six years of her life  was impacted by the illegal spraying.  Not only was my mother being sprayed by them, but me too.  And I had seizures for years.  I've gone to the doctors here in Butte County  and because no one in the authority will acknowledge it  and no news agency will acknowledge it,  over 25 doctors said nothing.  I finally got one doctor.  She was new to the area.  I explained what happened  and I was able to get a referral to a doctor.  So,  the first time I got exposed to this chemical was in 1989.  They took my driver's license because I had seizures.  That's over 39 years ago,  or 36 years ago.  They took my driver's license because of illegal chemical use.  They stopped that chemical from being used  because it is so dangerous  to the environment.  They started using it again in 2006.  The hottest years ever recorded in California  since they started using that chemical.  To use it legally, it has to be covered with plastic.  Both the county supervisor, the congressman,  and all kinds of...  public figures have admitted that they use the methyl bromide in the orchards.  When's the last time you've seen the orchard covered with plastic?  I'm glad that you all don't care about these folks' children.  You know, this is why we have to recycle public figures.  This council knows that it happened.  They sprayed the orchards white.  They burned Paradise to the ground.  Because of that chemical.  The overuse of water.  Today, the nut thing.  $150 million.  The farmers made.  Your disregard for public safety.  Sam Barber, followed by Tracy Anderson.  Hello.  There's just a few things I wanted to talk about today.  First of which is I was actually genuinely pleased  at a council meeting.  meeting for like the first time in my life. Y'all gave people homes and I like could not believe it.  So like, thank you. Shame to all of you who voted against giving these older women homes. I don't  know how you could do that, but you did it. The second piece is, again, I'm going to ask the  council, particularly the Republicans, just have a conversation about the ICE issue. It is a modern  day Gestapo. They are human trafficking people. I witnessed them on July 15th take a pregnant  woman's husband from her. He had gone through all the legal avenues. His lawyer had told him he was  in the clear. He did everything he needed to do. He was waiting for his papers to be processed.  They waited for him to go outside of his home. They slammed him against a fence, three men in  this unmarked van. They took him to Bakersfield. I've not heard from the wife. I've not heard from  the husband. I don't know what's happened, but you should be concerned. I mean, these are people who  are being disappeared. There's people who have been exposed to sexual abuse, slavery, all sorts  of things. I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's going on.  They've been it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it  you're not willing to even have a conversation about protecting our constitutional rights,  why should I think you're going to be there for any of us? We're in a city surrounded by  agriculture. One-fifth of the population is Hispanic or Latino. You owe it to them. You  rely on their services. We all do. Not just for them, but for all of us, for our constitutional  rights. Please do something. The third thing I wanted to mention was these red light cameras,  which I kind of disagreed with, but whatever, you put them up anyways. The price for a ticket  from one of those is $465. The average person in Chico makes about $33,000 a year. I'm sure you  could probably do the numbers on after rent, after internet, after their car payments and all that.  What a $465 payment looks like to someone like that, it puts them in a really sticky situation.  If we're trying to prevent people from becoming homeless, we shouldn't be charging them so much  for something as simple as a traffic infraction.  And that doesn't touch on the fact that their insurance rate is going to go up. Then they have  to figure out how they're going to afford that as well on top of their rent and everything else.  The last piece I wanted to speak on was Michael Williams. I think it was a police sergeant  who was having intercourse with women on the clock. He's a sexual predator. He used his  position of power to leverage intercourse from women. He used the murder of Desmond Phillips  to justify and manipulate a woman into having intercourse with him. And we gave him $36,000  because he was going to appeal his case. That's disgusting. Thanks.  Thank you. Tracy Anderson, followed by Ted Schwartz.  Okay. We're not going to do applause or clicking or any of that. We want to make everybody feel  welcome to come up and speak at the microphone with their opinions. Thank you.  Okay. Hello. I'm Tracy.  If you could pull the mic, excuse me. If you could pull the mic down towards you. There you go.  Thank you.  I'm here to ask for help on behalf of myself and numerous other people, residents of Chico.  I began renting an apartment nearby seven months ago and turned out to be very badly infested with  cockroaches and bedbugs. In the last seven months, I have tried tirelessly  to find an agency.  You can't find it unless it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it  reduction in the quantity of bugs in there. It's very extreme.  I've had many health issues  related to this. Mental, psychological, spiritual,  physical. Just on a personal note,  I miss my firstborn daughter's college graduation  for a lot of different reasons that are directly related.  A lot has happened.  There was an incident in the parking lot because residents are having to  evade the bugs at night and things.  There was a rape in the parking lot.  That person is incarcerated.  The treatments are not working and the housing  agency that is overseeing my apartment complex is not  willing to do anything about it. I've contacted  every...  Like,  by phone and in person, the courthouse,  the government agencies and charities,  law firms.  I'm here to follow up as a suggestion by a really  wonderful officer to come here because I haven't gotten  any answers from anyone else. I have a recommendation  that maybe a non-biased pesticide company  give a second opinion as to the treatment method  because maybe it needs to be tented. I don't know.  But it's not working. I'm pretty sure it's unlawfully  uninhabitable.  That's it. Thank you.  Thank you. Ted Swartz.  Good evening, everybody.  I want to applaud the speakers who spoke before me because what they spoke about was, I think,  makes what I'm bringing up trivial, but I'm concerned about many of the things they've talked about.  There's people running around with hoods on that are too cowardly to show their faces and they're prosecuting people for the color of their skin when most of them are just hardworking people.  And it's happening now in our community.  And I'm really disgusted by it, to be honest with you, that they have money for that, but they don't have money for that.  They don't have the money to give people who are on food stamps food.  But anyways, I do want to applaud all of you who spoke before me for having the courage to come up here and bring it up.  Because so many things that you have to deal with on the city level  are basic routine stuff.  But what I wanted to speak about is  I live on Mulberry Street and they just put in the  fiber optic there.  And the spoils from the diggings  they use to surface the street with.  And they need to put some aggregate base on top of it  because now it's all like mud about this thick  and everybody's tracking it out into the road.  Like when the post office comes to deliver your mail, they drive to the mud  from the porch, from the  spoils that they use to surface.  And I guess the fiber optic is going to be an improvement.  I don't really need it myself, but the city is part of the project.  And so I was going to remind them before they finish the project  to put some aggregate base down there.  Because it's across people's driveways and stuff like that.  But thank you for your time.  Thank you.  And then, Council, because of a permanent restraining order,  I'm going to read the comments from Andrew Merkel.  They were emailed to the council, so I want it on the record that we did send it right out.  He states, my name is Andrew Merkel and I'm here today because of  for over a month I've been seeking public documents that the city of Chico is required by law to maintain and disclose.  Specifically, the TDP-133  and any significant industrial user permit related to the city's wastewater system.  Under California Public Records Act and the First Amendment, every citizen has a right to access government information.  And I'm going to read the comments from Andrew Merkel.  I'm going to read the comments from Andrew Merkel.  I'm going to read the comments from Andrew Merkel.  I'm going to read the comments from Andrew Merkel.  I'm going to read it.  I'm going to read it.  I'm going to read it. We have 4.1, consideration of an ordinance regarding massage establishments. We have Charlene Durkin, our code enforcement supervisor. Welcome, Charlene. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, council members. Well, we're back. We had a couple of great rounds in internal affairs. We got some great feedback. You'll see in your staff report that most of that is attached.  in your staff report.  Most of that is attached. We did have some  come in late last week. I sent you guys an email  about that earlier today with some  information about that, but it doesn't  John Lamb looked at it,  Civica looked at it, doesn't seem to be any kind of legal  concern on that part.  I feel like we  got a lot of great engagement from the community.  We made some changes. I think we  have a good product for you to  review.  Any questions for Ms. Durkin before we go to  I do want to make  one comment if I may.  I thought Supervisor Durkin,  Director Veig, and our staff  did an outstanding job  engaging the local massage  industry. They had  some real honest conversations. We had those honest  conversations in internal  affairs and really in the  end this was an example  of how  we were able to  work.  I want to applaud our staff for  making those efforts, for making  this happen, working through some of  the details that were unintended.  Initially, remember, we had people coming up  and saying if we pass this, you'll put me  out of business. We recognized that was not  what we wanted, of course,  and made some adjustments. I think we came  up with an excellent  ordinance that  weeds out the bad actors or holds  them accountable but protects the  good people, which are the majority  in our industry.  Like I said, just an example of  good government at work. Thank  you Supervisor Durkin and Director  Veig and all those staff members  who worked on this.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  I was going to say the same  thing. I'  m not going to repeat  everything that Council Member  O'Brien just stated but I do  want to say thank you very much  for all the work you put into  it and you Director Veig for all  the work you also put into it.  I think it'  s a great  experience of the first session.  I remember it well. It was quite  voiceful. I use the word voiceful.  A lot of people were concerned.  They were upset. They were fearful  of what was going to happen and  you worked through it very  successfully. Again, thank you  very much.  Thank you.  Council Member Holley.  It'  s just so important to be  reactive and flexible to community  feedback and I think you did an  excellent job reading through the  qualified practitioner exemption and  changes made to the temporary  exemption. I really appreciate it  and recognize it isn'  t always easy to do this work.  You killed it.  Thank you very much.  We will open the public hearing.  How many speakers do we have?  We have one.  Three more.  Okay.  That is Amy Allward.  Good evening.  Council members, staff, community.  Thank you for this opportunity to  address you once again.  I will extend my compliments to  the staff and the hard work that  has been done on this ordinance.  However, I will also admit that I  don'  t think it goes quite far enough.  I will also say that I think it  is a great opportunity to address  There are several issues, major  issues that are covered in the  ordinance, one of which is licensure  and that has come a long way for  onboarding legitimate therapists who  have been hard at work in our  community.  That is beautiful work and I  appreciate it.  However, there is still an issue  with establishments and licensing  establishments. What'  s addressed in the ordinance is  that they are not  massage businesses to conform to  business models that they are not  currently using.  It is asking them to enter into  legal partnerships when most of  these arrangements are done ad  hoc as subletting and subleasing  arrangements.  I brought this up to Ms.  Durkin personally.  I have included it in my comments  which are also attached to the  agenda and I appreciate that as well.  opportunity to work on establishing  how we create an onboarding process  for legitimate establishments who  are already operating in tenant.  The other thing that I would like  to bring up is one of the  commentary, I think somebody that  I wasn't sure from the notes that  were attached to the agenda whether  that commentary came from CAMTC or  some other commentary.  It wasn't in their commentary.  I noticed their words were in  red in response to my documentation.  One of the things I requested because  of the history in this town of a prior  massage school which is no longer in  business that came into being before  the board of post-secondary education  even existed and then had some  understandable friction after operating  their own business here in town when  the board of post-secondary education  said they needed to change how they  were doing business.  And then CAMTC came along later.  So no one who graduated from that  school and there are quite a few of  them in the area have ever qualified  to apply for CAMTC because that  school was never recognized.  I have an alternative organization  it's called NCBTMB and the response  to that request to look into it said  that they do not do background checks.  They do.  So what I am submitting tonight is  a webpage for NCBTMB and the  response to that request is that  they should apply for CAMTC.  NCBTMB to show that this is a  legitimate organization with higher  standards than the CAMTC.  One of the things that they offer  is a portfolio review for massage  therapists regardless of whether  their school is certified or in  existence.  thank you.  thank you.  all right.  We will close the public hearing.  I will make a motion to approve.  And I do want to state that there  is some flexibility within this  ordinance and I know that our staff  will be flexible where we can.  So we are fair to all those that  we do not want to impact.  But I think overall I think a  really positive product has been  created.  It will be good for our community  and will protect people from what  we want them protected from.  So I move to approve.  thank you.  I think council member  Goldstein did you want to talk?  I was getting in the queue for  commenting.  go ahead.  I can go first.  First thanks to our staff for  working with our community and our  internal affairs committee on this  ordinance.  I am cautiously supportive.  I want us to make our best effort to  prevent human trafficking in Chico.  That is my priority.  I think we have addressed those  pretty well and hopefully we can  continue if we see any friction in  how this ordinance takes effect that  we could update that later.  I am cautious because I want to  avoid over regulating our small  businesses in Chico.  At first I was a bit concerned  about this ordinance perhaps being  a solution looking for a problem or  even a case of moral grand standing  against sex work.  I want the focus to be human  trafficking prevention and I want  to make sure that the  community is safe.  I have been looking at this for a  while.  I have been working with the  community on this ordinance.  That is in addition to meetings in  the community, exchanges of emails,  conversations with Charlene on the  phone and such.  Initially when it went to committee  it was brought up by I will say  former council member Deepika  Tandon.  There was very low public engagement  and given this was something I had  no personal experience in at all  that was concerning from any side.  Finally we got a model or design  that was really important to  I looked at it and I first thought  this is really strict.  I thought we were just requiring  certification and there was a lot  more to it.  I started to wonder, I feel like  when this is brought up the  conversation has been on human  trafficking but I wondered if we  were beating around the bush and  it was more about targeting sex  workers but undocumented workers  who are going to have trouble  beating any of these qualifications  or be afraid because of the things  we have heard about the way that  immigration enforcement is looking  right now.  We went into these recent committee  meetings we had much more robust  public engagement.  We had a lot of people show up.  Through this process that has been  described by other council members  we addressed the concerns of local  massage practitioners.  I am confident we have built enough  relationships with local  I still just recently because there  was a lot of it was a touchy subject  you could say.  I had some people from wildly  different political persuasions  whose opinions I respect a lot  tell me they thought this was  essentially a stupid unnecessary  ordinance and problem looking for  a solution.  There are two things that recently  things I have read or learned that  made me come around to unequivocally  think that this is a good thing.  One is that the !  I think it is a good thing  the practitioners to destroy any  fuzzy line that exists between  those two lines of work.  The other story is closer to Chico  and it was just recently I happened  to see in the newspaper there was  a rotary club discussion on human  trafficking from a local expert  and I talked to her about it.  Previously I felt like it was a bit  anecdotal or speculative that there  was human trafficking in Chico.  I had heard there weren't documented cases. We had a realtor come in and talk about this tentative thing.  But she told me of research she did  ten years ago where a lot of people  went into a lot of these businesses  around town and they talked to women and  eventually they got enough confidence  that these women told them that they were not here of their own will.  In certain cases they were even  they believed their families  were under threat by the  people who were controlling them there.  And that's  right here in Chico.  We don't hear about it. These are people  that don't vote in local elections. They are not likely to call 911.  They are not likely to reach out to us.  They come from China or they come from Vietnam  or they come from Thailand.  And I think that we have an obligation to work for Chico that's safe  for them too and a country  that's to them as free as we  purport ourselves to be. And I think this is a little thing that we can do  that's part of a statewide effort  to try to bring this industry under control.  I think this is a piece of all the things  that we can do. It gives us the  teeth to start to look into these cases  and so that this kind of thing  at the very least isn't happening in our community.  So, support the motion.  Did you want to say something else?  Okay, go ahead.  I just wanted to respond  to public comment as well as a couple of emails  that we've received.  I completely understand the worry  of some educational facilities  and massage therapy schools  going out of business  that those might not be  recognized  by  CAMTC anymore  but from what  Mr. Ginn has presented on  and the updates that the  IAC has added  just right here in the  qualified practitioner exemption  B, it says evidence that  they have certification or proof of  training in the field of massage from a school  or another entity comparable.  So, I would say that those  certificates would still be protected  and I understand that code enforcement  will have a lot of leeway  and flexibility when recognizing  these comparable certificates.  But feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.  No, absolutely.  Ms. Dirk, in the last time you did research  on this, can you tell me how many  illicit businesses  were advertising that you found  in the city of Chico?  I believe it was 36?  33 when we first started and now we're up to 43.  We're up to 43. And what did Redding tell you?  Well, at least one of their  bad actors moved to Chico.  Perfect.  So, we have a motion and a second?  We do and that's to introduce the ordinance  for the City of Chico adding Chapter 5.44  to the City of Chico Municipal Code  to regulate massage therapy establishments  within the City of Chico  by reading of title only.  Councilmember Goldstein? Yes, council member Holly. Yes, council member O'Brien. Yes, council member Van Overbeek. Yes. Council member Winslow. Yes, vice mayor Bennett.  Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Sorry it took us a year, but I'm glad we're here.  Carried 7-0. Thank you.  All right.  5.1. Consideration of a resolution  adding the Almonte  annexation territory to District 7.  Ms. Fressen?  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  What you have before you is  consideration of a resolution  that would add the Almonte annexation  and that area into  District 7  pursuant to Elections Code  Section 21603A.  It's  one of four annexations  that were  slated to  remove any of those islands  that still existed.  And it's part of an agreement that we have  with Butte County LAVCO.  And  just to let you know that  well,  one of them, the Chico  I believe it was the Chico Canyon  annexation, they did a protest  hearing. So that one is not coming  into the City  because they went through a process in that  process. They voted it down.  However, this one is.  And so I did want to let you  know that when we did the  redistricting  in 2022  because of the  getting the results of the 2020  Census, those annexations  were taken into consideration.  And that is why we landed on  District 7  for this area, for this annex  area to be added into.  We did reach out, Angie, to the  demographer who,  Claudio, who actually handled this  process for the City of Chico.  And he reviewed it as well as legal  for the area.  So are there any questions?  Any questions, Ms. Preston?  Will we have to go through an election  like we did with the Chico Canyon?  No, this one actually went  through. This annexation went through  the normal process and they approved it.  And so it's being annexed in.  And now we just are placing them into  the district that they're going to be  in for the 2026 election.  All right. Any other questions  for Ms. Preston? No. Okay. Do we have  any speakers? We do not. All right.  Consider motion.  Move to approve. Second.  Well, I was going to move to approve. It's my district.  Let's take that back.  It's all good as long as you're not  going to fight me for it, Tom, to get this in your  district. Never mind.  You want them, just to be clear? Yes, yes,  yes. I will represent this portion  happily. Okay.  Awesome. Council member Goldstein? Yes. Council member Hawley? Yes. Council member O'Brien? Yes. Council member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council member Winslow? Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes.  Mayor Reynolds? No, I want them in  District 2. No, I'm kidding.  Yes. Okay. Carrie 7-0.  All right.  CalPERS  unfunded accrual liability  discussion.  I don't have a name on here. Who's  taking this away?  Mr. Sorensen?  Well, that was a  Council Member Van Overbeek wanted  a council discussion.  So, amongst council.  All right. Council Member Van Overbeek.  I'll take it away then. Thank you.  So, I think we all know  that the city  employees of the City of Chico are part of the  CalPERS pension program.  It's divided into two groups. There's public safety  and there's everybody else.  And  how it works is  CalPERS is a state  agency.  The city makes a contribution as  the employer. The employees make a contribution.  And  there are returns from  investments  that are supposed to make up the  difference. Unfortunately,  I looked at these numbers about three years ago,  CalPERS  investment returns have only been  about two-thirds  of what the Dow Jones  Index is. So, they've  come up short. And part of the reason is that  their investment agenda was politically driven.  They seem to have gotten over that  and realized their first obligation is to  the pensioners, not  to whatever the political  fashion is. But as a result  of their  poor investment  performance, the City of Chico  is burdened with a  $181 million  unfunded pension liability,  which is up from $117 million  in 2021.  Our contribution  in 25,  I'm taking this, Barbara, off the  budget book,  is a little over $14 million.  Those are dollars we could use for  lots of other things.  So, what can we do?  The topic  I brought up  at Finance was what can we do  to reduce  the unfunded liability over time?  It's not something we can fix today or tomorrow.  The City's taken some steps.  We looked at some things like pension obligation  bonds. This was  maybe five, six years ago.  Yeah. And the only  way to really do that, to reduce  the unfunded liability  is to reduce  or at least stop the growth  of people  who work for the City  but are directly employed by  the City and instead outsource  some of those functions  to contractors. And the City already  does that. I mean,  janitorial services,  I think, correct me if I'm wrong  on this, Skylar, but the  seasonal forestry work,  you know, you guys have your own tree crews, but  then when there's the peak season  of tree work, you contract out with some people  that come in and help.  The priority has to be  that the City is managed efficiently  and effectively  and we need the staff to make this determination.  But  I did a little  research. So one of my concerns  is that I've had conversations with a couple  of managers about outsourcing. They said,  well, we looked at the cost  but  we compared what we pay our people  with what the cost was and  they were more expensive. And the reason is  when you get  a bid from a vendor,  a service provider, they've got  a burden, you know,  their overhead cost is in there.  And I'm not sure  we're taking ours into account. So I did some  simple  calculations this  morning and got into the budget  book, which is a real fun  Barbara, I'm hugely  impressed that you actually put this together  every year. So  community development,  the percentage of the  what I did was I took the budget  and subtracted  purchase services. So things that were already  contracted out. So the  total budget number that's left over,  which in the case of community development is about 6.4,  $4 million.  For every dollar in direct labor,  which is 2.3, in order  to deliver those services, they have to spend  two more dollars, right?  And so  what I found in my career in business is that  whether it's engineering or  finance  or sales, that there's a certain  burden percentage that stays  pretty constant as head count goes up and down.  Public works,  another example, operations  and maintenance, for every  dollar in direct labor, there's another  dollar  in burden. So  what I would like to do, what I would  like to ask is that the council  approve a  asking the staff  to go back and look at what  functions can the city  outsource without compromising efficiency  and effective management.  But in the  process of doing that, really making  an apples and apples comparison between  what our real costs are  instead of just the direct labor  costs and what a contractor might  cost.  I'm happy to  take any questions or  Council Member Hawley.  Yeah, I perhaps would  like to offer a different lens. I  understand the conversation of  unfunded liability and why  that's such a big deal. However,  we're only looking at this through a  money standpoint, whereas  we also need to be looking at the  quality of the public services  that are delivered.  Our city employees are also people  who are moms and dads  in our community.  And it's important that they're benefited.  Oftentimes when we  outsource these services,  those go to employees that  are not benefited  all the time.  And that's why working for  public services can be  such a reliable job.  So  I don't know, are we considering  also the fact that this would be  decreasing the number of high quality  public jobs within our city  and potentially adding jobs  that would not be benefited?  It's not going to reduce the number,  it wouldn't necessarily reduce the number of people  employed. It would change who they  work for in a  way to reduce  the pension liability. But we're  in a situation right now, if you look  at all the people that are covered by the CalPERS  pensions, both working and  retired, where less than  1% of the population is  responsible.  And we have agreements, and I'm not  suggesting we change anything  with agreements that are in place,  but we've got $181 million  liability  for less than 1% of the population  and that is a skewed  that's something we need to  address. Now the reality  is that there are  functions like fire  and police where you don't  want to outsource the sworn positions,  right? And maybe some of  those support positions  we can outsource.  I'm not, I'm not,  we're not here to talk about what positions we  should outsource. I'm here to say I'd like  the staff to look at it  and come back and see if  there's an opportunity  to do this without compromising  the city's  ability to deliver good services,  which it does now.  Thank you for clarifying.  Council Member Winslow.  I think this is a great discussion to bring up  and I appreciate the looking into  it, at least  from our standpoint. I think  to a certain extent, the staff's always looking at  when they can save money. Every time we  budget, you know, and I had a conversation about street sweeping  and we kind of went into it and I know they had looked  at, like, was it better to outsource  that? A lot of cities do  and determined that it wasn't. And I think  it's an ongoing process, right?  Looking at those sort of things. Yeah, I  agree with what Council Member Hawley was saying that  one of the reasons  why government can be perceived to be inefficient  is because we tend to insist on  having good benefits for  employees. We have to look them in the eyes, you know?  Which isn't something that private contractors  do. But I think also, what's something  that's overlooked in  comparing, like, public employee  costs and seeing that we have this big unfunded  liability because they  retire and stay alive for a long time  and take benefits, is that contracting costs  also go up over time. And if we're  on the hook for relying on this  limited pool of private contractors, we can be  in a position where they're able to consistently  require more increases. So I think  that it's hard to  predict what's better, you know? And sometimes  it comes down to it. It's like, well, are we going to negotiate really  tough with our employees and try to resist  pay increases? And I can tell you that  to the extent that in the last few years  we've added pretty substantially to this unfunded  liability, I can tell you  where that's gone. I don't think you're going to like the answer  if we want to get into  where the money goes.  So I don't know that I  think we're going to be  In general, I think it's good to shine a light on this.  I think this is something that we look at every  budget season when we're talking about needing new things  and whether we add positions or whether we contract it out.  I don't know that a specific review,  looking for a report from staff is really going to help.  It's really just going to take the admin overhead time  that I guess could be going to serving other things.  Yeah, we're six months away from  six, seven months away  from, so it's not too early to start  looking at it.  Council Member Goldstein.  Sure, just I guess I'm curious  for the city manager's opinion on  if our unfunded liability is really a significant risk  to our city right now.  Well, it's certainly a serious issue that has been talked about  by councils for many years in virtually every city in the  state.  As to Council Member Van Overbeek's point,  it is analyzed, in fact, just this year,  that the city is going to be  it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it  we can do it better and more  cost effective in house.  That was true of the tree crew  that was true of the only other position  we added this  fiscal year was a  wire pulling technician  because we looked at the amount of workload  we have we can keep that person busy  full time for the rest  of the year and we know we  were going to spend more contracting it  out.  Now to what extent does  also  reflect the weight of the  building  unfunded liability  difficult to tell because for one thing  that is such a  nebulous number  that I don' t think any of us  here really know what it  means.  Is that a number that we' re going to pay  this year next year this decade  unlikely unless we try to exit  CalPERS.  I don' t even know if the question that' s been posed can even be answered with any  certainty unfortunately.  You raised a very good point if I can make a comment  and so in private  industry as in cities  when you have seasonal work  so you have a  extra load  for a tree cruise in the summer  for example to do tree maintenance  it probably makes sense  to ask the question.  I' m not saying  that you can outsource it but if you can keep those guys  working  or ladies working  five days a week all year  then the case to bring it in house is much stronger.  So the seasonal  fluctuations taken the top of that  fluctuations off is one opportunity.  That is one opportunity another is an all point I'  ll use engineering as an example.  Where we have multiple multiple millions of dollars worth of contracting out work.  But you have to have a certain amount of staff to be able to manage the contractors because if you don' t that will go very badly.  That' s right it still has to be managed even when you contract.  Perhaps more so.  There' s some great cases I think of our existing practice in like using contractors like Dawson' s landscaping I don' t know how many guys they hire but arguably that' s like a big chunk of the 30% of the contract.  And they need to be able to manage the city workforce.  And they probably don' t need too much oversight as far as I know.  But in other instances I was thinking that I hear a lot from inside city staff of like difficulty managing contractors which is something that continues and maybe is even worse when you have different parties especially if you end up switching from one contractor to another overtime.  So there' s a certain amount of volatility I think you get when you'  re relying on contracts over government employees.  Do we have any speakers on this item real quick?  No.  Okay.  So Tom I'  m going to ask you to talk about the !  You can't it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it  based on the probability that there are some savings to be had.  And some of this is replacing existing functions,  but also just trying to get a handle on this unfunded liability over time,  because as the city grows and the city staff grows,  I would like a greater portion of the work to be done by people who are not city employees.  All right.  Can I just throw it to Barb and Martin?  You deal with this directly, and I've talked about it before  and kind of seen this projection that our obligations are going to decline over time  because of reform that's happened at the state level for these retirement deals.  And I just wonder if you have a comment.  Do you see an opportunity for this being useful,  and could it be a budget appendix to try to have this analysis to guide us in the future,  or do you feel like you're already doing the work?  I think when we go through the budget process,  that's kind of what we're doing ongoing is evaluating the cost benefit for anything.  When it comes to salaries and benefits and anything that comes our way,  we understand that hiring people is an expensive proposition,  so we definitely analyze it over time kind of on an ongoing basis.  That's just kind of the conservative and responsible thing that we do.  Okay.  Council Member Hawley.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, I was looking this way.  Yeah, just conceptually, I have strong concerns.  I think as Council Member Hawley mentioned,  the idea of reducing the amount of good jobs in our city,  and I think that we have good unionized jobs that support people and their families here,  and I don't think that...  I don't think private sector jobs are necessarily bad,  but I just would have concerns with trying to outsource more than potentially necessary.  I don't think we would be careless about that if we did assess this,  but it sounds like that work is already being done every year  to ensure that we are being budget conscious about our positions,  but also I want to point out that contracting is expensive too,  and somebody else already pointed out we have to manage those contracts,  and then maybe...  It's possible we don't have as good oversight of our work  if we have less in-house staff and more contracted work,  so I would be very cautious about this if we move forward.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  So when I first joined the Council,  I was assigned to the Finance Committee,  so I've been on it for, what, a little over four years now,  and I know that you are always looking at,  is this the best way to proceed?  With a particular job, function, concept?  I know you very well financially.  You're always looking at that,  and I have complete confidence in City Manager Sorensen  always looking at these numbers,  and should we go this way, should we go that way?  So I think to a great extent, and I love the way you poise this,  is there an opportunity?  Is there a way we could take a look at this?  There may not be one.  Yeah.  So I know you're doing this already,  so I don't know what it would accomplish to look at it closer.  If we did not have, I'm going to say we did not have the confidence in you,  your staff, your people, City Manager Sorensen,  and now Assistant City Manager Gufferson,  I could see taking a look at it.  I would not be opposed to that.  It's the same.  If City Council decides they want to take a look at it,  let's go ahead and do that,  but I don't have a concern because of you.  So that's what I wanted to say.  So I have an example that might illustrate this.  So this was seven or eight years ago.  The business, I'm sorry, the property owners in downtown Chico  voted in a property, a PBID,  which is the Business Owners Improvement District.  So we taxed ourselves, and it's about,  half of what our property taxes are in addition  to put those seven people on the street  to keep it clean and do the things that they do,  in part because the city couldn't do it  because of the cost of the public works people.  So they have seven people on the street,  and their budget's a little over $400,000.  And I don't know what the burden cost is  for people that do that for public works,  but I suspect they would have two,  or three people max for the same amount of money.  So there are, and that's one example,  and those are largely unskilled people.  It's not like tree crews where, you know,  that's a whole different thing.  But I believe there are opportunities,  and I believe it's easy to keep doing things the way  we've always done them because we always did them that way.  But what's happened in the private sector,  I mean, for example, in the 20s, the car companies,  you know,  Ford had its own coal mines, its own forest for wood,  its own steel mills, and now all that stuff's outsourced.  It's all outsourced.  So I do appreciate you, Tom, bringing this up.  This is a concern.  Yes, I think all of us recognize,  but it's not a new concern,  certainly something we've been discussing for years.  I know staff, Barbara, and other folks  in those positions have really taken  some really creative looks at this issue.  It does not mean, because we did not find some solution  or some things that will help in the past,  does not mean that we should stop looking at things  in the future, and I think our staff does an excellent job  of doing just that.  I don't think it is harmful for us  to continue those conversations.  I think we have to, when you have that level  of unfunded liability, it would be wrong for us  not to continue those conversations.  I think we have to, understanding that our staff  is doing the very best with what we have  and are always looking for those opportunities,  but us, again, being intentional about that,  I think is of value for this council and this community.  I think those are healthy conversations.  Again, not saying anything against our staff.  We have great staff.  Don't want to lose anyone, not a single one of our staff,  but at least having those conversations  is an appropriate thing for us.  That's what we have to do.  Yeah, my suggestion here is not at all  to impugn the staff in any way  or the way that they've gone about doing their jobs.  That's not the question.  The question is, is there a different way  to accomplish what we're accomplishing  more cost-effectively?  But this CalPERS unfunded liability,  I think Congress, I mean, sorry,  Councilperson Goldstein, you know,  what's the risk to the city?  Well, cities have already gone bankrupt  because they couldn't fund this stuff.  I'm thinking Vallejo and, was it Richmond?  Anyway, there were two California cities  that got bankrupt, and it all has to do,  it stabilized the last couple of years  because the stock market's done well,  but if the stock market has a correction,  which it's due to have,  it all gets dumped on the city,  so that number could go from 180 to 250 easily.  It barriers.  Do you have a motion?  Do you want to make a motion?  Or what do you want to do?  Yeah, I would like to make a motion  to have the city staff look at ways,  and I'd like to focus this,  so the non-public safety departments  look at opportunities to outsource their,  their, the functions,  the services that they perform,  if it'  s cost effective and it doesn'  t compromise the quality of the  services.  question, why are you excluding  public safety?  because it has a whole different  set of dynamics, I don'  t think  anybody wants to outsource police  work, or fire.  So it has a different set of dynamics,  doesn'  t mean they can'  t do some things by, they can'  t outsource some things, maintenance of police cars, for example.  Yeah, I was just thinking, I think it'  going to have to do something, there'  s functions.  Yeah, but I think instead of saying let'  s have everybody in the city do, let'  s focus it, and I'  m thinking specifically on public works, both engineering and more  importantly operations and maintenance, because that'  s the really labor intensive, you'  ve got a $33 million budget, your labor number is, direct labor number is $14 million, and maybe community development. But let'  s focus on that, and then, because there'  re two separate buckets, the  CalPERS is divided into two separate buckets.  Okay, I have a facetious question.  Do you want them to consider hiring a consultant for the report?  I don'  t think we need to do that yet.  But, you know, I mean, the advantage of consultants is they see what other cities have done, and if it works or not.  But I think I would like to have the staff look at it first before we start burning money on a consultant.  And Tom, do you want this to be a  Do you want this to come back during budget?  Before?  What'  e your thought on that?  Well, I think we should have a recommendation far enough in advance of the budget cycle so that that can be incorporated into the budget.  So maybe deliver those recommendations in the March-April time frame.  But we do want to give, and I appreciate you saying that, we do want to give staff time to really look at this and do a  Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, I want to give them enough time to look at it deliberately and carefully, but make it short enough so that  We have a number of things to look at.  And we have some time to, yes, I got that.  And we have some time to incorporate this, if they come back on anything that makes sense, into the budget.  All right.  So we got a motion.  Do we have a second?  I'll second that.  Okay.  Okay.  Councilmember Goldstein?  No.  Councilmember Holley?  Again, I hear you.  I care about our UAL as well.  But everything I've heard thus far has indicated we'd be directing staff to do something they already do every year all the time.  So no.  Councilmember O'Brien?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  It carries 4-3.  Okay.  We have nothing posted.  After the agenda, reports of communications, no action.  Can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda.  City Manager, report?  Nothing further.  Nothing further.  All right.  Councilmember requests, according to APMP 1010, councilmembers may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting.  After stating what the item would be, a majority vote of council is needed in order for staff to agendize.  Do we have any councilmember requests?  No.  All right.  We will adjourn to closed session meeting on Tuesday, November 18th.  It says at 5 or 5.30.  But I'm going to ad lib and close session.  I will just say that I have the input that it could be as early as 3 or 4.  So closed session will be early next time.  We just don't know exactly what time.  Followed by the regular council meeting at 6 p.m.  in the council chambers right here at 421 Main Street Chico.  Have a good night.  You can't wait it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it  Thank you.
