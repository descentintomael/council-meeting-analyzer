 Thank you.  Okay, we are going to call the Planning Commission meeting of Thursday, November 18th to order, and we will start with the pledge.  Salute and pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  And roll call, please, Madam Clerk.  Commissioner Wall.  Here.  Commissioner Poulin.  Here.  Commissioner Goldstein.  Here.  Sorry if that wasn't loud enough.  Here.  Commissioner Daramidi.  Present.  Commissioner Cooper.  Here.  Vice Chair Ober.  Here.  Chair Scott.  Present.  Thank you.  Item 2, Consent Agenda.  It says none on here, but we actually do have approval of minutes of the regular meeting of November 4th, and those were included in our packet.  So I would entertain a motion to approve the Consent Agenda.  So moved.  Thank you, Commissioner Poulin.  I'll second.  Thank you, Vice Chair Ober.  And so we have a first and a second to approve the Consent Agenda.  All in favor, signify by saying aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  So the motion to approve the Consent Agenda passes 7-0.  Item 3, Business from the Floor.  For anybody who is a regular of Planning Commission meetings, usually we're not using speaker cards, but with the audience that we have today, we will be using those.  Correct?  Yes.  So they are in the back.  Business from the Floor is for any item.  That is not already listed on the agenda.  So do we have any business from the floor?  Anybody who didn't get a speaker card in on business from the floor who wishes to speak?  Okay.  Thank you.  So we will move to Item 4, Public Hearings.  Before we do that, I don't want to steal all your thunder.  Do you want to go first, actually, or do you want me to kind of set the stage?  Okay.  At your will.  Okay.  I will probably, I'll wrap up after Mike, but I do want to let you guys know a little bit of the context for tonight and just set the stage for what this will look like.  So first off, I want to thank everybody for being here.  We usually don't have as many lovely faces at our Planning Commission meetings.  And we are all here as public.  We are all public servants who love planning and love the public.  So appreciate you being here to join us.  Tonight is different than a normal Planning Commission meeting because we will not be making any decisions.  So we are simply convening a hearing to collect public comment.  With that in mind, my colleagues up here are not only encouraged,  but I would ask you to...  Almost as a requirement, we are not to be sharing our comments on any particular comments that are coming from the public.  But we are just here to listen.  The Talented City staff are collecting all of the comments and then there will be a formal response.  So our job here is to really serve as a listening audience.  With that, and I apologize if you're used to interacting with us a little bit more,  but we will not be commenting or having any response on your comments.  And I know that can be a little disappointing, especially when you're taking your time to come out.  But that is not the format of this meeting.  And we will certainly look forward to having you here if we do hear this at a full hearing to make a decision.  And we'll be able to address those comments at that time.  In addition to, the city staff will formally address every single comment.  Thank you.  And we will also be addressing every single comment that is heard here tonight.  And every single comment that is submitted by the December 13th timeline.  One other thing, there are no points for having multiple comments on the same subject.  If you just submit one, if somebody has already said something that is a comment that,  on a point that has already been heard, that comment will be addressed.  So it's not like if there were 10 comments that we needed to do this one.  It's one thing that it's going to be heard in a louder volume.  All of the comments will be addressed.  So really, this is looking at the environmental impacts.  If this project would be approved, there is no approval happening tonight.  There's no decision on that happening tonight.  And we are just here really to give you the space to share your thoughts on the environmental document.  So with that, again, just a reminder.  We do have speaker cards.  We have speaker cards in the back.  So by the time we have the presentation wrapped up, we would hope we would have those comments in and we can go.  Thank you, Principal Planner Solley.  The stage is yours.  Thank you, Chair Scott.  That was excellent.  So I will try to fill in additional information.  Tonight we have a little outline for the presentation.  We're going to start with an overview of the specific plan.  Then I'll talk about the draft EIR.  And then I'll conclude with some comments that kind of overlap with what we've been doing.  And then I'll talk about what Chair Scott was just saying.  So the specific plan looks like this.  It has the spiral bound or you can also access it online on the city's website.  It's down below the EIR on the website because it came out first a couple months ago.  And it starts, the main aspect of it is this land use plan that shows how the different areas of the site would be coded for different types of development.  There's about 670 acres of residential, different types of residential land.  Most of it is low density residential.  56 acres of commercial and office, mostly down near the skyway where there's envisioned to be a village core and village commercial and complimentary uses around that.  That's also where the higher density land uses would be.  There's also a school, 19 acres down there near the village core.  And then there's a lot of open space between all of the planning areas.  And I'll explain why that is as well as against the eastern edge of the site.  And the lower, the southeast corner of the site where Comanche Creek comes out of the hills.  The project site is located at the southeast corner of town between the end of 20th Street and the skyway.  And then there's also about 40 acres of right of way and that kind of fills out the acreage.  The specific plan implements a specific planning area, a special planning area I should say, of the general plan.  It's called the Dough Mill Honey Run Special Planning Area, SPA 5 in the general plan.  And the specific plan includes the land use plan that I just went over as well as a bunch of policies, regulations, and addresses certain areas of special concern like development in the foothills and wildfire concerns.  It tries to do its best to mitigate impacts through its own design.  So to try to make as few issues to talk about in the EIR as possible.  And I have a little bit more on that in a minute.  Here's the general plan land use diagram.  And the special planning area 5 is down here at the southeast corner of town like I said.  And the whole diagram when you look at it kind of explains how Chico or shows that Chico didn't really follow this concentric ring development pattern that is typical of a lot of cities that don't have constraints.  It notably has a really hard edge or tries to have a hard edge.  It's an ever hardening edge along the western boundary which is represented by the green line that's been in place for about 40 years.  And in order to really hold that green line, the special planning areas on this diagram adopted at the last general plan update in 2011 show that their special planning areas tend to be along the freeway, north and south along the freeway, and the east side of the city like this special planning area.  You might notice that there's a little bit of coding.  I'm sorry.  I don't know if you can see it.  But it shows its own diagram for a conceptual land use plan that was envisioned there.  And that's just a placeholder waiting for a real plan to show up, a real plan that studies the site and is responsive to what you find on the site.  And then the general plan language will say that when we look at this area in detail, we need to address the circulation concerns because it only has two ways in and out along 20th Street and Skyway.  And then it's a little bit more detailed.  If we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then we're trying to capture a beautiful image, then  campfire. Some of it was backburned, but it also was just campfire coming down out of the hills.  So that was the general plans placeholder concept. And one thing I'll just point out,  because it'll feature prominently in a minute, is this low density residential right here,  just south of the Belvedere subdivision. That low density right there is a dead giveaway that  we didn't take a really close look at this site when we're putting down these conceptual  land use patterns. Because when you look at the proposed land use plan,  this slide is intended to show how the land use plan responds to the project site.  So if you notice, there are ribbons of trees going through there. Some of those trees are  along creeks. Some of those trees are along cliffs, little escarpments that are very in height.  And then down below here, where I pointed out that R1 area, that's a floodplain. There's R  1.  There's never going to be R1 there because there's a creek coming out of the hills right  there. And that's the area to avoid. So the land use plan is going to come on here in a second.  And it shows how most of the land uses are proposed in the areas that are mostly grassland and  largely untreated. If you want to do that one more time, you'll see how it  populates those kind of open spaces between the stands of trees, which represent the  creek.  And the steeper areas of the site.  So that people could see what this slide shows. We're just doing the north half of the site.  There's a whole southern half of the site that goes down to Honey Run Road.  To do it a different way, we can turn on the open space layer and see where the open space  would remain. And that should cover up our floodplain area down below and as well as  most of these tree areas. So when we got that specific plan, we did a completeness review.  We beat it up a little bit with the applicant, and then we finally launched into the city's process,  which is reviewing it, getting comments, and preparing an EIR. It is required that we do that.  So, moving on to this part of the presentation, EIR looks like this. It is a bigger document, it has a lot  of different areas that it touches upon, and we're here tonight to receive comments on this EIR  document, not the specific plan document. It is required by the California Environmental Quality Act, as is a  Act, which we shorthand say CEQA, and EIRs is Environmental Impact Report. It's the highest  level of CEQA review required by the law. And the city is the lead agency. So we also get comments  from responsible agencies and trustee agencies, and those are other state and federal, well,  state departments that also either have a permit to issue for a project like this or  are responsible for the Fish and Wildlife, for instance, is a trustee agency in charge of fish  and wildlife. So the application process looks like this on the left-hand side. And to kind of  explain more about the environmental review process, there's the step where we prepare the  EIR. That's been done. Now we're in the 45-day comment period. And then after that, we prepare  responses to all the comments, and then we've released a final EIR.  And that's released before we head to the public hearings to actually consider the  project, the specific plan portion. The draft EIR concludes that there are significant and  unavoidable impacts associated with aesthetics. There are no houses or development up on that  hill right now, and everybody can see it. And if the project were to be approved  and built, you would see development up there, and that would be a significant, unavoidable,  irreversible impact. It also identifies greenhouse gas emissions,  and that would be a significant, unavoidable impact. And there's various reasons for that,  but I encourage you to read the EIR and come to your own conclusions on how we got there.  It includes mitigation that then reduces impacts to less than significant in several areas. I won't  read them all off, but there's a section in this document for each one of those areas,  and a lot of those also have an accompanying appendice that has in-depth, detailed,  technical information about supporting that analysis.  So if there is an appendice, that means we had an expert prepare a lot of more detail on that  particular aspect of the project. One thing that isn't even required to have mitigation in this EIR  is it says that hydrology and water quality is handled not only through the project design,  but also through existing regulations that will come to bear later. If the project's approved and  we see subdivisions, there's subdivision improvement standards, and there's a lot of  demonstration that they have to make to the engineering department that the stormwater is  handled on site before it's discharged off-site. However, that might surprise some people,  especially people who live in Belvedere Heights, because as many will recall, that subdivision  flooded several years ago. I think it was about 2014, but forgive me if I'm wrong. We definitely  know about that issue heading into this project, and this is from the hydrology study, which is  also one of the appendices.  And most of that came from the applicant, because we're asking them, what's your plan here? What's the plan?  And we got it. So if we can draw everybody's attention to the Belvedere subdivision, which is right here  in this little corner, this little jog that the project makes, there's two waterways that I want to  highlight here. This is a little one that comes down the hill. However, it's very flashy, because  the soils out here are very poor, very shallow. That means when it rains, the water comes off the hill  really quick.  And then there's a larger one to the south, and that floods a little bit more down at the bottom.  But that little one, reach one, we'll call it, goes through the subdivision. And there's a 42-inch  culvert that goes through the subdivision and discharges back into where it always used to go.  And that 42-inch culvert wasn't enough, and that flood that I mentioned overwhelmed that system.  So what they did, what the city did, is we had a 56-inch  culverts put in, that bypassed it, and it goes around that jog, and adds additional  web for that water to get off that site. And those two pipes comprise enough storm water  to handling, to handle the 100-year flood. So, what is the project gonna do?  The project had a different type of hydrological analysis, and it, because there is a larger watershed, that go further up the hill,  the amount of rain that it plans for for this project, Comanche Creek goes way up the hill,  almost to Paradise, so, not to Paradise, but it goes way up the hill.  The hydrological report for this project assumed greater rainfall than the bypass around Belvedere did.  That's why this study says that those two pipes aren't enough to handle the 100-year storm.  So we actually have two different conclusions, but this handles that anyway.  So it overestimates, perhaps, the Reach 1, because the Reach 1 doesn't really go up that high.  And what it does is it proposes a solution where part of this Reach 1, which is,  I don't know if you can make out this line that designates where its watershed catchment area is,  we would have pipes developed in the project that collect some water from that reach  that would otherwise flow down to our little pipe system down there in our bypass,  and it's going to transfer that water over.  So it's going to transfer that water over to the larger watershed here,  where a regional basin is proposed to basically back up and hold water that runs off the development  and deny some of the inputs that would otherwise go down toward Belvedere.  So that's just an example of how this project designs a stormwater solution  that minimizes potential impacts in the future to an existing subdivision,  and how it led to a conclusion of less than significant.  So that's a little bit of detail.  We went into this level of detail on all these different category areas that we've talked about,  and that's why the document is so large.  So tonight we're here to take public comments.  The public comment period runs all the way until December 13th, 5 p.m.,  so it's really optional whether anybody gives comments tonight.  If you haven't read the EIR, maybe it's premature to give comments,  because the comments that aren't informed by somebody reading the EIR often just ask for a result  and it's not a good thing to do.  and we're going to take a public comment period that is in the EIR,  and it makes responding to the comments not all that satisfying,  because we just point out the page where it's on there.  And it's comments that remain in the reader's mind after they've read the document  that are most helpful and impactful and actually gets more results.  Tonight's chore for us is to hold a public hearing,  and also we're accepting comments via email.  They're just as good written in an email as any other way.  And we're really here to collect public comments.  So without repeating a bunch of things that Chair Scott said,  we're not responding to comments tonight.  Those will come later when we prepare the final EIR.  After the close of the EIR comment period, the City will respond to all comments.  I just said that.  So then that final EIR will come out before we have the hearings,  which we anticipate to happen hopefully next spring.  Maybe next summer if it takes us that long.  Email comments are preferred, but we're still going to have the hearing tonight.  And as I stated, the comment period runs through December 13th at 5 p.m.  Some of the comments weren't emailed to me.  They were emailed to other staff.  So I just want to encourage commenters to email their comments to me.  I'm responsible for making sure that our hired consultant gets them  so that the responses to the comments can be prepared.  And that's it. That's my slideshow.  With that, I would encourage the Commission to hold the public hearing  and cycle through all the speakers so that we can get those comments.  Okay.  Does the Commission have any questions for Mike before he sits down?  No? Great. Thank you.  All right.  So just a couple more comments.  I do want to let you know tonight, one, I have the best colleagues  in the rest of the Commission here.  So just want to let you guys know they will help me in keeping the decorum  that we're hoping that we can have in this meeting.  We really see ourselves as stewards of the public process.  And we see you guys as holding that responsibility just as well.  And I say that because we will not have a time limit tonight.  So we are used to having that.  But there's no buzzer that is going to cut you off.  But I would continue to ask if a comment has already been made,  again, that you not make that comment.  If there's anything more specific or anything additional that you can add to that,  that would be great.  But if you are making a comment that is repeating another comment,  I will kindly ask you to sit down.  So that we can hear from the next speaker.  And that's not to be rude or that I don't appreciate you being here.  But it's really to protect the integrity of the public process  of what our purpose is tonight.  The other thing I would add, too, is really as Mike laid out  what that process looks like, the Planning Commission,  when we come to the point where we are making a decision on this project,  we want to have the highest level of accountability.  We want to have the highest and best quality information  that we have to make that decision.  And that's really your role here tonight,  is to say how adequate is this draft EIR in helping us make that decision.  And so anything that needs to be addressed,  anything that you see as a weakness,  anything that you see as a strength,  helps us when that final EIR comes out,  and we're making the final decision in spring or summer.  So that is what the comments will be focused on  and what we'll be looking for.  You can speak generally on topic ideas in the EIR.  But I'd also encourage that if you have a specific section,  a specific page number, that's really helpful to us, too.  And we can go to that and kind of jot that down.  So I think that's it.  Are you guys ready?  Okay.  And this is our first EIR hearing with this commission.  So I'm informing us a little bit more than I'm informing the public.  All right.  Let's start with our first speaker.  First speaker is Mallory Borrego.  Hello, everybody.  My name is Mallory Borrego.  I'm a senior at Chico State.  I'm also a student intern for the Community Legal Information Center  within the Environmental Advocates Department.  So with this specific draft EIR, I have been looking at it since about August,  and I've been able to look through a bunch of different sections  for things that I've been working on within my internship.  And I have found myself pleasantly surprised by the adequacy of the draft EIR.  I didn't expect as many topic areas to be encompassed,  despite it as I found.  Looking at specifically the amount of creek mileage  that's going to be preserved in open space,  keeping over 5,000 of the oak trees.  I feel like this draft EIR is adequate,  and I think it's very important to focus our efforts  on conservation and sustainability within development,  because I don't believe it's avoidable at this point  with the housing crisis that Chico is facing.  So I'm here to say that I support the EIR,  I support the Valley's Edge Development Project,  and thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Next up is Susan Tshuti.  Good evening, commissioners.  Thank you for hearing me.  My name is Susan Tshuti.  I co-host Ecotopia on KZFR,  and I convene the Environmental Coalition of Butte County,  but I'm not a member of the Ecotopia Coalition.  I'm speaking just for myself.  The proposed Valley's Edge Development  in the eastern foothills superficially looks beautiful.  Parks, ponds, green spaces, and walking trails  amidst a huge neighborhood,  including apartments and housing for seniors.  However, I think this project is in the wrong time  and in the wrong place.  The draft, as Mike Solley already acknowledged,  the draft environmental...  impact report notes two impacts that are unmitigatable,  and one of them is huge.  One of them is maybe less of a concern to some people.  But the greenhouse gas emissions are unmitigatable.  Construction emissions, automobile travel into town,  it's a reach,  and this pristine riparian woodland area  with its birds, reptiles, animals, and plants  will be slashed through with 2,000,  777 housing units  with an anticipated population of 5,654.  I think that the impact on natural resources  in the EIR is inadequate.  It's a huge wildlife area,  a huge ecosystem.  It has big value for our community.  The document...  Valley's Edge actually stands in contradiction  to a lot of Chico's  guiding principles and documents.  The current general plan,  which is what we're living with right now,  calls for infill and compact mixed-use development.  The urban...  This is to quote from what Mike Solley already told us.  The urban form...  Oh, no, sorry.  This is from the general plan.  The urban form is compact with a clear distinction  between the city and its surrounding lands.  We call this an opportunity site,  but it's a reach to have it where it is.  This is a 1,448-acre project,  which is the opposite of compact urban form.  It is urban sprawl.  The Climate Action Plan,  approved by the city council just a few weeks ago,  calls for zero net emissions by 2045.  And according to the draft EIR,  the proposed project would result  in GHG emissions of approximately 3.13 megatons  of CO2 emissions per capita,  and thus the proposed projects...  And the proposed project's estimated GHG emissions  would exceed the 2030 efficiency target  of 2.76 megatons of CO2 emissions per capita per year.  And so this is taking us in exactly the wrong direction.  We're not...  We're trying to reduce emissions,  and this will increase emissions.  And finally,  maybe not so much to the point of the draft EIR,  but I think a really significant thing  that we have to look about  is that the city council will soon approve  the housing element update,  which emphasizes the need for affordable housing.  This project is intended for those  who can afford HOA dues and costly amenities.  According to every measure I have seen,  Chico needs housing for its low-income residents,  and the Valley's Edge development,  with its beautiful garden of even vision,  is not meant for those in need,  but for those with deep pockets.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Our next speaker,  and maybe just to prepare the speaker after that, too,  if you have that up.  Jake Morlone.  Jake Morley and Erica Spangler.  Welcome, Mr. Morley.  Hey, how's it going?  Long time no see.  Yeah, I'm around.  Jake Morley.  I've been in development land use for almost 20 years.  I'd just like to submit to the record Appendix C  from the general plan that talks about this growth area  and how the project itself,  the specific plan and over 700 pages of it,  expands upon this small page of the general plan.  It's a fantastic project.  That means a lot of the lion's share of general plan policy goals  and action items that are in the 2030 general plan.  It's a fantastic property.  It's a wonderful project in a post-COVID world  where the outdoor space is even more important than before,  and the adequacy of the EIR is definitely on point  with thousands of pages of expert opinions  on every item you can think of  between greenhouse gas and aesthetics.  So, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Robin.  Bangler and I lead our digital product and UX teams for a home improvement company locally  that has a lot of remote associates that are always looking for housing. And I've lived in  Chico for 16 years. I came here for Chico State to be a student and I had the luxury of being able  to stay here, find housing and build my career. Chico has a very special place in my heart and  my significant others. We get to balance our work lives, build our careers and enjoy the fun of the  community and the fun of our outdoor spaces. I am very pleasantly excited about Valley's Edge  because of all the open space and the fact that the open space has been instrumental into the  design. It provides smart growth and a bigger vision for our future. It's something that really  embodies this post-COVID world as we just heard. As we're building our careers, we work in office  environments, we work from home and we get to enjoy the outdoors more than ever and the  building of our home is a great way to enjoy the outdoors. We get to enjoy the outdoors more  than ever and the building of our home is a great way to enjoy the outdoors more than ever and the  design of a development is really exciting. Roughly half of the total land space is going to be  designate for parks and undeveloped open space and public uses. And that's very rare for a lot of  development areas which are more for housing and we need a lot more housing as well. So having that  balance of open space and enjoying the outdoors and really embodying the Chico area is something  that I support. Thank you.  Thank you. And our next two speakers.  Brent Sulberbauer followed by Noah Zopi.  Hi. My name is Brent Sulberbauer. I used to live on 20th Street just to the north of the project and I walked on Potter Road. It's a bike trail. It's just a true  just to the west of the project multiple times a week,  probably more than just about anyone here today.  That's how I used to relieve stress.  So I'm really familiar with the natural boots on the ground,  kind of looking at the land.  And I just want to say I gave it just a real two thumbs up  as far as environmental concerns that are addressed in draft DIR.  I really like the way they paid attention to where all the trees were,  reserving the trees, those ribbons of trees.  The hydrology study, I have seen where that has flooded in the past  and the way they mitigated for that or planned ahead for that,  I thought was really smart.  And in addition to that, I just feel like it's a really well-designed,  aesthetically pleasing project.  My day job is I'm a real estate agent by trade.  And it is really tough for me to see when I go to list a house,  we'll price it at a good, you know, fair market price.  And we get so many offers in that these houses are going $50,000, $60,000  over the asking price.  I just had one this week.  And I'm the guy, I'm happy for the sellers,  but I'm the guy who has to go to all these different families  and tell them you didn't get the house.  You didn't get the house.  You didn't get the house.  I had to talk to teachers, firefighters, coffee shop owners this week  telling them bad news that there's not enough housing for you and your family  to live in this neighborhood.  I'm sorry.  And the reason is because the house that I listed this week  was the only one in the neighborhood that had four bedrooms.  It was the only option for many people.  It's a severe housing shortage.  We lost over 20,000 housing units in the campfire.  We all know about that.  And we've built, we haven't built even a percent,  like a very good percentage of that, maybe a thousand.  I don't know how many houses we've built in Chico in the last three years,  but it's a very small amount.  We need large projects like this with thousands of housing units  to supply the demand that we've already lost years past.  We don't need, infill is great.  ADUs are great.  Everything's multifamily, subsidized housing.  But the large projects is what we really need.  And we need like five of them, in my opinion.  Just from doing open houses and seeing the desperation of the families  that are living in our community that have no place to move into.  I also just want to say we need housing at every single level,  from small little cottages like the Valley's Edge proposes  to...  to...  to larger luxury homes.  And the reason is because the high-income earners  are going to want those large luxury homes.  If we don't provide those luxury homes for them,  they're going to buy the middle-class houses.  And if they buy the middle-class houses,  and the middle-class houses buy the starter homes,  and they buy the starter homes,  they know where the renters go.  If renters have a place to move up,  there's nowhere for homeless and other  at the lowest, most vulnerable places of our society to be.  Housing at all levels definitely helps our community.  It's something that's absolutely necessary.  The CO2 emissions are a natural thing.  that has to happen to build a house.  You have to have a tractor, you know,  plow up some ground, lay a foundation,  and build a house.  CO2 emissions are a necessary part of that.  We can't get to more housing  without releasing CO2 emissions.  It's just a cost that you have to pay.  We are a community of people  who just are in desperate need of houses,  and the prices are going way too high,  and there's no supply to fill that gap.  And until we do so,  prices are going to continue to rise  as demand stays constant.  So that's my thoughts.  If I give it a two thumbs up,  and if we have any more of these special planning areas  we can fast track, I'd appreciate that.  Thanks so much.  Thank you.  Next after Noah will be Jim Stevens.  Hello. Good evening.  My name is Noah Zoppe.  I'm a young real estate entrepreneur  here in Chico, California.  I'm speaking here tonight to advocate  for the Valley Edge Project.  Before I speak specifically on the project,  I want to tell a quick story.  Back in the early 2000s,  before the Marina Del Rey development existed,  the land it sits on  was the last oceanfront site in Los Angeles.  In turn, this created a lot of backlash  from the city and community,  sort of what we have here today.  What ended up happening was the project was approved.  And let me tell you why.  It was because the lead developer  cared about the environment.  He made it a point to go above and beyond  to preserve every aspect of the environment.  We are blessed to be in the same position today.  Valley's Edge and its team has worked so hard  to preserve as much as they can.  For example, out of the thousands of trees,  80% will be kept in their wild environments.  While the other 20% will be incorporated in parks,  community areas, community areas, and neighborhoods.  Also, I would like to take a direct quote from their website.  It reads,  Valley's Edge,  a place where life is lived outdoors.  So my question to you all is this.  Why would we pass up on an opportunity  to have a developer and his team  that is environmentally focused?  And I ask this only because  if this group isn't the group to develop this land,  it'll be the group that's going to be the one  that's going to be the one  that's going to be the one that's going to be someone else,  five years from now,  10 years from now,  or 15 years from now.  And maybe only the dollar speaks to those investors,  or those developers, sorry.  So I leave you here with this.  The grass isn't always greener on the other side.  Sometimes we have to make the best decision  we can with the options presented.  Thank you.  Next, after Jim Stevens,  will be David Welch.  Just a quick reminder, too,  that we have a lot of people  that are interested in this project.  Though Mr. Stevens is well aware.  But we're really looking for comments,  specific comments on the draft EIR.  It probably extended a little bit too much grace  on talking about the project specifically.  So if our future speakers could really  hone in their comments on the draft EIR,  that would be great.  And I know you will.  Thank you, Chair Scott.  I will be brief.  I don't have the expertise to comment.  I'm not a hydrologist.  I'm not a geologist, a biologist,  an air quality expert,  or a geologist, traffic engineer,  which are the major concerns.  But I want to go look at the economic  or the environmental impact from 10,000 feet.  First of all,  Valley's Edge project is implementing the general plan.  I happen to be on the task force  when we put the general plan together back in 2010 and 11.  And this was determined to be a planning area,  a special planning area for future growth.  Okay. Fast forward.  11 years and here we are.  Secondly, it has a very light footprint on the environment.  It has been mentioned there's 26, 2700 units on 1450 acres.  That's just a hair over two units per acre,  which is probably the smallest development  that you guys have seen in quite a while.  Other than the gated communities.  And thirdly,  with respect to the greenhouse gas,  which is a significant unavoidable impact.  The concern that I have for this  and for virtually any project in Chico  is that has been mentioned,  we have such a significant crisis here  that if we don't provide local housing across the range,  of course,  but if we don't provide local housing,  we still are going to provide,  Chico is going to be the employment center  for the North State in 50 miles.  Okay.  And so if people cannot find a house here  or cannot afford a house here,  then they're going to look at Orland, Ridley,  Biggs, Orville, Red Bluff, Corning,  and then imagine the greenhouse gas contribution  if you're coming in from 35 miles instead of four or five.  So I think that's a very important characteristic  of this project that we have to keep in mind when analyzing.  And although it is significant and unavoidable,  it's a consideration that you guys  and the council are going to have to make when it's analyzed.  Thank you.  Next, after David is Jared Geiser.  Hello, David Welch from Chico.  I bring a somewhat unusual perspective  to the examination of EIR.  I'm very much a member of the senior demographic  and I'm also a lifelong cyclist  having ridden for transportation and sport for more  than 50 years and I'm nationally certified  to teach safe cycling.  And I have a longstanding familiarity  with the topography of the site.  Looking at the EIR through that lens,  I see a lot of conflict between what my experience tells me  and what the EIR visualizes as the role  of active transportation in reducing vehicle miles traveled  and mitigating the traffic and climate impacts of the project.  The combination of the large physical size of the project,  the very low density housing in most of the project area,  the concentration of commercial at one corner,  and the steep terrain of most of the project tell me  that the bike paths touted as an important part  of the transportation mix will be used recreationally  by a few sports cyclists by myself,  but will likely play almost no role  in the actual transportation mix in the project.  Neither typical seniors nor young parents  with children in tow are gonna climb those hills,  coming home from commercial services  or employment sites within or beyond the project area.  At the same time, the increases in auto traffic  on surrounding major roads, such as 20th Street,  as a result of the project, will actually work  to discourage the use of active transportation  by residents of nearby areas that are better suited for it,  like Merion Park.  On a broader scale, the comparison used in the EIR  for assessing the significance of vehicle miles traveled  is a very dubious one.  It's not at all clear what area was used  as a regional standard.  It's a big area, but the population numbers tell us  it was bigger than all of Butte County,  and it had to include a lot of rural areas  where people drive long distances by necessity.  So a comparison to the city of Chico  or another similar urban area,  if the numbers aren't available for Chico,  would be a much more valid standard for vehicle miles traveled.  I'd also say that the assumption  that the senior portion of the project population  drives substantially less than a younger working population  is probably outdated and erroneous for this population.  Not only is retirement age steadily rising,  but there's good evidence that high-income seniors,  the kind that will live in a high-cost project like this,  generate high levels of vehicle miles traveled  for leisure and other pursuits, even in retirement.  Finally, the EIR discusses at length the various activities  located within a rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rickety rick  whether they will be. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you for reading the EIR  and thank you for keeping your comments  germane to that.  Next is Jared  and then Caitlin Delby.  Alright.  Good evening Planning Commission.  Thank you for giving us the opportunity to comment  on this draft EIR.  I have spent countless  hours reviewing it, more than I ever thought  I would spend reviewing a public document. It's been a lot  of fun, I'll be honest.  I'll give you a brief summary of my background.  I  got a degree in geography and  planning at Chico State, so I have a pretty high  level understanding of land use planning and current  issues with it, as well as  natural resource management here locally,  working with faculty from all  departments, including biologists and geologists.  I've learned a lot about the way the landscape  is around here.  Professionally, I work as a conservation planner  and so I have a fair amount of knowledge  on conservation from that perspective.  And so I would like to explain to you all  some of the things in the EIR that I think  need to be given more consideration.  Principally, this term really irritated me when I read it,  was mixed use.  The EIR describes this development as mixed use  when it's not mixed use.  I don't think that falls in line with the City of Chico's  definition of mixed use that I read in the general plan.  And I don't think it falls in line with any  reasonable person's definition of mixed use,  which is clearly inferring the mix of uses.  Whereas the Valley's Edge draft specific plan EIR  clearly shows that the uses will not be mixed,  they will be separated.  Commercial will be down low,  residential will be up high.  Mixed use development is something I learned  about in school, particularly when we were  studying smart growth in my land use planning class.  And the whole concept behind smart growth is that in order  to avert,  environmental issues, climate issues,  issues of automobile dependency,  we need to grow in a smart way,  infill compact urban development,  so people can walk and bike to where they need to go.  And mixed use is a heavy component of that.  So this entails having commercial on the bottom,  residential on top, is a common example of mixed use.  And the value of that is that you have people right next to  you in immediate proximity,  to commercial uses.  So it's going to be boosting economics,  as well as promoting walkability,  as well as promoting safety,  which is an often overlooked thing in our community.  When you have these single use developments like the Valley's  Edge specific plan DEIR goes over,  you have low density residential homes where people are mostly  going to be inside their homes throughout the day  and through the nighttime.  But when you when you really do smart growth of having  mixed use development,  there's going to be more activity on the streets,  and there's going to be more eyes on the streets,  more people looking at what's going on.  So that's the mixed use is highly valuable.  And I think the draft EIR misuses that term.  I'd also like to address the specific sections.  So in college, I spent an extensive time studying climate change.  I've done research on climate change impacts to Chico,  to Chico State, and won awards for some of that research,  presented at conferences on that research.  And something that was really shocking to me when I was going over,  is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is  how this project's land use change will exacerbate climate change.  And it indubitably will, because as I mentioned, I'm a conservation planner  and particularly working with agricultural operations.  And soil is a major carbon pool on this planet.  And by converting soil that is capturing carbon through the photosynthesis of the grassland plants and the trees,  by converting that soil that holds carbon into asphalt, into roads, into houses,  into parking lots, into parking spaces for cars,  you reduce the photosynthetic capacity of the landscape.  So the landscape can't use photosynthesis to capture carbon how it used to.  So you're reducing carbon capture from this development,  but also causing carbon emissions directly from the grading of the landscape.  And so I thought I would acknowledge that,  as well as go over some of the climate impacts to Chico,  because I was kind of troubled to hear people say, yeah, carbon, carbon, greenhouse gases,  but...  We need housing. We need housing.  It's shocking to me that the significant unavoidable greenhouse gas impacts  could be overlooked because the climate impacts in this area are severe.  And they're acknowledged in the EIR on page 4.7-5.  So principally to the Sacramento Valley, we're looking at continued warming.  Average temperatures, average maximum temperatures could increase up to 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit.  And again, this is on page 4.7-5.  So those 114 days we've had this summer, imagine 124.  We're talking about extreme heat that will kill people.  Extreme heat is a public health issue.  And you don't need to go very far besides the very next page of the EIR to get confirmation of that.  Page 4.7-6.  They're talking about the regulatory setting of the greenhouse gas emissions relating to this EIR.  And the very first one on page 4.7-6,  is Massachusetts versus the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  And the findings of this court hearing were that the elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases,  and then they mentioned the greenhouse gases,  in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.  This is referred to as the endangerment finding.  And the next bullet point shows that the combined emissions of GHGs from new motor vehicles  and new motor vehicle engines contribute to GHG air pollution  that endangers public health and welfare.  And so this is referred to as the cause of contribute finding.  And so we're talking about the most severe crisis that humanity has ever faced.  That we really don't understand how we're going to mitigate this to any level of ensuring a decent life on this planet by the end of the century.  We're faced with this crisis and this EIR acknowledges the contributions of greenhouse gases.  And I think despite the fact that it's significant and unavoidable,  I still will argue that the threshold of significance is inadequate.  Because the threshold of significance that they use for this is the 2030 targets of the Chico Climate Action Plan update.  But the project will not become operational according to the EIR until 2045.  So if the project is not going to be operational until 2045,  then the operational emissions of the project need to be weighed against the threshold of significance of the 2045 Chico Climate Action Plan goals.  Which is zero metric tons of CO2 per year.  And that's the CO2 equivalent emitted per person per day in the whole city.  And that is also acknowledged in the EIR.  And so something that I found really interesting was the CARB's California Air Resources Board Climate Change Scoping Plan.  Required by them to create by AB 32.  Something I really found that I wanted to note to the Planning Commission in particular was a section that says,  and I'll quote,  the Scoping Plan identified local governments as essential partners in achieving California's goals to reduce GHG emissions because they have broad influence.  And in some cases,  exclusive authority over activities that contribute to significant direct and indirect GHG emissions through their planning and permitting processes.  So some of this stuff, principally large land use changes that are being proposed that would exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions.  This body and this city through the council and the other entities of the city are the only ones that can impact this.  You are the only ones.  The state can set these goals to say, hey, we want to limit warming, we want to reduce emissions.  But these planning and permitting processes have such an impact.  On climate change.  And the state is really relying on you to hold true to the goals set forth by the city of Chico and the state of California to protect us.  Not protect some far off generations.  Protect us alive now.  Protect us who are going to be on this planet in 10 years and 15 years.  And protect those that will come after us.  Let's see.  Something else worth noting.  It's Executive Order B55-18.  Statewide policy for achieving carbon neutrality.  No later than 2045.  This project will obstruct the attainment of this policy.  And that language is important.  Because on a previous page in the EIR, on 4.7-10, it's talking about project consistency.  A project needs to be consistent with these statutes and regulations.  And in the very last sentence before the first executive order on 4.7-10, it shows that a project would be consistent if it furthers the objectives and does not obstruct their attainment.  This project, as identified from the significant and unavoidable impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, will obstruct the attainment of this executive order, B55-18.  And that's not acknowledged in the EIR.  And I think that needs to be.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's go on to wildfire.  So I think wildfire is an issue that really hits close to home for everyone.  After we've had major wildfires.  Please.  So we're putting our air quality for several weeks out of the summer and causing serious impacts to our neighbors and exacerbating other issues.  I don't believe that the mitigation measures proposed in the EIR, specifically W-fire-1, would reduce wildfire risks faced by future residents.  I think it does a good job at trying.  But I think it's, I will argue it's severely inadequate nonetheless.  Because future residents will still be exposed to wildfire hazards.  because of the location of the project site in the Cal Fire moderate fire severity zone.  All right, on to hydrology.  So I studied the hydrology section pretty in depth.  I told myself I wasn't going to, and then I started and I couldn't stop.  And although the EIR states that the hydrology of the project,  or that the project will not alter the hydrology in a way to negatively impact groundwater recharge,  they do not adequately justify that.  So they explained that the lahar flows that are relatively impermeable underlying the site,  and they explained that the cracks in the lahar flows are not large enough to contribute to significant recharge.  And, you know, they probably have some good case to make with that.  But they don't show where the lahar flows are in relation to the impermeable surfaces proposed to be developed.  So I find it unacceptable that they're saying,  there's a problem with the lahar flows,  not on the whole site, but on a majority.  They don't specify how much of a majority.  Is it 51%? Is it 99%?  It does not specify.  It doesn't specify where the groundwater recharge is occurring and where it's not occurring.  Other impacts to wetlands.  So this is actually in the biological resources section,  the wetland impacts on protected wetlands of the United States.  I don't think that,  that they really looked at the whole picture of the significant impacts.  And so what I mean by that is they said,  will there be adverse impacts to wetlands, protected wetlands?  And one of those includes hydrologic interruption.  And the EIR fails to acknowledge how the development will hydrologically interrupt the wetlands in the northwest corner of the site.  And it does not acknowledge how it will impact the wetlands further west of the site.  If you're r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r  site that are preserved because this species of metafoam is in danger of extinction.  And so that's something worth noting.  It also, the EIR fails to acknowledge how the vast development of residential housing  up above the wetland sites, and in one case, which appears to be on top of a spring or  groundwater seepage area, the EIR does not acknowledge how that will impact the water  flowing into the wetlands.  So it's considered primary open space, which prevents the development on top of the wetlands.  However, the wetland preserves are only going to be meaningful if they're hydrologically  connected to the land above them, because the water that drains into them is essential  for their functionality.  All right.  And then so on to the threat and danger species that are mentioned.  I was kind of appalled about the mitigation of species that involved directly removing  them from the site.  But beyond me being appalled, I think the EIR is inadequate.  I think the EIR is inadequate in a way, because it's a very complex topic, and it's a very  But it's a topic where it has the mitigations not reducing the take of their habitat, but  only reducing the take of the species.  And I'll use the Swainson's hawk as an example.  The EIR says that if there's Swainson's hawk observed nesting on the site, they won't grade,  destroy, and rip up their nests while there's young.  They will let the youngs mature, and then come in and grade and destroy all of their  foraging and nesting habitat.  And my understanding of the Endangered Species Act is not as high level as other topics,  but that's...  I believe that would constitute take of the habitat nonetheless, as you were taking their  habitat, which is prohibited.  All right.  So transportation.  I kept seeing in here that...  Actually, I won't cover that, I'm sure.  Someone else will.  I have too much to say.  I don't want to keep you all for too much longer.  But the last thing I will touch on is inconsistency with local documents, principally the City  of Chico General Plan, the City of Chico Climate Action Plan.  The Butte County 2016 Regional Transportation Plan, and the Sustainable Community Strategy  created by BCAG.  And we'll start with those.  So for the General Plan Sustainability Element, it mentions how protecting public health,  emphasize the importance of public health and land use planning, infrastructure planning,  and implementing city policies and programs.  And the EIR claims consistency with this, yet it does not acknowledge how its significant  and unavoidable impact to climate change will negatively impact the future of the city.  And the EIR says, consistent.  It mentions that this is in the General Plan growth area, and the specific plan proposes  clustering development to maintain large areas of open space in the site.  Whereas that last part is true, they're not developing the whole 1,500 acres, it does  not relate to the compact urban form of the City of Chico.  This development is still a large, sprawling out development.  It's a development that will be automobile dependent, no doubt.  Especially when you're talking about senior citizens that are over 55 years old and have  a reduced ability to use active transportation, which is the transportation we need to mitigate  climate change.  And that relates back to smart growth, is having a compact urban form.  And the City of Chico acknowledges that.  That's why they have that plan, that this policy, or this goal, land use one, in the  General Plan, because they understand the importance of it.  Yet the EIR claims consistency despite the fact that that's false.  All right, so ensure sustainable land use patterns, policy LU 2.3 of the general plan.  Significant unavoidable impacts to greenhouse gas emissions is not sustainable.  In order to be sustainable, we must be able to continue to do the same thing indefinitely.  By using the finite resource of fossil fuels that's causing the climate change and exacerbate  several public health issues, it's not sustainable. Sustainable development would be something that  would not contribute significantly to climate change, that would not be dependent upon  non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels. All right, policy LU 2.5, protect areas with  known sensitive resources. For some reason, the EIR claims this is consistent, despite all the  known sensitive resources they acknowledge in the biological resources section. All right,  I mentioned complete neighborhoods, land use policy 3.1, direct growth into complete  neighborhoods with a land use policy 3.1.  The EIR claims that the EIR plan is consistent, and I will argue that it is not consistent,  and no one who's thinking reasonably could argue that this project is going to, quote,  reduce auto trips and support walking, biking, and transit use. The density is about four units  per acre, and as someone mentioned before tonight, once you actually include the whole land area,  it's closer to two units per acre, whereas California studies from their transportation  studies, as well as BCAG studies, mentioned that we need to have higher density for transit  to be effective. And reducing auto trips is not going to occur when you develop such a  large area with such long streets sprawling so high up into the foothills. Yeah, she said  if she goes into work, it's going to reduce VMT for some time, and this project will obstruct  the attainment of VMT reductions.  All right.  I don't want to keep you here all night, so I'll kind of just go over the sections of  the general plan that I argue are inconsistent. Policy CD 1.1, Action CD 1.1.1, Policy CD 2.1,  Action CD 2.1.1, Policy CD 2.4, Action CD 2.4.1, Goal CD 3.  All right.  Let's see. I guess I'll address the transportation plan now.  Nicole, can I ask you how many speakers we have after Mr. Beiser?  We have four left.  Four left.  Okay.  Four left?  Okay.  I'll wrap it up.  So the transportation plan calls for enhancing regional transit, mass transit, getting people  to place to place without cars with things like buses, trains, that kind of thing, and  this project is not going to do that by its layout and by its layout.  So we're going to have to do it by its location.  All right.  So that's the transportation plan.  And then the last thing I'll do is the climate action plan.  And so these are three elements, three measures of the cap that this project claims consistent  with, the EIR plans consistency with, but which clearly it is not.  Improve active transportation infrastructure to achieve greater than 6% bicycle mode share  by 2030 and 12% bicycle mode share by 2045.  This does not improve bicycle infrastructure.  This provides recreational biking opportunities for residents.  This is a great idea.  This does not improve bicycle infrastructure, active transportation infrastructure in the  city of Chico.  So the first measure, measure T1, is inconsistent with this project.  And the EIR needs to reflect that.  Measure T5 of the Chico Climate Action Plan, support implementation of the city's general  plan that promotes sustainable infill development and mixed-use development in new growth areas  to reduce VMT.  As I mentioned before and explained very lengthily, this is not mixed-use development and this  is clearly not infill development.  It is just surrounded by open space and grazing land.  Measure S1 of the Chico Climate Action Plan, increase carbon sequestration by increasing  the urban canopy at least 10% by 2030 through new green scaping programs.  And this claims consistency.  Project would incorporate a street tree program.  That's not what the measure is saying.  The measure S1 of the Chico Climate Action Plan is saying increase carbon sequestration.  This project plans consistency.  It will not increase carbon sequestration.  It will decrease carbon sequestration.  sequestration by destroying the grasslands present on the site and removing, I believe,  1,100 trees. Yes, they're going to plant more trees, but that's not going to increase carbon  sequestration. Carbon sequestration will be reduced indubitably. So to summarize what I just said,  as the draft EIR, this project outlines, the project is going to be inconsistent with the  Chico Climate Action Plan, the City of Chico General Plan, and the Butte County Regional  Transportation Plan. And the EIR needs to reflect on those components and ensure consistency with it.  All right, thank you for your time, and I look forward to furthering the City. Thank you.  You do have until December 13th to submit written comments, so if you want to keep reading through,  I know that Mike would really appreciate any comments that you continue to have on that.  So thank you. Great, will do. Caitlin is next, and then Maggie Scarpa.  Hi.  Welcome.  I'm Caitlin Dalby. I'm the Executive Director for Butte Environmental Council.  This is Isla. This is her first time.  Hi, Isla. Welcome.  Her patience is wearing thin.  I saw Bill here, and I do acknowledge that it's a really nice plan that's been thought out.  And we're not here to talk about the plan tonight. We're here to talk about the draft EIR.  So I'm going to...  I'm going to try to keep it short and sweet. All of these points will be succinctly summarized for you all,  and we'll send it with reference pages and all that good stuff.  So just the short talking points that we as Butte Environmental Council have on the draft EIR is that we would...  Actually, let me first start off by saying that BEC is not an organization that is against development or planning.  We want to see smart communities.  We want to see community growth with every citizen taken into account.  So I don't want you all to perceive me as some pitchfork environmentalist.  We want to be smart about the development of our community, just like you do.  We care about planning just as you said you do.  Okay.  So a few of the takeaways from our analysis of the draft EIR is that the report lacks an assessment of the impact of this development.  We'll have on the imbalance in...  Okay.  So the EIR is a project that is focused on the development of a new ecosystem for the !  And it's a project that is focused on the development of a new ecosystem for the!  Restoration and monitoring, including flooding, not just the 100 year flooding, which we are past that at this point.  We are now looking at 200, 500, 10,000 and 30,000 year flood events coming up in the next 50 years.  They also are very knowledgeable in wildfire and our wildfire regime and how hydrological changes can actually exacerbate our risk to wildfire. They also are very knowledgeable in wildfire and our wildfire regime and how hydrological changes can actually exacerbate our risk to wildfire. So that is one suggestion that we have is that the final EIR Duke does consult with the tribe.  So that is a big takeaway from our analysis.  So that is a big takeaway from our analysis.  She likes to talk when I'm talking too.  She likes to talk when I'm talking too.  We haven't learned that part yet, she is only 21 months old.  She is only 21 months old.  She is only 21 months old.  as the standard, not comparing transportation standards,  Butte County or beyond Butte County.  And actually David Welch already mentioned that.  The greenhouse gas impact needs to be reevaluated  with a more realistic assessment  of how much the expected demographics will be traveling.  So much of the plan area is for H55+.  The draft EIR is using a metric that is stating that,  the 55 year plus population,  population doesn't drive as much.  And yet their housing designation is up in the higher reaches  of the plan area.  And I think that everybody here probably agrees  that 55 years plus does drive just as much,  maybe more than some younger or some younger folks.  So that is an inadequacy that we see.  We're definitely losing our now guys.  I might just have to wrap this up to say that  we would like to see a fifth alternative  that is even greater density.  So with greater high dense zoning for housing,  pull those higher up in the hillside down  to create medium density living and really increase  those open spaces.  That can be used as regional park  and get the input from the tribe.  I do have more points and I will email them,  but thank you so much for hearing us today.  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  Yeah, thank you, Ayla.  Say bye.  Bye.  Maggie is next following Addison Winslow.  Hi, thank you for the opportunity to speak.  For a little bit of my background, I studied geography,  geography and planning as well as Chico State.  I did a climate planning fellowship under the city of Chico  and I'm currently a land use planner,  a county land use planner.  I will also stick mostly to the environmental impact issues  that I have found with concern.  Like many people, I have concerns with the,  I want to highlight the greenhouse gas emissions,  the significant and unavoidable impacts.  With the climate change impacts we are facing for the city of Chico,  increases in extreme heat,  increases in extreme oscillation of precipitation,  and increases in deadly and devastating wildfires.  For the health and safety of our communities,  we cannot approve a project with significant  and unavoidable impacts.  My second point to transportation and circulation,  the development will not be supportive of transit due to the  low density and sparks distribution of housing,  housing units, like many people have mentioned is 4.1 units per acre  to have feasible transit,  it needs to be around 14 to 21 dwelling units per acre.  With the project as planned, it will have significant impacts,  they do say they're mitigated,  but will fail to adequately provide access by transit.  For the health and safety of our communities,  vehicle miles traveled. I believe David has mentioned it, but the threshold area analyzed  is the whole county, which is inadequate. The threshold area analyzed needs to be the Chico  urban area. Our transit, transportation, and commute patterns are for Chico are different  than Megalia, and it takes into account both, like they both are viewed as equal.  Um, with the thresholds of significance, I know that the city does not have thresholds themselves.  It goes off the state, which is 15% of a reduction of vehicle miles traveled. We have a climate  action plan that does an updated one that was just adopted that does discuss transportation. So  it's important to have both of those in tandem, uh, with the targets. Um, going back one thing  to greenhouse gas emissions, we, we just had adopted a climate action plan,  I also see issues with the thresholds of the 2030 targets versus the 2045 targets when it will be in,  um, operational. Another thing that I, uh, found issue with is there is no analysis of population  and housing for, uh, an environmental impact report. There are many things that you can look  at for, um, issues and impacts. And that was one that I found missing. Um, one of the questions  in the appendix G checklist was that, um, will a project,  substantially induce, um, a pop population, this project or plan, actually, it's a specific plan,  um, is the allergic development and Chico in quite some time and will induce growth substantially  as such. The EIR is inadequate until this analysis is included. Um, one thing to hit on biological  resources. There are many threatened and endangered and sensitive species on this site. I won't go  into detail with all of them.  There's a lot. And then there's some that are of moderate, um, that will, that have been shown to be moderate.  I will include this in my written comments, but I wanted to speak to the burrowing owl, the Western pond,  uh, turtle, as well as the bats for the mitigation for the burrowing owl and the Western pond turtle.  Uh, they, um, it says that they will be either passively relocated or removed in the bat habitat may be  removed.  If this, um, ends up harming, harassing, pursuing, or capturing the species, this could be a take and take under the  endangered species act is prohibited. So that's really important to understand.  In short, the project needs to be more denser, um, get rid of equestrian ridge, which is this area way up above that has different,  it's, it's basically two separate, it's different projects and that will phasing will be first.  Um,  the project needs to be denser to allow transit for this to actually work for Chico.  And, um, we are growing.  We, we look different than we did before, but it's really important that we have areas of livability that everyone can access transit with for people who are 55 years old.  At some point they will not be able to drive and we want them to have equal access to the city, not just their little developed area.  Um, and with the density.  it will actually reduce vehicle miles traveled in reality as well as reduce the significance  of the greenhouse gas emissions. One other thing that I would like to see in the final EIR is a  more thorough and comprehensive protection for threatened and endangered species. And thank you.  Next is Addison followed by Joshua Pierce. So Joshua is our last speaker? Yes. Thank you.  Whenever I heard there was going to be no time limit, I was thinking like somebody's gonna say  what I was gonna say and I'm gonna have to like grab Jared's copy of the EIR and just come up here  and read some stuff out of it. I did review it but nobody really did. So my background for the last  several years I've been active as an environmental scientist. I've been working on a lot of research  on environmental protection and I've been working on a lot of research on environmental protection  and I've been working on a lot of research on environmental protection as an advocate for more  housing and better conditions for working in low-income tenants. I've also worked with a  number of local organizations providing shelter, supportive housing, and responding to the needs  of our unhoused community. I'm a member of the Environmental Council's Advocacy Committee and  one of the authors of our forthcoming review of the draft EIR. I'm a board member of the Northern  California Environmental Defense Center and I also grew up largely in Dome Hill just west of the  project area. So I want to get into some of the I'm saying like social and psychological effects  of this plan on this round.  So let's talk about some of the impacts of this plan on our community. Sort of like the aesthetics  but in a deeper sense. Like Dome Hill that I don't think they were addressed in the EIR. So to start  with from the perspective of our regional housing needs. The process for taking inventory of land  available for low-income housing to satisfy the state requirements is to count the capacity of  vacant sites owned for multi-family housing. The largest concentration of it, the land that we  account for is located right in southeast Chico primarily along largely along the eastern part of  Highway 32 and Bruce Road. Six out of seven of the pending subsidized affordable housing projects  in the city are also located within or immediately adjacent to Merriam Park. The current plan for  Valley's Edge includes just nine acres zoned medium high density, which would comprise,  given their estimations, about five percent of the project's total housing units. It's not helpful  for the dramatic imbalance in housing Chico's experiencing. And to the extent the project is  successful in attracting higher income buyers than exist in our area currently, it'll exacerbate  a geographical reflection of Chico's socioeconomic divide and further concentrate the placement of  workforce housing on the highway and a major arterial where those families will experience  the worst of the air quality impacts, the traffic noise, and the roadway danger that  all come with building low density housing on the periphery of an urban area.  From the custom houses overlooking Upper Park down through California,  Parkland, and Merriam Park, the project is a success. The project is a success. The project is  a success. The project is a success. The project is a success. The property in question tonight,  the homes blocking access to Bute and Comanche Creeks along Honey Run Road and the Bute Creek  Country Club, the area on the valley floor undergoing the largest expansion of working  class housing is being enclosed and hemmed in by restricted access developments in the foothills.  I didn't go to California Park when I grew up. I actually didn't even know there were lakes there  because you drive by Bruce Road, you just see this, like, sterile outer edge of them,  and I went to school at Marsh, but you just don't go up there. You're supposed to carry  ID when you walk around in California Park, and I don't know if that's the same intention for this  HOA. Similarly, Stillson Canyon is just not a part of the world for the average child  growing up in Chico, and we're to that extent impoverished of the natural endowment of our area.  So for generations, if this project were to go through, kids will share the same schools,  but some will have the freedom to explore in the foothills and others will not.  So the applicants have been promoting this development as Chico's largest conservation  effort since Bidwell Park, but if this plan is approved without any condition requiring public  access to the parks and the paths, it'll be more like the largest privatization effort  since the Mexican land grants. And one more thing I want to mention that didn't get mentioned,  a question Ridge Maggie did just bring up. It's located in the center of what's proposed as a  regional park with its own access from Honey Run Road. It also requires its own stormwater  treatment, requires its own, all the infrastructure entirely.  And  it's  I don't know why that project is included in with the rest of this. I think it deserves its own  environmental impact report or some kind of review because it's entirely separate, has separate  access, it's separate land use. And so it doesn't deserve to free ride on the merits of the rest of  the project, having some commercial, having a little bit more, being less remote from the  city of Chico where people will get the things that they depend on. And also I noticed an  inconsistent,  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  development agreement to that. Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker, Joshua Pierce.  Joshua, bring us home.  Thank you for your time and your patience today.  My name is Joshua Pierce. I'm a resident of South Chico.  I was also a builder in the Dome Hill neighborhood,  a neighborhood that was once mocked and panned for its narrow streetscapes,  its alleys, and East Coast style architecture.  15 years later, Dome Hill is now a cherished neighborhood in California  where the trees cross the street and create a canopy of shade.  Dome Hill created 350 more trees on the site than were there previously.  So I have to admit that while I will be providing written comments for the EIR,  I had to create some notes for myself after your comments about trying to be,  not about the specific plan, but the EIR.  What I would like to provide is,  some context to the EIR,  and then I'll get into the specific sections in my written comments.  My perspective here comes from a 25-year history in sustainable development,  renewable energy, urban planning, and climate change solutions.  I'm currently the executive vice president of a company  that focuses on low-income populations,  providing energy efficiency and decarbonization of the building stock  for vulnerable communities throughout California.  The first thing I'd like to say about,  and I'm very familiar with the specific plan.  In fact, two years ago,  for full transparency,  I was hired to help improve the sustainability components of the specific plan.  And that's why I'm proud to be a part of some of the improvements  that were made into the specific plan,  and therefore are a result of the EIR that we see today.  Some of the things that I'd like to talk about are less specific to the EIR  and actually limitations of the CEQA process  that we don't actually always see in reality.  One of those is that California is currently undergoing a massive decarbonization effort,  while over a year,  we've been seeing a number of billion dollars of funds from investment utilities,  and the federal government is going into decarbonizing our building stock  and decarbonizing transportation.  That is not taken into account in the EIR's calculations  of greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle miles traveled  and the impact of those vehicle miles traveled.  I think that's an important note.  What that means in all practicality is that 10 years from now,  when we're actually building these homes,  these homes will be all electric.  They will use heat pump technologies rather than natural gas,  and more and more people will be driving electric cars,  electric vehicles,  and used electric vehicles.  Those calculations are not considered in a way that reality will be in California  if we even come close to achieving our state goals.  There is a lot of talk about compact urban form and infill.  I won't talk specifically about that with respect to this development.  I do believe that infill is an important component of Smart Growth,  but it is not the entire solution,  reason being that infill generally does not create parks and open space,  It generally does not create or support intergenerational housing and uses the existing resources and existing infrastructure rather than creating new infrastructure.  A couple of other things you might not be aware of that may not be in the EIR but actually will impact the development itself are that because the soils are so poor, there was a lot of talk about carbon sequestration.  I'm very familiar with the site and I'm also familiar with carbon sequestration greenhouse gas calculations.  This site, when it is done and the development is happening, will actually increase the number of trees that are currently on site.  So there will be a net increase in the number of mature trees over a 15-year time horizon on the site due to the development and the requirements of street trees and also landscaping on individual lots.  Further, the site will, by necessity, tear up the lahar flows and the cemented cobble that exist on the site.  I know there's a more technical term for that.  What that does is that actually increases the surface area for potential infiltration.  That's a lot.  There's a lot of nuance around surface hydrology, but there's talk about surface hydrology.  I think it's worth mentioning here that there are additional riparian areas that will be created because of the development.  There are additional wetland areas, seasonal wetland areas due to the low-impact development aspects that are mentioned in the EIR around the roadways, especially the more rural roadways,  and that the actual trenching of infrastructure such as sewer lines and stormwater pipe will disrupt that lahar flow and actually create additional opportunities for infiltration.  In the surface hydrology.  I'm going to take you home now.  So, I'm breaking away from the EIR for a moment here, but this is my personal perspective.  That master planning is something that's very hard to do, and we are not very good at it in the city of Chico and generally in the north state.  It takes years to craft a community that is intentional.  That is why most of the development we've seen in Chico.  Small plot subdivisions generally built on verdant soils.  Valley's Edge to me represents a once in a generation opportunity by creating opportunities for development that do not build on prime farmland,  that do not build on sensitive habitat and preserve as much of it as possible.  We have seen this too much in the past.  I've not seen a more thoughtful, well-planned legacy building project in our community in the 40 years that I've lived here.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  So, with that, I will close the public hearing.  Just want to thank you all for all of your comments.  Really appreciate all of them.  I would invite you all to, you know, I have tried to restrict the comments tonight to the merits of the EIR,  but I'd invite you guys all to come back when we actually do make a decision to discuss on a more broader sense the merits of the project,  and while I cannot comment on the merits of the EIR, the draft EIR,  I can comment on the merits of principle planner, Mike Solley,  who just spent an hour and a half hearing how his hard work may be improved,  and it took it with a lot of grace, but he did put a lot of hard work into this document,  and shepherding us through this process, and so, for that, we do appreciate you, Mike, so, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We will move on to regular agenda.  There is none.  Reports and communications have none from Bruce.  No?  Okay.  So we will adjourn to the regular meeting of Thursday, December 2nd.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
