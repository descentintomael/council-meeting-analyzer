 Madam Clerk, you ready?  All right, we will start, call the meeting to order and start with an invocation from  Minister Chuck Rutledge from the Chico Church of Christ.  Welcome.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  Council, you bow with me, please.  All Sovereign Lord, we praise you for your creativity.  Thank you for life, your provisions, sustaining life in its present form.  We praise you for your creative vision of eternal life and the hope that you give us.  We thank you for this time we have here this evening.  We thank you for this great country we live in, despite the challenges that surround us,  the adversities we face as a nation every day, yet here we are, having these freedoms  to have open discussions, and we praise you.  Thank you for that.  We're thankful for this beautiful city that we live in, Chico, Lord.  We ask your blessings on its citizens and all the activity that,  as we've said, occurs here on a daily basis.  We ask your blessings on our first responders, those who help our citizens in times of need,  showing up in the most difficult of situations, putting their own life on the line for our  safety and stability.  We ask that you surround them, protect them.  We ask that you bless our community bountifully.  We ask that you bless the business leaders who contribute much to this community,  the commerce that happens on a daily basis.  Lord, we pray for our council.  We pray for their wisdom to make decisions, oversight, providing for the welfare and the needs of this great community.  And we pray that our leaders listen intently to the concerns of its citizens.  We pray that this meeting be one of clarity,  and civility.  And we ask that your spirit of peace and understanding guide the council this evening.  At this meeting, in Christ's name we pray, amen.  Thank you very much.  All right, at this moment, we'll have a moment of silence for passing of Tom Dauterman,  who was a very well-known and respected individual in our community and gave a lot to our community.  So if we could pause and have a moment of silence for Tom.  All right, if you please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Pledge of Allegiance.  Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation under God,  indivisible,  with liberty and justice for all.

And we've enjoyed it with alcohol, alcohol.  I think we need to look at our history.  I'm asking you to look at our history  and make some changes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Steve Perez.  Good evening, Mayor and Councilors.  Thank you for having me here.  I'm here to apologize.  My name is Steve Perez.  I'm the president.  I have the privilege of serving as the president of Chico State  and it's taken me this long to come and say hi to everybody  and introduce myself.  I've met a number of you.  I've had the pleasure of meeting with you,  talking with you, working with you,  and thoroughly have enjoyed it very much.  I've been the president since July 1st.  I've been here since January of last year.  I was the vice provost.  My wife, Tanya, and I moved to Chico  principally because,  we love living in a college town.  I love working in the CSU.  I love working at a college,  but we love living in a college town.  The nature of our relationship  between the university and between a city  is a very special one in a town like Chico.  I've got some stuff to give out to you.  I don't know how we do it.  Thank you.  This first one just talks about a little bit  of what we're very proud of to contribute to Chico,  both economically and we bring in students.  They add to our social vibrancy of the town.  We spend money in town.  Every thousand students that we bring in  spend $17.9 million in Chico every year.  Above and beyond that,  we've got performances on our campus.  We've got our faculty and our staff out in the community  donating their time and donating their expertise  to make this a better place to live.  That's what it's like to be in a college town,  at least from our side of it,  but it's a symbiotic relationship.  The relationship between us,  between a university and a city and a college town  is a very special one,  and no more special than a place like here in Chico.  So I started off apologizing,  but let me thank you all.  Let me thank staff.  Let me thank the councillors.  Let me thank the mayor.  The mayor and Councillor Winslow joined me yesterday.  We did a safety walk around campus,  identifying places where we need new lights,  where we might have problems in our sidewalks,  things that we can do to make both our campus  and our surrounding area even safer.  But all the work that you do,  the work that you put in to making Chico a wonderful place,  that impacts us tremendously.  We've got Choose Chico Day.  We've got another one.  We've got Choose Chico Day coming up on April 6th.  We're bringing families and prospective students to Chico  to see what it's like to be a student here.  And when they come here, they want to stay here.  We almost get 100% sign up when we get people to visit Chico  because it's such a wonderful place,  because of the work that you all put in.  And so I'm here to thank you for all of that. Let's, I'm looking for you.  I'm looking forward to work with you all.  Those of you that I haven't met, I can't wait to meet with you.  But looking forward to figuring out how we can make this an even better place,  how to have the relationship between the university and the city  and in a university that is embedded right next to downtown,  like no other in the state of California that I'm aware of.  Very proud to be here. Very appreciative to be here.  And thank you for all you're doing. Thank you.  Mr. All right. Thank you very much.  Safety walk was pretty fun, actually. Yeah. All right.  So we will move on at this time to public hearings.  There are some guidelines for public hearings.  So staff report, 15 minutes.  Then we have the council discussion and questions from staff,  which is 10 minutes.  Then we open the public hearing for input, which again,  applicant 15, additional speakers 30,  and then rebuttal period, if necessary, three minutes.  They don't usually go this long.  Then we close the public hearing and then council has the discussion.  20 minutes or longer as determined by the council.  So item 4.1, hearing on West East Avenue annexation.  And we have, I believe a report from Mike Sully,  and then we'll go to ex parte communications after that.  Thank you, Mayor Kilgour, for getting me to council.  This is an annexation proposed off of the, oh, one second.  On the east side of Norton Avenue between East Avenue,  West East Avenue and Henshaw Avenue.  The site is the annexation that follows up the Orchard Creek Estates project  that this council approved at last meeting.  And this zoning was adopted earlier this meeting.  It shows that the project site would be zoned predominantly R1,  that's the yellow low density residential with blue PQ  representing where the Masonic Hall is.  And that's to prepare for the next meeting.  And that's to perpetuate their operations.  It's important that we did the rezone before the annexation.  After you annex property, you can't rezone it for two years.  So we got that in place.  And that's not the first annexation recently in this area.  In 2022, there was annexation, West East Avenue  annexation district number one.  And that's outlined here in yellow.  And that was approved in 2022 with it going to,  delayed to be recorded in August 1st of this year.  The city will look like this over here on this corner.  And that brings us to the project site now,  which is adjacent to the city limits.  Involves those three properties,  the 15 acres for the Orchards  and the additional five acres for the Masonic Hall.  Staff recommends that the city council  hold a public hearing tonight and adopt the resolution,  which directs staff to apply  to the local agency formation commission,  where the city becomes an applicant asking for this annexation  to be approved.  So with that, I'll answer any questions you have.  All right, questions for Ms. Sully?  Thank you.  All right, any council discussion  previous to the hearing?  No?  Seeing none, we'll open the hearing.  How many speakers?  We have one.  Three minutes.  Okay, Chuck Tetreault.  I guess we would technically take him out.  Okay.  So can council members on the fire  want to be here this evening to let you know  I'm here to answer the questions  and I don't take up any more of your time?  All right.  Any questions from the city council?  No.  All right, thank you very much.  Okay, with that, we will close the public hearing.  Council discussion, motion to vote.  Discussion?  Entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Morgan, a second.  Second from Council Member Bennett.  I believe.  Okay, Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Kulich?  Aye.  Carries six zero with one absence.  All right, we'll move on to our regular agenda,  consideration approval of the downtown Chico Complete  Streets Improvement Project.  Centerpiece of our evening, I think,  for most of the folks here.  And we're going to start with the report, which is,  Mr. Mayor, on the advice of the city attorney,  I need to recuse myself, I'm a property owner in downtown.  All right, we will see you after.  All right, and then we will start with the report  from Brendan Ottoboni, Public Works Director of Engineering.  Welcome, sir.  Thank you.  I don't think I'll be as quick as Mr. Sullivan.  Probably.  I'll apologize ahead of time.  But I did take one of Mr. Gustafson's presentations  and added some color to it, so.  Sorry.  Sean, you teed it up earlier.  All right, we'll start.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council members.  Item 5.1 before you this evening holds significant importance  for our community and necessitates careful consideration  due to its far-reaching implications for downtown Chico  across many generations to come.  City staff, we feel privileged and honored  to have the opportunity to be involved  in such a project of this magnitude.  Again, that's gonna have weight for generations  and decades to come.  We are, as city staff also, for the most part,  residents ourselves, so we, again,  take a lot of pride in that.  We put a lot of care into this project  and we understand its implications.  The objective of tonight is to receive direction  from City Council on some of the higher level  design considerations. So, that we can get some of those  So that we, as engineering staff, can take that  and begin more detailed engineering design.  I'll get into a little bit more detail on that coming up.  Generally speaking, the agenda for tonight  is gonna be three main components.  We'll go through the background,  the public outreach that we've performed,  and then lastly, the moving forward,  which will include consideration of five individual items  that we're looking for Council action on tonight.  So, starting with project background,  five main project goals that we,  we embarked on as part of this.  Essentially, the goal is to create an environment  that our community is proud of  and enhances the experience of the patrons,  but also establishes and sets a foundation  and environment for successful business.  And now, there we go.  All right, so where are we at  in terms of the overall project components?  This is something I tend to gloss over  because we deal with this on a daily basis.  But I want to make sure we take the time  to communicate to the community and you as the City Council  that we are in the very infant stages  in the project initiation phase,  where we evaluate different options,  preliminary analysis, we do public outreach,  and ultimately, the deliverable typically on this  is a project study report that provides that analysis  with a recommended alternative.  So, very preliminary stages.  Once we establish that scoping document,  then we move forward with project design,  environmental, right-of-way,  and then we move forward with project clearances,  and then ultimately to construction.  So, why are we doing this project?  I've heard that asked a couple times through this process.  First and foremost, we have a lot of aging infrastructure,  as you know, in downtown.  A lot of it is not seen on our daily basis,  or really at all.  That includes our sewer lines that are about 70 to 100 years old.  So, we have planned repairs of that and replacement  of those old lines.  And the next year or two, Cal Water, PG&E, AT&T, Comcast,  all the utility providers all have aging infrastructure,  so we coordinate through those efforts to replace that.  So, that being the situation, we know we're going to be tearing  up the roads and the sidewalks even more as we trench through  those existing features, and it's an opportunity to rebuild.  So, the other why is our planning documents that we have.  We have our Downtown Access charrette.  That was performed back in 2006.  We have our general plan.  It was adopted in 2011, I believe.  We have our Downtown Access action plan.  We have our climate action plan, and we've got our bike plan,  among many other things.  So, a lot of planning documents that have gone into this effort  over the decades.  So, it's our opportunity as staff to then pile all this  together and come up with our best ideas.  And so, that's where we're at.  The other why is, you know, we're going to be doing a lot of  I think anyone that, you know, lives here and uses downtown on  a regular basis, it's not in the best condition, and these  pictures kind of highlight the opportunity that we have to  improve it and create a much better experience for our  community and something that we're proud of.  In addition to that, another why is the safety aspect.  And so, in the last 10 years, from 2010 to 2020, we have been  We had 93 reported bicycle and pedestrian collisions, two of  which resulted in fatalities.  And so, as you can see on the heat map, the downtown is at the  core of those safety issues from a bicycle and pedestrian  perspective, and so looking to enhance the safety features of  improving our infrastructure.  Another side note would be that we have an ADA transition plan,  another plan, and through that, it identified two main priorities,  first of which was, you know, the  accessibility to downtown through the Esplanade corridor.  So, we're addressing that this coming summer with our Esplanade  safety project, and the second priority of that ADA transition  plan is improving downtown for accessibility purposes.  So, consolidating to the downtown, the project location.  So, as you can see here on this map, we've got a lot of bike  facilities kind of in and around Chico.  You've got Bikeway 99 there in the purple.  You've obviously got Bidwell Lower Park coming kind of  perpendicular to that.  And then up Esplanade, you've got future bicycle facilities as well  as existing airport bike path.  So, this is really looking to create a lot of connectivity,  close those gaps in the bicycle and pedestrian facilities.  So, we're creating connectivity to downtown, but also to other  destinations outside of downtown, such as Bidwell Park.  Narrowing down a little bit more, project limits.  So, trying to define a, having a defined scope of work.  So, we're looking at going from Memorial Way at the north end on  Esplanade.  That's because where that, that's where the Esplanade bike  path will terminate.  So, we'd like to pick that up and carry that through downtown  on Main and Broadway down to 11th Street.  That will include the, one of the items for this evening would  be consideration of second, third, and fourth streets as  well.  And so, we'll get into a little bit more detail on the limits of  those considerations.  Active transportation challenges.  So, much of the existing environment in downtown presents  physical challenge for active modes.  You can see heaps sidewalk here from tree roots.  Vaults that are existing in downtown that are not ADA  compliant present tripping hazards.  And so, there's existing elements that we'd like to  repair and fix as a part of this effort.  In addition, we have a lot of street tree challenges as well.  So, you can see here, again, heaving sidewalks mainly due to  the fact that these were planted a long time ago without the  benefit of modern standards such as root barrier, tree grates that  are flush mounted.  And so, it presents accessibility challenges for us.  We've heard from some downtown businesses as well that they're  close to the buildings.  So, they grow into the buildings and cause maintenance challenges  with those.  You can see on the right-hand side there.  And so, it kind of creates this uneven, unsymmetrical growth of  the canopy of the tree.  And I know we want full canopies.  Engineers like things symmetrical too.  So, that always helps.  I wanted to touch on some future considerations because obviously  this project is far reaching in the details.  We're trying to keep it focused on these five elements.  But there are other elements that we would incorporate that we  would like to include during the engineering design phase.  That would likely include something like a gateway feature  for south downtown.  We have Ringle Park at the north end.  We have the roundabout with the Welcome to Downtown Chico sign on  that east end.  And so, looking to maybe enhance a gateway feature on the south  part of downtown.  Obviously, an opportunity also to include wayfinding and  information for downtown.  One big topic that we all know, living in Chico and being  downtown, is the commercial loading and unloading.  So, just want to make sure I spend a little bit of extra time  on that and talk about the fact that the intention would be to  analyze and incorporate some flex parking considerations where  maybe we use parking spaces for certain hours of the day.  We sign it.  We paint it a different color for commercial loading and  unloading off of the travel way.  And then during non-loading, unloading hours, those would be  able to be used for normal parking spaces.  So, we have a lot of parking stalls for pedestrian vehicles.  The intention, I know one of the elements too is kind of a given  is three lanes down to two lanes for Main and Broadway.  So, I'll just kind of address that here too.  From an engineering standpoint, three lanes is absolutely not  warranted.  Those, the sections of Main and Broadway are the only locations  in town.  We have three lanes of traffic.  For comparison's sake, Highway 99 has two lanes of traffic and  carries approximately 55,000 vehicle trips per day.  Our downtown averages about 8,000 to 12,000 vehicle trips  per day.  So, from an engineering capacity standpoint, it's not  warranted.  I understand loading and unloading now becomes a  challenge, right?  And so, there are California vehicle code sections that do  not allow for the blocking.  But, there is a lot of traffic blocking of a roadway.  So, you would still potentially have an opportunity to load with  one commercial truck in one of the lanes, but certainly you  could not block an entire direction of traffic with those  commercial vehicles.  So, I just wanted to clarify that.  Lastly, future considerations, in coordination with a lot of  the downtown businesses, with no private space on private  property to store garbage bins, we'll look to incorporate maybe  some consolidated centralized areas where people can't get  So, that way, the garbage bins can be done in a more  aesthetically pleasing and efficient way.  At the December 4th Internal Affairs Committee meeting, one  of the directions to staff was to also consider pedestrian  zones, which would essentially close off lanes of traffic or  complete blocks of traffic for pedestrian uses only.  We briefly looked at that.  I think there is a lot of challenges that would come with  that.  I think there's a lot of opportunity as well.  But really, to do it, we'd really need to look more in  depth from an engineering standpoint of the circulation  because of the one-way streets in downtown.  I think probably one of the better opportunities would be  Third Street between Main and Broadway, but that creates some  circulation issues because if you're going northbound on Main,  you can't go left on Second Street there.  So, we'd have to reevaluate some of the engineering circulation  elements to that.  All right.  Public outreach.  So, we held pretty significant community engagement.  The process we started off with was the December 4th Internal  Affairs Committee meeting, and from there, we embarked on  essentially a two-month long community engagement public  outreach effort.  This included significant stakeholders such as Chico  State.  The Matroopda Tribe, BCAG, Chico Velo, and the DCBA.  We had four coordinated DCBA meetings among many other  individual and other informal meetings.  We held three public community meetings, one here at City Hall  or sorry, the Council Chambers.  Then we held one at Chapman Elementary to get kind of the  south part of the community, and then one at Shasta Elementary  to address the north end of the community and have engagement  from other residents.  We also attended four different farmers markets.  We had a booth there with information.  We also put out a 14-question survey.  We received over 1,100 responses, which in my  experience is pretty significant for a capital  project.  We typically are in the 1 to 300 response range, so this is a  pretty good sample size, I would say, in my experience.  First and foremost, based on that, I think that says a lot  about our community.  We're engaged.  We received a lot of great feedback.  We tried to reach all users, not just businesses that are  obviously critical to the success of downtown business  owners, property owners, but also engaging the patrons and  the customers of downtown by, again, trying to reach outside  of downtown and get with those residents.  We took a lot of this to heart, and we heard a lot of good  feedback, and I think tonight's presentation is a result of that.  So we'll get into that in more detail.  But these are the main components we've heard back, the  seven main components of the survey results.  Concerns with reduction in parking, impacts to businesses,  the homelessness, delivery trucks, bike theft, general  safety, and removal of the traffic lane there.  All right, so moving forward.  This is where we look to engage direction from the Council.  So like I mentioned earlier, five main components we're  looking for individual direction on and vote by the Council.  First is the existing vaults in downtown, then the street trees,  the buffer options, inclusion of second, third, and fourth  streets, and then the main and Broadway street cross-sections.  My intention tonight is to do the presentation, obviously give  it back to the Mayor and the Council, have public comment, and  then I can bring back up these items as you vote on them so you  have a visual to go off of as well.  So recommendation number one in terms of the existing vaults.  So we have approximately 24 vaults in downtown.  These are access vaults to private businesses, private  properties.  And so we're looking to have a number of vaults in downtown.  So these were done a long time ago before we had ADA standards,  before we had a grant of licence procedure.  So if that was done today, we would not be using these vaults,  and we would require a grant of licence as it's a private property  access to in the public right of way.  So in this item, our recommendation is to allow these  to continue.  However, engage with the property owners if interested,  and have them responsible for the costs of purchasing new  vaults.  And then enter into a grant of licence with the city so that we  have the liability for the maintenance and operations of  those vaults onto the owners of the properties that are  benefiting.  The intention would be we specify which type of vaults, so  there's consistency across the whole downtown, and we know that  they meet ADA compliance.  But that we would include that as part of our construction  project to pour into the concrete essentially.  We have two vaults.  We have two other options here for consideration, and if the  Council has any others, again, we're always open.  So the other options we've considered is requiring all  vaults to just be removed and removing that access.  And lastly would be just to leave the existing ones in place  and pour new concrete around them.  In our discussions with business owners, they're seldomly used,  but when they are, they're critical to the operations of  the business.  So that's how we've landed on our recommended option of  allowing them to be replaced.  The second recommendation or request.  Yes, Mayor, I have a question.  Do we want to go through all the recommendations and then go  back and talk about them individually, or do you want to  stop and do them now?  Questions on each item?  I'd rather do it one at a time.  Yeah, no, I think we should do questions immediately after each  individual item.  Yeah.  So, yes.  Okay.  So do you want to?  If you'd like, yeah, I can pause here and then come back.  Well, no, the idea is that we don't have to come back to it  because otherwise we'd discuss it twice.  Oh, but then we don't get public comment.  No, that doesn't work.  We have questions for staff.  Oh, fair enough.  Yeah.  So Duvalds, questions, next subject, questions, next subject.  So we're not bouncing around all over the place.  Yeah, so do you have any questions on recommendation number one?  And is this the end of the slides on recommendation number one?  Yes.  Okay.  So questions from council on recommendation number one?  No.  How much are the vaults?  The doors?  Preliminarily, we think they're a few thousand dollars each.  The grant of license process is also then I think it's just over  $2,000.  So in the staff report, I think we provided a range of $6,000 to  $10,000 of costs.  So what are we charging them?  It would be $6,000 to $10,000.  That's between the new doors and also the?  The grant of license.  Grant of license.  Yeah.  Grant of license, that's not an annual fee.  That's?  That's a one time.  It's a one time.  Yeah, for the administrative costs to administer that.  Perfect.  Thank you.  Okay.  Any further questions on vaults?  No further questions on vaults.  Excellent.  All right.  Item number two, street trees.  Really, it comes down to two options.  Do we want to keep the existing trees and try and pour concrete around them?  There are some challenges with that.  For those familiar with construction, I can tell you that there are some challenges with  that.  One is that when you're doing activities, when you're excavating demo and concrete,  you can damage the roots.  Then when you pour back the concrete, it can cause damage.  There's going to be some slight elevation changes as we pour back concrete to be compliant  with ADA standards and slopes.  So there's some challenges there.  Our recommendation is to remove the existing trees and plant new trees that are of native  species, have proper irrigation, have proper root barrier control so that the roots are  forced to grow down and not sideways and heave sidewalk.  Eliminate future maintenance.  And then have flush mounted tree grates so that it's a walkable, non-trippable surface.  And then you have consistency amongst the whole corridor.  As you look down the whole corridor, we have the same grates, same tree protection elements.  And then there's also an opportunity to provide some lighting, up lighting, and different  elements like that, aesthetic features.  All right.  So that's the end of street trees.  That's the end of street trees.  Questions on street trees?  I don't have a question, but I just want to make a comment.  We talked about street trees.  We talked about this a lot in internal affairs.  I think the agreement was this short-term pain of having to take out trees for the long-term  gain of having the correct trees, not right away, but to keep any trees that could possibly  be kept and any legacy trees and make sure that if there, it is any way possible to keep  any that we can.  Absolutely.  I just wanted to add that.  Thank you for that clarification.  Yes.  And correct, the intention would be to get the largest possible trees to plant, which  would be at 36,000.  So, we're starting as far in advance as we can of a mature tree.  So, since this is a 10-year project, we can buy those trees now and start growing them.  Start growing them.  We just moved to big magnolia, so.  Questions to my left.  That kind of covered it.  I want to make sure because we had a specific recommendation in internal affairs that included  some individual trees.  It was all sycamores and northern red oaks, I believe, that were like the more mature  ones, if possible, if not too expensive than to maintain this.  Good.  I have a lot of questions about trees.  So, if the majority of the trees are ripped out, do you anticipate having obviously smaller  sized trees for an extended period of time until they grow in?  Yeah, by nature of that, I don't know when a lot of these trees were planted, but by  nature of, yeah, new trees.  Because it takes a while.  Yeah.  So, Yuba City's downtown did the same thing.  They ripped out all their trees and replaced all their trees.  And their trees are finally full grown.  But they did their street project 12 years ago.  So that's my concern is that we're ripping out trees that add a lot of uniqueness.  The other thing they did is they ripped out all the trees and got rid of some pretty unique  trees.  And I think our trees are a pretty unique feature downtown.  And the variance between them is a unique feature.  So I don't want to lose that.  Yeah.  So that's part of my concern.  Okay.  Yeah.  And we met with and will continue to engage with our urban forest manager, Rich.  Richie Bamlett to identify what those trees might look like to keep.  And then also, obviously, any species of new trees are consistent with.  Yeah.  And I understand the concern.  But whereas a lot of people go, oh, you know what?  And you're an engineer.  You like things nice and symmetrical.  Nice and symmetrical isn't always pretty.  Nice and symmetrical can be really boring.  So it can.  So if you get a line of trees that look...  Get a line of trees that look exactly the same.  It's not always unique.  It doesn't add a lot of character, a lot of feature.  And that's my concern.  I don't want a downtown that right now is really unique changing into one that's just  vanilla.  So...  Yeah.  I think the intention in the internal affairs recommendation where I did like pick specific  trees was to maintain diversity in the canopy so we don't end up with a blank slate and  then just all the same fresh trees.  But it's worth a little bit extra cost to make...  Yeah.  Variations in height, variations in style, different trees throughout, different  positioning, not straight line, not...  Yeah.  And I think one of the benefits...  I said that kind of tongue in cheek, the symmetrical...  We're not known for being artists, engineers.  Is you get more of a canopy, a full canopy, so you have more shade associated with a full  canopy, reducing heat island effect and all sorts of other things.  We good on street trees then?  Cool.  Thank you.  All right.  Item number three is our bike line.  Bike lane buffer options.  So really three options that we've come up with.  Our recommendation is the one in the middle.  Should a bike lane be considered, what we want that buffer to consist of.  And so our recommendation would be the landscape planter strip shown in the middle there.  Second option would be the intermittent planters, which are more physical barriers with some  shrubs in them.  And then a third option would be a fence, a concrete like hardscape with a fence that  would mirror the fence.  Fencing along Esplanade and children's playground there.  All right.  Questions on...  Are we there yet for questions?  Yes.  Okay.  Questions on bike buffer options?  Yes.  Fire away.  Can you...  I should have called you.  Can you tell me the approximate width of the concrete curb?  I'm going to call it a curb.  It's a buffer treatment.  I believe that is four.  Five feet.  The concrete is five feet wide?  I believe so.  I think...  Let me go forward a little bit here.  I think we have a dimension.  Yeah, five feet.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Other questions?  I don't think I have a lot of questions.  I think I just have a lot of concerns.  So...  And, you know, it's going to take some time to digest this.  So...  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Again, that's assuming we select a bike...  Makes sense.  Yeah.  Recommendation number four is a simple kind of yes or no question is should we include  improvements on second, third, and fourth streets?  Really with the intent of creating connectivity from Lower Park to the downtown.  By doing so, there's opportunities.  There's opportunities in the future to extend that through the South Campus area and connect  to other bike facilities on Ivy Street to connect to future development opportunities.  So we don't have a tremendous amount of detail, but we're really asking, do you want to include  second, third, and fourth streets in this and add bike facilities to that?  There's going to be nuance in a lot of the details.  And I'll add that it was about four years ago on fourth street between Main and Flume.  We did a pop-up where we tried that, where we closed one lane and actually had pretty  good success with that.  Learned some things and thought it was pretty successful.  So for whatever that's worth, just wanted to add that we did do a little pop-up and  kind of demo of that.  So that concludes my information on this item.  It's again, should we do it or should we not?  All right.  Questions on that one, anyone?  Just to clarify.  So...  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So we're talking about two lanes going in each direction.  We're talking about taking out a traffic lane, not a parking lane, and it would be a protected  bicycle access with two parking lanes?  It's two lanes in one direction.  Yeah.  So we'd reduce it from two lanes in one direction down to one.  Right.  So we still have parking on both sides?  Correct.  Cool.  Yes.  Sorry.  There's some sections.  Generally, it looked like, again, it might not be consistent for the whole stretch that  we're talking about because there's going to be some design challenges.  But for the most part, we'd look to achieve this.  Any other questions there?  No?  So, well, again, it's just concerned with delivery vehicles.  So particularly on the side streets, particularly if you're changing Broadway in Maine.  Yeah.  And the intention, like I mentioned, would use...  Yeah.  If you're using flex parking by California vehicle code, you cannot fully block if it's  one...  I should explain that to the people who fully block.  So, no offense, but none offense to our PD either, but there's a lot of blocking of those  three lanes on a regular basis.  Well, you can't impede...  But they do.  ...complete traffic.  They're stopping, but you can still...  There's still one lane of traffic through.  Oh, I understand.  Differentiated.  It's a good question.  For the police chief, is do you ever enforce on people blocking traffic?  Would you if there was only one lane and it were blocked by a truck?  So, I just want to clarify, if we had two lanes and all the lanes were blocked?  Yeah.  I mean, does that ever come up?  Because I think people have the concept that because right now trucks will park in a lane,  because there are extra lanes and go around, that therefore, if they were to block the  entire street, we would just suffer and not enforce our rules.  Oh, absolutely.  We would have one move.  You can't impede the flow of traffic.  That would create a safety issue.  So, we wouldn't pick one.  We would tell them both they need to move and they could work it out.  But absolutely, we would open up the roadway.  Thanks for clarifying.  Yeah.  I think for clarity, the California vehicle code speaks to if you have three lanes of  traffic and you have a truck parked on one outside lane.  And one on the other side, the other lane, the center lane is still open for the flow  of traffic.  So, therefore, it would not be a violation of the California vehicle code.  Well, that wasn't necessarily my point.  My point is that we have vehicle codes for lots of things, but people don't necessarily  obey them.  And we don't necessarily clamp down on every single person doing it.  I can tell you, I've been on Main and Broadway with two trucks on the side and one pulling  around them and stuck as traffic backs up to the Esplanade.  More than once.  So it's just the delivery aspect is a big concern for me.  So, all right.  Further questions?  All right.  Meat and potatoes.  Okay.  Main Street and Broadway.  So we have, as staff, changed our recommendation based on the public input from the internal  affairs.  Based on a lot of the feedback and engagement.  We've recommended reassessing the cross sections.  There's been a lot of positive feedback we received.  We've listened through that.  There's been good comments that we've taken to heart.  And I think, as I mentioned at the beginning, it's important that we get this right.  This is something that's going to affect generations to come.  Affect the livelihood of our downtown, the heart of our community.  We truly, truly believe it's important to get it right.  And so I think we want to make sure we get it right.  And we've heard a lot of concerns through this process.  A lot of which has merit to it.  So we appreciate that feedback.  And we've really kind of thrown out there the option of looking to Council to give us  these three main components of on street parking, sidewalks, and bicycle facilities.  What are your priorities?  Again, we walked through all those different planning documents and did our best to navigate  that.  But we want to make sure we get it right.  So.  Looking at 82 feet from building face to building face, we can't have everything we  want to the degree that we want it.  So we're going to have to have tradeoffs of what these three elements present and provide.  And so our alternative one, recommendation number one in this is to reassess the cross  sections and prioritize these functions.  Alternative two essentially becomes what we had previously recommended.  That would include a reduction of 3.5.  Three lanes down to two lanes.  Adding in a class four bi-directional bike path with a five foot parkway strip or buffer.  As well as 20 foot sidewalks on Broadway.  Well, Broadway would have 20 foot sidewalks.  Main Street would have 18.  The intention of putting bike lane on Main Street on that one side.  Again, connectivity with Esplanade.  And then ultimately at Humboldt Avenue.  We have a traffic signal there that you can bifurcate that bike traffic and get onto the  class two lanes on Park Avenue.  Twenty foot sidewalks in my opinion is important because we have existing outdoor dining cafes.  Twenty foot sidewalks is the minimum to accommodate a 12 foot wide outdoor cafe plus an eight  foot pathway of travel around that.  And so anything less than that, now you're that face of curb is going to be kind of going  in and out.  And you're going to be having intermittent removal of parking to accommodate future outdoor  dining cafes.  Or just accommodation of the existing ones.  So to our staff's direction of these planning documents and existing features, it was important  to maximize that to at least 20 feet for those existing features.  So here's the renderings I think everyone's seen on what that would look like in the built  environment.  On the left, Broadway Street at 4th looking northbound.  On the right is Main Street looking southbound.  From 3rd to 4th.  And so you can kind of see what that layout might look like and function like.  Obviously the biggest impact with the Main Street concept is the removal of on street  parking on that east side.  I think that's one element we've heard a lot from business owners, property owners.  We heard a lot of feedback in the public survey.  And so that's one of those elements that I think we can do better of giving up on certain  things and taking away some feet here and feet there to incorporate.  More parking to make sure that businesses can be successful.  So here's those dimensions a little more closely.  And then here's Main Street with those dimensions as well.  Alternative 3 is a different concept with facilities on both Main Street and Broadway.  Intending to have.  So we just have one section.  Because we're going to have a lot of parking. so we just have one section because it'll apply to both, a seven foot single direction with the direction of traffic. It's considered a class 2 facility with a four foot planter strip buffer. Parking on both sides with a four foot planter strip buffer. Parking on both sides and two lanes of vehicular traffic. In order to do all that, our sidewalks  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  This part there.  and you can kind of see that represented uh right here where this is a raw bar where it's going to  come out and you're going to have to remove some parking in order to accommodate those outdoor cafe  areas so that's kind of why it fell to option number two it has some constraints in terms of  connectivity especially as you go through esplanade coming into main and broadway  in terms of that north end and connecting to that class four facility that will construct this summer  so here's the dimensions of what that will look like  and that concludes that item i'm available for any questions all right questions on that particular  right you you already excuse me you already answered the question you mentioned the  results of the dcba survey  um !  which um you're familiar with you have read and you understand i have not you have not no  oh um well i would suggest that that be reviewed by your department yeah we made our survey  available to all dcba members and um so we tried to capture everyone in our survey  the survey from the dcba included all the property owners and  businesses in downtown so i think it's very very important  anyone else just to be clear on this alternative we're looking at you mentioned how we have to take  out some parking spaces to accommodate the existing outdoor dining or any new ones like  that parking already doesn't exist um correct right so yeah so that's so we we get that back  if we have the wider sidewalks where it's consistent um so there's some recovery of  spaces on broadway yes thank you for that clarification and i will add one element we've had a lot of work on the  part there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there  would not really function that well.  It'd be very disjointed  and probably not really heavily used.  Wall Street could be another option.  You'd lose some diagonal parking there  in order to accommodate that.  You'd also then have the challenge  of getting through the City Hall campus,  through the front of City Hall there,  as well as through the Boys and Girls Club campus  and creating a connected bike path through there.  But that could be an option.  I think connectivity-wise,  you can make that work pretty well  through the Lost Park parking lot  and kind of First Street over there  to get back up to Esplanade.  And then on the south side,  tying into Humboldt Avenue,  it could work well.  So if those are functions  that you'd like us to analyze further,  those are considerations.  But they, again, come with challenges  of removal of parking there,  the diagonal parking on those other facilities as well.  I think it's a worthwhile look.  One of my major concerns with that  is that intersections are where most collisions occur.  And if you're moving off the main street,  now you have non-signalized intersections.  So there's a lot more chance for conflict.  So people riding bikes down,  they're getting hit by cars.  Just like Second Street, for example,  there's a crosswalk,  but people don't always yield as we saw.  So is this the last item?  That's the last item.  Okay.  So questions in general at this time?  Any?  No.  Somebody else?  Go ahead.  I have something after you're done.  Yeah, here's a big picture thing  because it didn't come up in the presentation,  but I just mentioned  in the staff report.  Could you go over the process  for the grants that we're seeking to apply?  You mentioned in particular  an active transportation program grant  that we hope would fund  the majority of the project  and then the federal carbon reduction program  that we would hope would fund the design.  Yeah, thank you for asking that.  So for the design,  we have already secured  carbon reduction program funding for the design.  That's a federal fund  that we've coordinated and obtained through BCAG.  And so that'll allow us  to still proceed with design  and the construction of the project.  The ATP, the Active Transportation Program grant funding  would really be intended to fund the construction.  So the intent, the scope of this,  just main and Broadway and the side streets,  including second, third and fourth,  we're talking in the ballpark  of probably a $40 to $60 million project,  just for magnitude.  So right now we just awarded our largest capital project  of Bruce Road widening at $29 million.  So for context and magnitude.  Okay.  So the ATP program is a really good example  The ATP programs incentivizes  and really prioritizes investing  in multimodal transportation.  So bicycle and pedestrian activities and facilities.  And so really the concept of our alternative  with the bike lanes on main and Broadway  would I think compete very well.  It's an extremely competitive program statewide.  And you have to score very high to even get awarded.  So there's still risk there.  If not on those main thoroughfares,  now we're essentially reducing the amount of grant funds  that would pay for a lot of the improvements.  And so we'd have to consider a look at other funding strategies,  whether that's, you know, Measure H  or maybe another grant program,  maybe an Economic Development Act, EDA type of grant.  So we'd have to evaluate that  once we get the scope of work identified.  I mean, the Active Transportation Program  has like these large grants.  And this is such a,  it could be a transformative project.  So there's a lot of potential for getting funding.  But those other ones that you mentioned,  like what's the chance that they would throw that much money  at a project of this scale?  That's a pretty large ask  for those types of other programs.  We received some EDA funding  for the Cohasset Road project  and that was about 13 and a half million.  So this would be a very large ask.  We haven't been up to date on a lot of the programs there.  So those are things that we're looking at.  And those are things we would look into and consider.  Just one more question on that.  What about the timing of the grant?  And like what,  like when would we have to take action?  What's our deadline in order to get in  before the next grant cycle?  Great question.  Thank you.  So Active Transportation Program,  they're anticipating a June,  mid-June application date.  That is a two-year cycle.  So we are trying to really get early in the phase  to establish  a contract  and a commitment of funding for the construction.  That program happens every two years.  So there'll be another cycle of funding available in 2026.  So some of the timelines we've provided in the staff report,  we're talking about not really getting to construction  until 2029.  So there would be some future opportunities  if action isn't taken now  to go in future cycles  and apply for that funding.  I just want to reiterate too,  one thing I forgot to mention is  this is our community.  It's our downtown.  We're not going to chase,  our intention is not to chase grant funds  to establish or direct what we're going to build  in our community.  We want to first and foremost get it right for our community.  And then we seek and get strategic  on how we're going to fund it with different opportunities.  And ultimately,  the goal and the strategy is  to reduce as much money as we can locally.  So we're leveraging state and federal sources  to bring into our community and build these improvements.  Okay.  So,  other question?  I just want to be clear on my notes  with your comments.  The Federal Carbon Reduction Program,  those funds would only be for design?  Yes.  Okay.  And then the Active Transportation Program,  AIP,  ATP,  that would only be,  if it was granted,  if you receive funds,  that would only be for bike transportation routes?  Yeah, those are the eligible costs.  So the eligible cost for that program  would be focused on bicycle and pedestrian facilities.  Bicycle and pedestrian.  So there would still be a local match  for like the roadway improvements.  Okay.  But at least we're reducing that by at least half.  You're chipping away at the total cost  with these additional opportunities?  Correct.  Okay, thank you.  All right, other questions?  I have a couple.  So I know you mentioned obviously the freeway  moves a lot of traffic.  Freeway doesn't have stoplights,  doesn't have pedestrians,  doesn't have anything like that.  My big concern with cars going through the downtown  is that people in this town use it as a thoroughfare.  They take Esplanade or Mangrove  because the freeway runs crooked across our down  and those run north-south.  And then they both either connect into,  you know,  Ferris Street or they connect into Park.  So to provide,  you know,  north to south travel  in terms of going through our community.  My concern is if we reduce that,  what's the time it takes to go on one of those?  Is that you increase the amount of traffic  on Highway 32,  Nord,  Walnut,  or you increase the amount of traffic on Mangrove.  Mangrove's decent at handling traffic.  It's not perfect all the time.  Highway 32 is a nightmare  and is a one lane in each direction nightmare.  So if people just get the whim,  particularly where I'm located in the avenues,  people get the whim that going through downtown  is going to be a headache,  they're going to take Highway 32  because that's what I would do  because I'm right in between both of them.  And when there's construction on the S-Plane,  I head over to 32.  But 32 is a mess.  There's a lot more students.  There's a lot more risks,  a lot more bikes,  a lot more.  So that's my concern.  Have we analyzed this to,  let's say you drop the number of trips from downtown  because I think you said what,  five to 8,000?  Eight to 12,000.  Eight to 12.  So if you drop it to 5,000,  what does that do to the rest of the transportation?  Do we know?  Well, you're still assuming then that  Nord Avenue, Highway 32  would be able to accommodate an extra  three to 5,000 trips per day.  Well, that's my concern.  Would Nord and Mangrove be able to pick up the slack?  Because right now what I see is,  you know, you're talking about school let out times  at Chico High,  lunch walk times,  you know, in the downtown,  Chico State going into the downtown,  in and out delivery times.  There's a lot of factors already at play on,  you know, Esplanade heading through downtown.  And this isn't.  Those three lanes are not really there to carry capacity,  I guess,  because it's really the open ended of a bottleneck, right?  You have two lanes coming in from Esplanade,  you have two lanes exiting on Park Avenue.  So from like a capacity standpoint,  those three lanes are really not providing capacity  because you're constrained by Esplanade having two lanes  and Park Avenue having two lanes.  Obviously, most of the time you have a commercial vehicle parked there.  I was going to say most of the time it's a two lane road.  Right.  So that's the intention is it would remain a two lane road,  just like the other portion of those corridors that it ties into.  And like I said earlier,  no offense to PD in any way,  shape or form,  but I'm skeptical of the fact that they'll be able to control it and limit it  because I've asked for it before and we've never seen it.  So, and I know other councillors have asked for it in the past,  and they've never seen it.  So it's a problem and it has been.  So, but anyway.  All right.  Any other questions?  All right.  We'll go to public comment.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mr. Albon.  All right.  And I know this is controversial,  so don't, you know,  sometimes you got to play devil's advocate up here too, so.  Yeah, you guys have done a great job on public outreach.  I've never seen so much for any project.  I heard maybe the Esplanade project that didn't actually end up happening  had as much public outreach,  but nothing else that the city's ever done, I think.  Coming soon.  All right.  How many speakers?  We have 28.  All right.  So we're going to give a whopping one minute each  because that's what we do after 25.  Okay.  And I'm going to call the first two names,  and if you could, when you hear your name,  if you could line up in the middle aisle,  that would be great and it would help facilitate getting it through.  If I may too, folks,  it is a,  if you've heard the same thing that you're going to say 10 times before  you're going to say it,  you know, simply come up,  you can state your name for the record if you want,  and then, you know, say,  hey, I agree with the other folks on this particular subject.  So.  All right.  Okay.  So the first two speakers are Jill Serco,  followed by Corbin Vincent.  Hello, everybody.  My name is Jill Serco,  and I was born and raised in Chico,  and I've lived here all but three years of my life,  and I've seen lots of changes in Chico during that time.  I'm concerned about this proposal of really drastically changing our downtown.  It seems to me that it's working pretty darn good,  and I realize that now,  the infrastructure is old and needs to be repaired,  but I do not see the need for the drastic changes that are being proposed.  The number of cars that go through downtown Chico,  as opposed to the number of bikes in the downtown Chico,  it's like a waterfall and a trickle.  And it seems to me that we should be concerned about  what  the largest number,  the automobile population.  That's time.  That is time.  Thank you.  So Corbin Vincent,  followed by Dan Brooks.  Well,  let's see if I can fit all this in.  So I moved here about a year ago to study mechanical engineering,  and I'd like to say thank you to the engineers for putting on this time,  and to the council for giving me time,  and for the community for being so welcoming and open.  But I've never been here before,  and I noticed as I moved here,  I was excited to be able to bike,  but I realized that the infrastructure here  isn't very great for biking.  And in terms of the amount of resources that are already allocated to  transport for cars,  if we have better infrastructure for bikes,  it's to incentivize more people to bike,  reducing more car traffic as well.  And other cities and other  like states in the nation,  have started implementing this kind of infrastructure,  and we've seen really good data and good results for improving quality of life,  and actually bringing in more business to downtown businesses for  making the community more interconnected,  which I think Chico has a lot of great potential to do.  So thank you for your time again.  Thank you.  Dan Brooks,  followed by Kathy Squires.  Hello.  I've been in Chico over 50 years,  and downtown is beautiful.  I think it's a beautiful thing.  But as far as improvements,  I don't believe in 93 lost parking spaces.  Downtown is an improvement.  I disagree with one lane on 2nd and 3rd Street for the bypass.  2nd Street leads right up to Annie's Glen.  4th Street leads right to the one mile entry.  I believe 2nd, 3rd Lane.  And also,  I don't know.  I don't know.  Slightly different note.  The gambling and the high elimination of not open market with alcohol and all that,  I disagree with both those for downtown,  even though there's tax revenue involved.  And also,  as far as public outreach,  thank you,  Dale,  for bringing up whether DCV.  That's time.  Thanks.  Okay.  Kathy Squires,  followed by Marilyn Souza.  The original proposed plan completely disregards long-term effects of those of us mostly affected by the changes.  If it's strayed on paper,  or if you proceed with the plan as proposed,  historic downtown Chico will be lost.  The uniqueness of our city is what draws people to come here.  The specialty shops,  restaurants,  and historic ambience is why they come.  It's unique to the entire area.  No one is asking to eliminate bike lanes,  just consider placing them where they don't interfere with business.  Salem and Wall Street can very well handle north and south traffic.  Fourth Street would have minimal effect to connect Bidwell Park to downtown.  First and second already have bike lanes connecting Annie's and Lennon.  Third Street is lined with retail stores that depend on two lanes of traffic, parking and access for loading.  Reducing third to one lane will devastate in light of deliveries, emergencies, garbage trucks, handicapped customers,  loading such as for my store and large furniture purchases, as well as the farmers market traffic.  They tried this a few years ago.  That's time. Thanks.  Thank you.  Marilyn Souza followed by Kathleen Gabriel.  I couldn't hear what people were saying before, so if I repeat, I'm sorry.  I cannot imagine giving up our wonderful three-lane street on Main.  I am right there just close to Third Street for 34 years, and we got a punch in the gut with these new parking machines,  and now we get this, and I have never had anybody come to town on a bicycle to go into a store and buy something.  I am very difficult.  I'm very, very disturbed by the thought of this new rendition of downtown.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Kathleen Gabriel followed by Carol Whipple.  I agree with what the other speakers said, but I want to add something.  I'm really concerned about the width of the sidewalks, of 20 feet sidewalks on both sides of the street on Main and Red.  I think it would give downtown a big empty look.  I don't, the bump-outs that we have on Broadway are fine, but the whole street from first to fourth to me is really inviting unnecessary consequences.  Maybe we haven't really thought out like more room for loitering and camping, and it would be very hard to control.  That large of a sidewalk would really give downtown an empty look, and it would take away parking.  So what cost do we have on widening the sidewalks instead of just sticking with what we've done in the past, which was bump-outs in front of successful restaurants?  I might point out too that a lot of the bump-outs we have done on Broadway, two of them are already empty.  So let's fill those up first, and let's really look at carefully in designing the sidewalks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Carol Whipple followed by Carly Norley.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening.  When one walks, drives around Chico, it is not unusual on most days to see a bumper sticker that says, I love Chico.  Why, you ask?  It's because Chico, the center of town, is a highlight.  Chico has 15 blocks of old and new buildings in historical setting.  Every brick, mortar building houses people's business, that merchandise and cornucopias of restaurants and other amenities that give us delight.  This is about the pleasure to shop locally and so much more.  There isn't another city that has this distinction in Northern Valor.  Adding to this is the historical route which leads into the downtown route with the lights on Broadway and Main Street, which is the Esplanade.  Chico is indeed special, just the way it is now.  By voting complete street plans down, it will take it off the endangered list and preserve it for our children and grandchildren and generations to come.  This area may need a little dusting and sidewalk care, but the heart of Chico is still there.  Thank you.  So Carla Norley followed by Kirk Mumford.  I have lived here since 1955 and the only way to get to the other side from the north side of town was to go through the downtown before the freeways.  Thank you.  So I know what it looked like before.  I loved it.  I still love it because I avoid the freeway.  So I like going downtown through Maine, through Broadway, looking and remembering what it's been like for me.  So and I'm worried about the merchants.  I think a lot of people are going to go out of business if this goes through.  And that really concerns me.  As far as I know, I'm worried about the city as well.  And others.  Thank you.  Kirk Mumford followed by Leanne Powell.  Hi.  I'm all in favor of complete streets, most of the recommendations you've made.  One thing I was disturbed by the first meeting was the two-way bike path on Main and Woods as opposed to any way.  I think it's a good thing.  I don't know why it was.  Straighten me out on that.  This is to get old people and kids downtown.  And I think this whole complete streets thing is a good idea because we could turn that waterfall versus the little stream trickle into something that's more evenly matched.  You're killing 93 people a year basically because we don't have a – you can't bike downtown.  You just – you get killed.  And I bike all the time.  I've been here for 40 years and I bike all the time.  It's getting harder all the time.  And second, I think this will be good for downtown because it's –  Thank you.  Leanne Powell followed by Katie Holley.  Okay.  I just wanted to say that I agree with those folks that don't want to go down to one lane on 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Street.  I think that would be a huge detriment to the people.  businesses going down to one lane because the delivery trucks do not  listen to they park there for hours on end my second thing was the 93 parking  spaces that we would be losing on Main Street between first and all the way  down to 9th Street that that's that's crazy I know that we have over 1,200  parking spaces throughout downtown but 93 parking spaces on Main Street those  are our prime parking spaces so that's a bother a concern of mine and then the  last there was an article that was just sent to me from the Valencia Street in  San Francisco they did this something similar to this and there's a national  they're getting ready to do some lawsuits down there because so many  businesses have gone under from going into these by planes and taking away  taking away lanes and giving them to bikes and so I think we need better  sidewalks and we need better lighting and thank you for your time  Thank You Katie Holly followed by Kathleen  Cordy  time and time again infrastructure studies give evidence that a lack of bicycle and pedestrian  infrastructure does lead to higher death rates like was said earlier 93 people a year could be  prevented from being killed in downtown that is the reason that people are not seeing bikes and  down and downtown to begin with i personally do not go through there on a bike because there's  no infrastructure right now a painted bike lane does not protect me from lifted trucks  that don't have the ability to see me on the economic standpoint of concerns today  some examples from other complete street projects manhattan's first and second avenue parking spaces  were replaced with bike lanes sales were found to increase significantly in the subsequent  months along salt lake city's broadway a row of parking spaces replaced with protected bike lanes  sales at the site increased by almost nine percent the next year the evidence is  clear  completing downtown streets will not only prevent pedestrian death and injuries but also increase sales  thank you kathleen cordy followed by brandon squires  good evening everybody so cities california oh is the timer on oh there we go  california cities like lancaster uh grass valley and davis have remodeled their cities with plans  like or more extreme than ours in return for making a downtown that is safer and more welcoming to  people and the community  there are a lot of cars there there are cars there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there  buffer options. I don't see, unless you pick the one with planters, if you park on that side, how do  you get to the street? Like, you can't get to the sidewalk. You have to walk through traffic. Do you  walk across the mud, or do you walk across the plants, or do you hop the fence? It seems really  confusing. Also, the idea of making third and fourth and second one way, I mean one lane,  there's no way that all of the deliveries will be done on the four nines. It's just not going to happen. I'm down there every single day. I'm not opposed to bike lanes at all. I think bike lanes are a good idea. I just don't understand how you get from the parking where the bike lanes are across it. Yeah, that's my main thing.  Thank you. Carol Minso, followed by Jonathan Macias-Eimhoff.  My name is Jonny White. My name is Jonny White. My name is Jonny White. My name is Jonny White.

The brand-new kiosks, a lot of people say they won't come down anymore  because they can't figure it out.  But all I know is that bike lanes are great,  but they don't need to be on Main and Broadway.  We need three lanes, biggie, three lanes.  I sat there.  Cars are going down the street.  To my right is UPS delivering to me.  Beer truck going to Burgers and Brews.  And another FedEx truck.  That leaves one lane.  Everyone think, we need three lanes.  Don't get rid of the three lanes.  We'll be going backwards.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jonathan Macias, IMAHA, followed by John Kelly.  Hello.  Thank you for your time.  I was born in Chico and raised here.  I moved back here and bought a house.  And this plant in me feels like embracing.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to live in this house  The economic impact of walkable, practical downtowns in America  even shows that downtowns that are built like this increase  revenue for the entire town.  So you're investing in your future here.  I've heard multiple times in the survey especially,  73% of respondents said they don't use the bike infrastructure.  Well, I would say I try to avoid Main Street and Broadway  as a bicyclist.  I will use cross streets if I can.  But I feel unsafe when I bike down Main Street or Broadway.  So these bike infrastructure, I'm not going to use them.  But I think there will be times when there will be I think, I plan to have a family here and I think that this will be absolutely fantastic for the future generations of will be absolutely fantastic for the future generations of America. Thank you so much. Thank you. John Kelly  there will be  there will be  there will be  there will be  twice a day. If you're running from the heat map, I walk through the red dot twice every day,  if not more. I work downtown and I shop downtown and I would like to feel safer downtown.  Studies show that bike lanes actually improve sales and employment in the streets that they're  implemented, including when they replace car lanes and parking spots. Please let me be safer  when I'm walking downtown. Thank you. I can link those studies to those that scoff there.  I'll be here after. Thanks. Thank you. Greg Scott followed by Adam Fideli.  Well, I timed this for three minutes. I'm just going to throw some numbers at you.  As part of the  council member Ben said, you all received the DCBA survey. This one out of 300  surveys out we had 193 responses. A little better than the 10 percent response line.  88 percent said fix the sidewalks and level.  149 out of 97 percent said they want better lighting.  62 percent don't want the two lanes of traffic on Main and Broadway. 60 percent  don't want  sidewalks widened.  48% wanted  the trees replaced and  sidewalks leveled  with a tree hazard.  And just another thing, we're at 92 people  killed on bicycles.  Thanks.  Thank you. Adam Fedele  followed by Kelly Lesser.  Good evening  Council. Thanks for serving.  I'm a Chico  downtown business person.  Close to 10 years.  Once on East 4th Street and then my current  location on West 3rd  right across from the parking structure.  And I can tell you that the key to being  successful in whatever  iteration it ends up in is  going to be dealing with the delivery  situation. Because like  Mayor Kuhl has noted, it's bad  right now with three lanes.  If it's two lanes, it's going to be worse.  So there's got to be cutout spots.  There's got to be designated  spots where deliveries can happen.  Otherwise,  this won't work.  So please give direction  to planning staff.  It's not one of the things that was listed as  being directional.  Please give direction. Thanks.  Thank you. Kelly Lesser  followed by Kevin Cook.  Good evening, Council.  My name is Kelly  Lesser. I own a business  on Broadway, Urban Couture  and the men's underground.  I agree with  not losing  streets.  And I'm also very concerned  for the merchants losing  parking. I don't know  how you expect us  to survive that.  I'm all about  looking into other avenues  for the bike lanes. I would  at this point like to ask you to  please kind of put a halt on  this and possibly  look at some other options  but not just move forward  without really having,  you know, the public  share all of our facts  before us. Thank you.  Thank you. Kevin Cook  followed by Whitney Garcia.  Thanks, guys, for coming out.  I keep talking about this.  I think this is going to be a  many-year project for sure.  But I'm a special education  teacher and I just wanted to  mention the ADA from Brendan.  The city of Corning put in  an intersection about two years ago  and they thought it was  full ADA compliant.  And there was a blind child  who was going to do a crossing.  And blindness is low to 80%.  So it's often the last thought  about for ADA compliance.  Usually it's wheelchairs first.  What that translated to was a  student was taking a lesson  there and found out that when  they went to make a crossing,  the auditory cue was incorrect  and it was put in incorrectly.  So crossing left versus crossing  right, when they heard the  crossing was active, they went  the wrong direction.  Thankfully, the teacher was  there to stop them and said,  hey, this is a problem.  Went to the parent, made a joke  and said that, hey, this was  incorrect. And the city had to  redo the intersection on just a  comment from a parent,  essentially, because the parent  was pushing litigation.  So when you do a,  when you do more research on  this, make sure that you are  looking at all of the ADA  compliance issues because  otherwise you might have to do  it twice.  So wherever you guys go, just  factor that in.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Whitney Garcia followed by Bryce  Goldstein.  Good evening, councillors.  My name is Whitney Garcia and I  am the co-manager of Chico  Vela.  Chico Vela's mission is to  promote bicycling for  transportation, recreation and  health through public education,  advocacy and community  stewardship.  We are excited that the  city is considering  improvements to the downtown  area and would improve access  for all modes of  transportation as we feel this  project embodies our mission.  Buffering bike routes from  vehicle traffic creates a safer  environment for all users and we  support the development of any  buffered bike lanes.  Given the options currently  available, Chico Vela supports  any option that improves the  safety and accessibility.  And we feel like alternative to  class four bikes facilities on  Main Street is the best option.  This option will connect easily  to the  S-18 project, provide the  safest protection for bicyclists  and encourage more active  transportation to and from  downtown.  At a high level, we are  thrilled that the city is  exploring infrastructure  projects that will continue to  bolster Chico's iconic downtown  in a way that creates safe  places for all.  We look forward to working with  the city to bring this product  to life.  Thank you.  Bryce Goldstein followed by  Justice Kusumoto.  Good evening.  I'm Bryce Goldstein.  And I'm here to talk about the  And you know, as others pointed  out, studies show that walkable,  bikeable downtowns are thriving  downtowns.  We have a great opportunity in  front of us, so let's do it  right.  Our priority for downtown should  be to move people and goods to  businesses, not just to move cars  through it.  We need to challenge that  paradigm we've had since the  1950s that every road has to be a  highway.  I'm also concerned about the  south downtown area, as in 8th  and Main, et cetera, where people  have been run over.  We need to consider safety there.  People are getting run over,  drivers are running over,  bike racks, running into  buildings.  And we only have three and a  half months to apply for active  transportation program, ATP  funding.  We have a great opportunity, and  time is of the essence.  So I would like to suggest  pursuing quick build funding  through the active transportation  program to build a demonstration  style quick build project where  you can try out some of these  elements, keep collecting  community feedback, and then  shape the project around that  because we haven't reached  consensus yet.  Thank you.  I do support alternative two.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Justice  Kumasoto followed by Zach  Meisel.  Thank you, council.  About five or six years ago, I  got into a car-bike collision on  2nd Street because cars were  able to basically violate the  bike space and violate traffic  laws to turn in to various lots  and other buildings without any  kind of barriers.  That's why I'm advocating the  council consider landscape  buffers to be an alternative to  on bike lanes to protect bike lanes on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th streets, as well as Broadway and Main.  This is essential. This is the future. And if we invest enough in bike infrastructure, we can get  supplemental funds without having to raise any taxes at all. I wholeheartedly endorse  Bryce Goldstein's comments just now. And I also think that investing in bike infrastructure on  2nd and 3rd street is essential to connecting to Bidwell Park and also to allowing people to  commute through Bidwell Park. So I wholeheartedly endorse the two-lane cycle track on Main Street,  expanded sidewalks and bike infrastructure on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, and Broadway, and also  improved infrastructure around the Highway 32 intersection. Thank you.  Thank you. Zach Meisel, followed by Sam Steedman.  Good evening, Council. I'm Zach Meisel, resident of the downtown Chico area. Just want to keep it  short. I'm a huge advocate for the Bidwell Park and Bidwell Park community. I'm a huge advocate for  increasing bike infrastructure downtown. I frequent the downtown area to shop at local  businesses, and when I'm biking downtown to shop at these businesses, I want to feel safe.  I know there's concern from business owners about losing customers downtown. I think there  might be something to be said for increasing pedestrian bike access that might actually  increase customer frequenting businesses. All in all, I hope we can move forward with some sort of  bike infrastructure. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea.  I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea.  I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea.

I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. .  for it. Downtown isn't one of those areas that really has it. I've been able to  take out kids and teach them how to ride their bikes, but then not being as  confident with these things, it's not the best place to learn. It's not the best  place to be active in the first place. And by having places where it's going to  be a little safer for people that aren't as confident on their bikes or active  transportation or walking to do some of these things, I think that has the  potential to really shape what the next generation of Chico can be. And not to  mention I think this supports perhaps older bike riders and stuff that ride downtown on these things.  And I know that's interesting for the businesses and I think that that's valid.  But I think bike safety addresses both of those things to some extent. Thank you.  Thank you. Drew Gilberti followed by Jan Reed.  Hello, my name is Drew and I want to express my strong support for the proposal to  construct a two-way cycle track on Main Street, complemented by landscape buffers.  Additionally I support the idea of expanding sidewalks and implementing  protected cycle tracks on other downtown streets. Previously my partner and I lived  walking distance of downtown, which is incredibly convenient.  However, after buying a house where downtown is no longer easily accessible on foot,  I visited the downtown area and found the first-class parking space. I was very impressed by the  design. The parking space is a little bit different than the downtown area.  The primary deterrent is the hassle of parking, both the cost and the challenge of finding a spot.  Fortunately, the distance from our home downtown is suitable for biking, but safety concerns have held us back from going downtown more often.  I urge you to support biking infrastructure for those of us who are more likely to go downtown if it was more convenient to ride our bikes. Thank you.  Thank you. Jan Reed followed by Karen Laszlo.  Hi, I have a couple of questions. There's problems in downtown Chico with antiquated sewers and that's been brought up this evening.  And I just wanted to know if the city is going to work with property owners to help get the sewer lines aligned to current standards during this tear up of the streets.  Because sewers were mentioned, but this hasn't been mentioned.  I also want to know if the  engineering department and public works have gone to look at other cities who have done this kind of changes and find out what works, what doesn't work, what they wish they would have done differently.  And if they could provide that information to the public so that we could also go and do our own assessment.  Also, are the changes on the ESPINY coordinating with this particular project so that we don't have the whole city being torn up at the same time?  And also, I'm  I'm  part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part part  who are afraid of it may come to appreciate the beautiful and modern  Changes that will bring even more customers to their stores and restaurants  but if this City Council rejects this plan a lot of us will be left to assume that you and  those who have complained about it don't care if a bicyclist gets hits by a car and  I want you to know that this shirt that I have on this nice shirt  I got this step downtown and I got downtown to buy it on my bike  And just one other thing to notice  There are many bike stores downtown  So you know think about that?  All right  We're actually gonna take a short break because otherwise it's just gonna go on a little bit too long and  We'll have to take  A break in the middle of that so a short break will be back in a bit  And thank you everybody for your comments. We do appreciate them  you  you !  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  you  All right.  Oh, look, he's already back up there because he knows.  He knows we're going to have more questions,  and we've got to go through all this.  So why don't we let you lead us through here, Brandon.  We are Mr. Winslow's company.  Yeah.  Start the laying of fruit here.  As I mentioned, I was taking lead from our esteemed colleague  in his professional presentation skills.  Oh, he did fine.  He did fine.  All right.  Okay.  So back to vaults.  I will say I don't know where the conversation  is going to go, but I'm going to go with the conversation  is going to go from here.  But since we've had some talk about, like, rethinking things,  I mean, we're going to talk about what kind of bike lane buffers  we want when there's been doubt cast onto whether or not  we want buffers.  And I'll just say that here.  We can still talk about vaults, but I just wanted to say that.  Yeah.  I think we're just digging into it.  So let's talk about vaults first.  Vaults are first.  I know I'll try and enunciate here.  So recommendation number one, as I mentioned earlier,  is regards to the existing vaults.  So the three options we provide.  Again, there's always endless possibilities with the direction  of the council.  But this is what we've narrowed it down to with our staff  recommendation being that we allow for the vaults with the  property or the business owners or property owners.  It would have to be the property owners entering a grant of  license so that they're responsible for the ownership  and maintenance obligations associated with the vaults and  that they pay for the initial cost of the vault itself and that  we need to pay for that.  So that's the first one.  install it with the project.  All right.  I had a couple more questions on this one.  Does anyone else?  So I know.  Sorry.  Do you have a question, Mr.  Morgan?  You just want to make a motion.  All right.  No, no.  I'm going to ask my question.  So, A, why two grand for the grant of license?  That's our adopted rate in our fee schedule.  Just seems like a lot.  I think that's the problem I have with it.  So we could coordinate and look into the legalities of waiving  that and include that if that's part of the council direction.  And that leads to my second question.  What if they want one but they don't have one?  They have to go through.  Would you allow it?  Would you allow it?  I don't know where that exists, but there's that.  I heard endless possibilities earlier.  Well, I know there's.  That was the endless possibilities.  I know there's not endless possibilities, but.  Yeah, if there's a request for it, then we would consider that as part of the project.  Okay.  And treat them like anyone else.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  That answers that question.  So, Mr. Bennett.  Sorry, I might just add that in that instance, there might be other improvements necessary  to construct access down that would be the responsibility of the property.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Mr. Brent.  Okay.  That would probably cost a fortune.  If there weren't any. to go down into somebody's basement if it's not existing. On alternative two, there's no mention of the grant of license. Is that part of number two or  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  If there weren't any.  include costs for purchasing vaults and installing them as part of the project  estimated cost to be approximately $250,000, which is $10,417  apiece. But there's no mention of the grant of license.  So my question is, is that part of this, or is that  something separate that the property... Yeah, the intention  would be to require grants of license if new ones are installed.  If we keep the existing, there's really no mechanism or incentive  for us to be able to go after an existing feature.  So it's not including. Okay. And then under alternative two,  will the property owner be responsible for the  vault cover once it is installed by the  city? Would the upkeep and maintenance, whatever it might be,  transfer to the property owner?  That's another good question. I look at the details.  Yeah. What's that? Yeah.  That's what the grant of license was, is that they are responsible  for it once the city installs it, is what we had talked about in internal affairs.  Yes. So, okay.  That's it. Thank you.  Thank you.  So we're just providing direction. We're not doing a motion.  We're not doing a motion on each individual item.  No, just direction.  I just recommend that we go with both the internal affairs and the staff  recommendation, which was alternative one is what it's called, but  a lot of the business owners would pay for it.  For clarification, I was hoping to have a vote on each item.  I'll make a motion on this one.  Talk to the owners that have them. If you want to keep it, maintain it,  they got to pay half. We'll pay the rest of it.  It's not.  It's not super fair to say you've got to pay for something you already have,  but if we offer to pay for all of them, everyone's going to say, yes,  I want it when they don't all want it. You want to keep it, pay for half of it.  Grant of license is included in that. We'll do the rest.  I think most of them will get covered up and the ones that get used will stay.  I'd second that. Thank you. I have a comment.  Go ahead.  Um, being sensitive to the downtown businesses,  I was going to go with alternative.  Two, but I really like the suggestion for the splitting.  It seems a very good way to proceed on this,  so I do support your concept. Thank you.  All right. My motion a second. Okay. Council member Bennett. Yes.  Council member Morgan. Yeah. Council member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye.  Carries four, one with one absence.  Actually, let me figure that out. I have one recusal.  Sorry.  Yes. One absence, one recusal and four to one vote.  All right. The second recommendation is in regards to street trees.  Uh, so again, looking for council action on options,  keeping and working around the trees or, uh, removal and especially new trees.  That's what we communicate directly.  All right. Discussion.  I'll make a motion for alternative one.  Go ahead.  What?  Sorry.  What did you say?  I'll make a motion for alternative one.  He actually said .  I'll give you a second with the friendly amendment that what we talked about internal affairs,  which is potentially preserving some of the trees to maintain some diversity in the community.  If there weren't there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there be there would there would there be there would there would there be there would there would there be there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there would there  during the internal affairs meeting.  If there were some that could be saved  and not mess up the thorough way of the walkway,  I don't know how you're going to do that.  I'm all fine for that.  I don't know if that's good enough direction for you.  That is.  We'll work very closely with our urban forest manager  to evaluate all those trees.  A lot of that would come once we have direction  on these alignments and more design details  so we can really get into the weeds of that.  No pun intended.  The trees and the weeds.  That's good.  There's a whole bunch of really bad puns you can make.  Mr. Bennett, do you have further comment?  My concern is we don't have,  we haven't made a decision yet  about the width of the sidewalks.  So my question is,  if we were to move forward with alternative one,  all of that's going to be engineered,  played out, decisions made,  depending on the size of the sidewalk.  And on the width of the sidewalk.  In some instances, maybe there wouldn't be room for a tree.  And in some places else,  there might be room for trees closer together.  So that's my,  it's like we're putting the cart in front of the horse  with this particular item.  Yeah, I think part of this consideration  is looking at the pictures up there.  You have features that don't have,  that lack the root barrier protection, irrigation,  the inability to put flush-mounted,  or even the !  So, you know,  I think that's a good point.  So, yeah, I think that's a good point.  So, yeah, I think that's a good point.  I think my concern on this  is just the diversity of trees,  making sure that we have a unique look to the downtown.  So, as long as that's kept to,  I'm fine with moving that direction.  So, we have a motion on the second.  Yep.  I cannot remember who made the second.  Yes, Council Member Winslam  seconded it with a friendly amendment.  All right, thank you.  All right, when you're ready.  So, let me just put these in.  Council Member Bennett,  Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan,  Yes.  Council Member Winslow,  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds,  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge,  Aye.  Carries 5-0 with one absence and one recusal.  Okay.  Bike lane buffer options recommendation number three.  Again, this assumes,  there's some assumptions here,  that we select an option in the main and Broadway configuration  that includes a bike lane,  even if it was off street,  on a side street, in theory, this would apply.  So, looking for a direction on what we would like to see.  So, again, the staff recommendation is the one in the middle of the sidewalk,  or the bike lane with the landscape strip.  Our second recommendation would be the planters,  and the third would be the fence and the hardscape.  So, but someone mentioned this when they were speaking too.  So, if in fact you choose the center one,  but yet you have parking along that strip.  Yeah.  Are there any other options?  To cross them through planters and dirt?  We would have to incorporate some hardscape,  probably elements so you can walk across.  Yeah.  Obviously, yeah, we would not want to direct pedestrians  to walk down the street.  We don't need any more liability.  Inside traffic.  So, we would have to create gaps and probably poor intermittent steps  or hardscape so that people exiting their vehicles have access to get to the sidewalk.  Gotcha.  So, if I can make a comment.  Sure.  For that right.  For that reason, and I've seen that done a lot of places.  Inevitably, wherever the hardscape is, is not where the passenger door is.  Yeah.  It just never seems to work out that way.  So, my motion would be where we decide to have bike lanes.  This is not saying this is going to be made in broad.  Wherever they go, my motion would be to go with, in your mind, option two,  which is number one on our screen, the planters.  The left hand side.  Where we decide to have bike lanes, go with the planters.  The fence, I think, is impractical, especially if there's parking and the landscape,  well, I think, looks the best.  It also, if it grows too much, you can't see and you're just not going to know where to park.  Well, the advantage in the planters as well is that it creates a real solid buffer and barrier,  whereas plant, you know, bushes are not necessarily.  The tree just next to a tree.  The only challenge, Brendan, you're going to have to figure this out.  Not a baby tree.  Like when you park in the middle one and you don't end up parking where the hardscape is.  So, if you park where the planter is,  you can't open your passenger door.  True.  You have to fix that.  We can, I'm confident in our.  Thank you.  A lot of the places currently, you can't open your door because it's too high.  Because the curb's too high.  The curb's too high.  Maybe not in your truck, but in my car.  The curb's been pushed up by the failed sewer line.  Yes, there you go.  Dale has something.  All right, Mr. Bennett.  So, because of the complications I've always had in the shopping center business with, you know,  landscaping and all of the problems that come up with it, and this would require irrigation,  it's going to require maintenance, it's going to require ongoing expense.  So, I'm leaning heavily towards the concrete median with the fence.  Once, done once and all done is the way, it just, it's going to be a headache for somebody to take care of this.  Plus, people just inherently throw things away.  They throw trash in planters all the time.  So, you've got all these, and I agree that it would look better.  It's more aesthetically pleasing, but the amount of complications and expense and ongoing maintenance,  I think, overrides that to some extent.  You're going to be planting new trees right on the sidewalk a few feet away.  So, I'm leaning heavily towards just do it once, get it done.  But I would like the five foot width.  If there is a part of the concrete.  I'm going to say curb.  Can that.  I would suggest request.  Ask that there be narrowed down.  And it's a big piece of concrete.  Is it because of a safety factor?  Or is it because that's how it just ended up.  We can narrow that down in that option.  I think the 5-foot especially is relevant for the landscape parking strip.  To have adequate width for trees to go in.  with the root zone of that tree and the root barrier.  So yeah, the hardscape option,  we can certainly reduce that down,  probably even the planter option.  The sidewalks are five feet, so I mean.  I believe the design guideline,  and don't quote me on this exactly,  I think it's a minimum of three feet  to be considered a protected bike lane.  So there's minimum standards on all that.  And yeah, so the hardscape item and then the plantership,  I think we could probably lower that from the five foot.  Planters are watered how?  Yes.  Okay.  You know, similar to,  I think what you see in the planters downtown right now,  obviously if we're tearing up the roads,  we're putting in irrigation conduits  that would be stubbed up in those pre-identified locations.  So it would actually have irrigation built in?  Yeah. Okay.  All right.  So you're saying that you would have a-  No, water truck.  Sounds tedious.  So, all right.  Entertain motion.  May I?  Nobody seconded it.  Did we get a second?  No.  I'll second it,  but I want to give it the caveat of,  I'm not saying that I'm agreeing  that these bike lanes necessarily should be  where they are future.  So if we are going to do planners  and if we are going to have protection,  I agree with either one or two.  I actually don't mind either.  I love the fence.  I think the one and done is great,  but the reality of somebody parking on this side of the fence  and how they're going to get up and over it,  and then you're going to have to do gaps.  And I just, I think that's not going to work.  And when you drive by Children's Park,  it's just not that.  And I mean, I understand we're keeping high school kids safe,  you know, kind of, but it's just not,  doesn't have the feeling of what I think we are looking  for for our downtown.  All right.  So we have a motion and a second on this item.  Well, may I?  No. Yes.  I think that the fence would be like done once,  but done badly.  I hate the wrought iron fences.  I think they're so hostile to human activity  and to plant life as a matter of fact.  In which case the planters are a little bit better,  but still I don't feel like that's us doing it well at all.  We have the opportunity to put another row of trees in downtown  and we're in Chico.  People love trees.  I think it's worth a little bit of an investment.  Certainly if there's parking there,  I think we can work it out.  So, yeah.  Actually, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there  Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Really? No. Okay. It fails 2-3 with 1-0-1 absence and 1 recusal.  I'm going to make a motion that we do a mix of planters and trees. Planters and trees? Yeah.  Can we get staff comment on that? If and in fact we end up doing bike line.  I think there's options. Yeah. There's certain opportunities to maybe come up with a hybrid approach there.  Sure.  Where there's strategically placed planter strips that have the ability.  Now we're going to be committed to that 5-foot width there.  So we might have wider planters as those happen.  But I think there's opportunities.  Because obviously when you plant trees, you bring up trees on the sidewalk and then you have trees in the planter strip.  So we'd space those accordingly.  And so those might be intermittent little.  Planter strips, planter islands, and then you have the larger physical barriers in between those.  So I think that's feasible.  Okay. Give me that. I'll second that.  All right. Madam Clerk.  Okay. Just get that motion in.  Council Member Bennett?  Still no.  Council Member Morgan?  We get lax continuity and a little piecemeal.  So again, no.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 3-2 with one absence, one recusal.  No, we're not taking another recess.  All right.  Recommendation number four.  We're getting close here.  So the inclusion of second, third, and fourth streets.  Again, the concept being incorporating bicycle facilities, maintaining parking on both sides of the street,  reducing the lanes.  We're focusing on the lanes and traffic, what's termed a road diet, especially on third and fourth streets.  Second street's a little bit easier.  There's more of a road widening.  There's some unnecessary two lanes there.  It all comes down to one lane for the roundabout as well.  So the question is, should we include this in the project design?  Can I start?  Sure.  Okay.  I think that the third and fourth street connections to the park are one of the most important lanes.  beautiful aspects of this project that really like expand the potential of this  like safe connectivity in the core of our city all the way up the park to  everybody who lives near the park and if you can access the park safely on your  bike and you'd be able to get all the way to downtown all the way up the S  line all the way up to the airport actually it would be such a dramatic  step forward for the like the like safe connectivity over the city that I think  it should be obvious that we incorporated those are not like heavy  traffic streets like traffic can flow on one lane you're maintaining the parking  all the way through it there's still that access that's there the two lanes  is really unnecessary in each direction with the kind of flow that you get there  but the potential for even if even if some people just use it sometimes but  the experience of coming to Chico and you can rent a bike if you're just  visiting or living somewhere and being able to get all the way up the park  without ever encountering some of these traffic nightmares that that we live  every day those of us who ride bikes around well there's a lot of potential  for it I also think that within downtown too like you said that there's not  there's a there's a  bottleneck in there and the two lanes do not really serve as much as people  think that they might and this this idea that because delivery trucks park there  now they will if there's one lane and there's nothing we can do about that and  like we are just helpless before these delivery truck tyrants but we do have  police department who are capable of enforcing the laws against against  inhibiting traffic like that so I think that the problems that are named with  this are very solvable and the benefits are tremendous and will make our  community so much more of an appealing place to other people and then for those  of us who already live here we'll we'll just dramatically improve the the  quality of life for getting around without a car.  So Mr. Bennett where you going to go?  I don't want to talk over you sir.  Sir.  Thank you.  Being from the retail arena the  thought of losing parking I don't like. The  thought of losing parking I don't like. The  thought of one lane and possibly a truck blocking that one lane and everything backing up,  I don't like. I don't like losing stalls or the one lane. That scares me to death.  While it's certainly admirable to improve bicycle safety and bicycling in Chico,  I think I would like to see this reworked such that we maintain the traffic flow and the stalls  and try and work something else out regarding the bike situation.  That is my thought.  Mr. Morgan.  So.  In reverse order, I think, with all due respect, I disagree with Mr. Winslow.  There's a lot of consternation and I don't know.  We get along a lot.  A lot of consternation and gnashing of teeth about going from three lanes to two on main and Broadway.  So to go from two lanes to one on second, third and fourth, I just can't fathom it.  I don't think we need to open all three of them to make this a bikeable community.  I'm all for bikes.  Downtown's a bad place for them for obvious reasons.  I would be happy with any of the alternatives on 4th Street.  4th Street goes right by City Plaza.  We don't need to cross it over every single time to make it accessible on every single street.  If the bike lane is clear, whether it comes from Salem or wherever it comes from, get over on 4th.  It takes them right to the park.  But all of them, that doesn't need to happen.  And where I disagreed with you, sir, was one.  We have a lot of officers.  We have a lot of laws.  We have a lot of things that are not being enforced, not because the officers won't, but they've got to do the priority thing.  So the people are going to double park.  The delivery trucks are going to do what they're going to do.  So I'm unwilling to go to one lane on any of them.  But if we can make 4th work to get all the way through, I'm willing to look at that design as long as it continues to be two lanes.  But I don't know that you're going to get them.  I can make that a motion, but I don't know if you're going to, if you need that to go back.  Okay.  I'll work on some of that or not.  That would help for staff.  I don't think that's necessarily a bad idea either.  For 2nd Street, it's a little different.  I'll just add that I know we've heard from some restaurants that there's a desire, especially on that, I guess that would be the north side, where there's diagonal parking.  It's prohibitive to then have an outdoor dining cafe because by the time you widen the sidewalk, you're essentially removing like six parking stalls.  And so parking.  So parking is a little bit of a  problem.  Yeah.  Yeah. there at... I hear what you're saying, but it's two lanes from Broadway to Main. Yeah. And I'm actually going to use 2nd Street as an example later of two lanes that can work. But if you take that down to one lane... Yeah. We would still at intersections have, we'd have to remove some parking as you get to the  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. as two lanes, find a way to make the bike path work so it goes all the way through on 4th. But did you say that you wanted to keep two lanes on 4th or you've accepted that that can be a one lane all the way through? I'll accept that it could be, but I'd rather see the bike lane with the two lanes.  I'll accept that it could be, but I'd rather see the bike lane with the two lanes.  Just take out the sidewalks or something?  Yeah, there you go.  I mean, at the end of the day, we can't have 20-foot sidewalks, room for cafes, room for pedestrians, room for bikes, and rooms for my truck.  Right.  So there has to be give and take, and I think we're actually doing a fairly good job of doing that.  Yeah.  I wouldn't want to see second and third, which are more, I think, heavily traveled than fourth.  But if you can make fourth work, get your bike lane on there, and keep it two lanes, fantastic.  And I will say fourth is the main entry at Cypress to South Park Drive.  Yeah.  So that was a motion.  Mr. Morgan, I'd be happy to second your motion.  I think somebody probably else will, too, if I don't.  But if you at least, you know, when we're bringing it back, maybe the alternative one lane and two lane both come back?  On fourth?  Yeah, just fourth.  Yeah, if you can make it work.  Okay, then I'll second the motion with the amendment.  I wonder.  For my brain, working this out, is we have this, like, tight grid in downtown, unique among areas in Chico,  and you have the opportunity, then, for traffic to distribute.  So we've created these one ways, and so we're saying we need two lanes in each direction.  And, like, so should we consider turning Fifth Street into four lanes, then, in order to accommodate what we think is the traffic that we need here?  Oh, I'll make that motion.  That's just my case in opposing it, is that traffic does flow well enough.  I think we're not going to have to do that.  I think we're going to have to do that.  It's not like there's not, like, these terrible issues of backing up and sitting in gridiron traffic on Third Street.  It simply is not the case.  I don't think we have anything that would say that that is the case.  But we do lack safe bicycle access.  So you, all the things you mentioned, your truck can get through, and people could bike and walk safely, but only if we balance all these things.  Like, if you give two lanes to your truck, then we are giving up the safe access for other people.  So it really is, it is, like, more convenient, like, fast access.  It really is the speeds that you get when you have that.  Like, extra space, being able to navigate around somebody who might be stopped there.  But it comes at the expense of safety for everybody else.  And that's where I stand firm, is we should be trying to guarantee that everybody can get here somewhat comfortably and safely  and not give the priority to cars being able to just move quicker through the space.  It doesn't give anything to anybody, really.  All right.  Vice Mayor?  I would, excuse me, I would disagree.  We're not giving priority to cars.  We're just trying to make the traffic flow work.  So it's got to be, as...  Mr. Morgan mentioned, it's a give and take on these things.  We can't have it, we can't have it all without giving up someplace else.  So I'm just going to say one thing for everybody out there that's having heart attacks.  We're making votes to do stuff.  Just understand that, A, this isn't happening for five to ten years.  And, B, we're giving direction to have staff come back with something else.  So this could look completely different by the time it comes back to us.  And I would also say to the third street,  if we do take it down to one lane, I'm not saying our truck drivers are horrible people,  but the reality is you're not going to park on second or first or main  and put stuff on a dolly and walk it two or three blocks over.  So I know that there was a conversation about delivery zones  and possibly it's a delivery zone during the day and parking at night.  Maybe we look at that.  If it's going to go to one lane, if it does.  But I just don't see how you can possibly take it.  If you're going to take it to one lane and still have deliveries come.  Deliveries are going to have to come.  I think we can eventually train our truck drivers.  It's not going to be easy.  I think it could happen.  But I'm telling you, since COVID and 2020 and delivery chain,  I have deliveries come every single day.  And you take them when you can get them.  It's a huge, huge issue.  I don't think it's going to be this way forever.  I think that other cities have adapted to the fact that all deliveries have to be done before 10 a.m.  I think we can get there.  But I just wanted to throw a couple of those comments out there,  because I know there's business owners that are concerned about how they're going to get their goods.  And remember, while we're talking about all this,  94 to 95 percent of the people that come downtown right now that are supporting the businesses come in a car.  So cars, I'm sorry if you don't like cars.  I'm sorry if you want to come on your bike.  And that's awesome.  I come on my bike sometimes, too.  But cars are important to business owners that have customers coming to them.  A follow-up to your point is there aren't any delivery trucks on 4th,  because there's so many.  There's nothing to deliver to.  Correct.  So if you had to make it one lane, that's the place to do it.  Yeah.  Those are good points.  I think the delivery truck thing is really important.  We've heard that very clearly.  I think maybe one lesson would be is that we should have had a more fleshed-out proposal for it.  I'd say we're putting the hand truck before the delivery truck here a little bit in making these decisions.  I don't think that we should consider, like, not giving bicycle access on these streets,  because we consider that it might be a problem for delivery trucks.  And like you mentioned, there's an hours consideration that would help a lot.  But also, people can roll stuff on those hand trucks for more than a block.  There's actually a business that's been rolling bread on a cart down the sidewalk blocks away for a while now,  quite successfully, I think.  All right.  We have a motion on second.  Okay.  Is the motion to move the hand truck to the side of the road?  Yes.  Is there a motion for engineering to come back with some options and or a change regarding our comments?  Is that, or are we voting yes or no because we want this to move forward as is?  And I think that's what the motion was, wasn't it?  My motion was to throw out second and third, find a way to make the bike lanes work on fourth with options for both one and two lanes.  Okay.  Yes.  That's what I heard.  All right.  Madam Clark, did I get that right?  Yes.  Thank you.  All right.  When you're ready.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  It carries 4-1 with one absence and one recusal.  All right.  No.  I didn't say nay.  I said aye.  All right.  Main Street and Broadway.  And a fun one.  So recommendation number five would be to move this back to the side lanes.  for the cross-section features for both Main Street and Broadway Street. So again, to recount  the alternatives, alternative one would be direction to staff with input. We don't necessarily  need maybe a formal action, but at least dialogue, verbal direction on prioritization of these  three elements. Alternative two would be the class four bidirectional path on Main Street.  And alternative three would consider the class two protected lanes on both Main and  Broadway.  Okay. Can you go back to those and have the actual, yeah. Like I want to look at this  view of each of them just real quick.  So this is alternative two. This would be...  So are we going to discuss, or should we discuss all of them, Broadway and Main at the same  time?  What do you prefer?  I mean, you can do it independently or together, depending on the outcome. I mean, they're  pretty independent of one another in a lot of ways.  All right. So alternative two, Broadway. Let's see alternative two, Main. All right. And  then alternative, what is it?  Oh.  Three. Yeah, there we go. So alternative one, just what we have.  Alternative one would be direction for staff to come back with different ideas and options.  Okay.  To implement more based on the prioritization of those three elements.  Gotcha.  So again, I think we recognize as staff, you know, this option and reduction of 93 parking stalls,  on-street parking stalls, some of which are in obviously the main core area of downtown,  which has the highest parking occupancy rates, would be significantly impactful. So, you know,  just throwing that out there.  If there's any other ideas out there, we might consider reducing some of those features, like the  18-foot sidewalks down to 14 feet on both sides, and put parking on both sides, and come back with  that as an option. They may come back with no bike lane on Main or Broadway and maximize parking.  We can come up with different ideas that the council considers as priorities of those three  features.  Okay.  Come back to that.  All right. Mr. Bennett?  Okay.  Okay.  After listening, after the city survey, and after the reading through the DCBA survey several times,  in listening to what many of our citizens are concerned about with the changes to Main and Broadway,  I definitely think we need to go with alternative one, which is to come back with some other options.  I haven't heard, except for the bicyclists, of course, they do enjoy the,  the safety and the improvement regarding bicycling.  But I've also heard a lot of people say that they are concerned about these changes.  It's too drastic.  It's too much.  It's not Chico anymore.  All of those comments.  So I can't help but think we need to go with, I need to go with number one so we can look at some other ideas.  Thank you.  I think what they're asking for in that is to...  You know that, right?  Is to prioritize those things.  So just saying going with the number one, it's like you need to say like you want on street parking to be more important than walking or biking.  That's the question there.  That'd be helpful to receive like a ranking maybe of, hey, I'd prioritize on street parking, then sidewalks, then bicycle facilities.  Or I prioritize bicycle facilities, then on street parking, then sidewalks.  That'd help with just some verbal direction to staff.  So as we come up with different options, Council Member Morgan mentioned earlier, I mean,  there's a lot of different ways you can manipulate and move.  You prioritize one thing and then you're giving up on another option.  So we can come up with a lot of different cross sections, but it'd be helpful to understand the Council's priorities of those three features.  Yeah.  I think the problem is, is I'm not going to go, that's one, that's two, that's three.  Because it's more like, no.  I will.  I don't.  I know you will, but I won't.  So, and the reason, so let me start as we move through this.  Because we obviously need to move through this.  And it looks like we're going to be maybe going back, getting some further recommendations.  Is you have people up here, some of us which live close to downtown because we're in districts now, who don't even own cars.  We have some of us up here who only live really far away from the downtown who only have cars and probably never touch a bicycle.  And then you have some of us up here who do both.  So, you know, we're representative of our community in that respect.  The reason why we're doing the downtown projects, we're ripping up the sewers.  I can't tell you how much I get asked that question.  And that is the question.  Why are you guys doing this?  Why are you wasting our money?  Why aren't you filling potholes inside?  It's a sewer 70 to 100 years old downtown.  Unless you want sewage all over your downtown, we're going to have to fix it.  So, that's why we're doing this.  So, we're ripping it up anyway.  We can build whatever back pretty much we want within the same cost, close to the same class.  So, at this point, if I had to do a priority, you know, certainly I'd...  I'm very concerned about the delivery aspects.  On-street parking, keeping the same numbers is very important to me.  I would like to see Maines stay.  You know, maybe that's the opportunity for a bike lane, but not on Broadway.  So, but I don't know exactly in terms of doing this if you want specifics on what to bring back.  I'm not going to give you specifics.  Because I've been listening to the people.  And I'd rather you come back with some other options.  I'm not going to categorize these.  I'm not going to list them out.  That's not why I'm here.  I'm a policymaker.  I'm not a detail engineer.  So, I'm not going to do it.  All right.  Vice Mayor.  Sean.  Sean.  Go ahead.  You did talk first.  I didn't talk first.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Prioritize parking.  Number one.  Then prioritize trying to keep it.  You're going to understand this.  As Chico has possible.  Okay.  I'm never going to vote for the bike lanes on Main and Broadway.  I think it's a bad idea because it's going to cost parking.  And whatever the percentage is, whatever the statistics show, it's just not that many people will be punishing the business owner.  All right.  A street that seems to work has an example.  It's Second Street between Broadway and Main.  On one side, you've got diagonal parking, which adds parking.  The other side, you've got parallel parking.  It is two lanes.  I'm not excited about two lanes unless it gained us significant parking, which I think is 60.  And it would also require some code or ordinance that levied hugely.  Huge punishable fine on anybody that double parked.  Like $500.  Make sure that is not happening again.  It will take some training to do it.  Is the tradeoff worth it?  The 60 additional spaces for the two lanes.  We're going to get some more community input, I think, based on that.  Which means then you have to figure out what do you do with those bike lanes.  Do you go down Salem, which you said was problematic, or do you go down Wall?  You thought you could make that work.  As far as keeping it Chico.  I have an analogy.  And I believe you were here for that.  And you mentioned earlier, if you decide to move that bike lane, you've got to go back and do traffic studies and all this other stuff.  Brendan, I don't think you do.  I think you've been here long enough.  I think we've all been here long enough.  I remember a very long meeting where the council elected to put a roundabout at East First and the Esplanade.  And all the traffic studies and all the data showed this was the way to keep traffic moving.  And this was going to change Chico and all those things.  And the citizens went nuts.  And had we done it, there'd still be people trapped in that roundabout right now trying to find their way out.  Because while the data may have supported it, it just didn't fit this community.  Which is where we get into the two to three street thing.  But I think we can get some people to buy into the two streets if we can gain parking and make sure we enforce the double parking thing.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I think that gets into the culture of it.  I think the bikers, bicycles, will understand you need to follow this route.  We are giving you a route to the park and everywhere else.  I just, I'll be tart and feathered for this.  I don't think riding your bike down Main and Broadway is a good idea.  I would never have my kid ride their bike down Main or Broadway.  I would never ride my bike down Main.  You're going to get hit by a car.  Particularly if we've got diagonal parking there.  You can't see it.  When you back up, you're going to run into a bike.  It's not safe.  It's not the car's fault.  Blame them all you want.  So, how do we keep it safe for everybody?  I think that's pretty good direction.  Yep.  All right.  Give me a second.  So, we're getting some outbursts, too.  If we continue to do that, we'll just have you leave.  Thanks.  Okay.  No, I'm saying we're getting some outbursts in the back, and I prefer not to have them.  I want to say a couple things in response to that.  I have some general comments that you'll get to about, like, what is Chico, what would keeping a Chico be?  But in this, I think it's really important.  It's really important to keep in mind because it hasn't been mentioned since we've come back to this level of discussion.  This is what I would call policymaking, by the way, is determining priorities.  And one is that we're not getting the state or the federal government to help us with this project if we are going to prioritize cars.  Like, we just have to understand that we are pulling out of our general fund.  We are not fixing potholes in the rest of the city if we do not prioritize improving access for other people than who already have the access on cars.  The other is, respectfully, Council Member Morgan.  If you read the staff report, there is an alternative with...  You don't have to insult me.  If you read the staff report, alternative three has protected bike lanes on Main and Broadway and does not lose parking.  That is an option that's presented to us.  It just wasn't the recommendation of the Internal Affairs Committee.  All right.  How much direction do you need here?  Yes.  Is that enough?  Yes.  Yeah.  Vice Mayor, you can weigh in here.  I just wanted...  There was actually somebody that asked three specific questions.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Sewer lines.  I'm assuming we will work with the property owners to tie into their businesses on that.  Yeah.  Okay.  And other cities said, have we reached out to other cities?  Have we gone to other cities?  My understanding is we have a consultant that's working here with us on this that has actually done this in another city and has some good information to give to us.  Across the country, they've done several large projects.  I think Minneapolis, some Seattle, some California cities.  So, yeah, they've done...  Which I like.  I like the fact that we're...  We're not taking this on.  We've never done anywhere else.  Yeah.  And for clarity on the sewer stuff, what our intention would do is to serve laterals to  the properties that then hook up to the laterals.  And then the property owner takes it from there.  Yeah.  And then construction for Esplanade.  Construction for Esplanade starting here in a few weeks from what I understand.  And we're way out on this.  Probably about a month or so.  Yeah.  So, we're starting Esplanade in about a month.  And this is five, 10 years down the road depending on how many grant rounds we go through and  what we decide and everything.  I thought they were good questions.  So, I just wanted to answer those.  I know we don't always take public input, but...  Or not...  We take public input, but we very rarely have the opportunity up here to answer and speak  back.  The garbage cans are a huge issue.  We've got to figure that out.  Like, we have garbage...  People that have literally no outside space.  So, they're pulling their garbage cans into their lobbies at nighttime and putting them  back out like that.  So, we definitely got to work on that.  We're absolutely not here with...  I don't know.  I don't think with what we have.  I think we've given a lot of input.  I'm not saying we need to...  I don't want to give up the ATP grant funds.  I don't think you're realistically...  If you put a bike lane going two ways on Main Street and you have nothing on Broadway, you're  not ever going to convince me that your bikes aren't automatically going to go on Broadway  because naturally bikes go with the flow of traffic.  So, I inherently see a problem.  I don't see the two-way.  Although it's the most protected and everything else, I just realistically don't see it working.  So, if we do have bike lanes, I think smaller ones on both sides so people are going with  traffic, which is what they're used to doing when they drive around town.  I love connecting to Fourth and getting that connection in.  And I think we could probably get away with one lane on Fourth in some places if we can  make it work with Stobel and Diamond and all that.  I don't know.  Gosh, there were so many comments.  And so many...  Good.  Good things.  I just would encourage everybody to...  Brendan has committed that we are not going to do something for Chico that's not Chico  just to make a deadline.  It would be great.  We definitely need those funds.  And it would be great to have that come out of another place.  But we shouldn't sacrifice who and what we are as a community and what we want for our  community just to make a grant deadline.  So, I would recommend that you take the input from Mr. Morgan and Mr. Winslow.  And come back with...  Can we mesh all of that together?  Still be ADP eligible?  And can we keep as many lanes open as possible?  Prioritize nice garbage cans and parking for bicycles and everything.  I know I want my cake and eat it too.  And it's not possible.  But bring us back some drawings.  Bring them back quick.  Okay.  And go to Flume.  We don't have to use Wall.  We can go Flume.  And then you don't have to go through the Boys and Girls Club. Flume and then you don't have to go through the Boys and Girls Club in City Hall. Maybe that's  Right.  Maybe that's an option.  I don't know.  So, that's what I got.  Back to the drawing board quickly.  Bring it back.  All right.  Mr. Bennett, do you have something further to add?  You've made comments, but you didn't specifically denote anything.  No, I just...  I appreciate everything you've done.  I'm looking forward to you coming back to us with some options so we can keep this moving  forward.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, Brennan, the only thing I would add is that I think it's a great idea to have a  new design.  I think the other thing I would add is that, you know, realizing that perhaps the designer  has done multiple cities and gone and looked at multiple cities and redone them, I'm more  interested in finding out where they are 10 years later.  So, I think that's a priority, not necessarily how beautiful it looked and how great it was  year one, two, or three, but how it looked 10 years later.  Okay.  So, I think that's really important.  I know bicycle facilities makes this financially worthwhile, but that, you know, we need that  grant funding in some respect, but...  Yeah.  I think you've got fairly good direction here.  Yep, absolutely.  Is there fairly good direction?  I feel like I just heard contradictory things.  We're supposed to give priorities.  He said parking before everything else, and I'm not sure that that's what I'm hearing  from everybody else.  That is certainly not how I feel.  I don't think he's heard that from everybody else.  I think he's heard a wide variety.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I'm saying it's contradictory.  So, I'm sure...  What kind of direction are we giving?  We've got to make, like, a firm enough decision to get somewhere, right?  Well, I think he understands some of his options don't work.  Respectfully, it was a request, not a must, you must do this.  Yeah.  Well, the request that we have to us is to prioritize these functions, and Councilmember  Morgan was fully willing to give the priorities, done this policymaking job.  I'm not hearing that from anybody else.  I'm, like, what's...  Where are we going with this?  All right.  All right.  All right.  One minute.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Mr. Al-Abbani, hearing everything you've heard from the variety of Councilmembers up here,  do you think you'd be able to bring back a couple of varied alternatives?  Yes.  I think we can bring back alternatives with the different...  That four or...  Balancing them.  As we have another Councilor join us, five of us could agree on.  Yeah.  Or...  Well, I can't commit to that.  Still four.  Still four.  Sore.  We only need four.  Yeah.  I think we can come with some different options for those cross-sections.  Absolutely.  We've heard a lot of feedback tonight, obviously, through the survey, through the...  Stakeholder engagement.  And so I'm confident we can come back with, you know, maybe four or five options that  prioritize those different features and elements and be more...  We've heard a lot of elements clearly.  I think we can come with some ideas.  All right.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  We appreciate it.  We appreciate everybody's patience.  We have one very short item next.  So instead of heading towards the exits, I'd say if you do that, do it quietly because  we're going to move on to item 5.0.  I'm going to Mr. Guff's.  Yeah.  I hate to break everybody's heart that I don't have a presentation for you tonight.  All right.  Oh, we need to get Tom.  Let's give time for folks to clear out.  As you're clearing out, folks, if you could keep the conversation to a minimum, we'd appreciate  it.  All right.  Mr. Guff's.  Go ahead.  Thank you, counsel.  Yeah, this will be quick.  This is just an item to approve a fleet procurement and specification policy.  All right.  Keep going.  Okay.  A fleet procurement and specification policy just to memorialize a process for procuring  vehicles and equipment in the city.  Components of the policy are just basically to establish usage parameters for current  vehicles and equipment, replacement criteria for when those vehicles are replaced, a process  for new vehicle requests, and of course, standardization through the procurement and  procurement process that ultimately saves dollars in long-term lifecycle costs.  That's it.  Simple.  Policy for procuring fleet vehicles and equipment.  And I can answer any questions.  All right.  Any questions?  How did you do it before?  I mean, this all seems very straightforward.  We followed basically the parameters of the policy for large items such as fire apparatus  and patrol cars, where we design a specification committee of representatives.  And then, you know, the collaborative process from both the using departments and the supporting  department, which was fleet services.  This just really memorializes that procedure when it's needed.  Thank you.  So is anyone going to lose their government car as a result of this?  No, but it just, it does, you know, kind of put some standards out there for usage criteria.  I think, you know, we, Fleet Services, you know, constantly optimizes a fleet as much  as possible.  And if there's low-use vehicles, we raise a hand and say, hey, this vehicle's not going  to get utilized.  Is there another part of the city or another department in the city that could use it a  little bit better?  If there are, we move them around.  If not, then we surplus the vehicle.  So we have a pretty constant handle on that.  This policy just, again, delineates and memorializes it for us.  All right.  Further questions?  I'm assuming we have 12 speakers.  24.  No, none.  None.  All right.  Well, we were giving out 30 minutes per speaker, but oh well.  All right.  Entertaining motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion by Council Member Bennett, I think, gets that one.  Vice Mayor Reynolds gets the second.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  All right.  Reports and communications, following reports and communications items are provided for the  Council's information.  No action can be taken on these items under this section of the agenda unless Council  agrees to a subsequent agenda.  6.1.  City Manager's report?  No report.  All right.  The monthly financial report and budget information monitoring reports was attached for information  only.  Item 6.3, Council Member requests the following reports and communication items are provided  for the Council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section of the agenda unless the Council agrees  to include it on a subsequent agenda.  Do we have any Council Member requests?  I have one.  All right.  Council Member Winslow?  Aye.  Clock 2.  Clock 2.  Clock 2.  Clock 2.  Clock 2. That's like what Caltrans has as a key part of it. It's also one of the most dangerous areas where somebody recently about my age was hit and seriously injured there and just a couple years before. Somebody else about my age, who's a friend of a friend, was killed there on his motorcycle. And so when we're looking at improving the safety of downtown, I think it's really important that we have some conversation with Caltrans and Caltrans is not known for  and Caltrans is not known for caring what the public has to say.  But us being the city council, I think we might have a little bit more sway.  So I'd like the motion to have a discussion on sending a letter to Caltrans  requesting participation in our Complete Treats Project downtown.  Second.  That was a motion, yes.  All right.  I'll second.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Can I ask a question?  Is that, Brendan's not in here, but is that something that's already being done?  Well, I'm asking for, it's the policymaker request to it.  So they can talk to the engineers.  Of course, they have some coordination with staff,  but it's different from getting that kind of direction that, like,  the local government of Chico wants Caltrans to participate,  which they can always say no to because they're the state.  But I still think it's worth a letter.  Gotcha.  Okay.  I'll probably say yes.  They seem pretty agreeable, usually.  Council Member Bennett.  As long as it's just...  Just a simple letter.  Yes.  This would be the, yeah, bringing it back for discussion.  Council Member Morgan.  Aye.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 5-1 with one absence.  All right.  Any further requests?  Seeing none, we will adjourn.  Thank you.  Thank you.
