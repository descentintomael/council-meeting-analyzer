 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening.  Good.  This week, August 3rd through the 10th,  this is the Hiroshima  National  of the Akasaki Remembrance and Resology.  And I've been asked to read a proclamation.  Whereas the city is the basic cell of nations,  and roughly half of the world population now lives in cities,  and in a world of intensifying globalization,  all cities are in different degree also connected  globally beyond their regions.  And whereas the city of Chico, which now supports population  over 100,000, has witnessed the destruction of its neighbor city,  Paras, and other surrounding townships due to the 2008 campfire,  which devastated the economy and crippled the education,  health care, and safety and security systems of those communities.  And whereas 75 years ago,  this year, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, two harsh Japanese cities,  were destroyed by atomic bombs with even more total devastation  than our neighbor cities, and the use of nuclear weapons  was introduced to nations.  Whereas, due to a large part of the dedicated work of the survivors  of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on July 7, 2017,  an overwhelming majority of the world's nations voted to adopt  a treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons,  a landmark international agreement that outlaws ultimate weapons  of mass destruction and establishes a pathway to their elimination.  It is now the subject of an effort called the International Campaign  to Abolish Nuclear Weapons to convince the United States government  to sign the treaty.  And whereas the U.S. Conference of Mayors on June 30, 2020,  has endorsed the International Mayors for Peace  called for membership to recall the 75 years of effort  to end the nuclear existential threat and the delusion of deterrence.  And whereas for 60 years, also this year,  the Chico Peace Virgil has continued the work of three Chico women  aware enough to oppose the planned Titan missile silos,  reminding Chicoans to endeavor for peace.  Now, therefore, be it resolved that I,  Anne Schwab, Mayor of the City of Chico,  on behalf of the City Council,  do hereby join in the effort and declare the week of August 3, 2010,  to be the week of Hiroshima and Nagasaki remembrance and resolve.  Thank you, Mayor, for committing the City to reflection on these 75 years.  Both...  of the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons,  but also of efforts to deconstruct and put an end to nuclear weapons  by both survivors and even authors and developers of these weapons.  So I think it's really important for us to reflect upon this.  75 years is longer than over 90% of the people in this world have been alive.  It's...  Let's see.  So...  I just want to make sure that people can be aware that,  you know, the issues that have confronted us,  the homelessness, the economic situation of our city,  and now the pandemic,  have really pressed upon the city and people and everybody there.  They're pressed upon us.  They're pressed upon their time and their energy.  But there's the...  But this...  These situations, particularly the COVID,  has overshadowed other imminent and critical issues.  And that is the proliferation of...  or the march to nuclear war  that our country and other countries are continuing to do.  So it's important...  You know, we can see our issues,  but you can't really see these sort of issues.  The...  The...  The...  The Bulletin of Atomic Sciences,  which began 75 years ago,  right after the detonation of the atomic bomb,  has been issuing every year about the situation  of where we are in respect to our ultimate annihilation.  And they've created what's called the Doomsday Clock.  Many people perhaps have heard of this.  This year, in January,  the Bulletin declared that we are 100 minutes from midnight.  This is less than a two-minute warning  to look at our plans  and change our strategies to what we have to do.  So, anyway, I want to just hope that everybody here  and everybody in the city can take this to heart  and understand that the...  the case of nuclear weapons is a no-win situation,  and we can do whatever we can do is... is good.  And cities are a very important part of this.  Thank you very much for the work that you're doing  and bringing this to our attention.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Great. !  I would appreciate it if this council would recognize  a moment of silence for the incident that occurred  eight hours ago in Beirut, Lebanon.  Obviously not a war situation,  but a devastating impact  to a community that could not sustain it.  They're suffering throughout the world,  and they're suffering right here in this community,  but the explosion today was something horrific.  So I'd appreciate a moment of silence recognizing that.  Yes, please join me in a moment of silence.  Thank you for bringing that to our attention.  There's a closed session announcement  from the July 15th special closed session meeting.  The city council met in closed session,  during which time interviews of various city attorney firms were held.  Upon the end of that session,  the council voted five to two,  Schwab and Horry opposed,  to select the firm of Colu...  Tuono, Highsmith, and Wally, PC,  for city attorney services.  Staff will prepare the final agreement  and bring it back to official.  The council will then be able to  hold a future council meeting  for final action by the city council.  I would like to thank and welcome  the members of the public back to our meeting.  Instead of being virtual,  we've added the option of people  addressing the council in person.  I want to acknowledge and thank  the team of our city staff  who really have put a  hiraculent effort together to make sure that  this is possible.  We think we have thought out all of the bugs,  but you know, things may not go perfect,  and I ask for everyone's patience.  We will get better and better and better at this.  I would also ask for the members of the public,  while you are outside,  to please...  Please act as if you were inside our building,  and respect each other.  Be patient with one another.  Consider everyone's opinion  and give everyone the respect that they deserve,  so that we can run our meeting  as smoothly as possible.  We really appreciate everyone's comments,  and we want to hear them.  So I ask that you please respect that.  We will now move to the council.  I want to remind everyone that this meeting  is being conducted in accordance with  executive order N-2920.  The public may attend the meeting in person  at 421 Main Street.  4th Street will be closed to vehicular traffic  from Main to Wall Street for ease of movement  around the council chamber and speaker queuing area.  Those wishing to speak are encouraged to sign up  before the meeting through Engage Chico.  Speakers may also sign up to speak  by checking in at one of the speaker card tables  located near the sidewalk on 4th Street.  All speakers will be given instructions  to queue in the speaker line.  Please follow the instructions accordingly.  The public may view the meeting  on Compass Channel 11  or remote public participation  allowed in the following ways.  The Engage Chico Civic Engagement  Program will be available for citizen input  on individual agenda items  both prior to and during the meeting  and that program can be accessed  through the city's website.  Public comment will also be accepted  by email and can be sent to  publiccomment at chicoca.gov  during the meeting prior to the close  of public comment on an item.  The public is encouraged not to send  more than one email per item  and not to comment on numerous items  in one email.  Please note that in-person comments  can be made in person at this meeting.  In order to ensure the safety of our citizens,  face coverings are required  and all social distancing requirements  are in effect.  Staff will be outside helping to line up citizens  for when their names are called.  The city clerk will be calling the names  of the individuals to speak  and the amount of time allotted to each speaker  will be determined by the number of speakers  that are present.  It should be noted that if someone  cannot wear a face mask,  they may participate in the meeting  through the Engage Chico platform  or through email.  We want to protect the members of our staff  and members of the public during this process.  Thank you.  Council Member Orie is also joining us remotely.  He has access through WebEx.  He can participate in the meeting  at any time that he feels that he wants  to make a comment.  And I will be sure to call on him  while we are making comments  to make sure that he is engaged in the process.  So we'll start with the consent agenda.  The consent agenda is for items  that are routine in nature  and can be enacted in one motion.  Are there any council disqualifications  or no votes?  Mr. Orie, do you have any disqualification  or no vote?  Yes.  Okay.  Are there any speakers?  On this item.  If so, we will give them some time  to come into the lobby.  While we're waiting for them to queue up,  we'll ask the city clerk  if there are any public comments received  either through email  or through the Engage Chico platform.  So I do have one speaker  who said he would be here,  and that would be Jeff Creed  as an in-person speaker.  And any Engage Chico?  I think if we have any,  if we have any comments,  Engage Chico,  and I'm sorry,  I've got three computers in here.  I do not have any comments  under consent for Engage,  and we did not receive any comments  from the public comment side  of the email account.  So Jeff Creed.  We have one person to speak in person.  Mr. Creed,  you may address the council  for three minutes.  I'll be quicker than that.  Thank you, council.  So the item about the bicycles,  I think it was 2.2,  or 2.3,  I can't remember.  I just wanted to touch on that  for a second.  I appreciate the police department  has found a good,  worthy place to donate these bicycles.  I kind of wonder now  with the new police chief  if it's not time to revisit  what the police department can do  to slow down the stealing  and the theft of bicycles.  And, you know,  I know there was a proposition  that came forward before  about making it mandatory  that all bicycles  be registered  and sold in Chico.  And what I was told  is a bunch of businesses  said they wouldn't comply,  they didn't want to do it,  so the council shot it down.  So I would ask the council to,  you know,  one,  go look at the volume of bicycles  the police department puts  because I know a couple years ago  when I was picking up bicycles  and dropping them off,  they had a ton of them.  You know,  just for me,  they had a dozen  in a couple months.  And two,  maybe explore what other cities  have done  to help retard  the sale of bicycles  or reduce the amount of bicycles  being stolen and trafficked  on the streets illegally.  You know,  there's a lot of great options out there.  I know the registration  of every bicycle sold in Chico helps  and it would help the police,  you know,  when they have contact  with a suspected stolen bicycle.  And I don't know  if that's something you're willing to  go against the wishes  of the prominent business owners  who shot it down the last time.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  Do I close the conference?  Yes.  Any other public comment,  have discussion,  or entertain a motion  for the consent agenda?  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion and a second.  Please call the roll.  Council Member Huber.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  Mr.  Constantine.  I thought there would be  a notation on the agenda  for one of the consent items.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  I forgot that one.  There.  If you mind.  On the item of review,  discussion,  and authorizing  temporary fee refunding,  the second aspect  of the recommendation  is that the consent  agenda is not  we need to drop.  It is our intent,  if you approve this,  to refund fees  associated with the work  that staff are performing,  but the work  that staff are performing,  we're going to submit  the reimbursement  under the CARES Act.  So we don't require  an appropriation  for the work.  We're conducting the work,  billing it to COVID-19,  and then submitting it  for reimbursements.  We don't need you  to appropriate 25,000.  So if you can approve  it with that amendment,  that would be great.  So my motion  will be amended  to correct that.  And item two,  please.  Item 3.1 is an ordinance.  Could you read that?  Oh, boy.  And with that,  a motion to approve  an ordinance  of the City Council  of the City of Chico  amending sections  19.2, 7.0, 1.0,  and 19.5, 2.00, 1.00,  regarding foothill  development permits  in Title 19  of the Chico Municipal Code.  Second.  On the roll call vote.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Orry?  Aye.  Council Member Huber?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  We'll now go to business  from the floor.  Members of the public  may address the council  at this time  on any matter  not already listed  on the agenda  with comments being limited  to three minutes  or as determined  by the mayor  based on the number  of speakers.  The council cannot  take any action  at this meeting  on requests made  under this section.  The council will now  of the agenda.  Are there any speakers  on this item  and how many?  So we have eight people  who may be outside  wishing to speak  when we call their names.  We also received  quite a few emails  on engaged  and we have  two public comments.  Okay.  So if you would  like to read those first  I'll call their names  and then our staff  outside will be  queuing those people up.  They have the list  out there.  So we have  it looks like  eight comments  from the public?  Yes.  Okay.  In person eight  and then we have  the engaged to read  and then public comments.  Okay.  I'm just trying  to figure out  how many online  how much time  we should give ourselves  to review them.  There are nine comments  in the public comment  section engaged.  Chico there is  one comment  that's in the public comment  section  and it was repeated twice.  Okay.  So let's take  two minutes  to review the comments  while you read the names  and as staff queues  members of the public up.  Okay.  So I will go ahead  and read the names  of the people  who should be queued  up outside  and the first speaker  is Julie Three  followed by Daniel Rodriguez,  Jeff Creed,  Marissa  Rob Berry,  Annalyn,  Richard Munzer,  Cecil Hamilton  and Chris Palak.  On the engaged Chico  we received comments  from Kirsten Norris,  Terris Lee,  Kimberly Burke,  Jules Brown,  Gina Bax,  Susan Smead,  Claudette Ritter,  Nicole Navas,  and that is it  for that one.  And then on public comments  we received one message  from Cicely Sherry.  Just a few  other comments  anyway  anyway [inaudible] We're trying to figure it out. Okay.  anyway  anyway  anyway  anyway  anyway  anyway !  anyway  anyway  anyway  Is everyone had an opportunity to read the comments?  Mr. Ori, have you had a time to read the comments?  Yes, thank you.  Okay.  So it looks like we have our first speaker.  Madam Clerk, could I have you just read the names of the speakers?  They're not on my screen, so that would be the best.  When I call them up, they will appear in the timer.  So did you want them for three minutes?  Yes, because we had eight speakers, correct?  Yes.  Okay, Julie Threatt, followed by Daniel Rodriguez.  Welcome.  Okay, hello, the cast members.  Thank you for having us in here.  I normally talk about how I'm against the needle on this recent program,  but today I want to specifically talk about and ask the council to hold  and be received accountable for the terms of the contract.  So, number one, this ridge dispensing plan that they've got listed  says that you need to get a report from the Licensing Medical Waste Disposal Service  that they've used to verify the number of needles.  Okay, so we have a number.  And heard that 3,000 needles were disposed of to one person.  So we know that probably is false.  So if you could do that, that would be great.  In their needs, they claim to have collected from October of 18 to May of 19  to some of that 61,900 needles.  So I thought that's right.  So we want to make that a study.  Number two, the mobile site.  I would ask that we report that to the residents.  We want to make the appointments as your group requires  that the client who needs home delivery or liability submit the requirement.  Also, there's information on attachment A.  It's got three attachments to track who is required counseling service.  So I haven't seen any of those.  Community-bound relations plan.  It's got a community relations plan.  So number A, I am a plan.  I am required to document.  I am required to report all adverse incidents that occur with law enforcement.  And they keep it for three years.  And that's the top of C.  So that's the second thing.  Number G, they're supposed to get updated and require regular contract with senior leaders  with Chico PD, the park rangers, and the county public health to troubleshoot the issues.  So if community relations needs to share with the community, we'd like to know that.  And then in closing, let's see.  And again, the mobile sites, I'd like to require the right to know who's getting them.  We see pressure right around tons of needles in that.  And so that is my thing.  Again, these three attachments, I think, are critical for you all to see, know, and then get.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Next speaker is Daniel Rodriguez, followed by Jeff Crean.  Good evening, Congress.  First, I want to start by applauding you for the last meeting you had.  You actually showed stability towards one another.  And we're able to come to you both on two different items.  So I know you've heard a lot of challenges and negativity from me in regards to community.  But I do want to take a second to applaud you for the positive work that you did to protect the community.  Now to our side.  The House is on fire.  And we're wondering who we're going to invite to dinner on Friday night.  What I mean by that is we've got issues that are polarizing this community.  Issues on meal distribution.  The food.  The food.  But anyway, the most important thing is the food is the most important thing anyway because  If you go back to the days of the Black Plague, and talk about the amount of trash that was built up, and the influx of rodents, and other environments that came in and actually helped to move forward a plague-like environment, and we're not even the Gen-Dyke City.  How is that possible? How are you representing our city?  And yet, we didn't even take the time to Gen-Dyke two items that have polarized the city for the last six months.  It makes no sense.  We want the meal distribution to be addressed by you immediately. It has to be.  Whether it be some sort of limitations, some sort of controls, this is your town, and we have hired you to run it.  No one gets to tell us that we can't have a meal distributed in gross amounts here in our community. It's your town.  Then you're out.  It's not the trash that's in our parks. Again, this issue has got to be taken care of.  There's not enough police officers to police the environment and protect our community.  We demand a safe town. Right now, we have the very worst officer-to-citizen ratio in the entire United States of America for towns our size.  Create a city-smart campground. I don't care.  Do something to protect our parks and waterways.  And remove the hiring freeze for PD.  Let's get cops hired so they can protect our community.  85 sworn officers. And I'm not going to include detectives, parents, officers.  Thank you very much.  This is it. It's got to be addressed.  Thank you. Jeff Creed, followed by Rob Berry.  JEFF CREAD  JEFF CREAD  JEFF CREAD  JEFF CREAD  JEFF CREAD  JEFF CREAD for opening up the meetings to public comment. I really appreciate it. I'm going to skip over most of the park issues because I think it's redundant to tell you what everybody in the city is talking about. If you don't know that already, I feel sorry for you. I just love sympathy there if you don't understand what's happening on the streets about that issue.  about that issue. What I will comment on about it though is you really set the city staff, police,  home enforcement, everybody on the field because you went ahead with what was done, the ground deal,  told people to camp in the best campground in the state for free with no rules and no regulations.  When they go camping in any other campground in the state or the country or probably anywhere  internationally too, there are rules and regulations about trash on the ground and what's acceptable  behavior and what isn't. And you didn't outline any procedures, protocols, or anything for the city  to ever even provide a correction to go create it. So you set the city staff up for failure.  You set the city up for failure. Your rush to action was naive at best and foolish.  I went to the city staff three years ago saying we needed a dedicated campground to get the people  out of the waterways. And you haven't done that. You're just now talking about it when it's too late.  The waterways are already horribly dangerous. I sent you another email today about the campsite  that was cleaned up recently and there's already more feces less than 10 feet from the water in that  same campsite. And what made me horrified is minutes after I sent you that video on YouTube,  I watched a family of like six kids who were playing in the creek downstream of that.  Think about that for a minute. Would you want your kids, your grandkids in that creek?  Why are there no signs close to you saying,  warnings? Why aren't there more accurate tests being done for years?  We've had this lackadaisical testing protocol. It's a joke.  And there's plenty you could have done. You had plenty of time to say a shopping park ban.  I don't know why the Chamber of Congress and places like the DCDA don't beat down your door saying we need this.  Because what happens is these people living on the street, they talk to the shopping carts,  to the dumpster, the dumpster, fill it with trash and then take it into the creeks and the parks and the waterways.  Mercer's Glen, I think, I'll bet there were more shopping carts in that corner last week than there were in almost every parking lot,  grocery store in town other than Costco. So why don't we have a shopping cart ordinance that prevents that?  There's any number of things you could have been doing for years to help mitigate this trash problem, and you're not.  So you can sit up there and say, oh, we're doing things, we're doing things, but the proof is in the streets.  Have you been out there?  Have you been at the parks?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Rob Berry followed by Annalyn.  Well, this is strange, but it's better than watching on Channel 11.  So I've got to take my glasses off because they're fogging up under my mask here.  I can't see.  Earlier this week when the agenda was published, I noticed item 7.4 that announced that Leslie Gonson from CHAP was beginning negotiations on property purchase.  Mr. Berry, I'll remind you that business from the floor you cannot address items that are on the agenda.  No.  Well, then how can you mark?  We've been down this road before.  You want to do that again?  I get clarification from the city attorney.  We have been down this road before.  Yeah.  My recollection was that we would be taking those comments at the time of 7.4, not from business from the floor.  Yes.  Before we go into closed session.  But Mr. Berry is correct.  He would be able to speak on any item on the agenda.  Yeah.  You just said it's too difficult.  No, no.  He's able to, a speaker is able to speak on any item on the agenda.  I can't hear the discussion.  A speaker is able to speak.  Turn your mic off.  Please.  I am talking.  Can you stop?  A speaker can speak on any item on the agenda.  It's when they get to speak on the item that appears to be at issue.  Mr. Berry raised this issue several months ago and our clarification on this, we would be taking those comments at the time the item was called, not during business from the floor.  So it would be appropriate for his comments on item 7.4 to be addressed at the time of 7.4, not now.  Okay.  So Mr. Berry.  I can't hear a word that he said.  Sorry.  Then I'll summarize and hope that I am getting it correct.  Yes, you may speak on any item that is on the agenda.  However, it needs to be spoken at the correct time.  If you would like to address it.  I'm trying to finish my sentence.  Before we go into closed session, we will ask for if there are any speakers on that item.  So if you'd like to address it, please.  us on any item under closed session, you may do it before we go into closed session.  I may be mistaken, but I look for a way to register to speak on that item on closed session  that I did not see on engaged, and that's why I presume that my option would be to do  it during here. And by the way, I'm not just talking about 7.4. This is the issue that  we had before as to whether or not this is an item on the agenda, whether the content  of my speech is going to be solely on item 7.4. And I may refer to 7.4, but just because  I mentioned 7.4 does not bar me from addressing the council in the public address section.  The speaker is correct. He gets to speak in business from the floor as to items that are  not otherwise on the agenda.  So items that are elsewhere on the agenda, he would speak at the time those items are  called. To the extent that he was unable to register, he's here now. He can fill out a  speaker card and speak when that item is called.  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear a word.  If you would like to address the council on item 7.4, you can register at the table out  front for item for the closed session.  Okay. I would also like to address the council.  On an item that includes 7.4, among other things, am I going to be disallowed on the  basis of the fact that I'm mentioning an item that is on the agenda tonight?  Yes, I believe so.  Are you sure you want to do that?  I'm asking for a city attorney's direction.  Madam Mayor, I would let the gentleman speak his three minutes as to what he wants to talk  about if he talks exclusively or predominantly.  If he has item 7.4, then he should be speaking at the time 7.4 is called.  Okay.  It looks like the city clerk has an opinion.  Yes, I just want to note that it is open under engaged the closed session.  Just like with consent agenda, we don't list out all those items because it's taken in  its entirety.  But we do have a comment under closed session, so there was that opportunity and you can  identify.  I just want to let Mr. Berry know that we always open that up.  It's under 7.0 and it is live right now.  But I'm happy to put him in if he would like me to do so right now as a speaker under that item.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So, Mr. Berry, you can...  I'm sorry.  It's just impossible to hear you from back here.  I don't know what you said.  Would you...  Item 7.0 is open under engaged Chico and Ms. Preston said she would be happy to list you  as a speaker under item 7.0.  Okay.  If you are under closed session, if you would like to do that now.  Okay.  I'm essentially raising the objection that just because I'm making reference to an item  on the agenda does not mean that I'm tired.  Madam Mayor.  Madam Mayor.  Yes.  Madam Mayor.  I would just allow him to speak for his three minutes and let it be.  Okay.  I couldn't hear.  Sorry.  Mr. Berry.  I'll let him speak for three minutes.  You have three minutes to address the count.  When I noticed the item on the agenda, I inquired about what it was about, and no one knew,  including colleagues on the city council.  Now, the rules about closed session are such that there are very narrow exceptions, and  discussing the sale of property in a general sense...  Madam Mayor.  Madam Mayor.  Madam Mayor.  The speaker is speaking on specifically the item 7.4.  Just give me a minute.  I'm just going to go through three slides.  Can I make my point, please?  You cannot speak to the council at this time about items that are on subsequent sections  of the agenda.  And you're addressing us on...  Madam Mayor, you do not know what the rest of my speech is.  You cannot possibly know after listening for 29 seconds.  You kept referring to items that are on the closed...  Um...  Right.  Closed session.  But I want to talk about other things during 7.4.  I'm here to talk about a general issue about how the city council conducts its business.  And this is a pretty good example of what I'm complaining about.  Why would you err on the side of not letting me speak, rather than giving me at least a  minute here to develop my concept here, so you can determine whether or not I'm violating  some rule.  I'm trying to have some sense of fairness for all the speakers, so that we apply the  same rules to everyone.  That if you would like to...  You can speak for three minutes, talking about whether or not you can...  Are clear-point enough to know what I'm going to say.  And you're going to send me away, rather than let me speak for three minutes.  And we've already been down this road.  There is a...  There is a...  There is a...  There is a commitment letter from you about this.  And I don't think you want to go there again.  This is the same issue.  Just because I make reference to something else on the agenda does not bar me from having  a general conversation about how that relates to the point that I would like to make.  Now, this is all on tape and so forth, so you can send me away and I will go peacefully.  But this is a...  If you'd like to...  This is a...  An issue of freedom of speech.  speech, you should err on the side of allowing you to speak. Nobody's going to get infected  if I say something that you object to. It's ridiculous to try to split hairs so carefully  that they're wasting more time splitting the hairs than you would just allowing you to  speak. So, am I banned or shall I continue?  Continue.  I'd like to start from the beginning if I may.  You can, you already spoke for 30 seconds as you stood, so let's bring back 2.2 and  a half minutes.  Okay.  Okay.  So there was an item on the agenda. Based on my legal opinion and my review of an opinion  by its only general on this very subject, it is illegal to have a discussion like that.  Okay.  Now, my point.  My point is that objection is not about campgrounds, it's not about CHAP. As you well know, there  was a lawsuit brought by citizens against CHAP in the city of Chico. That was not about  tiny homes either. That was about the way this city conducts its business. Trying to  ram through projects that are beneficial to some favored non-profit and bypassing all  of the normal laws and regulations.  So, I'm going to start with the first one.  open meetings.  The Brown Act.  Regulations about how the city disposes of excess city assets. What use the city is going  to apply to its resources, including its property. These are all topics that belong on the public  agenda. They belong in a public meeting. They belong in the outside sunshine. Not something  that is discussed in a closed session. If there was cigars, smoke, and whiskey glasses  in closed session, you would complain about it. But when you guys make background deals,  you vote yourself up as being virtuous. It is wrong. It is not fair. It is not popular.  And it's not the way to conduct business in this city. Now you guys don't need to try  to live so close to the line and try to sneak through issues that you're bound to approve  or whatever by not following the rules that everybody else follows. If you want to sell  land, make it an issue at a public meeting. If you want to sell land, make it an issue  at a public agenda. Explain what it is you're trying to do. Look at the options. Open bidding  up to other people. You don't get to promise land. And that was confirmed by the letter  by Charles Lola that Eves is now publicly announcing that the city has promised land.  And he's organizing a group to administer that land. This is wrong. Thank you very much.  On the line, followed by Richard Munzer.  Hello. Long time no see. I don't know if the public has been sort of glad she was  in between or he was in between. A little closer? Yes, sir. Okay. March, no shout out.  April, no shout out.  Get the draft prepared. Clean clothes. Not really going out there.  We're coming out here prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared  We have no clue what's really going to happen.  It is getting violent on the facts.  My cell phone's stolen.  Not good.  It gets worse.  Not better.  The showers, the most important thing I'm going to say here, because of COVID.  I got a little deep fear with me.  Christmas comes around, we get bad days and pneumonia.  This doesn't look good.  Things don't cross out right when it comes to COVID-19 and pneumonia.  It just don't, well, they sort of fit too well together.  Anything else?  Yeah, here's the one.  Not good for yourself.  I don't need, I don't need a clue who God was coming in here.  You want to know politics?  You keep me out of the street.  It doesn't go in here.  The last thing that made me realize, I was strong and bad in here.  Bye, Paul.  Bye, see ya.  You guys should be ashamed of yourselves.  I got a bigger body count coming and I'm really scared.  Also, I got a more funky count.  20 feet to the end.  I need the money.  See what else?  I tell you, it would be nice to take all self-defense.  You guys killed that one.  Can't have a paintball the whole day.  I put rocks on you.  You think you can?  Of course, I will stab you with these retards.  I'm gonna shove you.  If you just let me blow my head out of stick.  I don't need my cousin in Miami because he wants us to golf with our team.  Which is what I'm doing.  Yeah, I have family here, people.  How do you know?  It's our families.  I'm done.  I got a 15 minute bike ride.  I'm not gonna get a photo till I...  I'm gonna get to go right across the street.  Thank you very much.  Get it accomplished.  No!  Cecil Hamilton followed by Chris Palick.  How are you both doing?  I'll just be really brief here.  I'm just gonna address the needle program.  You guys haven't heard from me or anything.  It's been 18 years in the Army.  I used to run the National Guard Army in Waterville with that.  And I moved away from the city when I came back.  And I used to see Chico like this.  He was like, oh, he's a good guy.  But anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway,  I've seen some bad things in my life when I was a dad.  I was in San Francisco taking my mom to the hospital not too long ago,  and I saw a kid on the street shooting a parent.  That honestly upset me more than some of the stuff I saw at work.  And it breaks my heart when I'm reading on social media and things  that people are taking their kids down to stick them up the pool,  and they're watching people shoot a parent in front of their two-year-old kids.  Now, I'm sorry, but no right mind is giving a deal to a drug ad  and calling it a problem.  I mean, that's the equivalent of giving a monkey a freaking hand grenade  and sending it to a classroom.  It's not going to solve anything.  Just, you guys need to think about the people stages that you're spending here,  people in this community.  You don't pay that for it.  All it's going to take is one person.  It's one parent that their kid gets stuck by a needle.  That kid gets tested positive for HIV.  They're going to have to go through 18 years of daily or weekly testing for that kid.  One bad day, and they will find out where you guys live.  Have you guys even thought about that?  People know your addresses?  Right?  So, you get a commercial with your son at the park.  Imagine one bad parent that comes to your house.  You get a call 911?  The way that you get your address is a matter of public record.  You know, that didn't hurt me.  I said, imagine what happens.  I will never be.  But think about what happened to that boy.  I'm trying to get you guys to think about the repercussions of your actions.  It's one businessman that loses their livelihood.  Guys, please.  I'm actually saying this because I care about you.  If you guys call 911, do you think the cops are going to show up quickly?  You've neutered the police department.  They might be able to get you out of the car.  You've spent two minutes on that call.  But that two minutes could cost somebody something.  You've spit in the face of armed or private security.  I run private security.  I'm telling you.  You guys can't be doing this.  Think about your kids.  Think about your families.  Please.  Because these other people out here, we just want to take our kids to the park.  We want to take our dogs to the park.  We just want to be safe.  Please.  Hand the stupid HEO program to the city.  And Randall, I'm sorry you were placed out there on the block.  But we're feeling better about that.  Thank you.  My address is 1390 Greenwich Drive.  It's a matter of public record.  And my children were in Upper Park this afternoon enjoying the creek.  So Chris Palick.  And then I'm just going to call Annalyn again just in case she's out there.  Or he.  I apologize if I'm mispronouncing the name.  So it's Chris Palick.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Thanks for coming.  Do you have something to share with us?  Yes.  Okay.  My name is Annalyn Palick.  I'm eight years old and I support children education.  We should not be wearing masks.  Only sick people and other people should.  Our world is a mask-free zone.  Alright.  Alright.  Thank you for your support.  Okay, so our last speaker is Chris Palick.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  I see someone coming in.  How are you doing today?  My name is Chris, and I'm third generation of five generations in this company.  Not even half an hour ago, I just left some of my famous property down in New England,  where my older daughter had been in there earlier today to get some of her stuff out of the upstairs  where we store some of our personal stuff.  And she found a bed, sleeping bag, needle galore.  Scared her to death.  She was smart.  Got out of there.  Told me later.  I just called Tinkopedia.  I said,  it would be appropriate for me to show up down there and deal with it myself.  So I called in Tinkopedia, and they were awesome.  I support them in one emotion.  And I would just like to point out that anybody who thinks this is okay,  there was a drug, there was a needle there, there was all sorts of stuff, I guess,  the police officer told me would help somebody if they were overdosed.  And I'm thinking, really?  So I guess I just want to put it out there that people who think it's safe are,  I just left the property.  I'm not comfortable back down.  I'm not comfortable back down there until we don't have a man or he or she for that matter.  I don't know.  So I just want to put that out there.  These needles are everywhere.  I'm not comfortable.  This is on maintenance.  This is six blocks away, five blocks away, whatever it is.  So that's just all I wanted to say.  I hope you change things when we get a chance to do it.  Thanks.  Thank you.  That is it for speakers that I have in the list.  Business from the floor.  I'd like to take a short break.  Just five minutes.  So we'll reconvene at 7 o'clock.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  Thank you.  Any questions from council?  None.  Anything?  Okay.  So how many speakers have we heard from on the engaged platform?  Two.  Two.  So.  So we have, I believe, two.  One from Nicole Nava, another message on engaged from Julie Threat.  Okay.  And then on public comments, we haven't received any.  And Jeff Creed would like to speak in person.  Okay.  Well, let's take a moment to read through the engaged comments,  and then we can invite Mr. Creed to the lectern.  Okay. Has everybody had a minute to check those out?  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everybody  Good morning, everybody  Good morning, everybody  Good morning, everybody  speak? Go ahead.  Sorry, it's hard to hear you. It's okay, no worries.  Time's up.  Nice. So I sent a video of the horrible situation  that Lost Park was into about a month ago, and in there  I tagged an idea about the farmer's market being moved closer to Lost Park  and that part came out instead because the combined use  of the farmer's market in that parking lot would increase the foot traffic  in Lost Park and keep it from getting so devastated by  homeless people sleeping there and, you know,  trashing it. And if you were to take that money and dedicate  the rent that the farmer's market pays and use it  to keep Lost Park maintained, maybe add specific tables, permanent bathrooms,  I think it would be a win-win. You could really change the whole landscape of  downtown and make one Lost Park.  One, make Lost Park more usable, and two, make the farmer's market much more of an event  if there's a place for children to run and play and there's a place to sit down next  to the creek and enjoy a morning snack fresh from the market.  So I don't know if anybody gave that any attention at all or any thought process, but I just  want to reiterate that there are solutions that will solve more than one problem.  And, you know, happy farmer's market's getting a long-term commitment here from the city.  It's overdue. But I'd also encourage you, as a city who's failing at so many things,  to look at solutions that solve multiple problems and, you know,  set the city up for success in the future.  And right now, Lost Park is probably going to degrade  until somebody like me goes over there and raises a stain.  And, you know, it gets cleaned up and you'll have this repeating cycle  because, one, you don't have enough police to patrol it, and two,  it doesn't get the foot traffic from the residents.  And the local businesses there currently don't care because, you know,  there's many businesses right there next to it and none of them said anything.  It took me and some other people calling and raising a fuss to get it cleaned up.  So, you know, if you would just take a moment and pause and think about that,  you know, I think it would be worth your time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No more speakers, right?  No.  Get the mayor back in the room.  I'm sorry.  We have a few more.  We have to make an action, don't we?  Any other questions or comments from council?  Questions or comments?  No.  I'd like to move an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico  granting a franchise for the exclusive use of a portion of city streets, sidewalks,  and other city property municipal lot 1 to certify Chico's farmers market.  Introductory reading.  Second.  Okay.  Question on the floor in a second.  Any other comments or questions?  Let's call the roll.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Orry?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one recusal by Mayor Schwab.  She was not sending the hand signals from the door.  So now we are going to Item 5.1, Modifications to Emergency Resolution Number 2020,  concerning holding public meetings and enforcement of orders.  City Manager Orr?  Yes, honorable Mayor, members of the council.  This item is fairly straightforward.  Working with the city attorney, you'll find before you modification to Resolution 2020,  which is basically just bringing back to the city council for authorization the language  that staff believes you agreed to at the previous meeting.  And it's for your affirmative vote, should you choose so.  And it will modify it to ensure and enable staff to continue to run the meetings as you're  currently experiencing with that higher level of public engagement as the council has voiced  a desire to have and as the public certainly has voiced a desire to have.  With that, that's my report.  We're here to happy to answer any questions that you might have.  Questions from the council?  I have a question about the modification.  This is a question for the city attorney, I think.  The agenda item is about enforcement of orders.  Item 5.2 is enforcement of orders.  5.2, we're going to consider administration fees for violations of enforcement of orders  that are part of the emergency resolution.  So if I want to discuss enforcement of orders and the emergency resolution, it looks like  5.1 is my proper opportunity.  Probably.  5.2 deals more with amending the, not amending the code, but amending the provisions in the  code relating to administrative citation processes and providing a fine for that that's alternate  to citing violations of the city code as either a misdemeanor or a violation of the code.  Right.  But anyway, the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing  is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other  thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the  other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing  is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing  is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing  is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing is the other thing  address the enforcement?  And if I understand correctly, and it's hard to understand because you were as  confused as I was, I know because I have it verbatim down here.  I'll just go ahead.  Did you want to make a comment?  I do, but I just want to make sure that I was okay in doing it.  I mean, I actually kind of thought I was.  But so this is more of a comment and a reason why I'm probably going to vote  against this because it all came in together.  Understanding the city manager has the authority to do the things he's done.  At the emergency meeting that we had, I think it was last Tuesday at 3 o'clock  in the afternoon, and I was actually going to go through all this, and I'm not.  But the vice mayor, and this isn't critical to anybody on the dais in any way,  and it shouldn't be taken that way.  It doesn't read that way.  But the vice mayor brought up the question of mandatory masks and enforcement.  Council Member Huber made a motion, and then the mayor asked, well,  instead of having that discussion at a future meeting, we could bring staff,  we could ask staff to bring us back options.  And Council Member Huber said, yeah, that would be fine.  And then Council Member Stone said, well, we don't really need to do that  because we can go through that.  We can give the city manager the authority to grant all type of things under this  emergency order.  Let's operationalize this with staff and how they can most effectively implement  the masks and a bunch of other stuff.  And we can have that discussion on the 4th or the 18th or whatever they may feel  is appropriate.  If we need guidance, we can go to the state.  This went on for a while.  And then Mr. Stone did make a motion saying that he appreciated Council Member  Huber's motion.  So there's a lot of things going.  Basically saying I support the general activity of mask enforcement.  That's all we were talking about at that point.  And his motion was to effectuate and engage staff to operationalize  and forceful as masks as soon as possible, leaving the discretion to staff  how to achieve it.  Brown seconded it, although I don't see that in here.  The city attorney confirmed the motion to direct staff.  And then Council Member Stone said if Council needs to take action on the  4th, which we probably will, to define things, then we probably want to  do that.  And then Vice Mayor Brown said my request includes the other mandates as she mentioned  to the chief on businesses that are out of compliance and want that to be included.  Council Member Stone says yes, that's fine.  So then this is why I knew we were both confused.  Mr. City Attorney, I'm so glad I wasn't the only one.  He says so my confusion on this, are you expecting something to come back on the 4th?  Are you expecting staff to start enforcing this at their discretion as soon as possible?  I'm not sure.  Council Member Stone's answer was both, which made perfect sense.  The city manager has the authority to do some of these things if he has that.  But I don't want to put my thoughts into Mr. Stone's head.  But I think he was saying let's give staff the let them operationalize this, which they can do anyway.  It's a little confusing from a policy standpoint.  Bring it back at the earliest possible time, which I imagine will be August 4th, which is today.  And then he said I wasn't sure that all had to be part of the plan.  I think we have to get it out of the motion.  And the mayor said yeah, the agenda has to be post tomorrow.  Stone said that's going to be tough.  Ms. Brown said we can bring it back on the 18th as long as we're moving towards public engagement.  Because then we brought in what's going on outside today.  So that all went together.  It was fine.  It was a little confusing.  Is it coming back?  Is it not coming back?  Because first, is this going to be a discussion?  Are we going to start enforcing?  How are we going to do that?  To not.  And I know I don't always vote for this.  I don't vote yes to discuss certain items.  But I try to if it's just going to be discussion because I thought that was going to come back.  Although Mr. Stone did say the CM is not going to do anything without direction from us, which is prudent and makes sense.  If there's a law that needs to be created to do this, do that, it will probably come back on the 18th.  It goes on and on and on.  So then the city manager made a statement kind of making sure he understood what was going on.  And he included we're going to have to sit down and look at the aspects of face covering.  And what do we need to do to operationalize this?  And that discussion will come back at a future meeting.  So here's my hang up.  The press release that came out 48 hours after that, this is just my opinion and I realize I'm in a mass minority here, was unbelievable, unbelievably draconian.  I don't know who wrote it.  I called the city manager the second I saw it.  And I said, wow.  I believe you did get direction from council to look about how you might operationalize mask enforcement and some other things with the businesses.  But that press release literally came out and said if you want to turn in your neighbor, if you want to turn in another business, here's who to call, here's how to do it.  And it just stopped me in my tracks.  And I said we literally have just turned citizens on one another.  I can't speak for my colleagues.  I know that the skipper got some hate email.  Which was probably deserved, not to him specifically, but as a result of what we did.  So depending on how this vote goes, I'm all for trying to have the public back in the meeting.  I've been saying that for a long time.  It does kind of fly in the face of what the state is saying, you know, no public gatherings.  And it turned out no one showed up anyway.  At least not a lot of people.  So that's probably all right.  My concern is this.  And as we move into 5.2, and I won't get into that.  As we operationalize this or vote on it or just go with the emergency, whatever.  As I walk around town, I go a lot of different places.  And I'm seeing 80, 85% compliance with the mask mandate.  I think it's a good idea.  I wear the mask wherever I can.  The vice mayor asked me, said, Sean, I'd feel better if you had your mask on.  So I did.  I use a steroid inhaler twice a day.  I've used one since I was in fourth grade because I have asthma.  But I get it.  And I appreciate people that wear them.  I don't want citizens being turned on me.  But anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway,  and police officers and whoever else to go and tell businesses they're doing  everything they can to meet their commercial lease  payments and pay their employees and do all those things. And if we get into  the we're going to shut you down business, the very people we're asking to  enforce those rules onto and including the  city manager are at some point going to be out of a job because  we're shutting down the very businesses that create the revenue.  And there's a happy medium somewhere.  And the mayor mentioned and I said it as well at the last meeting.  Super, super, super, super educational. Do what we can.  That's kind of where I thought we were going. I thought we were going to have this discussion  again either today on the 18th. It's not on the agenda, but we are talking about  enforcement of orders. So all that  was just one big monologue to say I think that  press release went too far.  I think we're scaring some business owners and I do and I think I read this  in here somewhere and Mr. Stone made a great point. He said to the  extent that you say you're going to enforce this, you'll probably get more enforcement.  And I'm all for that and I'm probably undoing some of that without  meaning to. But at the same time, if we're 80-85 percent  I don't know what we're going to do by pushing people  beyond where they are. And at one point, Skipper, in your  answer he said, you know, we're not going to  to use our discretion on some things, but that's not how it read.  And it just concerned me because we need these people and they don't have a choice.  The state's running out of money. The federal government stopped spending money  to go in and say we're going to turn  you into a state agency and take away your means of supporting your family.  That's not something I think should have gone out  from this building without this council seeing it first.  That's it.  Other comments from council?  Madam Mayor, if I could clarify.  Yes.  Two points.  During last meeting, I mentioned that there was confusion  about the  regarding what the discussion, at least the motion  was at that point. That was cleared up for me  at the time, and I don't have any type of  confusion about that issue due to the  clarification that the council provided.  The issue that needed to be brought back for you tonight to amend  the resolution is in relation to a very narrow  issue.  As to those sentences three and four of section three in resolution 2020,  that's all that the action that is before you that's being requested.  So that would then clear up how additional  city business could be brought and what was previously called essential city business.  Everything else will be postponed by having these accommodations of allowing participation,  either in person,  as has been happening tonight, or through other electronic means.  The resolution will be amended to get back on track to regular style agendas with regular  types of items on.  So that's all that's really before you as the attachment in the new resolution.  The staff report does also have a discussion regarding enforcement.  I believe that there was some, there was a lack of clarity, but I think that's all that's  really prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared prepared prepared  prepared  prepared !  orders through the administrative citation process. That's an alternate process to something  being brought either as a misdemeanor or a infraction as a criminal side enforcement method.  So if I understand this correctly, 5.1 is the emergency resolution coming back to us clarifying  or just solidifying our action that we took in regards to opening up our meetings.  Correct.  And there was some additional information in the report that could be related to item 5.2?  Related in a way, 5.2 really stands on its own, and it's an issue that we've had as staff,  we've had slated up for quite some time to try and address, and in fact it was going to be  addressed.  It was addressed on something, I believe in May, which then got pushed back and delayed because of a number of reasons,  but a more comprehensive fee resolution that will be coming to you in the future.  But before you, under 5.1 also, is this discussion on the enforcement.  So it is appropriate, and that was requested by council, to bring back the discussion on that as well.  Mr. Orme.  Yes, I want to thank Council Member Morgan for those comments.  It's been one of the most difficult aspects of the whole COVID-19 scenario as it relates to the potentiality of more heavy-handed enforcement  as compared to the educational approach we were taking.  I want to be clear.  If the city staff misinterpreted the council's direction, please let me know.  I can hit reverse really fast.  And I'm happy to do that because I do believe that the majority of our businesses and population are abiding by the rules.  And so if this council's desire is to reverse course on that, please let me know.  And we can send out a new press release.  But we were sending a message, and I thought that was the message that we heard loud and clear.  However, if I was inaccurate in understanding the message that the council wanted to send,  then please let me know by all means.  Thank you.  Thanks, Mayor Brown.  I don't believe you were inaccurate in interpreting the message that I understood council to be sending.  I think it's very true, and we had this conversation during the dialogue,  that the vast majority of folks are complying.  And we need that extra because our cases continue to go up and up and up.  I also heard Council Member Morgan say during that conversation that having that in reference to the  writing and having that in place would likely increase compliance without having to do that enforcement.  And so I think it plays in both ways.  Just really quickly, Section 2.  I don't believe it actually changes the meaning of anything.  But commencing immediately is stated twice in that first sentence there.  So maybe just to clean up some clean-up language.  All right.  I'll strike the second, commencing immediately.  Thank you, City Manager Orme.  I concur with the Vice Mayor as far as the message being received as we intended it to be.  And if I may just sort of comment on Council Member Morgan's statement.  I believe that kind of what he was saying was more about the way it was said rather than what was said.  I think that was the issue with that press release.  If I may, what I specifically asked for the other meeting was that the City Manager take the discretion that he felt was necessary.  I thought I was pretty explicit about that.  Is that we, the Council should not be making the decisions as to how we implement that operational nature.  So, and I kept using the word operational to emphasize that detail.  The Council does not have the responsibility to be addressing operational details and rather policy.  So because for four months that we hadn't done anything like this.  It was.  And the public was clamoring for it and we needed that measure of safety.  My motion initially was the City Manager already has that authority to execute that exact program.  And I left it to the City Manager to implement that.  I also mentioned that if the City Manager felt that there was something necessary to come forward for policy recommendation.  That he would do so on the 4th or the 18th.  And that's exactly what I'm seeing at this point.  So I'm not sure where the confusion lies.  It was solely up to the City Manager to make that operational details.  And if there was something that needed to be changed to be brought back up.  We'd be bringing it up on the 4th or the 18th.  My opinion is that the State has issued these guidelines.  Telling businesses, what businesses can be open and what businesses can't.  And are leaving it to the Municipality.  To do the enforcement.  It was my intention or belief that we needed to be able to say there are consequences.  For businesses and individuals who are putting our community at danger.  And it would be my thought that the City staff.  The Code Enforcement and Police Department.  And the City of New York.  Would be making those in the field calls on that.  That we would still lead with education.  However, if we were not getting compliance.  And it was a serious threat to the community.  Then we would be able to take steps.  The County, a day after we met.  Or it could have been the very same day.  Reiterated.  That it was the City's and the County's responsibility.  To assure that businesses were complying.  It's still my thought that we are most likely not going to be able to give everyone who is in violation.  A ticket.  And to cite them.  However, just like we would not cite every single person who is talking on their cell phone.  And driving a car.  Or not wearing their seatbelt.  But this is a tool that is available to our Code Enforcement.  Our Police Department.  To gain compliance.  So that we can put this serious pandemic in the rear window.  So those are my thoughts.  And I apologize for the email that you have sent.  I think every single Council member up here could say yes.  That's the kind of email that we get every single day.  For making a decision or not making a decision.  And I think what we try to do is measure the actions that we can take.  And try to do the most good for the most people.  Mr. Ory, did you have any comments?  I do, thank you.  My object is to approach the Council Member Morgan's comments.  And it was a reflection on his comments.  I understand.  Council Member Morgan.  I don't like the press release.  But what I did hear is what you support.  I was just thinking of signing in front of all businesses.  Which I'm not seeing.  I would have thought that we empowered businesses to be able to save their customers.  In a calm manner.  That I'm sorry you can't come in.  We can't do business with you.  Unless you wear the mask.  Unless you have a reason.  I'm not sure.  But I'm sure that it's handy.  I do believe that many of the businesses and many of the citizens understand the severity of our problem.  And that this moment in time that it is the right step to change what the state guidelines are.  And so I'm still trying to understand what brings us back to unanimity on that issue.  Because it does seem to me that at the last meeting there was a consensus that there should be some level of enforcement on this.  The businesses complying for our business.  Perhaps just the businesses that are on the governor's list that are operating today.  And it just seems to me that we are trying to be clear.  And that we're trying.  And this is not the time.  Not within a week or two.  But to bring down the infection rate.  And to recognize that.  That something has gone out of control.  And it's time for us to act.  Other comments before we hear public comments?  I'll just quickly add.  I know that part of that whole motion and kind of package of things was to bolster education efforts.  And I definitely noticed that in the digital space.  And I would just say I think it's appropriate to go a little bit further.  I believe Council Member Horry was referencing this.  Although I didn't hear him entirely.  If we could do signage.  Additional signage.  If we could do more kind of paid advertising type of things.  I think it would stretch beyond those who follow us on social media in a way that could create a different kind of culture around this.  And educate folks.  So I just.  That was my intent in some of that.  And so I just wanted to be clear.  We did certainly hear that messaging.  I know the PIO has already been in contact with a number of folks with that regard.  And so we are following up on other means of that public messaging.  So thank you for that.  Thank you.  I'd just like to address one quick thing.  Coming from the person that actually has a business and has to deal with the public on a daily basis.  It's all fine and well to say that you need to have your employees enforce this.  The reality of that is I have employees being screamed at.  Yelled at.  Things thrown at.  For simply asking people to wear their mask.  I have the sign on the front door that says please wear your mask.  So it's easy to flippantly say you're going to turn these business owners into the person to do it.  Trust me.  We're doing it.  Got sanitizer at the front door.  Got free masks at the front door.  Got the sign on the door that says please wear your mask at the front door.  But if you want me to turn my 16 year old that has her first job into the person that's going to throw the six foot guy out of the building.  Because he doesn't want to wear his mask.  I do the best I can.  But there's some realities that we're dealing with here.  So we just need to do the best that we can.  But we're not going to get 100%.  I mean it's just there's some realities we're dealing with when you're asking these young employees at a lot of these places.  And they're doing a lot.  They're working their patooties off.  Changing their gloves in between every single thing.  Being in masks all day long.  I mean they were really working hard and doing a lot to serve the public and to keep everybody safe.  So I just wanted to give another perspective.  I fully enforce it.  I'm enforcing it in my business.  I fully encourage it.  It's just there's some realities behind it that we also need to understand.  Council Member Reynolds I really appreciate those comments because I actually think it reinforces the need for the city to step up for those workers who have been and have had to be the enforcers.  Because the city hasn't been taking an active approach in that.  And so it does create an alternative.  So that workers are not having them confused.  How does the city help that?  The city is now taking the lead in enforcing.  Therefore your workers, the people who are in these jobs aren't alone in having to ask somebody to do something.  They have a reporting structure.  They have a number to call.  And if they're not feeling confident or safe or skilled enough to have those conversations.  Then now they have the city behind them.  And so I think that that just reinforces that importance.  And I would think that our city staff would take that into account in totality of what that situation is.  It is, I would imagine it would be virtually impossible for a 16, 18 year old to tell someone that was quite large and bearing down on them that you're not going to tell me what to do.  But, yeah.  Thank you.  No.  As you're citing all the other things that you were doing.  Then that, then you are trying everything that you can.  But having some enforcement sends that message out.  Supporting you in your decisions.  And that's precisely what we talked about at the last meeting.  Was that this was designed to support the businesses so that they have backup with their enforcement policy.  And then there was a mechanism that the city was standing on.  And then there was a mechanism that the city was standing behind them to make sure that our community was safe.  Now I think we've missed the point that if somebody has the virus, whether they're large or small, they're going to walk in your business.  And that's just as dangerous a threat as somebody with a knife.  Right?  I mean the impact is that grave.  So having the city manager address this issue.  Supporting our businesses with their actions.  To support the actions of the governor and the state.  Unfortunately there's been a lot of misinformation.  As I said at the last meeting.  There were people even on this dais that were suggesting other operations.  We've since learned from that.  And that's great.  And so now the city manager can implement a policy that will help support those businesses.  Implement and operationalize that safety.  Let's see if there's any speakers on this item.  How many in-person speakers do we have?  We have.  We have.  I believe six of in-person.  We received seven comments in the engaged CHCO component.  And we did not receive any additional public comments in the emails.  Okay.  So as you read the names of the people in person who are going to address the council.  And the names of people who have sent us an engaged CHCO.  We'll review those.  And then we'll start.  Perfect.  Okay.  So the ones that need to be lined up to speak in person would be Julie Threat.  Benson.  Andrew Palmquist.  Annalyn Palmquist.  Nick Jay.  Mary Beth Werthner.  And then addressing the council through engaged CHCO.  We received comments from Carissa Casey.  And then we received comments from the council.  Mary Beth Werthner.  Teris Lee.  Claudette Ritter.  Susan Smed.  Nicole Nava.  And Julie Threat.  Mayor Schwab, if I can make one additional comment.  There might be members of the public that comment on these issues.  I just wanted to clarify in particular the at the covid19.ca.gov website there is an  evolving website that's prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  list of regulations by the state.  And one of the members of the council mentioned  that it is the state that has created these regulations  and these guidelines that businesses must abide by.  And Butte County has now moved into the segment  of counties that have been on the county monitoring list,  as it's called, for three consecutive days.  Throughout the state of California, in all counties,  indoor operations for dining and restaurants,  wineries and tasting rooms, movie theaters,  family entertainment centers, zoos and museums,  and card rooms, those must close the indoor operations  in all counties.  To the extent those can be done outdoor,  in particular bars, brewpubs, breweries,  and food service as outdoor sit-down dining,  that can be,  that can be conducted outside.  And that was one of the primary reasons  why staff moved towards creating,  and the emergency services director executed  those four orders that allowed for outdoor facilities  to move that ability to engage in that  and as fast as possible.  During that period of time, since we last met,  Butte County moved onto that monitor,  the three consecutive day monitoring list.  That then means the indoor,  indoor operations of gyms and fitness centers,  places of worship, cultural ceremonies,  weddings and funerals,  offices for non-critical infrastructure sectors,  personal care services like nail salons and body waxing,  hair salons and barber shops,  and then also shopping malls.  Those indoor operations needed to cease as well.  And it's the shopping malls that became an issue  and gave rise last week to some concern about enforcement.  Additionally, in that same section  in the state guidelines is the tattoo parlor section.  It says shops that offer tattoos, piercings,  and electrolysis may not be operated outdoors  and must close.  So just to clarify, this is not staff,  it is not the council that is making up these rules.  These are state guidelines as to that particular sector.  Thank you.  And the city abides.  All right.  So let us start with the public comments.  And hello.  Hello.  Who is?  Hang on just a second.  So you're Julie.  Thank you.  Each member of the public will be allowed  to speak for three minutes.  OK.  OK.  Hi, y'all.  So two things while I was listening and standing out  there.  And I came last Tuesday.  And.  I was completely confused.  I wasn't that confused.  I got a college degree.  But I put this one that I heard you say  that you were going to bring options to this meeting  to operationalize it.  And also you asked the staff to come up  with a public education campaign.  So when I got this email saying this is a law or whatever,  a rule or whatever, I was like, what just happened?  But so I decided that I'll come down here and state my piece.  But anyway, so.  And then.  And then when I came here, there's 5-1 and 5-2.  And I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to speak at.  I'm literally signed up to speak at both.  So if I go on my time, I'll speak the next one.  So my concerns are that before we all  talked about this ordinance last Tuesday, literally there  were more than I hear it to you.  I live in the suburbs.  More than 80% of my neighbors, my people,  I come downtown wearing their masks.  But when you throw the word enforcement out,  everything changes.  And I'm on Nextdoor app, the right health park area.  And literally, I've got neighbors, good neighbors,  fighting with good neighbors.  I've got moms with disabled kids and other people  that are telling them, just leave them in their house.  Just leave them in their house.  I'm like, oh my, it has gone nuts.  And I've got strings and strings going on in Nextdoor app.  So that enforcement rule just really turns things around.  And I now also see people with their good word enforcement  seeing big government.  And they were wearing masks, but now they  are refusing wearing masks just because of the government  overreach.  And I personally looked online.  And out of 482 cities in California, 69 have fines.  And they're all below Sacramento.  So they're all below Sacramento.  And that's really what you expect of most people.  So I got to think more seriously.  So I personally then also am worried about the disenfranchised.  They can't wear masks.  Where are they going to get their masks?  The transient population.  They don't have social distance.  So the good people in the city are doing the right thing.  And you've got other people that aren't.  And now we're forcing things on, again,  the big citizens of this town.  So the one city or the county, San Antonio,  we had a really good idea.  So they've got their compliance officers,  their that carry with them PDEs.  And they will hand out PDEs.  And if that person refuses to wear it,  then they get the citation.  So thank you very much.  Thank you.  So our next two speakers are Andrew Palmquist  followed by Annalyn Palmquist.  Thank you.  I'm Tony Lindsey with ASMR.  Microphone's great.  Thank you.  So the first speaker is Andrew.  Thank you very much for this opportunity to speak today.  Now what I'd like to say to this council  and to this municipality is that voluntary enforcement is key.  There is a big question on whether an unconstitutional edict  from a governor can even be enforced.  Our Constitution and our Declaration of Independence  dated July 4, 1776, say explicitly that no government,  state, city, local, county can enact any legislation  that would counteract what is in our Constitution  if stated in the Constitution.  If such language is drafted, it is deemed void.  That's our Constitution.  It says, we hold these truths to be self-evident  that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.  We are granted through Article V of the Constitution  the right to free speech, un-muzzled speech.  We have those rights.  And there is a question.  I'm wearing these masks today to illustrate to you.  Are we free or are we slaves?  Is there a voluntary compliance which we can all support?  Or are we having our rights taken away?  What use is it if at the end of coronavirus,  there are no businesses left,  there are no funds left to support this municipality,  there's no funding left to even enforce  what are already on the books of laws?  If we have no money left, no funding left,  no businesses left, we can't leave our houses,  then what are we even living for?  We've lost our life, we've lost our liberty,  we've lost our pursuit of happiness,  and therefore any city or any county  that has any of these elements would be deemed void,  as we as Chico residents should view the governor's ordinance.  We can voluntarily comply, and that should be encouraged.  Voluntary compliance is key.  But we are not slaves to a mask.  We are not slaves to anything that would contradict  our right to liberty or our pursuit of happiness,  or our right to have un-muzzled speech.  And what I'd like to say is,  we didn't do this in H1N1.  We didn't do this in SARS-COVID-1.  We're doing this now in SARS-COVID-2.  We're doing this now in H1N5.  This was never the case before.  We've had eight lives in Butte County lost,  one life per month.  And we are literally turning our economy  and our city upside down for one life per month.  Voluntary compliance is key.  Thank you.  Our next speaker is Arnalyn Palmquist.  Do you want to say something or not?  No.  Thank you.  Arnalyn, I want to tell you thank you for coming.  It takes a lot of courage to come and talk in front of people like that.  So thank you, and come see us again.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Do you want to say something?  Yeah.  You want to talk?  I believe in freedom.  But anyway,  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Thank you.  We may have a couple of speakers that may be speaking from outside.  I believe our next speaker is Nick Jay, followed by Mary Bell Werthner.  So Nick Jay is our next speaker.  Point of order, why are we having speakers outside and not coming up to the podium?  Is there, I thought we were trying to avoid that.  No, no, excuse me a moment.  I just had a point of order.  I'm wondering how we have speakers outside since we were trying to avoid that.  If they are not going to wear a mask, we're asking them to speak from outside.  Gotcha, okay.  Thank you.  You gave direction that a mask would be required to wait in line to do this.  So that for me feels contrary to-  Is that microphone going to be passed to another person?  Like that feels completely reckless to me.  Also, we were concerned that we weren't going to be able to hear whether there would be a crowd mentality outside.  So this was specifically what we were trying to avoid.  I'm just surprised that we're now in that position that we said we were trying to avoid.  I can let the city attorney address that.  However, I think that if they indicate that they have an inability or some type of a medical condition in order to be ADA compliant,  but the city attorney can address that.  What we did do was once we heard that there were, well actually there was one individual indicating that they could not wear a mask,  but did still want to address you, we set aside an area that would be completely separate from anybody else.  We have the ability to split.  We have the ability to spray down and clean and disinfect everything before being passed on.  But we didn't-  That makes sense to me.  Yeah.  I appreciate the clarification.  Thank you.  That's all I needed to know was that if someone could not wear a mask and be here in public,  then they had other ways to engage the council.  And that's what I would encourage.  Right.  And I think that that was offered up, but they didn't choose to use the engaged or the electronic.  They didn't have a way out there possibly to do that.  Okay.  It's a matter of reasonable accommodation.  Got it.  Okay.  Thank you.  So, Nick J., you have three minutes.  And the microphones do work all the way out to the sidewalk.  I hear that.  Okay.  Can you hear me?  Yes.  Yes, we can hear you.  All right.  Chico City Council, the residents of Chico.  This was going to be my ending statement, but I'm going to start with this.  You have locked us out of our building for months now under the banner of global emergency  within Chico.  Approximately 500 total cases of positive tests in the city of Chico for COVID in the  last four months is not justified.  A declaration of emergency powers from you as the city council.  The Chico Municipal Code Section 2.68.030 states, we are in an emergency when we are  not in control of our services, facilities, and resources within the city of Chico.  There are no grounds for a local emergency according to the California Emergency Services  Act.  A local health emergency may only be proclaimed by a local health officer.  There are two definitions on how this can be terminated.  And because of these two definitions, there are no grounds for a local emergency within  our county.  And therefore, the COVID situation does not meet the definitions of a local emergency.  Further to learn, on the State of California Health and Human Services Agency California  Department of Health website states that face coverings are only guidelines, as quoted,  guidance for the use of face coverings.  There is no enforcement code stated.  Therefore, it is not a law and has not and you have misrepresented at numerous times  city council members and city attorney.  Also stated on the website, our investors are not eligible.  Our industry, industry guidance is to reduce risk pertaining to business operations.  There are only guidelines, no enforcement, no law.  When you go to the Duke County website, it refers you to the state guidelines I mentioned  above.  Again, no enforcement code and no law pertaining to COVID for businesses or individuals.  When you visit the City of Chico website, it only refers you to the state guidelines,  which has no enforcement code, no law pertaining to COVID.  COVID for the businesses and individuals.  The Butte County website  addressing which businesses can't stay  open or closed is again only  listed as guidelines referring  to the California Department of Health.  Again, no enforcement code and  no law, only industry  guidance to reduce  risk. As quoted on the  CDC website, and I  quote, your mask may protect  them, their mask may protect  you. May is not scientific  proof that it will keep you safe.  Furthermore, California Department  of Public Health states  there is limited evidence to suggest  that the use of cloth face masks  face coverings by the public during  a pandemic could help reduce  transmission, disease transmission.  Also stated, face coverings  may increase risk. Cal OSHA  states that cloth face masks  do not protect against COVID-19.  CDC has no evidence  supporting the wearing of cloth  face masks.  Thank you, Mr. J.  Mr. J, your time is up.  Can you turn?  I did.  Mr. J is completed.  We will take a recess.  Five minutes, ten minutes?  No, he's finished now.  Okay.  So our next  we have two more speakers.  Our next speaker is Marybel  Werthner, followed by Jeff Creed.  And let me turn the mics back on.  Okay.  Marybel  Werthner.  Marybel Werthner.  Jeff Creed.  Jeff Creed.  Mary Beth is getting ready.  Oh, is she coming?  You can see her?  Okay.  Okay.  So go ahead, Marybel Werthner.  Marybel, we can hear you in here.  So you have three minutes.  And just let me know when you want to begin.  Okay.  So we have three minutes.  Just a few more minutes  There's no emergency here.  The watch list you cite, I checked it out.  Epidemics are determined by mortality rates, not cases.  The watch list counts cases, 99% of which recover.  You claim you're doing it to protect our health.  Substantial evidence shows that masks are harmful to one's physical and mental health  and that they do not prevent the spread of viruses.  You have to be informed and check the research before you make any decisions.  And also, let's look at the real reason this is happening.  Let's follow the money.  The governor has no authority to mandate anything,  so he...  He's withdrawing relief funds from the cities until the council submit  to becoming their henchmen, their mandate enforcers.  For his guidelines, this is tyrannical behavior.  Do not become tyrants along with them.  You took an oath to be responsible and to protect the rights of people.  Do not do this.  I will not comply.  Thank you.  Okay, our last speaker is Jeff Creed.  And Jeff is coming in.  So, there's a couple things I want to touch on with this.  The first is what Councilor Reynolds was talking about.  It was utterly lackadaisical.  It was not acceptable listening to that conversation  and the rebuttals to everything she was trying to get at.  Because standing outside for the last few hours,  I've been watching the nonstop back and forth that the city staff has had with  city residents who don't want to comply with simple,  like, don't go up the stairs in that direction rules.  And you have police officers, code enforcement, city staff out there  very politely trying to help these people follow the most basic rules that,  that are clearly laid out.  They set it up perfectly.  They're doing a great job of keeping social distancing.  I mean, the city staff is outstanding on it.  And you still have people who can't follow the rules for people wearing a uniform.  And you expect an 18-year-old cashier to enforce rules?  It's just laughable.  And the idea that they would then turn around, pick up the phone, and call a cop,  and then that would help the situation, is even more laughable.  So, the other side of this is,  this whole enforcement thing is just a joke.  Because, you know, I watched Mr. Orme on TV a couple days ago.  It's a state mandate. We have to enforce it.  But, wasn't it like three months ago, you guys dismissed the state mandate about camping?  And said, no, we don't want to follow that state law because it doesn't fit our personal agenda.  We don't want to do, you know, what the state says is legal because we want to do our own thing.  And then, at the city, the Parks Commission meeting,  we had Chris Constantine standing there explaining how and why the city doesn't want to enforce  half a dozen ordinances that are on the books.  There's people across the street right now, drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, with stolen shopping carts.  And which of those aren't being enforced by the police?  Oh, all of them, right?  So, how do you expect the police to run around town?  You know, it was brought up there, we had the lowest staff police department in the state.  I haven't checked that number, but I'm sure you know.  I'm pretty confident it's accurate or mere accurate.  San Jose might be close, but they're a metropolis, not a tiny city, right?  And you want to add this burden to the police?  You know, you can pick and choose what laws you want to enforce for years,  and then all of a sudden this one you want to enforce?  I'm not trying to discount the severity of COVID,  but I think operating, you know, with businesses and people,  and asking them to do the best thing is the best answer.  You know, businesses I've been in that never want to enforce this,  they're actually enforcing it without the enforcement.  They're actually going out and making the effort to make sure everyone wears a mask.  So why don't you believe in the community a little more,  and take up the slack on all those other laws that you've been ignoring.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That should have been our last statement.  Yes.  Looking for council discussion, questions.  Okay.  Questions?  Action.  I'll make a motion.  I'll make a motion.  Could we just check one second?  I believe, is she out there and does she want to speak?  Mary, I apologize.  I apologize.  I took her inadvertently off.  Mary Beth Werthner was the last speaker on that item, and I apologize.  She spoke to us.  I thought I called her, but...  She was the woman who was concerned that she couldn't be heard.  Yeah, she was...  She was right before Jeff.  Okay.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Sorry.  So I'll make a motion that we adopt the resolution of the city council,  of the city of Chico establishing administrative...  Oh, that's the wrong one.  I'm sorry.  Keep doing that.  I will make the motion that we accept the recommended amendment to the resolution to  item...  That's the motion.  That amends items three and four, or sentences three and four of section three of resolution 2020.  Do we have a motion on the floor?  I'll second your motion, which I know to some of the public they're thinking,  wait, he did that whole diatribe and he's seconding the motion.  But Mr. City Attorney, just to be clear, this whole thing is really just about modifying it  to allow for the public meeting.  Correct.  Also, I'll second your motion, Mr. Huber.  Thank you, sir.  Mr. Horry, did you have any comments that you'd like to make?  I don't, thank you.  Okay.  Any other discussion before we take a roll call vote?  I apologize.  It's hard when I'm getting interrupted.  Just a second.  You must have killed the system.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Horry?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Just a few more minutes prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  I'm going to try and get it. Okay.  I'm going to try and get it.  I'm going to try and get it.  I'm going to try and get it.  Are you prepared?  Are you prepared?  Are you prepared?  Okay.  Everyone ready?  Is Carl?  Carl's there.  Okay.  Call our meeting back to order.  We're on item 5.2, consideration of establishing administrative fines for violations of the Chico Municipal Code.  Report from Andrew Jarrett, City Attorney.  Thank you, Mayor and members of the Council.  As I mentioned earlier, this item is to essentially set a baseline or default administrative citation fine for violations of the City Municipal Code when they are enforced as an administrative order process.  The Chico City Code has several ways to enforce the code.  And the administrative citation process was adopted in 1999 as an alternative to the citation process through or misdemeanor process through the code.  This will allow for the first violation in citation under the admin site process to be a fine set at $100.  A second violation that occurs within 12 hours.  And then the second violation set in 15 months of the first to be cited at $200 and a third violation at $500.  Are there any questions?  Any questions?  Yes, I do.  Thank you, Madam Mayor.  So the resolution, resolution, resolution, says a fine not exceeding.  Does that mean it has to be $100 or are we leaving, I'm not suggesting we leave discretion, I'm just questioning.  The discretion would be $100.  would be essentially at the time  the administrative hearing officer hears the matter,  it could be reduced.  Who's the administrative hearing officer?  That the, Mr. Lindsay could probably discuss  that in greater detail.  This gets administered  through the code compliance department.  Was that an invitation for Mr. Lindsay to come explain?  I was gonna ask.  Yes.  Thanks, Andrew.  Certainly.  So the administrative citation  gets reviewed administratively  and then they can ask for a hearing officer  to hear the citation.  And that hearing officer, I believe it's...  Oh, is my microphone not on?  Probably the mask.  Just have to speak louder.  Okay, sorry.  Okay.  So once we go to administrative hearing officer,  that's administrative hearing officer for the city.  I believe that's, is it Matt Wolf?  Yes.  Then he hears the appeal of the citation.  Matt Wolf is the administrative officer?  Our hearing officer for the city.  And what department does Mr. Wolf work in?  He's an outside.  Oh, he's an outside person.  Okay.  I didn't even hear you.  That was Mark.  That was Mark Wolf.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, no, it wasn't him.  It's an outside impartial hearing officer.  Oh, what are we getting in?  Um...  .  .  .  .  .  Okay.  Good.  Any other questions for you, Sean?  No.  Okay.  Mr. Huber.  Thank you.  So even though this was kind of paired up with 5.1,  it's a freestanding piece of work that can be applied to any and all situations,  not necessarily specifically to the situation of mask wearing.  Is that correct?  That's exactly accurate, yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Mr. Orr, you have a question.  Mr. Orr, did you have any questions?  No.  Any other questions by council before we open the public hearing?  Okay.  How many speakers do we have in person?  We have three speakers in person.  Okay.  And we had additional comments received in the Engage Chico platform.  One, two, three, four, five of those.  Okay.  And we did not receive any public comments via the email.  Okay.  So we will review the comments on Engage Chico as you read the names of the people who are  going to speak, and they can speak for three minutes each, and the people who submitted  comments.  Okay.  So outside we should have lined up Mary Beth Werther, Rob Gage, and Mark Gere.  And then the additional comments received in the Engage Chico platform were from Teris  Lee.  Julie Threat, Troy Steffie, and Mary Beth Werther.  Has council had enough time to review the written comments?  Okay.  So let's ask our first speaker.  Okay.  Our first speaker is Mary Beth Werther, followed by Rob Gage.  I find it really disingenuous to ask a question that I've never heard before.  I think it's really disingenuous if you're saying this item is separate from the resolution  amendment, as if it had nothing to do with the...  I mean, I just can't believe that you think we're that stupid.  And I find it despicable that you're using this...  Wait a minute.  I'll point the clock.  I find it despicable that you are using this time to establish lines from where you're  going to make a law that's back in 1999.  Suddenly you need to make a law really quick because you're going to fine everybody on  this COVID thing.  I oppose this whole despotic plan of forcing the entire population of Chico and fining  them hundreds of dollars in businesses too, maybe, if they don't comply.  And as I said before, you know, follow the money.  This is all about you getting your money.  You don't care what happens to the people of Chico.  You don't have to worry about their health.  You just want that money from the governor, you know, because I can imagine what you want  to do with it.  It isn't to help people.  And so I don't think you can fool us on that either.  This is horrible.  People are hurting.  This is a stressful time.  People are out of work.  And you want to institute fines for everybody?  This is never happening in Chico.  This is a really bad time anyway because the ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary  ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary  ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary  ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary  ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary  ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary  ordinary  ordinary  Thanks for fighting a good fight.  My name is Rob Gage.  I'm a resident here in Chico, a business owner in the region, a couple times over.  I have a two-year-old and four-year-old at home, two little girls.  They're seventh generation Chicoans.  And we're all pretty upset with a lot of the decisions that are being made here.  It's disappointing to see this council concentrating on fines and fees for mass burning  when we have so many other pressing issues here in this town that need to and should be addressed,  such as fire.  There's a need for distribution, the homeless and crime situation.  It's unconstitutional, what you're trying to do.  Frankly, against the law, you want to start fining people for not wearing masks.  Your governor has made that very clear.  If you'd like to do something to improve the community,  let's concentrate on the things that are really dragging this town right now.  The condition of our city, the condition of downtown.  It disappoints me greatly not to be able to bring clients downtown for dinner anymore.  Or to let my wife bring the kids down.  And feel safe, which I don't think anybody in this area right now does.  Why not phone the police?  We've got to let them get staffed up to the numbers that are prescribed,  that we all know are going to work.  You're cutting our legs out from underneath us.  And we're tired of it.  Um...  There's not just people suffering on the streets here.  There's a lot of people in their homes suffering.  And a lot of that has to do with the decision making  that's going on right here in this council chamber.  And uh...  We would expect and appreciate  very much  if we got to the matters at hand that really matter to this community  and made it what it was once,  which it is not now.  And that's all to you guys right now.  And come November,  come November,  our voices will be heard.  Thank you very much.  I'll be clear.  Thank you.  Am I on three minutes already?  Yes.  Is that right?  Yep.  Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.  Take it to heart.  Our final speaker is Mark Geyer.  Thank you for the talk.  Hope I didn't spend too much time here.  Alright.  Council Member Cunningham, Mark Geyer,  my wife and our local business owners,  I appreciate your time tonight.  I really do.  I'm here to speak upon this mask  that you guys are trying to push through.  Not really a product Utah.  I'll let you allow these homeless people  to come drugs to their veins.  Yeah, I see repeat offenders  picked up off the street  with copies of masks and drugs,  with citations,  with promised good beer.  And you want to fine us hundreds of dollars  for not wearing masks in public.  Which,  you see suffrage on the streets,  but you don't realize that there is  suffrage happening behind closed doors.  A lot of us cannot afford $100, $200, $500.  It just,  it doesn't make sense to me.  We're suffering as well.  And it's just,  it's futile.  Our police department,  it's over-intimidated here.  It's expecting the code enforcement to go out there  and enforce these laws.  It's cold-hearted. It truly is.  It doesn't make sense.  I pray to the Lord that He softens your heart  and you realize that's really truly happening out there.  And maybe you come to grips  with the reality of what you guys have created.  Realize it.  Look at yourselves.  Do some self-inventory.  Take self-accountability  in your actions.  Look at it.  Look at yourselves.  Look amongst each other.  Christ washed His disciples' feet,  so you shall wash ours.  Look each other in the eyes.  Look us all in the eyes.  This is reality of life.  This right here,  this is nonsense.  This is the reality of life.  Give it up.  That's all I have to say.  Come November,  I know what I'm dropping in the box.  I do.  The game is done.  That's all I have to say, guys.  God bless.  Thank you. Thank you very much.  That closes the public hearing.  Any additional comments?  Any additional comments?  Mr. Ory,  would you like to make any comments?  What's the pleasure of the council?  Mayor, if I might.  I just want to  the city attorney was 100% correct that this is  generally answering Councilmember Huber's  question. However,  if there were fines given  with regard to any COVID-19  related items, this would  be used, just so you're  aware. And I think that there were  questions or  people trying to find  the truth behind the numbers,  and it's accurate what was depicted,  but it's also true that this would be the only thing  we would have in order to find people  related to COVID-19. So I just wanted to make  sure council understands that as well.  If I could clarify,  this, yes, this would be the first  enforcement  method and tool.  There are other tools to enforce the COVID-19  orders, both within, under  the city code,  as an infraction, meaning  taking it to criminal court,  either as an infraction just for money,  or as a misdemeanor,  and in seeking  up to a $1,000 fine and  six months in jail. That's what's  under the code under the criminal side.  So that's a lot of things.  It's identical.  Those types of remedies also exist  under state law, under multiple  sections there, most notably  government code 8665,  which gives  the police the authority  to cite as misdemeanors  the lawful orders  of the governor and the public  health officer.  So this,  indeed, what is being  talked about  is the general  resolution for all city  codes to be enforced  in the  administrative citation process.  And as the city manager just said,  this would be the first line of  defense in enforcing  the city codes as to that.  There are other remedies that are available,  taking it  as a criminal citation  or a misdemeanor, or  egregious offenders going  after it, say, in nuisance  abatement and restraining  order activities. Not necessarily  for something, I mean, what's brought this all to the  forefront in the public's mind  is the mask issue.  But it's as to all, this would  apply to all city codes.  Move approval.  So we have a motion from Vice Mayor Brown.  We have a second.  I will second it.  Any other discussion?  We have a roll call vote.  I guess I would just say  that this allows  when you,  also, one comment,  when you say this is our first line of defense,  I think what we have  already discussed today  that our first line of defense  is education and  a very vigorous  attempt at compliance  and  understanding what the  totality of the situation  is. That this  helps us back up what we  are saying.  Indeed, I stand corrected. And  actually, the second line of defense  after just a general education  campaign is a specific education  campaign with a notice of violation  telling someone  they're in the wrong. And when they still  won't comply with that, then it's a  citation, an administrative citation.  But anyway, anyway,  from both of those items and Vice Mayor Brown will take my place while I go into the other room.  And for the record, Mayor Schwab, the recusal is due to the property interest that you have in the downtown area?  Yes, I have a leasehold.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr. Jarrett, I didn't talk to you earlier, but I'm assuming then I would need to do the same.  Like, out of abundance of caution, I would recommend that.  Yeah, probably. Thank you.  And again, that is due to a business issue.  So, that's the interest in the downtown area.  And then there were five.  Are you wishing for something?  All right, Item 5.3, City Appointment to Property-Based Improvement District Board of Directors.  Mr. Constantine.  Thank you, Madam Vice Mayor.  Back in 2017, the property owners from the downtown area  came to the downtown area and organized and came forth requesting permission  to implement a property-based improvement district, which would go in effect January 1, 2018.  It was overwhelmingly passed by the property owners.  And a property-based improvement district sets an assessment against property  that provides both a direct and indirect benefit.  That property-based improvement district is represented by an organization.  That organization is represented by a governing body, Board of Directors.  In the discussion and formulation, the Council provided direction  that the members of that board should be all property owners,  and that both Chico State and the City of Chico, who are both property owners,  and in the case of the City of Chico, the largest contributor to the property-based improvement district,  should have a dedicated seat on the board.  In reviewing the agreement and compliance with the requirements of the PBID,  the City of Chico has already made a request to the City of Chico  We identified that an appointment had not been yet made for the City of Chico,  and a formal request was made by the PBID Board Executive Director to us,  requesting such an appointment to be made.  In that request, they asked the Council to consider either Mr. Brendan Ottoboni  or Eric Gustafson, who already do a tremendous amount of work  that's in line with what the PBID is doing, are very well familiar,  and involved in the downtown.  However, the Council can make any appointment it chooses to be their representative on that body.  So the request to you is to make an appointment to that board.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Any questions or comments from Council?  I do.  Mr. Constantine, does the City feel that both Mr. Gustafson and Mr. Ottoboni have the capacity to fulfill that role?  That's a loaded question, considering that they carry a tremendous amount on their shoulders.  However, this is aligned with that, so the obligation wouldn't be significant.  They would be attending board meetings, they would be reviewing the materials,  understanding the activities that were happening in the downtown.  It's something that already falls within their scope that they would need to be aware of anyway.  So yeah, I think it's easily handled.  Do you have a, I'm sorry, were you going to say something else, Council Member Rieber?  Do you have a sense of how the Council might be advised or informed about what's going on in that particular world?  It depends on what type of information you'd like to receive.  If there's anything specific you could advise, that would be something you'd like to know,  and it could either be done through an update through the City Manager,  or just an update from the minutes of the board meeting, since minutes are taken during that meeting.  Other comments from Council?  I have a comment.  Yes, Council Member Ory?  Yes, Council Member Ory?  Yes.  He said I have to do my job.  I would be afraid to sit on the people at board representing the city.  I probably could do a lot of damage in four months.  And then I would think that it would be a better idea for us to make an appointment with the new Mayor and the new Council  when we look at the rest of our appointments, so that the Council could decide whether to come up with an appointment  with the new Mayor and the new Council when we look at the rest of our appointments.  I'm not sure I'm appointed to this board.  So, Council Member Ory, if I'm understanding you correctly, your preference would be that  we wait to make the appointment until that formal process?  I guess I see myself as a candidate to an interim appointment.  Okay, got it.  So you're proposing yourself until that time that we make other formal appointments?  Yeah, I'm gone.  Thank you.  Council Member Morgan.  Chris, how do they, does the  pre-bid board, how often do they meet?  I believe their  meeting is every quarter at this point.  Like having a meeting between now  and November? They had a meeting  within the last couple of weeks. They had asked  myself to attend.  I didn't feel comfortable attending given that there was  no appointment of one of our representatives.  However, in terms of the  discussions of what occurs,  the management plan lays out pretty  specifically the categories of where those  expenditures could go and the majority of it,  approximately $400,000,  goes to the cleaning and safe  activities of the downtown.  Is this a voting body? Just to  clarify. I'm sorry? Is this a voting body?  Correct.  Well,  let's take a comment. I might have a few comments  but how many folks do we have  on the stage?  I'm not seeing...  I'm not seeing any on my iPad.  No, we didn't receive any  in Engage nor in the public  comments and I'm not sure  he's still here but we did have Jeff  Creed signed up to speak on this item.  I'm not sure he's here. Mr. Creed wants to  come in? Okay. If he does.  If he does, yeah.  Oh, there he is. He is there.  Welcome back, Mr. Creed.  Good evening,  Council. I think the  PBID is, you know,  an interesting organization.  I'm not mistaken. Wasn't it a parking  set to be  like controlled parking lawns  or parking spaces? I don't know.  But I think Brendan  and Eric would be a good  like a perfect  appointment  when I have interacted with  the city over the years.  I have often met with an I can't  attitude. I ask a  city employee about this. I can't  do that. I ask a city employee about that.  I can't do that. And those two have  never presented me with that attitude at all.  They've often  explained to me the hurdles in front of them  to get something done, but they've  always presented or  come back to me with, you know, plans  or workarounds or something to resolve  an issue or to just explain  that the issue isn't resolved.  And that's  a  rare thing in the Chico City  organization. The  I can't attitude of the  Chico City is pretty prevalent. It's also  prevalent in the PBID, so I think they would bring  a good  fresh attitude of accomplishment  in getting things done to the PBID.  The PBID, you know, I think has been a really  poor  poor guardian of their neighborhood.  So when you look at the downtown, I don't think the  PBID is a good guardian or  good neighbor to their own neighborhood.  So  Lost Park is right on the edge of their area and  they watched it go to hell, didn't do anything.  You look at the plaza, I believe Mr. Morgan said that they  refused to clean the plaza anymore.  But they've been out there for years and I haven't seen them  doing anything on the enforcement side of the loss.  I see bicycles right up and down the sidewalks all over downtown.  I don't hear the business owners say a word.  I don't see business owners here from downtown saying,  hey, we need help.  So I don't see them doing anything. I don't see them doing anything.  I really don't think they care about their own businesses.  Because if it were my business downtown and my foot traffic was  being reduced by the lack of good enforcement from the  city council, I would be here complaining.  So if the PBID's businesses don't want to protect and fight  for their downtown, then maybe they need a little guidance on  how to do that.  I think both Brandon and Eric could take that to them and how  to be better partners for the city to make downtown a better  place for everybody.  And, you know,  frankly, you know, downtown is dying.  If you can't see that, walk across the street.  If the businesses can't see that and they don't want to fight for  their neighborhood, I have no sympathy to make a lot of business.  I'm sorry, but, you know, I'll support the businesses that protect  and fight for their downtown, fight for their neighborhood.  So I hope you pick one of those two.  A non-elected official that has an agenda of their own.  Those two have proven their agenda is for the city and the city alone.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Craig.  No other speakers?  I, too, believe that either of those staff members would be  appropriate fits.  I did have a feeling of, like, a little bit of discomfort with  that council member not being a part of this.  And my thought was if council would be amenable to appointing  a council member that could designate a staff member to  attend meetings, that that might be a...  Is that a good answer?  Yeah.  I think that's a good answer.  I think that's a happy medium.  So I wanted to kind of gauge folks' thought on that.  It's certainly a body that I have...  I mean, I'd be happy to appoint council member Ory at his request.  I've just been curious kind of about their work in a little bit  more detail, and I think it would be great to have a council member  learning about the work that they're doing.  Yeah.  I appreciate Mr. Ory's offer.  I think it's a great idea.  I'm a little bit concerned about the fact that there's only a  quarterly meeting and worried about the continuity of Mr. Ory  attending one meeting and then having to switch over to  something else or someone else.  I also...  Mr. Constantine's response to my question is pretty telling as far  as...  his feeling about the workload that both Mr. Ottoboni and Mr.  Gustafson are already under.  And I understand that and sympathize with that.  So I think from that standpoint, at this point in time, it may be  better that a council member be a representative to that body rather  than taking the time of one of our management staff.  So where does that leave us?  I guess in theory, I know that Mr. Ory has a relationship and an interest  with that group and maybe get started with that group and then after the  election kind of reassess our strengths and who's doing what and then hand it  over to somebody else.  Okay.  So I think that at that point would be...  I guess that would be my direction on that.  Thank you.  Councillor Morgan.  I'll go ahead and make a motion for the simple...  not against Mr. Ory, but the PBID put the PBID together on their own.  The business owners came together.  They did all these things.  They're doing great, great work.  They do it for a third of the cost it would cost the city.  And the PBID put this all together in a great aid and help to the city.  And the city requested Eric or Brendan.  And I think that we should honor that request.  And my motion is that we appoint Mr. Ottoboni for the simple reason that his office is closer  to where they probably meet than Eric's is.  I had a motion on the floor for the discussion.  Mr. Morgan, did the PBID specifically request that Mr. Ottoboni be appointed?  I think that's what the staff report says.  Okay.  Yeah, I guess I either missed that or...  Well, okay.  I would have, but I didn't.  It's...  Councillor Umerson, did you have a comment?  I did.  I was waiting for a second and I didn't hear it.  So I'm ready to make another motion.  So we'll wait for that.  You were going to speak to the motion.  More or less, or offer another motion.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'll wait for a second.  It looks like the motion has not received a second.  Therefore, is that for lack of a second?  Okay.  So...  Could you repeat the motion, please?  My motion, without all the dialogue before it, the PBID has come together.  They've done great, great work.  They continue to do great work.  Even when the city doesn't meet its obligation to pay them, they made the request in the staff  report of either...  Eric or Brendan, I think both of them would be fine.  Brendan's office is closer to downtown.  Eric is over on Forest.  So I think it makes sense to honor the people that are honoring the city and honoring us  and giving them the staff member they asked for, including the continuity issue which  you brought up.  And again, this in no way reflects poorly on Mr. Horry, or I don't intend it to.  Okay.  And I'm looking at the document now and it does say the PBID board requests the city  council appoint...  Either Brendan Autobonning or Eric Esselstyn.  As they both work closely with the PBID with various initiatives and a deep understanding  of how the PBID works.  So I'll second your motion.  Okay.  I'll give a motion and a second.  I'll make a substitute motion for...  To appoint Mr. Horry at this time, I appreciate my colleague's concern and direction.  And I agree those two staff members would be outstanding people for the PBID.  But the problem with that is, is the city is a large city.  We're just payer of those fees and there's no direct accountability from the voters.  So we have an entity that's operating an exclusive area downtown without any members that are  held accountable towards the public.  And that I would second everybody in spirit, all of those concerns and excitement for staff.  And I think it's appropriate for staff to be involved with that, but I'd rather have  a council member and I'm less concerned about who that is.  And I appreciate the continuity.  I just think Mr. Horry has a great job.  I think Mr. Horry would be fine for this time period, especially since the period of  time that they're asking for this PBID.  Let's also review where the PBID came from.  We've been fighting for a PBID.  The city council and the city was fighting for the downtown business owners to create  a PBID in the first place.  So the genesis of this actually is not quite where that is being reported.  Now the property owners had to vote to approve this and they, for years, didn't think that  they had the vote from the business owners.  And now that they do...  They created it.  The fees that are paid, again, the city is the largest contributor of that PBID fee.  So my substitute motion would be to place Mr. Horry in that capacity and I welcome,  if they feel it's appropriate, those elected bodies or whoever is appointed to that to  defer to staff in those cases.  But at least the accountability would be held towards the council member or the council  itself.  So I'm going to move on to the substitute motion.  If I can make a comment on the motion.  I don't disagree with any of it.  Well, does it need a second first?  I don't know.  I'm going to second it.  Go ahead.  And then you can go ahead and comment.  I don't disagree with anything you said except for, as we're going to talk about on the very  next item, the city isn't the largest contributor of fees because we didn't pay them last year.  That's interesting.  It's completely factored in.  Can we speak to that item next?  I'm just making sure that we have our facts right.  He's calling me out.  There we go.  Got you.  Okay.  I'm going to second the motion.  And I want to explain, just as Council Member Morgan isn't attempting to affront Council  Member Orry, I'm not attempting to affront the PBID.  For me, it's a matter of education.  I feel like it's so important for the council to be looped in and understanding that work  and to be informed and advised.  I've had to learn about it outside of that opportunity.  And so for me, it's really about kind of getting on a similar footing and understanding  the issues and understanding the needs from the city.  And I think having a city appointee, that's one of the elected officials, is how we do  that.  So that's why I'm going to second the motion.  Any further comment, questions?  Yeah.  I could go either way on this.  And I think that's a good point.  I think that's a good point.  But I do think it's important to acknowledge that if we put Mr. Orry in this role, we're  acknowledging that we're going to have to remake this decision again in four and a half  months, five months.  Is there anybody else on the council who has interest?  I've worked with Mr. DiGiovanni quite a bit over the last year.  I don't want to jump in at this point, but maybe after, if this passes and Mr. Orry becomes  part of it, then I'd be interested in the future.  I'm going to make a substitute motion that we appoint Councilmember Huber to the  PBID.  And again, no affront necessary.  Frankly, Councilmember Huber, I've heard you speak pretty frequently at council meetings  about the PBID and their work.  I know that you're well informed and plugged into that work, and I know that you care deeply  about it.  I also know that your term is another couple of years, and so for the continuity's purposes,  it seems like there'd only be one meeting where Councilmember Orry would be able to  attend.  For that reason and that reason alone, I'm making that substitute motion.  If that's not of interest to you, you let me know now and I'll withdraw.  It's not of interest to me.  Okay.  I withdraw my motion.  We've got a motion and a second on the floor to a substitute motion and a second on the  floor.  I call on Councilmember Orry to appoint Councilmember Orry.  Let's go ahead and call the roll.  I'm trying to get back to that second one or whichever.  Okay.  Councilmember Huber.  Councilmember Morgan.  Councilmember Orry.  Councilmember Reynolds is disqualified.  Councilmember Stone.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Aye.  is disqualified as well so it carries 4-1 with two recusals.  Okay, great. Congratulations on the report.  Go ahead.  My acceptance speech is correct.  Thank you very much.  I'll report back when I hear.  Thank you.  I don't know that I understood what was said.  You said I'll report back when I hear.  Thank you, Councilmember Ory.  All right, item 5.4, property-based improvement district general benefit.  Mr. Constantine.  Just to close out the last item, it has been now, we're in the third year of the first five years of the PBID.  It may be beneficial to request a PBID to present to the council so you can get a good understanding of the first two years,  what's been happening, what their challenges are, and to be able to just get a good starting point.  And then get updated by your councilmember representative for the regular meetings that are occurring.  In terms of the amendment, when the PBID was first formulated, a PBID's assessment is assessed against property based on some type of formulaic approach  that is designed to assess the cost of some benefit that's directly associated with the property to the property.  So if I'm intentional, I'm going to get a good start.  If I'm intending to clean the sidewalks, then linear square footage of sidewalks in front of my business is a good measure to say,  okay, if it's $100,000 and it's 100,000 square feet, and I have 200 square feet, I should pay $200 for my assessment to be able to cover that cost.  And so that nexus has to be pretty tight.  And the engineer and management plan refers to what those services are, what that nexus, that direct benefit nexus is to those properties.  And in our case, it was looking at, you know, linear square footage of sidewalks in front of my business.  But anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway  frontage areas, parking lots, the sidewalks around parking lots, the City Hall complex,  the plaza. I mean, we pay just shy of $70,000 a year for that direct benefit. But as always,  with an area like the downtown, the downtown is also visited by folks from throughout the city.  And so the property-based owners that are being assessed and paying for some type of benefit that  directly is attributed to their business are also generating a more general benefit to the  remaining community and those who visit. And so by extension, there is an argument that there is  a component of general benefit that should not be assessed to those property owners. And that's why  they refer to it as a general benefit. In terms of this analysis, when the management plan was put  together, there was approximately $17,000, the exact amount as in the report, $17,467. That was  calculated with the initial budget. And so the amount that was calculated was $17,467. And so  the amount that was calculated was $17,467. And so the amount that was calculated was  the amount that was calculated was the same amount that was collected  prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared prepared prepared  prepared prepared  prepared prepared  prepared prepared !  the council at that time after acknowledging  and representing that we would be assessed every year  approximately 67, $68,000 that we are not inclined  to contribute to that general benefit.  What's being requested of the city council today  is to execute an amendment to make that payment  to make up that general benefit so they get the full amount  of what was calculated in the management plan  to be able to provide that directly into the services.  Most of that money would go towards the cleaning services  that are occurring downtown.  I'm sorry, Mr. Councilman, can I ask a quick question?  Do those cleaning fees also include the city plaza?  It does, but the calculations were based  on the sidewalk common travel areas,  not the actual insides of the parking lots  and the plaza itself.  And so we met with the PBID and the PBID was engaging  in cleaning services.  We were also involved in cleaning activities  within the plaza.  That wasn't necessarily something contemplated  in the management plan, nor was the city paying  for the scope of services that were being provided.  So although we are the largest contributor,  we're the largest contributor based on frontage square footage  and size of buildings that derive the benefit.  It wasn't contemplated, you know, I don't,  I won't go into a private business  and clean their common areas that two businesses may share.  It's only along the sidewalks and whatnot.  So up till now, the amount of work they were doing,  in the plaza was impacting their ability  to perform throughout the remaining 45 blocks.  Thank you.  Sorry, I cut you off.  You can continue.  No worries.  I think that covers what the tenor of the request is  from the PBID.  And so the action would be to authorize the execution  of an amendment to the agreement for the city  to contribute the $17,467, not knowing because this item had  come up before whether this is a,  something that council would consider.  We did contemplate in budget for these dollar amounts  in the budget so that no supplemental appropriation  is required, just your authorization  to execute the amendment and to be able  to distribute the funds.  Thank you.  So you set the money aside?  The $17,000, yes.  But didn't give it to them?  No, they were given the pass through for the direct benefit,  the $67,000.  The $17,000, the council had not given direction  to execute an agreement to commit those funds.  So we're just really voting to give them the funds we set aside  to give them anyway?  Correct.  Thank you.  Other comments from council?  I have a comment.  Council Member Orte.  Just a couple questions, Chris.  The source of the $17,000,  $17,000 bill.  If I understand the correction,  what revenue source is covering it?  That's the question.  It would be the general fund revenue sources  of sales tax property, UUT, and fines.  Would this be a annual,  permanent expenditure by the city?  Yes.  Could a future council opt out of a reduced amount?  Would this be a permanent expenditure by the city?  Yes.  Would this amendment as specified, no?  I mean, it's almost like they've got cheapness up  for me because it's off budget.  And I hate to be a penny pincher on this kind of stuff,  but really, I think since your said the police officer's position  is frozen because of our concerns for the economy,  and I think that when there's a lot of money in the bank,  and if we're going to do a final budget in 60 days,  that we should have all options available,  no discretionary funds, any.  I don't doubt that in 60 days we'll give 17,000,  but I think we need to be consistent that we're, you know,  trying to put things together the best budget we can  and that all discretionary funds will be on the table.  I would suggest that we defer this decision  until the October meeting.  Other questions or comments?  Council Member Ory stated that he would like to have us defer  the decision until the October meeting  when we'll be discussing the budget.  Is that a motion, Council Member Ory?  I'm sorry.  How many folks do we have signed up to speak?  Just one.  Just one.  Any comments via engaged or online?  Tom DiGiovanni.  Mr. DiGiovanni.  So if you can go to that over there.  Thank you.  Thank you, Council Members.  Here today to obviously,  to support the amendment to the contract,  but frankly, having heard what I've just heard  in the last 15 minutes or so,  it would be possible, I think, from,  I can't exactly speak for the Board,  but as Board President, if these funds are delivered sometime  in a few months from now, that's clearly worth it.  In some respects, some of the comments that were made about  FGDID have some inaccuracies to them,  and it's probably high time to,  for us to simply present to the Council  in the next month or two,  what exactly FGDID does and how much it does  in downtown on a daily basis.  It's over 32 hours.  It's over 32,000 hours in the first two and a half years.  And it happens, although we do have the statistics,  if you want them,  amounts of cleaning and safety  and hospitality for downtown.  I must say, I think some of the concern I've heard,  not just here at the Council of Chambers,  but also outside,  is the function of the worldwide high level problems  that's facing the city,  which of course is this pandemic.  And we're doing the very best that we can,  but there are some times,  say, this is something I described to the,  to, to, to,  not to Sean, excuse me,  to you Randall,  that there have been some times  in the last few months in particular  when there were folks in the,  in the plaza who were essentially sitting there  that it is not possible to safely be in that space.  Although always the,  the hazardous materials, if you will,  both the needle waste and the feces were picked up.  So we've had,  one of the things I wanted to say,  we've had some,  some concerns and things that we wanted to bring forward  to, to the Council at some later date.  And perhaps at that later date is,  is, is a couple months from now,  and that's when the decision about the,  the,  the,  the general benefit of the location  could be discussed further,  because in some respects,  I think,  under the current circumstances.  Thank you.  I'll have you finish your sentence,  but we are out of time.  So I do have a question for the speaker.  So Mr. De Giovanni,  are you requesting that we punt on this  until you come back  and can give a presentation?  If the Council wishes to devote on it now,  that would be terrific.  We would like to come back and talk about some,  some challenges that are,  that are we're experiencing.  In,  in the downtown.  And that it's,  at some point,  it's beginning to overwhelm our resources.  Our resources,  we only have so many hours that we can devote to this,  based on the number of dollars,  the amount of dollars that are in place.  And then by,  by,  you know,  the city and,  and the,  and the property owners.  By and large,  the property owners and many,  many of the,  of the,  of the business owners.  Mr. De Giovanni.  In the essence of time,  I do,  I do believe that Council Member Morgan felt his question was answered.  So I,  I would like to move us forward unless there's any other questions for the speaker.  We appreciate your time.  Thank you for being here,  Mr. De Giovanni.  Thank you so much.  So two comments.  A,  Mr. Stone was right and I was wrong.  We are the biggest contributor.  We should pay everything.  So I got to point that out.  I don't do that every day.  I thought I'd be muted.  So,  it's a rarity.  You do point it out.  Yes.  When it happens,  it did happen.  I do point it out.  I will make the motion to give them the money that we have set aside to give them immediately.  I'll second that motion.  Madam,  Madam Vice Mayor.  Yes.  I,  I know.  I,  I apologize.  I apologize.  What,  what are we missing?  I apologize for him too.  I would like to take some time to look at this.  There were some statements made which caused me to rethink some things on this.  If we could put this over to the next meeting, I would appreciate it so that it could be analyzed  in a different light.  Are you open to, I mean, there was motion to second, you had a substitute.  I'll make a substitute.  Can you provide a little more, a little more enlightenment on that?  What are the reasons that you feel like you need more time?  I was not included in the development of the project.  I was not included in the development of this item and was not aware of the issues associated  with it and the statements that were made by both speakers actually caused me to rethink  some issues associated with this.  I'd like to make sure that the city is on the right foot in what it's doing and how  it's doing.  So in light of that, I'll make a substitute motion.  I gently support the concept, but I appreciate,  Mr. Jarrod, our city attorney's concern about this.  I'm inclined to delay it just for the city attorney's benefit, but as we start looking  at the calendar, we probably should just do this during budget session anyway.  But really my substitute motion is how about if we give the city attorney the time that  he needs with the expectation that probably this thing is going to get wrapped up and  sucked into the budget discussion.  Second.  Second.  Any other comments, and particularly Councilmember Ory, anything you want to add?  We have a motion.  Sorry?  I couldn't hear.  Was there a second?  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you.  Okay.  We have a motion on the floor and a second.  Okay.  Thank you.  And so I just want to clarify that this is actually not a substitute because there wasn't  a second on your motion.  Oh, there was.  Oh, there was?  Okay.  Like always, I stand around.  I didn't catch that, so I just didn't want the minutes to be around.  You two will have to sit.  Okay.  Just don't throw the prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared Do I bark at this moment? Aye. Sorry, Carl.  prepared prepared prepared prepared prepared  prepared  prepared  prepared  prepared  Brown. And that means  aye. And then Mayor  Schwab is recused.  So it carries 5-0  with two recusals to  delay it to the next, to give the city  attorney additional time. Thanks, Carl.  We don't have any items  added after the posting of the  agenda, so we will go to reports and  communications. Start with  a verbal report from City Manager  Orme. Yes,  Honorable Mayor, members of the Council, thank you very much.  Just wanted to give  you, as I told you previously,  an update from the financial  perspective on where the city stands. I know that  it's been mentioned on a  number of occasions, and  I too have concern  with regard to the financial  state of affairs. However,  which is typical of me, I'm starting out  with positive news.  The finance team is working to close the city's  books for the fiscal year ending this past  June 30th. Staff will  close those books by late September,  hence why it's  timely calendar to have our budget come back  in October. And  so, anyway, the preliminary cash  position at the end  of this fiscal year, 6-30  of this calendar year, all the  funds was about $135,490,648.  That's roughly $945,000.  That's roughly $945,000.  That's roughly $945,000.  Higher than what staff projected  the 6-30  cash position would be, and we  projected that on April 30th.  And that's primarily attributable  to the two things. One,  general fund revenues, and I'm sorry for my  foggy glasses. I'm trying to do my best here.  You've all got it. Yes.  General fund revenues for this  past fiscal year are meeting  or generally exceeding  the budget, so the revenues are up.  Tax revenues will be online.  Approximately with what we adopted  in the budget the council adopted,  while the property taxes and the UUT,  utility users tax, looks like it may exceed  the budget by about $500,000.  So, we're looking good there.  In addition to that, the other piece  that's attributable to that increase  in the fiscal year numbers is that  the expenditures are trending lower than budgeted.  Staff's awaiting the final accruals,  but it looks like that's going to be  around $500,000 as well. So, finishing up last fiscal year,  year. We're coming in pretty good. As you know, that that includes the first component of when  COVID-19 hit, so we're good so far. Staff continues to monitor the revenue projections all the way  through the calendar year, and sales tax projections continue to track with original projections.  However, we haven't seen this second quarter of the year come in, which is going to be pivotal  for us to understand. TOT revenue is looking like it's coming in slightly above revenue projections,  so thank you to our hoteliers. We're seeing those revenues continue to come in. The hiring  freeze and staff's conservative and restrictive use of expending budget has also been contributing  during this time in particular to help curtail general fund costs. Another piece that I wanted  to make sure you're aware of is that the CARES Act funding continues to be monitored to ensure  that the city is able to maximize the utilization of those one-time dollars, and the cost incurred  before the end of the fiscal year, before June 30th,  was about $400,000, somewhere in that ballpark, and we will likely be fully eligible to be  reimbursed through that program, the CARES Act program. However, we are continuing to research  that and keep our eye on that. All that good news. However, due to the uncertainty of the long-term  effects of COVID-19, I am continuing to work with staff regarding the potential budgetary adjustments  in October, and we'll update projections with the best available information staff has, which  hopefully will be helpful to you in the future. Thank you.  DR.  DR. which hopefully by the end of this month and September, we'll have those numbers of actuals that are coming in. If there are further reductions necessary, we're looking, I'm estimating somewhere between 2 to 10% potential reductions.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  DR.  right in the middle with around five potentially,  that's a huge hit to this city.  And so I just wanna make sure  that this council's aware of that.  I wanna make sure the public's aware of it.  And obviously I can't speak specifically  to the dollar amounts because we don't know yet,  hence why we're waiting until October  to come back to council.  So with that, I wanted to make sure  and allow you to understand  where the numbers are coming in at.  Last fiscal year, we're looking good.  This fiscal year, up in the air,  but I will tell you,  it's probably not gonna be pretty  because of the secondary shutdown.  With that, that's my report.  I've got a comment about that.  The university was just projecting  that they were 5.9% down for next fiscal year.  So that's tracking consistent with other entities  and organizations and municipalities throughout the state.  It seems to be kind of the magic number  between five and eight.  So thank you for the report.  Absolutely, thank you.  Mr. Ory, did you have any comments  or questions?  No.  Item 6.2 is sunshining of negotiation proposals.  Chico Management employees.  This is for information only.  6.3 is council member requests.  Pursuant to AP and P 1010,  council members may verbally request an item  to be agendized at a future meeting.  After stating what the item would be,  a majority vote is a no.  The council is needed in order for staff  to agendize council members.  May also submit requests in writing.  And council member Ory has submitted a request  to discuss Annie's Glen.  Council member Ory?  Yes, I feel that the two is better  from several residents of the Annie's Glen area.  Can you hear me okay?  Yep.  Yes.  Yes.  And I assume that you would want these agendized.  There may not be something here we could take action on,  but I'm primarily asking that this be agendized  for the August 18th meeting.  Does anybody have any questions for Mr. Ory?  Mr. Huber?  So Mr. Ory, are you asking for a general discussion  of the Annie's Glen situation or for a specific, for a,  for specifically these three items to be addressed?  In other words, is it more general,  is it more general or is it specific  to just these three items?  It's hard for me to answer, I guess,  because this is what the neighbors came up with  as the most actionable item for us to deal with.  If there are other things we can do,  I'm sure we can agendize,  in such a way that we would also be able  to consider other suggestions of personnel.  Yeah, I just want to make sure it's not spelled out  so specifically that we can't talk  about the Annie's Glen situation in a broader sense.  So I guess my motion could be to agendize a discussion  of Annie's Glen, specifically the three concerns  and suggestions raised by our neighbors.  Thank you.  Do we have any speakers for this item?  And did we receive any comments electronically?  We did.  We received, I believe, three comments on Engage Chico.  We did not receive any additional public comments  in the public comment email account.  And if he is still here, Jeff Creed was going to speak.  Okay.  So let's, why don't you read the names of the people  who submitted comments.  We'll review them.  And if Mr. Creed is here, we'll speak.  Okay. So the comments received in Engage Chico were  from Carissa Casey, Rob Berry, Jules Brown.  Has everybody had a chance to review the comments?  Okay. Mr. Creed.  Yes.  Okay.  Please share your thoughts with us.  You'll have three minutes.  We're ready.  Yeah. We can't hear you once we come inside.  Sorry. You know, the whole idea of this being agendized is  ridiculous to me because how can you justify removing the camps  that are there without repealing the whole Brown New Deal  or Brown Act, whatever people are calling it,  where you can camp anywhere and go out in the park?  It took, it took a lot of time.  I mean, I think it's a monumental effort just  to get people 50 feet away from the waterway.  You know, these few residents, why do we want to speak  up about their neighborhood?  I'd ask them where they were the last few years  because I've been complaining about Annie's Glen for years.  One of the last things that Chief O'Brien did was he just lost a  campsite that was there for two or three years consistently,  right at the bridge.  So I just think this is, you know,  educate these property owners, these, for hesitancy, neighbors,  how do we get them to come back?  How do we take better care of their neighborhood?  I've had to fight to keep my neighborhood clean.  You know, I need a red curb painted.  I need a curb painted red.  I called the city.  They said, no, we can't do that.  And I argued with them until it finally gets painted red.  I need cars towed.  They don't just come out and say, okay, we're going to tow this car.  It's been here for too long.  You have to argue and fight with the city to get them to come out  and do their job.  And everybody in Chico needs to be doing that in their own neighborhood.  So I encourage these poor people to get out there and fight  for their neighborhood.  But to have an agenda on a council meeting is just ridiculous to me  because aren't you here for the entire city?  And how many citizens are you ignoring when they send you emails asking  for similar items or similar practices or similar effects?  You're just ignoring all those other people and you're choosing  to listen to these four.  I don't get that.  You know, the hypocrisy here is just amazing.  And the lack of planning.  The lack of planning is profound.  So encourage them to use their system to call code enforcement.  I think every code enforcement officer knows me by name.  I think a few avoid me.  I'm sorry about that.  But, you know, they do their job when they're given the opportunity.  And unfortunately, you don't see fit to give code enforcement the proper tools  to do their job effectively.  And you don't give the police the proper tools to do their job effectively.  And I'm sorry that these property owners, these residents, neighbors, you know,  are just now starting to think they need to take care of their neighborhood.  But, you know, I've said it a couple times tonight, go across the street.  There's evidence of neighborhoods being neglected.  You know, and the neighbors need to speak up and demand action from you.  Because the city acts when they have to, but only when they have to.  And that's because you've underfunded them, understaffed them, and undertooled them.  So, you know, if Mr. Orrian wants to give special treatment to four people,  that speaks a lot about his, you know,  the neighborhood's equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity equity  Yes, you can go ahead.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'm the last speaker.  I did sign out.  I did get that email confirmation, so I have my little thing in writing.  So, yeah, we, I have been documenting trash, needle litter, and firebaths,  and graffiti in all city parks since April.  I spend time every week to ensure that needles, drugs, knives are cleaned up.  And I've got a big old huge needle or a knife down in Windshine Park.  So I'm very disappointed that one memo from four people to Mr. Ory gets on the agenda.  And I pray that.  That the same thing goes and is agendized for all the parks that have the same thing.  Thank you.  Okay, thank you.  We'll close the public hearing and discussion, motions.  Counsel's pleasure.  I'll make a motion to agendize Mr. Ory's request for a discussion of Annie's Glen  and specifically the three items that have been submitted.  I'll second it.  Any additional comments or questions?  What was the end of what you said?  I'm sorry.  Including the three items that are on his list.  Gotcha.  But this is strictly only talking about Annie's Glen, not the rest of our parks.  At this point, because that's what was requested, yeah.  If I could comment.  Yes.  I would also, after the action on this one, offer a renegotiation agenda item  that Jesse's and some of the others' concerns,  that we can all agree on.  But what's in front of us right now is just this request.  Councilmember Ory, so you're saying you're going to bring another request after this one?  Is that what I'm hearing?  Yes.  Yes, please.  Okay.  All right.  So there's a motion on the table with a second.  Can we have a vote, please?  Councilmember Huber?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Ory?  Aye.  Councilmember Reynolds?  Aye.  Councilmember Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  So this part of the agenda allows for councilmembers to make verbal requests.  Are there any other requests that councilmembers would like to make?  I have one.  Okay.  Mr. Ory?  I would like this to agenda as the council discussion of the week.  Okay.  I would like to have the entire council policy regarding encampments.  Okay.  So that's a general council discussion regarding encampments, correct?  Yes.  I'm not prepared to specifically bring up whatever administrative policies and interest  you want us to have all taken under.  That's my intent.  Our policy has been up until this date.  I would like to have it up until this date.  Okay.  So we have a motion to approve the encampments as the council has requested.  I would like to have the council's office do my visit on the 18th meeting.  I believe our APMP has asked that if we do approve this, that you provide a little more  direction in that request before we .  That's right.  Are we going to have a discussion about the encampments?  I think they'll be glad to do that.  We'll take that as a .  I think that our options could be either withdrawing the emergency ordinance or modifying it.  So I'm trying to have an open council discussion regarding the policy at a critical time on  this 18th and all these policies have been in place for awhile now to see if we actually  we want to go with any change into the future.  So it is just that, a chance for us to decide whether or not  what correction we've given to date is what we want to continue.  I support it.  I just wanted to add that clarification.  So I will second that motion.  Are there any questions or discussion?  No.  Happy to support it.  Okay.  So we'll take a vote on that, please.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ori?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Are there any other requests from council?  Seeing none,  we will recess to close.  We will recess to close session in conference room one.  However, before we do that,  I'll ask if there are any disqualifications from council members on any of the items.  Yes, I wanted to take that,  and then public comment on closed session.  So any disqualifications?  Okay.  Do we have any speakers on closed session?  We do not at this time,  unless Rob Berry is out there.  But we did receive in some comments in Engage.  I believe we received two comments regarding closed session.  Okay.  Actually, we received more than just the two that I thought.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  We received seven comments for closed session.  And we received two comments for closed session.  Okay.  And the Engage Chico.  The names, please.  Okay.  The first name, I can't pronounce it.  The second one is Nicole Nava, Angela McLaughlin, Claudette Ritter, Rob Berry, Julie Threat, and Jeff Creed.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you. We'll adjourn to closed session.
