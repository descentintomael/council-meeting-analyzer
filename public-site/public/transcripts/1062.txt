 but Okay, I'm going to call the, I feel really loud today. The Planning Commission meeting of Thursday, April 7th to order, and we will begin with the pledge. Pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, and with liberty and justice for all. And roll call. Roll call, please. Commissioner Wall? Here. Commissioner Poulin? Here. Commissioner Goldstein? Here. Commissioner Dermede? Here. Commissioner Cooper? Here. Vice Chair Obers absent. Chair Scott? Present. Thank you. And then item 1.3, selection of a second alternative liaison for the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board. Yes. Yes, Madam Chair. Just in case we run short on the Architectural Review Board, we thought it might be best to have, we already have an alternate. I believe Commissioner Goldstein is our primary, and it would be great if we could have a secondary, because we're losing a member of the ARHPB, and another member may go soon. So we may have a real reliance on it until we can recruit for the Architectural Review Board. So we're asking you to please slow down. I would like to reflect someone. Could you remind us what daily and time those are? They're on the, excuse me, they're on the first and third Wednesdays at 4 o'clock. Yes. I nominate Commissioner Wall. Do you need a formal vote? That'd be great. If that's a consensus, that'd be fine. Okay. Do you want to? All right. Okay. All in favor? Do we need a second? Yeah. Do we need a second? Yeah. I'll second. Okay. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion carries 6-0 with one absent. Thank you. Thank you. Item two, Consent Agenda. We have just one item, and that is the approval of the minutes. Is there a motion to approve? I'll move to approve. Thank you. We have a first. I'll second. And a second. All in favor of approval of the minutes, or approval of the consent agenda, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion carries 6-0 with one absence. Item three, Business from the Floor. Members of the public may address the Commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda, with comments being limited to three minutes. The Commission cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. Is there any business from the floor? Great. We will move to item four, Public Hearings, and I'll start by asking for ex parte communication. Do I have any to my left? Oop. And any to my right? Nope. And I have none. So we'll turn it over to Assistant Planner Madison Driscoll. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Scott and members of the Commission. The proposal in front of you today is to subdivide two parcels totaling 1.24 acres into five lots for single-family residential development. The project is located on the west side of Burnap Avenue, south of Eden Road and north of East Lassen Avenue. The proposed development would include a private access way taking access off of Burnap Avenue. The site is designated low density residential on the general plan land use diagram and zone R1AOB2 low density residential with aircraft overflight zone B2 overlay. The surrounding land uses include mostly single-family housing to the north, south, east and west. Currently on the site, there are two single-family homes on each parcel with a handful of accessory structures. The existing homes are proposed to remain and the accessory structures would be demolished. The project does propose removal of a few fruit trees for the site for future building of single-family residents. All trees removed will be subject to the City's tree preservation regulations. The proposed project would subdivide the two parcels into five lots with a private access way off of Burnap Avenue. Lots would range in size from 6,273 square feet to 15,000 square feet. The property would be a total of 1,680 square feet with an average lot size of 9,999 square feet. This would result in a density of 4.03 dwelling units per acre. Parking would be prohibited along the private access way and in the Hammerhead configuration turnaround to allow for fire access. To accommodate for adequate visitor parking, condition 13 is recommended so that each parcel will provide two off-street parking spaces for the residents. The proposed project falls within the Airpart Overflight B2 zone for the Chico Municipal Airport. That usually results in a lower density. Traditionally, the density for these sites within the AOB2 zone is 0.2 to 4 dwelling units per acre. The site has been identified as an infill parcel by the City of Chico. The site is currently under the Butte County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan. Pursuant to this plan, the density for the site is calculated by the average density of all lots within 300 foot radius, which was equal to 4.16 dwelling units per acre. This is above the proposed 4.03 dwelling units per acre. The applicant has requested one subdivision design modification. The modification would allow for an access way to serve more than three lots within the project. In this proposed project, the access way would serve all five lots. The modification would reduce the amount of driveways off of Burnap Avenue and reduce the possible points of conflict. In conclusion, a neighborhood meeting was held on the project site on July 28, 2021. The meeting was attended by about 10 neighbors, the applicant and myself, Assistant Planner Madison Driscoll. Questions were brought up about traffic and street lighting by the neighbors, but were asked by the applicant. The item, a a! a! a! a! a! a! a! a! a! redressing tentative subdivision map subject to the attached conditions. I'm happy to answer any questions if you have any. Are there any questions of staff? Commissioner Wall? Yes, on the fruit trees in the tree park, are they required to pay the in-lieu fee if they're taken out? They will not be. The trees are small enough in diameter and also that species is not a requirement. Okay. And any questions to my right? Thank you. And we will open the public hearing and begin with the applicant. I guess I'm nominated. My name is Herb. I'm with Roll Sanders Rolls. I'm actually the project surveyor. We've actually reviewed all the conditions and we agreed all the conditions. We work with staff. It's worked very smoothly. And we're here to answer any questions if you have any. Thank you. Are there any questions of the applicant? Thank you. Any further public comment? Alright, with that, I will close the public hearing and bring it back to the commission. Tony, can I bring up one? Yes. I don't know if I need to recuse myself, but I represent the sellers when they purchased, when the applicant purchased the property about two and a half years ago. The sellers and I knew that that was the intent of the buyer and I don't feel I have any conflict. If I may respond? Yes. Thank you. I would say that if you, if you're not, if you don't have a direct financial or indirect, financial interest vote tonight, then you would not need to recuse yourself. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. We're happy to keep you. Can I make a motion? You may. The plan is to drop the resolution 22-01, approving the reinvesting candidates subdivision Mac Perrin S21-01, close Perrin, based on the required findings and subject to discussion. The conditions contained therein. Commissioner Goldstein, would you like to second it? I'll second. Okay. Thank you. So we have a motion by Commissioner Wall and a second by Commissioner Goldstein. Any further discussion? All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So the motion to adopt resolution 22-01, approving the reinvesting tentative subdivision map based on the required findings and subject to the conditions contained therein. Passes. So the motion passes 6-0 with one absent. I'd just like to say it was a privilege to be inside both of those houses and the sheds, so thank you. Item 5, regular agenda. We have none. Item 6, reports and communications. We have a lovely communications sitting at our desk. Thanks, Bruce. Anything else? No. We intended to get the housing element to you earlier. We're still working with the department. The Department of Housing and Community Development gave us some last minute changes and we've been kind of working overtime to address them and get this thing back on track. But I don't have anything else to add to my report. Bruce, do you feel like other jurisdictions are in the same boat as we are as far as the timing with this? Yes, with the housing element? Absolutely I do. Yes, I do. It's rare that somebody's getting through these times. And I've been through a lot of these and I've never seen this much difficulty. There's new laws and it seems like there's a lot of new things that they kind of come up with along the way that's been challenging. If there's anything we can do on a policy level from letters or recommendations or anything to put some pressure on, let us know. We're in close communication with them. I'm pretty much on a daily basis. And we're working it pretty good. And I think we're getting to a point where we're going to get a breakthrough here. Thank you. We will adjourn to Thursday, April 21st. Will we have a meeting then? We sure will. No, we will not. Okay. Maybe we'll see everybody in May. Okay, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great
