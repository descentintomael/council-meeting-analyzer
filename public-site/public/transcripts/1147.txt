 Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, we're going to get started, folks.  All right.  All right, if you can keep it down, please, I'd appreciate it.  All right, we will start this emergency meeting on January 6th, Saturday at noon.  Call it to order, and Madam Clerk, could you do the roll?  Okay.  All right.  Council Member Bennett?  Here.  Just, I'm sorry.  Let's see.  Council Member Bennett.  Council Member Morgan?  Here.  Council Member Tandon is absent.  Council Member Van Overbeek is also absent.  Council Member Winslow?  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Here.  Mayor Coolidge?  Present.  Okay.  All right, item three, determination by the city council that prompt action is necessary  due to disruption or threatened disruption of public facilities.  The city council is being asked to consider making a finding that the emergency city council  meeting is necessary pursuant to government code section 5495.  6.5B-1 involving matters which prompt action is necessary due to the disruption or threatened  disruption of public facilities.  And I believe we have a recommendation from the city manager saying that we hold this  emergency meeting.  Is there a motion to confirm the holding of this meeting?  Second.  All right, we have a motion and a second.  May I ask, can we have an explanation for what it is that constitutes an emergency in  this situation?  Sorry, go ahead.  Sure.  Just like in our earlier conversation, the disruption of activities at City Hall last  night and the apparent potential continuing disruptions of activities at City Hall.  All right.  We are referring to the Safe Space Intake Center.  They have announced that this weekend they're moving to a church parking lot nearby that's  no longer within public facilities.  So does the emergency still stand when they have announced the intention to not be present  there?  Aside from the question, I'm going to ask the city council to consider making a finding  of whether there actually was a disruption or threat to public facilities based on activities  going on.  Unknown, because it has moved around quite a bit without any sort of advance notice.  Okay.  And I understand the move that you're referring to has also been described as temporary.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk?  I would make a substitute motion that we adjourn and hold a properly noticed special meeting  so that we can reconsider the item.  Thank you.  Okay.  So I'm going to make this announcement now.  This is not a chamber for applause or boos.  Do not restrict the rights of your fellow citizens to making their opinion known.  We do not applaud or boo people in this chamber.  We are to consider everybody's opinion.  So we do not want anyone to feel like they're in harm's way by speaking here or anything  of that nature.  So we have a second.  to the substitute motion.  All right. Substitute motion  fails for lack of a second. Madam Clerk, the original  motion. Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  It carries 4-1  with two absences  and it does meet the requirement  of the two-thirds vote of the seated  council that's here at this meeting.  All right. So  speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address  the council on any matters listed on the agenda should  first complete a speaker card, which can be found at the back  of the chamber on that desk.  They can be turned into my left, to your right,  to the city clerk, and once  the first speaker begins, there will be no additional  cards accepted.  All right. We'll move on to our emergency agenda.  The public shall have an opportunity to address the council  on items described in the agenda before  or during consideration of that item.  According to the government code section,  the city council is prohibited  by law from considering  any other business at this meeting.  So we'll start with item 4.1  open session potential  disruption or threatened disruption to public  facilities and will report by city manager  Mark Swarns.  I believe we just covered  the report.  All right. So we will move  on to speakers. How many speakers?  At this point,  we have 38.  All right. One minute. I have a question.  When you say at this  point, are we accepting cards?  After we start taking speakers?  Absolutely not. I'm just saying that  Excuse me. No outbursts from the public.  Thank you. Absolutely not.  The rules are that once the  first speaker is called, there are no additional cards.  I just didn't know if there were more.  I also like a point of  clarification. Is there a specific actions being  requested of the council?  No. The  mayor called the meeting to  consider the situation.  Okay. Well, I would address that to the mayor.  I think there's a specific action that's being requested of the council on this.  I don't think there's a specific action.  I think there's a host of actions that we can look at.  Okay. Can we have some kind of understanding?  Before the public speaks on it, it's good to understand  what we're looking at doing because all we have is  a title and agenda item, but people are  not really cued into what  that spectrum of actions is that we might take.  Okay.  So if we can have the public be  quiet, please, while we're discussing the meeting.  We appreciate that. This is kind of an amphitheater situation.  It's easy for you to hear us.  But it's also easy for us to hear you.  So, you know, we've had that discussion.  We had that discussion a little bit yesterday on the phone.  I think at this point, anything's open for consideration.  So I think it's the will of the council as we move forward.  I think we probably need to look at the contract for safe space.  I think we obviously need to look at the location for this use.  And beyond that, whatever the will of the council is.  Okay. Thanks.  All right.  So we'll move on to speakers and one minute apiece.  Okay. Just a moment.  All right.  So our first, so we now, we are now at 42.  I'm going to, 44?  Okay.  And then I'll call the first speaker, Rob Berry, and there will be a one minute.  And I'm going to call the first two names.  And if you could line up in the center aisle, we can expedite this.  Rob Berry, followed by Richard Naren.  Okay.  If I didn't know better, I would say that this meeting is about shelter, but that's not what it's about.  It's about putting this council between a rock and a hard place.  This is political.  This is a political theater.  If it was about shelter, we'd be talking about the 62 open shelter beds that exist in the city today.  So you have a dilemma.  On the one hand, if you enforce the law, you're going to be accused of punishing  and not having compliance with the law.  passion for people without shelter. If you don't enforce the law you're going  to be criticized by those people who expect the city to enforce their laws. So  you have to go back to first principle. What is that? All we're asking for is  equal protection under the law. Treat everybody the same under the law. If you  wouldn't allow one enterprise to operate without permits you should not allow  another operation. Doesn't matter what they do we expect you to uphold the law.  Thank you very much. Thank you. Richard Nairn followed by Julie Cox. Good  morning. My name is Rick Nairn and I'm the board president for Safe Space  Winter Shelters. So if you want to get mad at anyone here I am. I want to hit a  couple of points real quickly. I only have 55 minutes, 55 seconds left. One is  when we opened up at 101 Main Street we believed  in good faith that we were following the city code with usages that were  allowed as a matter of right and I'd be happy to go through the details when I  have more time to do that. Second in terms of last night we did not have a  lot of notice of when we were doing it because of the when the fine was  received but I would invite you to go back to the back of the building where  it says the area is closed after 5 p.m. or excuse me after 10 p.m. We were  way gone by before 10 p.m. It is a  public area. Other organizations have used it and I do not see anything  anywhere that tells me where I need to notify someone or request permission to  do that. Instead we believe again that it was legal. We were not going to renegade.  Real fast we had 65 people in last night and it's going to be 25 degrees out  tonight. Can you Mr. Nairn, can you address the fact that it's apparently  it's posted on Facebook or something I don't know. We have I have not been notified.  It's not a  official capacity that you have a plan to move. Yes we started to continue  working with several churches and last night Trinity Methodist which is about  a block or so away did grant us permission to use their their parking  lot at least for the anticipated future. So we will not be behind City Hall  tonight. We anticipate being there at Trinity instead. Okay thank you. So Julie Cox followed by Quinn Troster and if you could please line up in the Middle Island area.  Thank you.  I'm just asking for a warming place.  I just got out  of the  hospital  with  pneumonia  and  I  am  just  trying  to  find  a  warm  shelter  during  the  day  because  they  don't  pick  us  up  to  five  okay  there  is  no  room  for  the  homeless  except  for  the  round  your  buildings  you  know  for  us  to  go  and  I  love  to  wear  for  us  to  during  the  day  so they'll  way  like  so  much  can  heal  because  I  I just got out of the hospital last night.  And there's no room anywhere for you to go warm  during the day.  You know, for housing, for homeless people, you know.  I mean, at night you have it back,  but you know, it's not until five o'clock.  That's a long hours to sit out in the rain  with nowhere to go.  So there's anyway, anywhere for that to be, you know.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Quinn Troester followed by Mike Rosen.  My name is Quinn Troester.  I'm the operations coordinator  for Safe Space Winter Shelter.  And I've got a question of whether there is any place  in Chico that is zoned to operate as an intake center  for our shelter.  What we do is unprecedented.  It's not done anywhere else.  The fact that we have to transport people  from somewhere that keeps on moving around  because we're getting kicked out to a shelter  where churches are donating their space.  It's amazing that we've continued to do this.  There's so much community support  that goes into what we do.  There's so much faith and goodwill  that is the lasting embodiment  of what Butte Strong was after the campfire.  We serve so many campfire survivors.  And what I'm seeing today in Chico,  is a lot of people who are trying to get out of the shelter  and get out of the shelter.  is that, that Butte Strong,  that idea is very much fractured in our community.  That we've forgotten what happened there.  We've forgotten that we still have to take care of these people.  This is a legacy that is going to last decades.  And the city needs to support Safe Space  in what we're doing.  Thank you.  Mike Rosen followed by Bill Monroe.  Hi, my name is Mike Rosen.  I'm not involved with Safe Space Chico.  So I just found out about this.  But I do think it's shameful that the city council has made it  a priority to hurt our most vulnerable neighbors  to hurt our most vulnerable neighbors  who already have it the hardest here.  I think it's shameful that not only the city council  made this a priority,  made this a priority,  but now they are trying to prevent  But now they are trying to prevent  decent citizens  decent citizens  are standing up  are standing up to prevent decent citizens from standing up and doing what the city council should be doing.  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  are doing  this disrupting public facilities concern is pathetic dodge and so that it allows the council  to ignore its duty to the citizens. So I urge the city council to waive the fees and work together  with Safe Space Chico to provide needed services for our most vulnerable citizens. Thank you for  your time. Thank you. Bill Monroe followed by Bruce McLean. Hi Bill Monroe, 4th District.  There's a few things that are a little disturbing. One is the fact that when Safe Space was at  1st and Main, it was in the same block with a huge building that's been sitting empty  for over a year with exposed windows on the second floor. We all know which facility that is.  They are allowed to break code by having that kind of structure in the downtown.  And some compensation could have been made toward Safe Space. The other thing is that it's  really disturbing to me that it seems like there's a move afoot by the city council to remove funding  from Safe Space. And that would be horrible. We have 50 to 75 people who need to just someplace  dry and someplace warm to sleep. And it's not actually too much. Also in the summer,  to keep cool.  Thank you. Bruce McLean followed by Charles Withoon.  Hi. On this inauspicious day, January 6th, we have a meeting here on a Saturday.  In emergency session, I wish that you would have seconded Addison Winslow's motion.  Because I think that this should be aired in public. But it is indeed  an opportunity.  An opportunity for the council to show that it is not really mean-spirited by punishing its vendor,  in this case, Safe Space, who's doing the work that I think the city should be doing itself.  I think you should be facilitating their work. And don't forget, we have an election coming up.  And people are paying attention to this issue.  To a lot of people.  It's a great concern. Thank you.  Thank you. Charles Withoon followed by Gail Mandeville.  Good evening. Good day. Thank you for your time.  What's actually happening?  If you talk to business owners downtown, like I have recently,  their beef was with the tents.  The tents preceded Safe Space.  And you, oh,  Safe Space and the tents. No, no, no.  If code enforcement  was on their game, as they have been,  the tents would have been gone by the time Safe Space got there.  At first in May.  What's happening?  Mr. Coppy is closing down  the entire first block  of Chico.  First block of Main Street on the east side of the main street.  It will all be shuttered.  And we couldn't accommodate an intake center for a couple of hours after hours.  Check out the handouts I have for you later.  Thank you.  Gail Mandeville followed by Lori Monroe.  I'm not a Chico native.  I moved here, you know, ten or so years ago.  And I was hoping to find a place that was warm and welcoming.  And friendly.  And it was when I came here.  Now, I don't know where the city council is coming from.  They're not coming from a place of taking care of their citizens.  Have you talked to any of the citizens that are on the streets and found out that they're from here?  They're from here.  They're our citizens.  And I don't know who you're talking to, but you need to talk to all the citizens.  In order to be representative of them.  Please.  Thank you.  Lori Monroe followed by Rob Davison.  I have a few points about the saga of safe space identifying a good intake center for the city.  Each year they've had to identify a new center.  This year, as of tonight, they will have had three different places to use as their intake center.  That in itself sounds like Mary and Joseph searching without success for a room in the inn.  The city could have been proactive and assisted safe space in finding an intake center that both parties agreed to months ahead of time.  I know that's true.  I know that safe space requested assistance because I received an email which listed the items that they were looking, the things that they needed for a good intake center.  And the city chose not to help them.  The concern about the building at Thurston main as an intake center at being a code violation, it's not a valid code violation because they aren't running an office.  This is evident because last night they were able to conduct their research.  They were able to conduct their business at the hands, which is also not an office.  There's a sign at the hands that states that the area can be open until 10 p.m.  That's fine.  So Rob Davison followed by Candy Mala.  My name is Rob Davison, District 3, Councillor Bennett.  I am here to express my deep concern and lack of faith in the council's actions.  If the actions are not followed by the council, then I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to do anything.  I think the actions that are being contemplated include discontinuing the contract with safe space.  I think that would be mean-spirited and retaliatory.  I think it is evidence of what appears to be a failure on the part of the city to negotiate in good faith with safe space to assist if there's an issue with the intake location and code violations.  I don't seem to see that the city is working hard enough to actually address those.  To simply sever the contract and end the services would be really, really mean-spirited and terrible, and it would make Chico City look very bad.  Thank you.  Candy Mala followed by Catherine Riley.  Good afternoon.  Absent any cooperation by the City Council and Planning Commission,  for an operable space to continue this humane work,  the City Council is effectively, purposefully shutting down safe space winter shelter by their own hand.  It goes against the cooperative agreement and the city's contract with safe space,  against wishes and deed of local participating churches, and is deeply inhumane at this time of year.  The tactics of the council, sudden moves and cancellations, last-minute meetings,  ensures little voice of the community to an extremely unpopular set of actions these past 10 days.  I beg you, urge you, to consider offering a allocated space, suggesting space, for this work to continue.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Catherine Riley followed by Jessica Giannola.  Hello.  Since 27 people died on our streets last year, I think Chico is getting a really bad reputation for being repressive, cruel,  and essentially the Alabama of Northern California.  Now, I have thought for a long time that once we're two lanes each way, that more businesses would come up.  Everybody's been waiting for 7-8 to open.  But the people are waiting.  People who would be coming up for Silicon Valley, they're moneyed, they're educated, they're liberal, they won't have any of it.  They're human resources.  People won't send them up here because they will be afraid they are unsafe.  Not unsafe from homeless people, but unsafe from a local city government that just allows 27 people to die on the streets without doing anything.  This city council is destroying Chico's economic future.  And you're turning us in to the Alabama of Northern California.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  We did it once.  If we do it again, we'll just recess for 15 minutes and come back.  So that's how we've done it in the past.  It doesn't matter the issue.  We don't applaud.  We don't talk during the meetings either.  If you guys want to talk, you can go outside.  Thanks.  So the next speaker after Jessica is Hillary Crosby.  Go ahead, Jessica.  Hi, council.  I was anticipating just a minute and trying to figure out the words that I'm going to use.  But they are amazing.  But they are amazing. Because it's really important as service providers and people servicing the most vulnerable population out here that we're not offending and appearing as we are as partnerships. We are serving the most, we, and I say anyone out here who's an advocate, a volunteer, a service provider,  But they are amazing.  But they are amazing.  But they are amazing. who's an advocate, a volunteer, a service provider, anyone who's helping the people who have no housing right now out there in that freezing weather. And they need the partnership of the city to support. The winter and the summer, they're not surprises. We should be disaster planning ahead of time.  disaster planning ahead of time? What is a safe location that's authorized by the city that can  be used in these situations when there is no other site? The intake is only processing people to get  them to a separate place to sleep. That's all that's happening. And we need to have that  partnership with the city and not the intimidation that's happening or the unnecessary fines,  just support from the city. There's a lot more, but a minute goes quick. Thank you.  Thank you. Hilary Crosby, followed by Kim Knott.  Good afternoon. You've heard already that there were 65 people at our shelter last night. I'd just  like to tell you a little bit about some of the people that are staying with us that aren't able  to be here today. We have a mom and two kids. There are no shelter beds available for her in  this town. That person has been on wait lists ever since she showed up at our doorstep.  We had a guest the other day that when I was there experienced seizures. This has happened twice  where we've had to call 911. If we weren't there, that person would have been on the street by  themselves.  We sent a  guest to the hospital the other day. They had a heart attack and just got out of the hospital  yesterday. So to hear that it's not emergent, that these are not emergency services doesn't  quite feel like that. And there seems to be a concerted effort to put me in my place, to put  Safe Space in its place. And I just really, really would like to remember the people we're serving  and how do we get to a point where we can work in collaboration with each other and in partnership?  Because that's, I think, what we both want. This does not need to be this way. Thank you.  Thank you. Kim Knott, followed by Mary Kay Benson.  Hi, Council. I think most people agree that Safe Space is a worthwhile program. The city supports it with, I guess, $50,000.  What's bothering me and what has seemed to bother other people is that there was a big failure to communicate between Safe Space and city management.  I'd like to really request that Mr. Sorensen,  address why when he realized there was a zoning problem,  he didn't call the Safe Space people into his office and figure out a solution instead of having this big carnival that we're in.  I'd also like to say that recently I've been disturbed by the rulings of the city attorney,  which I think is going to lead the city into litigation for which his firm is going to benefit.  I think if we have litigation,  based on his advice, it should go to an outside firm.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mary Kay Benson, followed by Sierra Sandoval.  With the Dickens, this is not the way to start a new year.  But I came to praise Safe Space, not to bury them.  To quote Shakespeare.  I worked at Safe Space Winter Shelter as a night monitor.  It's the hardest work I've ever done.  And frankly, I couldn't do it.  It was so hard.  I also volunteered there for many years.  Now that I'm 75 and retired from even volunteering on the streets,  even though I'm very low income,  I donate money to Safe Space.  Because I believe in them more than anything else.  I believe in this city.  And I have a letter here from a friend whose sister  is on the streets in this freezing rain tonight.  Please help.  Thank you.  Sierra Sandoval, followed by Mike Trollander.  Hi, I'm Sierra Sandoval.  I run the Chico Community Fridge.  So I see the community that's using me.  And I see the community that's using Safe Space firsthand.  And there's a lot of our community that utilize that program.  So I'd love to see a space that they can utilize to continue that program.  One that the city approves of.  I don't know what exactly they're not approving of or where the barrier is.  But I do know firsthand that people are utilizing that program.  So I was just here to say I'd like to see it continue.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mike?  Mike Trollander, followed by Emma Contreras.  Hello, I'm Mike Trollander.  I'm here to just kind of warn us about the idea that are we following good legal advice?  Are we grilling our lawyer?  You know, we've already, we're in a catastrophic problem,  overworn and not doing things right.  And so I, 20 years,  are planning,  there's a couple of things going on here.  One is,  this use is actually an allowed use in your Title 19 Code.  Is there, it's not determined that way,  but it is.  So, I, I, I, I, I, I,  I strongly recommend you grill the lawyer on,  on your legal position here because you're,  you're getting ready for another catastrophic problem.  So, thank you.  Thank you.  Emma Contreras, followed by Chris Freitas.  Emma Contreras, 5th District, Chico, I was born in Chico and have lived here just about  my whole life.  I'm getting my master's at Chico State right now in the Public Administration program and  we often talk about the power of discretion.  Discretion can give administrators and public servants the opportunity to better serve the  needs of their public.  The law is not black and white and oftentimes requires the use of discretion on a case-by-case  basis to best serve the public's needs.  I want to encourage the Council to utilize their discretion to allow for Safe Space to  operate.  I've had a family member utilize Safe Space and without that organization, that loved  one would have been on the streets in the freezing cold.  So while you all enjoy the warmth of your homes tonight, I want to encourage you all  to search for some empathy for those in the community that are not as fortunate.  As a reminder, the unhoused are still a part of the community you are here to serve.  Thank you.  Chris Freitas followed by Rich Ober.  Thank you.  Hello, thank you for allowing me to take your time today.  I've been a part of the 7 District and I haven't really been pleased with my Council member  or the others in the last, honestly, couple years with just their views on pro-homelessness  because most of your guys' advancements to get to the positions that you guys are in  today is pro-homelessness solutions and I don't feel like you guys have been really  pro-homelessness solutions.  It's more been finding problems and not really creating solutions for the problems.  So I'm just going to take a moment to thank you all for your time.  And it's just, it's kind of disheartening to see when you look at a space that is kind  of meant for individuals to find warmth or just even a second chance for a night and  it's just hard to see that this is kind of the position that we're in today and now without  seeing a solution.  So I hope that there's a solution soon because this is ridiculous.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Rich Ober followed by Michelle Zavely.  Good afternoon, Council.  Rich Ober.  Good afternoon.  I'm here to acknowledge and ask you to acknowledge that this is your community and they came  out, we came out in the cold in the middle of a Saturday afternoon with very little notice  to do something that we should not have to do and that is defend a partner, a valued  partner that has a decade of service record with this city and with many of you on the  council.  And to be here today to defend the work that they have done for a decade in good faith  successfully with their hearts and their minds and their passion and their skills behind  it is actually crazy to me.  They've had a contract in place, a small contract of $50,000 and they have done herculean efforts  with that and they have protected the city and served the city in good faith.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely. I'm a fortunate citizen of Chico. My professional life, I'm a public educator  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  Michelle Zavely.  and it may not be your calling to volunteer at Safe Space,  but for me it is and for many others it is.  So please, don't take that away.  Let us continue to support our unhoused citizens.  Thank you.  Thank you, Suzanne Hermanson,  followed by Ciceri Sherry-Puckett.  Hi, thanks for the opportunity to speak.  I'd like to say that I support Safe Space  and all the work they do in our community  and have done for the past 10 or 12 years.  I would like to remind you to keep your eye on the prize.  What is your job here is to provide service  to all of the community members of Chico  and especially to the people who are unhoused.  So I believe that Safe Space keeps people from dying on the streets.  It saves the city of Chico lots of money in police and fire services  and hard work.  It saves the city of Chico lots of money in hospital costs.  And I think it's your job and it behooves you  to continue supporting Safe Space  and to work with them in finding the appropriate intake center.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ciceri Sherry-Puckett, followed by Julia Flynn.  Good afternoon.  The city identified what it perceived as a problem.  That's neither here nor there,  but instead of offering,  a solution,  the city has caused chaos,  which is,  I'd like to think,  obviously harmful.  If the city wishes to be in a more effective organization,  it needs to behave more constructively.  And hopefully we can all continue to take it seriously if it does.  Thank you.  Julia Flynn, followed by Angela McLaughlin.  Safe Space Winter Shelter solves problems that should be bipartisan.  It confuses me that our city council values authoritarianism over privately organized efforts of community members.  It is clear that the city council does not view our towns homeless as people in need,  but instead as a public nuisance.  Let's address this as a public nuisance.  When people die in our streets, who pays for that?  When people are arrested repeatedly for loitering and sleeping where they don't belong,  who pays for that?  We do with our taxes.  When people sleep on the ground, we pay for that.  When people are on the ground with all their belongings, they don't fully rest.  They wake up tired and sore, unable to present themselves in an acceptable way or engage productively in our community.  We all pay for that with our money, with our worry, with our business.  Our community suffers.  We can all sacrifice two hours every day while we're at home feeding our families.  And we'll all win.  Thank you.  Angela McLaughlin, followed by Josh Marks.  Last night I volunteered with Safe Space Intake.  One of the people that I worked with was an elderly woman using a walker, shaking with  cold and in tears.  I helped her bag up the 15 medications that she'd been given when she was released to  the streets from the hospital.  That is who you are hurting with these kinds of actions.  There are many logical arguments to be made for why it is important that the city work  with Safe Space.  But I'm not here to make those arguments.  I'm here to help.  Rather, I would like to know what has become of your humanity.  Twenty-seven people died on our streets in 2023, at least one of them on the sidewalk  downtown.  How you can sleep at night knowing that your actions are directly contributing to the misery  of the poorest among us, many of whom are elderly and disabled, is beyond my ability  to comprehend.  We deserve better public officials.  But in the short term, while we do not have them. Thank you, Josh Marks, followed by Eric Nilsen. Good afternoon. I'm an advocate for Safe Space. It's a good program, but as a downtown business owner, I don't think that it belongs downtown. There's a stigma that follows it. There's already a stigma that downtown isn't safe. I agree that it should be a safe place for these people, and an allocated space. The downtown is a place of commerce.  Downtown's a place of commerce.  It's where business happens.  We can't, you know, people don't want to come down because it's not safe.  Already, business is already hard in 2023.  It has been.  2024 is probably not looking much better.  I just think that I didn't even know that this was down here.  I think that there should be a place for it.  Don't get me wrong.  I have compassion for what's going on.  But I don't think that it does belong downtown.  That's all I have to say.  Thank you.  Eric Nelson, followed by Peter Washington.  Good afternoon.  I am one of many volunteers for Safe Space.  If you haven't volunteered already, I would encourage you to do so.  A few questions.  Why does city government think this is not an emergency when clearly there are lives at stake?  Why can't we use 101 Main Street temporarily and continue to work collaboratively to find an alternative space?  And why is city government not rallying around this wonderful and effective organization?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Peter Washington, followed by Susan Tichuti.  Good afternoon.  Thank you for your time.  I'm encouraged that many people have made some point to what I came to make today.  Your first speaker talked about the importance of enforcing laws.  I want to remind this body that your primary function is legislative.  You're policymakers.  You see a problem.  And your constituents expect you.  You address it.  That's really all I have to say.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Susan Tichuti, followed by Norma Wilcox.  Good afternoon.  Safe Space is solutions-oriented.  And that's what I urge the council to become.  To become solutions-oriented.  Instead of resisting solutions to various kinds of ways that we could help Safe Space  and other organizations.  And I think it's very important to think about the role of people who are on the council  and in the city to participate in finding solutions.  Instead of demonizing.  Instead of saying that they're a potential disruption.  Look at what those lives are and what those lives need.  Find a way to support Safe Space.  And find a way to come up with solutions.  to homeless problems. Thank you.  Thank you. Norma Wilcox, followed by David Halimi.  My name is Norma Wilcox. I'm a registered nurse.  The key is looking at prevention and  a safe place that started 10 years ago.  I remember there was a time where it was very, very cold at night  and a number of  community members decided to open up the Peace and Justice  Center to allow people to come in and have a  warm place. And from then  and from there, the churches opened up.  And I really believe that it's really  important for each of these city council members to  take your turn and volunteer at Safe Space.  Get to know what the  these people are doing. What kind of people are they taking care of?  Some of these people are really, really sick.  They come from the hospital. They come with all kinds of  medical equipment.  Thank you. David Halimi, followed by Will Brady.  Good afternoon.  I own and operate two businesses on 2nd Street,  close proximity to the current location.  I also own the parking lot right behind Old 711.  I can tell you that all three locations have been negatively impacted.  It's not a political statement. It's a practical statement.  I do applaud Safe Space for their mission. I fully support it.  Needless to say, every human being deserves a roof over their head  and a safe space. But a prominent corner of downtown Chico  in the middle of the Christmas season was neither the right place  nor the right time. Downtown businesses face daily challenges to survive.  One of the challenges that both the DCBA board and the PBID board have been trying to overcome  is downtown being safe and clean. Clean and safe.  The current location doesn't lend itself to either one of those.  Let's work together to find a better location.  Thank you. Will Brady, followed by David Halimi.  Will Brady, followed by David Halimi.  Hello. I'm also a downtown business owner.  I used to have a couple more but a lot less these days.  To my wife's great joy.  As a previous and hopefully future contributor to Safe Space,  I hope to see them continue their activities.  What they do is absolutely necessary in the downtown.  What I do see being a problem mainly in this town,  more so than Safe Space, is the lack of public space.  is the inability for people to solve these problems before we have these meetings.  And that's both sides.  The fact that we couldn't find a better location for everybody previous to this,  after everyone's got their dopamine released,  is a testament to how fractured and useless this conversation has become.  Now, in the future, I recommend you take a second from somebody  and you let us all go cool off.  Everyone can go sit down, come to a better solution for everybody,  and we don't have to have these meetings.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  Star B, followed by Leanne Powell.  I was at Safe Space, and I had my 11 heart attack.  Here's the advantage for me.  If I hadn't been there, I'd have been dead.  The night before that, I had to stay in one of the shelters.  These people volunteer.  They're for nothing.  People need to understand that.  What they do for us, don't pay their bills.  So, we need to come together and figure out something.  Because I'm a dead man walking, really.  But they're behind me.  They call, they check on me, everything.  And now...  I'm not the only person.  They help other people.  So, we need to find a solution to this problem.  God bless everybody.  Thank you.  Leanne Powell, followed by Eric Chisler.  Hi, my name is Leanne Powell, and I own a business downtown on 3rd Street.  And I will be one of those folks that is...  I just signed a lease, and I'm getting ready to move over to the block right a couple doors down from where the current intake center is.  And so, that block won't be completely dead, I'm hoping.  But I am a little concerned.  I am not against safe space at all.  I think it's an amazing program that it offers our homeless community.  And I do think that we do need something like that.  But personally, being a business owner downtown and having an intake center specifically downtown,  I don't really feel like that's a need to have it in the downtown area.  The downtown area is a place of business and for commerce.  Like previously...  Business owners stated.  And I have customers that do not come downtown anymore or have voiced their opinion with me,  saying that they're afraid to come downtown due to the homelessness that we have going on downtown.  And the intake center, with the things that are going on in that area,  I do know that there are tents next door to that area that popped up before the intake center arrived.  And that did not help.  And I don't know if that has anything to do with the intake.  But I do know that there are tents next door to that area that popped up before the intake center arrived.  But it didn't make the downtown look any better.  So, you know, I think that we should come to a solution.  You got a little extra.  Oh, I do. Thank you. I don't know what happened.  So, I think that...  I meant you had already.  Oh, okay.  Not that you get.  Okay, so...  Just a second.  So, Eric Chisler, followed by Emily Alma.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry. I'm still a little shook by Mr. Starr's speaking.  Thank you.  I wanted to come up here in good faith,  but a lot of people have said all of the logical and passionate arguments that can be said,  all the legal arguments that can be said.  I can't come up here in good faith because I have no faith in you.  I have no faith in Councilmember Morgan candy-crushing his way through another meeting  while people speak on issues of importance.  We're not individually pulling out Councilmember's names,  talking directly about them.  Okay.  We're here to talk about the issues.  Thank you.  I'll put it in the interest anytime you want.  Okay, I'm sure. I don't mind.  Continue, please.  We'll add 10 seconds.  Thank you.  There's not much to say.  I've been up here enough times to know that speaking to you doesn't do anything.  You have the political majority, and Rob Berry is right.  This is political theater, but it's on the other side of the dais.  See you in November.  Thank you.  Emily Alma, followed by Catherine Belden.  I have been so moved by the two folks who received safe space services who spoke here today.  Gentle people who had serious, very serious medical problems.  These are people who they could be our uncles, our aunts, our sisters, our brothers.  Please, please.  Please open your hearts to what Safe Space is providing.  It's a crime that years ago,  Safe Space was set up to have a 24-7 facility  that was shut down by bureaucracy.  And I want to invite you not only to support Safe Space,  partner with them, work with them.  Sure, if downtown isn't the right place,  find a place that there's plenty of right places.  But please even consider opening a 24-7 shelter.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Catherine Belden, followed by Bo Rasmussen.  One in four homeless people live in California.  In Chico, 925 homeless people live on your streets.  I'm not originally from here, and I know how cities work.  I was employed with the city before I moved here.  And one of the first things I remember  is my supervisor.  Looking at me after telling me an assignment,  telling me, if a homeless person approaches you,  or if they're doing something that you may see  and that they might not supposed to be doing on city property,  they're allowed to.  It is public property.  They were compassionate to the homeless people  and their community, and they knew it was not their fault.  So to move here and not see that compassion  from this city council, it was really disappointing.  Chico Safe Space,  is actually making a change.  So I'm speaking as a community member  asking that you realize the community supports Safe Space  and that it should be a priority for you to not make walls,  but to stand in support with them.  Thank you.  Bo Rasmussen, followed by Sam Keller.  Hi.  I am a born and raised citizen of Chico,  and I have volunteered with Safe Space  for the last three years.  So I'm very familiar with the community-led efforts,  to make this essential and emergent service happen.  We serve so many kinds of people,  from campfire victims to domestic survivors  and families, my own family members.  I think it is disgusting that the city  make efforts to block us from being able to use this location  as an intake center,  as someone who works specifically in the intake,  and I think that is a very important thing  to be able to use this as a center.  It's been a dream of a location,  and I would be very sad to see it go along with many others.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sam Keller, followed by Avri, or Avri,  I'm sorry if I just ruined your name.  Hi, my name is Sam Keller.  I'm a taxpaying citizen of Chico.  Not originally from here.  But so we've heard some previous people speak on,  you guys are supposed to be legislators, and,  and affect solutions.  So we're here to debate if there's a potential disruption  in a threatened public space.  A public space in a building that would be closed  during the times when they're doing their intakes.  There's no money there.  We're not even using the space.  And to see like the city,  you have a huge following,  huge support for safe space,  and it's clear the need is there.  And to see the city just continue their policies  of just ignoring things at work,  like stuff like housing,  first models, or, or, or like filling a need.  Like you should be thankful for these people  that are there volunteering.  They're fixing a problem.  You guys all have, we all have the same issues,  and they're affecting solutions.  And you guys are more worried about candy crush.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Avri, followed by Owen.  We come here wrapped in our privilege, keeping warm,  against the cold.  You probably traveled here a short distance in your car  with your heat in there, rolled out of your bed  and your heated house, you know,  in your warm, clean bed to make decisions  on those that do not have the same luxuries of you.  Have you ever lived on the streets  in the cold rain of nights,  wrapped in wet moldy blankets  with a leaky makeshift tent,  or in the dead of heat in the summer  with little more than the shirt on your back  because the belongings you had were stripped away  from your city, your home, your home, your home.  It's like crazy that we're here,  that you're doing this right now.  You continuously make decisions  that endanger our most vulnerable population  of our community, and now you seek punishment  to an organization ran by our community for our community  that you should be happily involved in and be supporting.  I just wanted to be another person in this community,  I'm born and raised here, to look you in the eye  and say how disgusted I am with you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Owen, followed by Anne Seymour.  Is Owen?  I couldn't read the writing on the...  Okay, go ahead.  Anne Seymour is our last speaker.  I would like to silently applaud the speakers  who have spoken in favor of safe space.  And I would like to ask the city council,  why it seems that you are so much more in favor of litigation  than you are in problem solving.  To not solve problems is intellectual laziness.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That was our last speaker.  All right, questions or comments from council?  I have a couple of you guys.  Okay.  Well, I have a lot of comments and questions.  But the first one I'll start with is, Mr. Sorensen,  can you tell me the first time that you heard from safe space?  One of the things that we are being accused of  is not finding a space for them or not doing this  or not doing that.  The first I have heard about this was on December 19th  or saw an email come through on December 19th  asking for use of that location.  Were we notified and asked before that?  And we're talking about the 7-Eleven location?  Or any location.  I didn't hear of any locations.  On November 20th, we received an email from Ms. Crosby  indicating difficulty finding an intake center.  And we looked through the inventory of city facilities  for a match that might be suitable.  Without success, city facilities tend to be purpose-built  for their purpose.  Most of our city facilities are pretty well used.  And plus, they tend to carry  or contain sensitive infrastructure.  Such as, you know, examples.  We had a couple that we had to eliminate  just because we had hundreds of thousands  or millions of dollars worth of equipment  that we would be worried about the security of that equipment.  So we responded back on, well, nine days later, the 29th,  that we couldn't find a location,  at least among the city inventory.  We knew that they were working with a commercial real estate agent,  trying to find a location.  And then on, I want to say the 14th,  is when we read about it in the newspaper.  That they had been notified,  that they were going to operate there.  At that point in time,  code enforcement contacted Ms. Crosby  and suggested that they get a zoning verification  to conclude that this was the proper location  because initial review indicated we couldn't see a fit.  They didn't respond.  So by December 19th, a notice of violation was sent.  And then we received their request  for zoning verification the following day.  So I hope that answers your question.  Yeah, that did.  And there was a fee or no fee for that?  Because we also were...  We did not charge a fee.  Okay. So no fees have been charged.  We were not notified before November 20th  that there was any issue of...  We had no...  We had no knowledge prior to November 20th  that there was an issue finding a location.  I didn't.  Okay. So because I keep hearing over and over and over,  we need to work with Safe Taste,  we need to work with Safe Space,  we need to work with Safe Space.  However, if I or anybody on this dais don't know  that there's an issue, it's virtually impossible for us  to try to...  It does make it difficult.  Yeah.  ...work with them.  So I just wanted to put that out there.  So fees being waived, we talked about that.  Disturbing windows at First Street,  I will absolutely agree with you 100%.  I think that...  Windows are disturbing at First Street too.  And I believe that they have been cited and fined for those  and that we'll continue to be working on.  And this all needs to be aired in a public meeting  where there's more people.  There's over 100 people in this room right now.  That's more than we have at most council meetings.  So clearly, we are able to get people here and have...  to talk about things.  One of the things that I don't understand and maybe somebody  from Safe Space can answer is, you know,  you keep saying you keep getting kicked out  and you can't find anywhere to go.  I would like to know why you keep getting kicked out.  Because I keep hearing that, you know,  you're such an amazing location, you're doing so good.  And I agree, actually.  I think you guys do provide a great service.  But I don't know why we have to find a new location every year.  And I think we know in July that December's coming.  So, yeah.  Rick, you're right.  I think we're going to have to do something about it.  I think we're going to have to do something about it.  One of the problems we have with hiring...  I asked a question.  One of the problems we have with finding an intake center is  that it's a major ask for any organization to give us part  of their facility for three whole months, right?  So each year, we've had people who, you know, say,  we'd like to but we can't do it for more than a couple weeks.  We can't do it for more than a month.  So we've had some success in different areas.  But we've also run into problems.  So, for example, for about, I think it was four years,  we were at Calvary Community Church down on 13th Street.  Very, very generous congregation, very aging congregation.  They couldn't make it down their stairs,  so they gave us their basement.  Unfortunately, neither could many other people make it  down their stairs.  There were major ADA issues.  We had another church three years ago now  that had the same issue.  They gave it to us for one year, but ADA was an issue.  We were at the old...  Work Training Center for several years.  It was outside, which wasn't great,  but we were able to make it work.  How do we know where that building is today?  It's the new Jesus Center.  It's being used for homeless services,  but they can no longer accommodate us in the way  that the Work Training Center did.  Last year, we were offered a building that was in escrow  from the Jesus Center near their new construction,  and the building was about to be torn down.  So we were there for one year knowing that it was limited.  It didn't have running water,  and we had to have the electrician come in regularly  to put the lights back on, but again, we made do.  So it's not in the sense that we don't know it's coming up,  but it is really, really hard to find a building that is usable  and that the organization is willing to share with us.  In this year, we did not get it.  We weren't even notified that this building might be available  to us until close to the middle of December,  where I think we were a week before opening,  and that was our panic phase.  Gotcha. Okay.  Thank you for your experience.  That's all I have right now.  Further questions?  Yeah, here.  Just one, just as a response to the fact that people showed  up on short notice doesn't excuse us  from public noticing requirements.  I think it was .  We're still in council discussion at this moment,  but that was a response to a comment.  The question is that we looked at city facilities and found  that none, that the super was built, and you said none matched,  but last night, you said, oh, we're going to have to do this.  But they are in the middle of the middle  of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle  of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle  of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle  of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle  of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle  of the middle of the middle of the middle  operations while still respecting our city code? I'm sorry to say that again? Is our parking lots  then within consideration now because clearly they're at risk of shutting down because we are  kicking them out of the building. They resorted to operating in a parking lot and are operating  out in a church parking lot. So now as we're looking at city facilities and we agree that  safe space is a program we should support, can we look at our parking lots for use for the intake  center? In part that would really require a discussion with safe space. At this point,  I've heard they've found a temporary location. I've heard they have a prospect for a location  for the rest of this season that may alleviate this question. Right, that feels like a little  bit of progress. Thank you. What would feel like more progress is if a conversation was happening  instead of us seeing stuff on Facebook? Safe space has a meeting with city staff on Tuesday. I think  they were hoping that the citations would be postponed until that meeting could occur so that  these kind of conversations could continue.  You have any other questions? Okay. So I have a few. Any questions? All right. So how much money  does the city of Chico spend each year on the homeless population? We actually don't have a good  total. Just the Genesis Center, 4.7 million.  But that doesn't include very significant amounts of public works time, police time,  legal costs. My best estimate would be around six or more million per year.  It's around $6 million a year. And how many pallet shelters do we have?  177. And I believe I'm correct in saying until Sacramento builds theirs, which they are doing  right now, 244, that that is, as far as I know, the largest number of homeless people in the  country. It is the largest I'm aware of. In the entire United States. So I don't know if the  compassion aspect of this is really at play here. You know, you're talking about a city. I'll clear  the chamber, guys. I will. You can be. All right. We'll take 15 minutes recess. Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay. Ms. Morgan, you had a question. All right. We'll let folks file in. If you want to come in,  please come back now. Hey. All right, folks. We're going to get restarted here. All right. Ms.  Mr. Morgan, question or comment?  Yeah, I'm ready.  Okay, so I have no doubt about the work that Safe Space  and its volunteers do.  And I toured Safe Space years ago with Ansel McLaughlin.  It was a positive experience.  Having said that, attempts to project vilification  on this body are just that, projection.  Our city spends more money per capita on homeless issues  than most other cities in California,  save LA and San Francisco, and look how that's turned out.  More money is not going to fix the problem.  It is not the City of Chico's job to ensure proper management  of the nonprofits that operate here.  If Safe Space and its leadership can't operate efficiently,  let's say like the Jesus Center, the Tory shelter,  trying to make it look like it's the city's fault  by purposely misleading the public shows a lack  of accountability and responsibility.  Does Safe Space know this, the leadership?  They do.  But when they purposely disrespect the citizens and culture  of the city in an attempt to gain favorable press  and donations, it shows their own lack of desire  to be a trusted partner.  Citizens and business owners who want a safe place  to raise a family, an ideal location for business,  and a premier place to live shouldn't be vilified,  told to rot in hell, or that God may not have mercy  on their souls.  Are there solutions for Safe Space?  Certainly there are.  Is the city willing to work with them to find them?  Certainly it is.  Will it be a city parcel?  I doubt it.  If Safe Space truly wants to be a trusted partner,  they need to act like one, not point the finger at the city.  And when they don't, and until they're ready to act  like they're a trusted partner, they should stop  their vilification and their finger pointing, and worse.  I would suggest the city's dollars and staff time  would be better spent elsewhere.  And there's plenty of places that have proven  to be efficient at the very things that most of the people  in the audience today are concerned about.  I don't think it's a big stretch for the city  to help them go find something.  But when you attack our culture by putting something knowingly  where it is going to upset citizens and business owners,  that's not a trusted partner.  That's saying give me what I want,  and then accuse me later of not helping.  Can we help?  Certainly.  We have a wonderful staff, good city council members.  My colleague here, Addison Winslow, I talked about this.  Sidebar a little bit.  I think there's something that can be done.  But we have to trust one another and not come in after the fact,  which is what's been happening.  Mr. Winslow?  Well, it strikes me as somewhat narcissistic to assume  that Safe Space doing their normal operations  was something against the city.  There was nothing political about Safe Space's operations  until the government came in and tried to shut them down.  That being said, with all the misunderstandings going on,  clearly there's a lot of bad blood in the air.  And I think what most people in the room want more than anything  is that people just have a safe place to sleep tonight.  And Safe Space is willing to provide that.  They're willing to provide that not on a Sydney-owned parcel.  I think that the best thing that could happen right now  is that everybody go home, take a deep breath,  maybe talk to a priest or something.  And I'd like to make a motion that we just adjourn the meeting.  You mean the whole city?  No, I mean in general, the whole city.  That's not better.  I wasn't going to disagree.  No, if we were getting into the name calling, I was all in.  That's not better.  We have a motion.  Do we have a second?  All right.  Motion fails for lack of a second.  Well, I appreciate Mr. Winslow's motion  to adjourn the meeting.  That doesn't solve the problem.  People want to leave here and feel there's some type  of closure.  I don't know what that closure is.  It sounds like Safe Space has found another place to do this.  I don't know how that will fit into the current code and all  those things.  I don't think this has been remotely productive  on anybody's side.  Well, we haven't gotten any type of closure.  But I do know the city manager.  I know the staff.  I know that they can help when approached reasonably.  I know my own ego.  And when I'm approached the way I've been approached,  I don't want to.  But having said that, I report to the citizens.  I'll do what I can.  If, as you said, Safe Space has a meeting on Tuesday, which is,  you know, a city management, then let's move forward  and make this happen just like we do  with all other code violations.  But let's also understand one side doesn't have the moral high  road just because of the work that they do.  Everybody has to be treated the same.  Mr. Sorensen, are you comfortable with that?  Yeah.  All right.  Now we'll adjourn the meeting.  Further comment?  I'll second the motion.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, are we going into closed session for the closed session item?  Is that what you're?  Okay.  Adjourned to closed session.  Adjourned to closed session.  Oh.  Okay.  Well, we do have a closed session on the agenda, so we should.  I thought we were going to adjourn the whole meeting  and not discuss it, but I'll accept that.  Okay.  All right.  We have a motion to adjourn into closed session.  Agreementment from the city manager.  Madam Clerk, take your role.  You.  Okay. I am sorry.  So there is a motion to do that?  You don't need a motion.  You can just.  Adjourned to closed session.  Okay. So we'll adjourn to closed session.  Okay.  Well, stop this discussion.  And then we will come back out  and then make the announcement from closed session.  Yes, correct.  Okay. So if they'd like to remain.  Yeah. If you want to remain  for the closed session announcement,  you're welcome to do so.  All right.  All right.  We will reconvene and report out from closed session  from the city clerk.  Thank you, Mayor.  Council met with city, the city manager,  city attorney and city clerk in closed session  with council members Tandon and Van Overbeek absent.  Council was briefed and a motion was made  by Council Member Morgan and seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds  and it carried 5-0.  And it is as follows.  One, safe spaces to immediately cease operations  at city facilities.  Two, appoint two council members to attend Tuesday's meeting  with staff and safe space representatives  to help facilitate a trusted partnership.  Three, barring that from happening,  the city attorney's office is directed to pursue the  initiation of litigation and that carried 5-0.  All right.  So we need the two council members.  Any volunteers?  Yes.  I would like to motion myself  and Council Member Wiesel.  All right.  I second that.  Is that all right?  Council Member Birnbaum.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.  Council Member Birnbaum.  Aye.
