I will now open the public  readiness program. Hearing none  let'  s see. Hearing none I now open  the public hearing on the  residential readiness program.  And kelly I believe it'  s your turn.  good evening members of the  commission my name is kelly  murphy and I will be presenting  this agenda item tonight.  A series of amendments to  title 19 of the chico municipal  code are recommended to ensure  consistency with state housing  law, implement pro housing  policies and address actions  from the 2022 housing element.  The proposed amendments also  resolve minor inconsistencies  formalize interpretations by the  community development director  and clarify terms and definitions.  The amendments represent the  The second phase of a planned  multi-phase code amendment program  referred to as the residential  readiness program as the majority  of amendments are intended to  streamline existing permit  processes, reduce barriers for  residential development and  facilitate housing production.  These amendments are also intended  to provide more flexibility in  zoning regulations particularly for  key commercial and mixed use areas.  The first phase of the residential  proposed by the council in June  of 2024 implemented a total of  10 housing element actions  included in this second phase of  code amendments is an additional  housing element action, action  812 as it relates to low barrier  navigation centers as defined by  assembly bill 101.  Low barrier navigation centers  provide temporary shelter and  supportive services for individuals  Assembly bill 101 mandates that  low barrier navigation centers be  allowed by right in areas zoned  for mixed use as well as  non-residential zones permitting  multi-family residential uses.  Amendments to the land use  tables and chapters 1942, 1944  and 1946 are proposed to create  a new land use category for low  barrier navigation centers.  The application procedures and  requirements are established as  a new section 1970.  The proposed new law includes  for consistency with state law  and implement housing element  action 812.  In addition several new laws  affecting accessory dwelling units  took effect the past year further  reducing regulatory barriers and  encouraging small scale infill  housing including senate bill or  sb 1211 which increases the  maximum number of ADUs allowed on  multi-family properties from two  to eight depending on unit  configuration.  Amendments to the city'  s ADU ordinance are necessary  to be consistent with sb 1211.  AB 1033 allows cities to permit  ADUs to be sold separately from  the primary residents provided  they are part of a community  land trust or similar affordable  housing model.  This expands local jurisdictions  authority but does not require  changes to be made.  The new law is also in place to  AB 976 permanently eliminates  owner occupancy requirements for  ADUs removing a restriction that  previously limited rental  flexibility.  As a note junior or JADUs are  separately defined under California  law and still subject to an owner  occupancy requirement.  Owner occupancy requirements for  ADUs have been previously  eliminated citywide so no code amendments are required or proposed.  The new law requires local  jurisdictions to establish pre  approved ADU programs offering a  set of pre-reviewed building plans  to streamline permitting and reduce  development costs.  The city of chico is proud to have  launched its pre-approved ADU  program in 2020.  These plans are pre-approved by the  building division and streamline the  permit process reducing costs for  homeowners.  The city of chico is also actively  pursuing a pro-housing designation from  the California department of housing  and community development or HCD  to demonstrate its commitment to  removing barriers to housing production  and implementing policies that promote  affordability and development efficiency.  This designation is awarded to  jurisdictions that adopt pro-housing  policies and enhances the city's  competitiveness for state housing and  infrastructure funding.  As part of this effort proposed  amendments to chapter 1962 density  bonus law.  The new law requires the city to  strengthen the pro-housing stance  by expanding local incentives for  affordable housing projects.  These changes align with the government  code as amended by AB 2345 ensuring  chico maximizes density bonuses,  concessions and parking reductions for  qualifying developments.  By streamlining affordability  incentives and reinforcing pro-housing  policies these amendments support the  city's application and broader housing  production goals.  Since the distribution of the staff  report staff identified a few  additional amendments needed for  consistency with the proposed changes.  As it relates to rooming and boarding  houses consistent with the staff report  narrative staff is proposing to delete  the land use definition from chapter  1904 and remove the land use category  from both the residential land use  table in chapter 1942 as well as the  commercial land use table in chapter  1944.  The new law requires the city to  Staff also recommends removing the  references to rooming and boarding  houses from other definitions in  section 1904 and 020.  Similarly car wash facilities as it  relates to car washes for consistency  with the proposed change removing car  washes from the definition of repair  and maintenance vehicle staff recommends  deleting the reference to these uses  under the definition of drive-in and  drive-through services.  These amendments do not propose any  construction demolition or other  activity that has the potential to  impact the environment and therefore  are exempt from further environmental  review pursuant to CEQA section 15061  and any future development projects  would be reviewed on an individual  basis for compliance with CEQA.  This is going to conclude the staff  presentation and bring us to our  recommendation the community  development director recommends the  planning commission hold the  public hearing regarding the proposed  amendments and adopt resolution 2503  recommending city council adoption of  an ordinance to amend title 19 as set  forth in attachment a exhibit 1.  I can take any questions.  Thank you very much.  I have a question or two.  Is there going to be any cost  increase or cost savings from this  stuff?  Certainly.  Particularly for the home  building.  I will take that question.  I will take that question.  Just across the board the  changes we are making to reduce  the level of review taking use  permits and turning them into  principally permitted uses will  result in an instant cost savings  for the applicant.  Any idea how much is the  percentage of the permitting fees?  A use permit runs around  $10,000 to $11,000 right now.  required to principally permitted use.  thank you.  Of course.  The boarding and rooming houses  is that just going away?  Yes.  You can't build one in this  town anymore is that correct?  We have not permitted that as a  land use whether or not they exist  in reality that hasn't been  something we have regulated for  quite some time.  I think it is necessary to  retain in our code.  I have my last question.  I see where you are proposing  drive throughs to go from 12 feet  wide to 10 feet wide.  Is that all drive through type  things?  That would be for all drive  through uses just meeting a  minimum width of 10.  10 feet seems narrow because  larger vehicles and even small  I think this is something that  came up in a plan check review  for a drive through use and was  discussed with our engineering  folks and was agreed upon that it  could be reduced to 10 from 12.  can we revisit that?  I could defer to nat if he  wants to chime in on the drive  way width.  it is adequate enough for a  vehicle to make a turning radius  I think that is the minimum  10 to 12 isn'  t significant enough of a  change.  we wouldn'  t go below 10 but 10 is  acceptable.  I drive through drive  throughs frequently and in my  vehicle 10 feet wouldn'  t get it.  I would have to back up.  raising canes we reduced it to  10?  we have seen 10 as the minimum  width on many for the straight  part.  our code says 12 foot minimum  for all parts of the drive  through and what we see on these  modern drive throughs now they  want 10 feet on the straight  parts 12 or even wider around  the corners where people have to  negotiate those corners.  the corners are going to remain  at 12?  this standard is at a minimum  of 10 and we will be looking at  the corners and the corners  we will be looking at the  to be at a maximum of 10.  what would be a maximum?  they wouldn'  t build it bigger than they  need to.  they are 12 or 13 feet around  the corners and 10 feet on the  straight away and maybe 11.  we have seen it recently where  it has worked we have allowed 10  and it has been fine.  we have seen it in the  but on the straight part it'  s 10 feet.  i think you will see that  again.  do you have any more questions?  i have a question.  several.  first does it hurt anything to  keep the boarding and rooming  houses in the code?  there'  s a lot of talk  nationwide about those kinds of  facilities helping to address  affordability issues and i know  nobody has even asked for the  last 20 years or so.  does it hurt anything to keep  that option open in case it does  become something that people want  to try to do?  i think it'  s something we have  recommended just to streamline and  clean up our code in a way that  makes sense for us.  practicing planners but we'  re here to serve the will of the  commission if that'  s something you'  d like to retain in the code it  doesn'  t hurt.  the other question i have is  about duplexes.  the rules for duplexes are  different depending on whether it'  s just an ordinary lot or whether  the lot was created by an sb9  different things.  there'  s all kinds of variations  that are called different things.  as a potential person trying to  apply for a permit it'  s really  confusing.  is there a way to add a little  paragraph somewhere just explaining  the differences and where to look  to find the different rules for the  land use table?  you will see two very similar  land use categories we'  ve got  our two unit housing developments  that are sb9 projects and then our  two family housing slash duplexes  those are separate and you'  ll see a reference to the code  section and a footnote where we'  re talking about sb9 projects and  so there is a section you can refer  to for more information there but it  does take a little bit of reviewing  those land use tables.  you sort of just have to think of it.  yes.  and then duplexes or two family  housing just refers to any time we  see two primary units on a property  or a duplex and those would be  obviously subject to our general  development standards the underlying  density requirements of the zoning  district and our landscaping and  parking standards and other chapters  of our code.  any further questions?  i'  ve got a question from the  ask a couple questions unless  somebody else has some.  first I think this is great doing  all the cleanups and getting rid of  stuff we don'  t need and making things  better but it'  s here we have another example of  some of the challenges we have when  we combine things that are kind of  disjointed into one action and so I  think we might find that some of us  here support part of it but don'  as much as possible in the future  too as much as we can segregate  things so we could have separate  actions on some of the more meaty  aspects of things here. I would  appreciate it but I think we can  get through this anyway. The big  one here I think and maybe it'  s kind of a non-issue because of  the way the state works is the  low barrier navigation centers and  I think in the past they were  referred to as wet shelters.  re the really tough ones. The  state has mandated that every  county and city have this in the  code as a principally permitted use  in certain zoning districts. I  think just as a matter of principle  I bristle at that. We'  re a charter city and  shouldn'  t be subject to the  whims of the sacramento on this kind of stuff. I think land use regulation is not  something we should be  taking a lead on.  That said I wonder and I think I  know what the answers are. What  would happen if the city did not  incorporate the state'  s mandate into our code?  I think I might tap  marina to answer the second half  of this but I'  ll point out  it is reflected as a housing element action and therefore I  think we would have some  complaints about that.  complaint about the compliance issues if we chose not to implement that action.  Would our housing element not get certified again and take away our birthday and that kind of thing?  It could definitely be decertified and there could be notices of violation. It could even go up to litigation but I don'  t think we'  re not that  controversial.  So what would be the consequences? Are there fines involved or anything like that?  I'  m not aware. I would defer to marina if she knows.  Or mike.  This is marina. I'  m not aware of any actual fines or penalties that could occur should we not include specifically the low bearing navigation center included in the code but I could follow up with the commission just to clarify that issue.  I think I'  m just it'  s more of an editorial comment than anything else unfortunately and I apologize but I  think we' !  I  re talking about  having zero input on what has traditionally been a fairly controversial type land use and virtually every commercial zoning district in town including our downtown zoning districts and that'  s just a concern to me. I  don'  t like cutting the public out of the process and I would add one more thought that this may affect our pro housing  designation application which requires that we have a certified and compliant housing element.  I understand it'  s all kind of connected again I'  m just bristling at the mandate from sacramento. Just a couple minor clarifications or comments. I think that the just clarify that the changes to section 1908-04-0B that had to be  with the restoration and reconstruction of non conforming structures that that applied to all residential uses and not just single family. Just to clarify I think that'  s different in the staff report and in the ordinance and the ordinance it'  s just for all residential including multi-family I think that'  s the way to go.  s the intent.  thank you.  other crazy little things. The landscape and the  s  landscape standards in the  iomu district going from 15%  down to 10% with board or  commission action to go below  the 15%.  I would try to clarify it  further and streamline it  further and take it down to 10%  unless we have some criteria or  standards to look at why have  I would try to recap that  discussion.  I would be supportive of going  10% and not going down to 15% or  down to 10% with more review  let'  s just cut to the chase on  things would be a suggestion.  I'  m getting beyond just the  question part.  The one last thing, crazy stuff.  The municipal code section 1960  The section that'  s being removed  has to do with solar panels on  roofs, correct?  correct.  as it reads right now, the  solar panels are supposed to  conform to the slope of the roof  and this would just allow them  however they want to install  them.  that'  s my understanding.  This was feedback from our chico  builders association on the actual  build.  thank you very much.  Any other questions?  I have one more.  It'  s really minor.  Sure.  19.28.04e, there'  s a suggested change to require a  builder to certify the formation of  a maintenance district if there is a  common area that needs to be maintained.  It'  s just reads a little confusing.  I would suggest instead of saying  certify the formation of a  maintenance district,  parent the cmd, which is confusing  because at least for me, I couldn'  t figure out where the c came from.  If you change that to form a  certified maintenance district,  cmd, then it'  s clear where the c comes from.  the c is for chico.  That'  s not noted here.  It'  s for chico.  you could just add the word chico  to chico maintenance district.  chico maintenance district.  thank you.  thank you.  any other questions from the commission?  thank you, galli.  thank you very much.  with no further questions, I now open  the public hearing on the residential  readiness program.  nicole, are there any public speakers?  we don'  t have any.  great.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  and guidance we should make in  our current housing crisis.  Your duty as commissioners isn'  t  to maintain systems that failed  the community but to chart a new  course toward a stronger and  more resilient chico. Eliminating  not just reducing parking  requirements throughout the city  would be a clear signal you are  serious about residential  readiness. You may fear doing  this will lead to bad outcomes  but the status quo has already  given us bad outcomes. Just  walk out that door. The status  quo has yielded too little  housing that' s too expensive and  development patterns that strain  our municipal budget reducing  requirements downtown while a  good step won' t fix these  fundamental problems. I' m asking  you to be bold to trust when we  remove artificial constraints our  community will adapt and thrive.  The evidence from cities across the  we are not eliminating parking  requirements doesn' t lead to  parking catastrophe. It leads to  more housing and affordable  development and more vibrant  neighborhoods. Thank you for your  time and service to our community.  thank you. Hearing no  further comments I now close the  public hearing and now it' s time  for commission discussion.  I thought the comment from  man was a good one. I will just  the rooming and boarding houses  if it' s not doing any harm let'  s keep it open as an option I  would be in support of that.  I have a question about what  we can and cannot do. The speaker  suggested a really major change  is that something that can  originate from our group or is  that something that has to come  I don' t have the authority to  agendize anything but I could do.  That was my question.  I think it was council direction  a couple of years ago.  I think if we made any major  changes to parking  we would put that in public notice  and make sure everybody was on  blast that we were going to do that  tonight. Failing that having done  that I think the most appropriate  thing is to have a  I think the majority would be  to direct staff to entertain  these thoughts and bring back a  recommendation on a phase 3  residential  and then bring back something  where you chew on it the next  bite of the apple.  I love the idea. I definitely  think I' ve definitely pondered  either eliminating parking  requirements or parking maximums.  I think that would be a  I would be interested in  supportive of a phase 3  regarding that item.  I' m already on record  supporting either eliminating or  reducing parking mandates.  I would be willing to talk about  that at a future meeting.  I' ll join you on that record.  we should probably go back to  the item at hand.  for this phase of the residential  readiness. I' m in support.  a lot of these things are either  housing law requirements or for  pro housing designation.  with pro housing I know the city  of chico gets more points for  certain grants like the infrastructure  grant, transformative climate  communities, affordable housing  and sustainable communities grants.  I' m supportive of this motion  and this agenda item.  I would like to ask for two  amendments.  one is to not eliminate the  rooming and boarding houses from  the code and two the very minor  little suggestion I had is to  insert the word chico into the  item about the housing  maintenance districts.  if that'  s a motion.  I move that we approve this with  those two amendments.  second.  nicole would you be able to call  for a vote?  yes if I can have just one moment.  I' m going to ask for a vote.  commissioner kaufman.  yes.  commissioner laffins.  yes.  commissioner sharp.  yes.  commissioner wall.  yes.  commissioner wolf.  yes.  vice chair scarpa.  yes.  and the motion passes unanimously.  moving on to the regular agenda  there are no items on the regular  agenda so we'  ll move on to reports and  communications.  mike do you have any reports or  communications?  just very briefly I want to let  the commission know we do have an  item for your next meeting on  april 3 we will be bringing forward  a project to that meeting.  what is the item?  we will announce that with the  public notice.  thank you.  you won'  t tell us.  great.  this concludes our agenda.  the next regular meeting will be  that thursday april 3.  2025 this meeting is now adjourned.  wait.  sorry.  I forgot when I could insert this.  we mentioned the possibility of a  future meeting discussing reducing or  do we need to do something official  about that if we want to do it?  that item kind of concluded  without that motion having been  made.  the chair can reopen the meeting  and revisit that item if you want  to entertain a motion for that  and we can record that in the  minutes.  okay.  I like the idea.  so would I just reopen?  say we'  re just  re-opening the meeting.  just reopen the meeting for the  purposes of entertaining a motion.  okay.  I'  d like to reopen the meeting  for the purposes of entertaining  this phase 3 residential readiness  regarding parking requirements.  so I would like to move.  I'  m not sure how to state it.  but that just be an item of discussion.  refer to that in the  phase 3.  that the possibility be included in  the phase 3 of reducing or  eliminating parking mandates more  widely than has already been done.  did you want to include  boarding houses in there?  we already took care of the  boarding houses issue.  we just didn'  I thought you wanted to keep them.  right.  the motion to vote on the  we voted on that already.  as the public speaker his  idea wasn' t included in this.  would we need to motion?  I think we got the motion if  there' s a second we can  consider that.  is there a second?  second.  Okay.  Okay.  One moment please.  who is the first to  move?  who  who  who Who seconded? Commissioner by Kirkman. I will get it.   I know it'  t know what it is.  thank you.  commissioner laffins?  yes.  commissioner sharp?  yes.  commissioner wall?  yes.  commissioner wolf?  no.  vice chair scarpa?  yes.  the motion passes 5-1.  now with that, I believe this  concludes our agenda.  the next regular meeting will be  April 3rd, Thursday, April 3rd,  2025.  this meeting is now adjourned.
