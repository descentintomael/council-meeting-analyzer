Anyone wishing to address the council  on any item listed on the agenda  should first complete a speaker card  that can be found at the back of the chamber.  And once completed, turned into the city clerk,  up here to my left, to your right.  Speakers are taken in order.  The cards are received.  And once public comment begins,  no further cards will be accepted.  So if you want to speak from business from the floor,  please make sure not to address the fact,  or not to address the topic,  of the city council candidates.  You will need to do that after we have the interviews.  So this is on items other than people asking  to be city council members are coming for interviews.  With that, we will move on to our closed session announcement  from the 7-12 special closed session meeting.  Attorney Vince, you.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, the city attorney,  city manager, city clerk, and staff  met with the city council,  and closed session on July 12, 2021.  No action was taken on that item.  Direction was given.  That concludes my closed session report.  All right.  Thank you very much.  So at this time, we'll do business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the council  at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda,  with comments being limited to three minutes,  or as determined by the mayor,  based on the number of speakers.  How many speakers do we have?  We have one, Jessica Giannola.  All right.  So we'll do three minutes.  All right.  All right.  So we cannot take any action at this meeting  on request made under this section of the agenda.  And I would also like to note that we do not,  particularly as we get to the council member interviews,  we do not applaud in this chamber.  We do not hold up signs in this chamber,  unless you're at the back of the room.  And we do ask for respect for both members of the community  and staff, as well as council members.  So if you do have comments, please refrain  from any personal attacks.  And take it away, Jessica.  Thank you.  I didn't want to miss the opportunity  for business from the floor.  Let's see.  I'd like to ask the city to please still continue  to reconsider reinstating the shelter crisis status  for the city of Chico as soon as possible.  We're going to need every dollar in partnership moving forward,  and our current expired status makes us ineligible  for some funding.  It is imperative that we do all that we can  to address the housing crisis now.  We cannot afford to delay on acting unknown services  and programs that can only benefit the city.  I keep thinking what will happen when one of these fires here  moves into our local homes, or right into our city.  What would we do?  We haven't recovered from the last fire.  Before the fire, we're already lacking adequate,  affordable housing for low-income wage earners.  Now it's just impossible for more and more citizens  to obtain housing.  For those that have lost their housing completely,  they have only a few options available to them at this time.  The GC offers great resources for those that fit their model,  and I think the community, for supporting them, is going to need to do more.  They serve current participants and are on their way to fulfilling a need  to even more of a population that can benefit from them down the line,  but that's two years down the line.  They have a proposed addition that has yet to break ground,  and we have housing needs now.  Tourist services, they service another population,  and we are getting grateful for their services,  but they're still not enough.  We still need to have more housing resources in our city  for those both unhoused and need  for funding.  We need to have more housing resources in our city  for the protective measures to prevent further homelessness from occurring.  We need to plan to stand,  to have standalone shelters at fixed locations.  We can expect them to be there about 24 months,  considering the time it is to build other structures or renovate.  We need to be working to provide these shelters now  that the populations are already standing by,  waiting for genuine supportive help from our policymakers.  We will not be able to achieve a level of housing security  without the help of state and federal funding.  So we need to reach out for those resources,  and we need to be able to provide them to those who need them.  We need to be able to provide those resources available to us now.  The state has identified one time surplus of $12 billion  intended for homeless resources.  The federal government has proposed $9 billion more  in increased HUD funding with their Build Back Better housing plan,  and it will provide 2 million more affordable homes.  It's a 15% increase from last year.  As a city, we need to participate in these programs  coming down the pipeline,  and not miss another opportunity,  like we've seen with the project Home Key,  it's different than Room Key,  Home Key we missed out on.  Where the city could have purchased or renovated structures,  for permanent housing,  and instead the opportunity has slowed by.  We cannot afford to pass by another that could help us.  One way to start is by declaring that our housing crisis still exists,  and that we need all the funding and resources  that can be sent our way to help recover here.  Thank you.  Alright, thank you.  So we'll move on to the regular agenda,  the interview of council applicants.  We'll start with the report from our city clerk.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge and council.  I'm a member of the City Council,  and I'm the City Council's Board Member.  At the meeting of July 6,  the council formally declared the seats  of former Councilmember Huber  and former Councilmember Denley vacant  due to their resignations from serving on council.  The council voted 4-1,  with Councilmember Brown opposed,  to fill the vacancies using the appointment process  as outlined in our AP&P 1044.  The current positions needed to be filled  include one at-large position  and one position specifically representing  District 3.  In order to be considered for appointment,  the council must have a registered voter  in the City of Chico,  attest to being at least 21 years or older,  and if applying for the vacant seat in District 3,  they must reside in that district.  All requirements have been verified  via the standard procedure  that is used when conducting a regular election,  which is to have the Butte County Elections Department  verify voter registration  using stated addresses  that are provided to us,  and they also confirm  that District 3 applicants  do indeed reside in District 3.  The recruitment period  was open on Wednesday, July 7th,  and it closed at 5 o'clock p.m.  on Thursday, July 15th.  Twenty-two applications were received  in total, one which was not forwarded  as it was received  a little bit past the 5 o'clock deadline  and it was deemed incomplete  with pages missing.  Of the 21 applications,  14 were for the at-large position  and 7 were for District 3.  Once the new council members  had been selected  for next week's meeting,  I as your City Clerk and Elections Official  will provide a four-hour long orientation  with the two new appointees  and help them get everything  processed related to their position.  Just as a side note,  council members receive a $600 a month stipend,  a $75 phone allowance per month,  and can also buy into the City's  health insurance if desired.  Additionally, each new council member  will be required to file a Form 700,  that is the statement of  economic interest,  and that's required every year  while they remain on the council.  They will also be required  to take the trainings  and complete the AB 1234  training and sexual harassment  through the City's Target Solutions Program.  Also, our two new council members  will be assigned various committee assignments  as there's a large number  of outside agencies  and internal groups  that end up having council members  be appointed to it.  Those appointments are made by the Mayor  and confirmed by the full council,  and that item will have to come back  at a future meeting once we get  the new council members on board.  And so, Mayor Kudelich,  do you want to add anything to that?  I do.  You know, it's very important  that people understand when applying  for this position that it is not  the position alone that you're applying for.  So, I serve on, I think,  ten committees, nine or ten?  I think I serve on six, I think?  Something in that neighborhood.  The rest of us serve on four or five, depending.  We also have special,  as you guys have noticed with the ad hoc,  things along those lines.  Those committees can be  entirely encompassing  in their own right as well.  So, for example, when I was on the council  previously, I chaired also air quality.  So we had employee negotiations,  we had meetings,  it was pretty extensive.  It was like doing a second city council position.  And you don't necessarily get a choice.  You get appointed to various committees  and you'll have to serve on those and they do take time  out of your schedule.  So, I want everybody to just be aware of that.  The other thing is  we are a policy driven  body as well as a budget.  We do not conduct the work of the city.  We do not have fancy offices.  Obviously, we don't have a ton of pay.  We do get an iPad  and some sodas.  And that's about the extent of it.  So, we share the  seven of us share one office  in the third floor.  I always find it entertaining when someone  says they want to come by and visit me at my office  at City Hall and I tell them my office is at home  right next to my kitchen.  But,  in terms of there's not a lot of perks,  certainly you'll receive your fair  share of nasty emails as we all have.  I always think we should have one of those  sessions where we read the emails we've received  just like they do on late night TV.  It would be pretty funny.  But some of them are actually pretty funny.  And some of them are pretty harsh sometimes.  And that's what we're hoping to move away from.  But, just so you're forewarned,  there is a heavy lift here.  And I know everybody here  is interested, who's applying,  is interested in representing their community.  So, I appreciate you doing that.  But the frills are not many.  So, keep that in mind as you're here tonight.  So, we also need  Madam Clerk, we need to  discuss the length of time which we're going to give each individual.  If you would like to do that right now.  The Council can decide how long  you want to allow the speakers to go.  It's entirely up to the Council.  So, do we have any thoughts on that?  I was thinking we do, you know,  three or four minutes or up to five,  whatever Council desires. And then a period of  questions and answers as we see fit on each candidate.  I have a thought.  I'm sure.  I'm sure we've  read all the applications and resumes  written by the applicants and those that  were written by people other than the applicants.  I think three minutes is  probably long enough for them to let us  know who they are and we can ask as many questions  as we want. But five minutes,  well, it seems like five minutes  is a long time. Even for most of the  speakers to get up there and do that whole thing.  And the disadvantage also to five minutes  because I can already see people shaking their heads  is that three or four people that go  last, as you will learn when you sit up here,  we won't be listening.  Better get it said,  get it said quickly and get done.  So, I would argue for three minutes.  Well, I like three minutes  because I was never in a public  forum where I had more than two  to make either a closing statement or opening statement  or a combination thereof.  Any other thoughts?  Alright, so we'll go with three and then questions  maybe up to ten minutes as the Council  desires on each individual candidate.  Some thoughts to that at the time.  Okay, we will go with  the standard three minutes and then  Council will ask any questions.  We will be starting with  the at-large applicants, the fourteen  individuals who graciously  applied and are willing to help our  community. We will be  calling them in alphabetical order.  They didn't have to fill out a  card or anything because  it was mandatory that they actually be here  to speak to the Council. So,  we will begin and  Deputy Rogers  will actually start calling.  Alright, and I wouldn't say  too from my opinion in terms of these interviews  is, I know a lot of you  probably have prepared speeches.  I'd be more appreciative of off-the-cuff  comments. You know, we got your prepared  items in terms of, you know, the  applications that we read through.  And that was a lot of pages, so  we're familiar with you in terms of  that. But certainly  if you want to read, you're more than welcome to.  But I think getting to know exactly who you are  on a little more familiar basis is beneficial  at least to me. So,  we'll go ahead and start. Okay.  Alright. Okay, up first  is Beth Burton followed by  Jordan Colby.  Good evening,  Council. Thank you for  this opportunity. I want to say thank you all  for stepping up and applying.  I teach government politics at the high school level,  so this is like, oh my gosh, you're getting  involved in stuff.  And when I saw this opportunity come up, I said,  shoot, at least throw my hat in the ring.  I have no, no,  no plans ever  to go into politics. So,  you know, a few month gig or I guess  a year and a half gig, it's like, alright, I want to step up and help out  my community. I have no planned  statements for you all.  I want Chico to be the friendliest  city in town. My first week here, I went to  Burton Hand, I got a button that said Chico,  California, California's friendliest town.  I said, that's where I want to live. And that's like  22 years ago. So if you got  questions, fire away.  So I've got a question. Yeah.  So beyond the 16  month period, do you have any thoughts  to the future in terms of possibly  running again? No, absolutely not.  I love teaching, I love coaching,  I travel probably  30 months of the year to Scottish festivals over the world,  so I got plenty of time doing that.  So the question for you,  your council  other business,  what time does that take place?  When you're in committees and such.  Committees can range from  any time, actually. So some of them can be  in the morning, some of them we've had some  in the afternoon extensively, so  they do bounce around quite a bit.  But I believe it's federal  law, they have to let you out of employment  for community service.  Not a fan of missing class, but  just throwing it out there.  Yeah, we do occasionally work around  schedules too, and we have done that in the  past. I mean, certainly we all have  jobs, so  yeah, we try to do that best we can.  Other  questions?  So while traveling to 30 festivals,  pretty certain you can be here the first Tuesday  at least of each month. That's my other  thing. I have either staff meetings or  instructional council meetings Tuesday  afternoon, so I don't know if I can make  that commitment.  Thank you. You're welcome.  Any other ones?  Alright.  Okay, well thank you so much.  Hey, good luck to y'all.  Thank you.  Jordan Colby  followed by Jessica Giannola.  Hi.  Thanks, council and mayor.  My name is Jordan Colby, and  yeah, you've seen my  application. I  am into  coaching kids running  and teaching  Sunday school class at our church,  and I  wanted to answer a call  to serve, so  if there's  a lot of really great  applicants here, I was really  heartened to read through all the other  applications and see  that we have a great community, and  people want to step up and serve.  So I'm really happy about that.  Questions?  I'd ask you the very same  question, so, and just be prepared  everybody. I'm going to ask the same question to everybody.  So,  in terms of filling the seat, are you looking at  just filling the seat for the time period,  or possibly running beyond that?  I do not have political  aspirations, so I would  be happy to take a temporary  assignment and not run in my  district after that.  Alright. I have a question.  Just out of curiosity, what  district do you currently live in? Six.  Kind of a long question,  so I'm going to read it. Sure.  So I see and appreciate your focus on  fortifying our city against fire spreading  into the WUI, the wildland  urban interface. Are you  familiar with the projects, the development projects  at the edge of town, Stone Gate and  Valley's Edge to be specific?  Not in depth, but I've heard about it.  How do you think we should  respond to those areas of expansion  for Chico being vulnerable to  wildfires?  Well, certainly we have to make  we have to allow  development, but  the development needs to be driven  by wildland  urban interface  compliant code, so  making homes fire safe when they are  in fire prone areas,  which fire prone areas seem  to be a lot wider  than what we  originally thought.  Thank you.  Alright, any other questions?  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Jessica Giannola  followed by Jeffrey Glatz.  Hi Council, thank you for this opportunity.  I started coming  to Council meetings regularly  quite a few years ago now,  and it started as a class assignment  at Chico State, my degrees in  public health education, and  I went back to school, I switched my  degree to public health education from nutrition  because I've seen a need in our  community for an understanding of what  I was seeing happening around us. I was  seeing more and more people who are homeless on the street  and I really honestly want to know why,  and not only why, but how can I  help that, how can I help be a part  of that process. So that's why I started  coming to these meetings. I don't agree  with the idea of having a single time  that we have one for the past year.  I'm very involved in the community.  I was able to get involved with our homeless  resources and really get to know the  population, the people, and it's a  passion for me. I suffered from  youth poverty and I was homeless  as a youth as well, so I have  an idea of what that's like.  So when I see other people,  I come from a different point.  And I come from now, I've been a business owner.  I own my home  here in Chico. I've gone to school in Chico.  I've got my education. So I have this  well-rounded  respect and experience  from different aspects of our  community. And communication  and problem solving is really  important to me. It is not  important to me to be right. There are many  times I say and do something wrong and  I am not afraid to say I'm sorry.  I call that camming and I feel bad.  I apologize  for making a mistake because I want  to do better because I want to serve as an example  for our community. What changed for me  with trying to work harder  with all aspects of our community?  COVID hit.  COVID hit and we didn't have access to  masks anywhere. And I jumped  in as part of a bipartisan group  of people making masks to make sure  that our community, our service workers,  our hospital, anybody and everybody,  it didn't matter if you were a Republican  or Democrat, I was making sure that everyone was safe  because everyone is  our neighbors. And it's taking that initiative,  finding a problem, solving it, and  making sure everyone is included. So here  is my husband.  We like to say how my husband is a Republican.  I think that helps balance me  because I bounce things off of him often.  He gives me a different perspective.  It's important for me to understand  what it is that is the concern of someone  else who thinks differently than I  because I want to meet them.  I want to meet them in the middle. I want to see how  solving their concern is  also solving a concern that I have that they  haven't yet seen. It's important that  we can come together and I try really hard  to find those avenues. So,  my time is almost up. Questions?  The same.  Political aspirations?  Well, I mean, just beyond the  seat. I'm just trying to determine if  people are interested in just  serving for the time period which  remains or if they have  an interest in running after them.  Honestly, I'm in District 7.  So I'm in Devica's,  am I saying your name right?  District. And there are a lot of  people in my district. And I've  always wanted to be in a position of  education and appreciate  the platforms that I have. That's why I write  letters to the editor. I'm on the news all the time.  I'm up here because I want that platform  to help educate. So I would not  be opposed to running in the future.  It had not been in my plans.  And honestly, I don't know if I'd have the  support because we  have a lot of different diversities out there.  I just don't see it happening.  But I wouldn't say no. And it hasn't  been an aspiration. But I do think  that someone who is taking this position should be  serious about it. We have a lot of  tough subjects that we're facing.  And it shouldn't just be as an experience.  But someone who has a will and drive to actually make a difference.  Alright.  Any other questions?  My other question is time constraints.  Do you feel that, I don't know where  you work and you don't need to tell me where you work.  But are you flexible on times and is  every other Tuesday or first and third  Tuesdays a problem? Well, I'm here all the time.  I don't miss a meeting.  Even Zoom's, I'm here.  So meetings are not a problem. I think if there's  board meetings and what not,  just letting me know what the times are  and working with my employer, I don't foresee  that being a barrier.  Yeah.  Alright.  Any others?  Thank you, Jessica.  That's it? Okay. Thank you.  Jeffrey Glatz  followed by Bryce Goldstein.  Mr. Mayor,  Vice Mayor, thank you guys,  Council, for having me here.  I didn't really prepare a statement. And Jeff, if we could  have you come over in front of the podium because the mic's out.  I'm sorry. Inside the podium.  That's okay. They always say, whenever I'm here,  nobody can hear what I say, which could be a good thing.  So first of all,  I'm just happy to see some quality  candidates out here. I'm very happy  Mike and my people who have been  in our community before stepping up to continue  to serve the community. I think that's great.  I think that gives us all a step forward  in this process of keeping  government moving very quickly and not  to have any kind of lag time.  I don't want to go off topic, but  one of the things I want to discuss  that kind of affected me  five years ago was I went  to the Housing First  seminar given by  Lloyd Pendleton back at the  Presbyterian Church. And  everybody who was on the City Council then,  the group of people, were slapping  each other on the back, shaking hands. This is  the solution for Chico Housing First.  I don't know.  I think this goes to what the judge  said about education. The community  needs to be educated a little bit more  about some of these policies.  That are going on around town.  Housing First's goal in Utah  was to solve chronic homelessness.  Chronic homelessness in Utah at the time  was 3.9%  of the homeless population. That  was their goal. Their goal was never  to basically house everyone.  And when I hear a lot of the  people come up and talk to you guys,  it's always about housing is the only  solution. While  the judge has dictated decisions we have to do  and direction we have to  take from the resting place or whatever,  I believe we need to determine  as a city and a community,  and each individual who's listening at home,  what is your definition of homelessness?  Who are the people that  the city should be trying to help?  Because a city can only  do so much.  With respect to  Lloyd Pendleton and all the respect to him,  one of the things I went and asked him afterwards  is the city of Salt Lake City at the time  had 189,000  people. We had about 90.  Their general fund budget was  $229 million.  Ours is 50.  Okay. In 2000, right now,  Salt Lake City has a population  of 189 or 190,000  people and a general  fund budget of $350 million.  The community needs to understand  what is actually possible  on a city level.  We had reached out to the county.  The county did not supply any  kind of a camping area or  an area for people to go.  I reached out to my connection in the governor's office  and connected one of the cabinet director's  secretaries directly with Mark Orem  to talk about the fairgrounds. The state said no.  So the community needs to understand the city  has only so much  bandwidth and ability to  affect change. So as a community, we have  to decide who is getting changed, who's not.  Do we protect the criminals? Do we protect  the vagrants? Or do we protect those who truly need?  Looks like I've got three seconds.  That's my little statement.  So any questions, guys?  All right.  Mine's the same as everyone else's.  So no, I actually believe  the next year and a half is a very  important time in our history here in Chico.  And I think it's important  that everybody step up.  So, and then,  thoughts on after that?  No, I mean, I enjoy my time  on the park commission right now. I've been fighting there  for five years.  Mr. Glossman,  do you mind me asking which district you live in?  I'm in Topeka's district.  It seems like you have a lot of  input and insight on the issue of homelessness.  In your application, you'd said  that we need to work with local shelters  even if it means requiring them to create  day shelters. How would you  propose doing this, and how do you  believe it would help the situation?  So, one of the biggest  issues, when you go to many other  communities, the homeless  problem exists in many places.  But a day shelter, basically,  having someone just come spend the night  and then kick them out during the days and they come  downtown or they go into people's neighborhoods,  or whatever they do, it's not actually  doing a service to them. You're not helping  them, whether it's the rehab,  looking for jobs, looking for work, trying to get their  life back on track.  And I'm not familiar exactly how Torrey's  runs, I'm not familiar how JC runs,  but I do believe that  there has to be a  communication and a plan  between city and whatever shelters  are here, as to how can we help  these people who are coming to the shelters for  assistance.  And a day shelter, or making them  basically dictating that  to have a shelter in Chico,  you need to be 24 hours a day  service shelter to those people.  And that's not true of everybody in town,  as I understand it.  So, from a policy standpoint, you would support a policy  that required all shelters that are operating  in Chico to have day centers?  Yes.  I have one more question.  I found a lot of your description of  structured growth agreeable.  As you may know, most of the  horizontal build out of the city  is set to go exclusively to  single family homes.  Do you believe that is smart growth?  Yeah, I mean it's,  it was a question you had about the valley's  edge and things like that.  The closest  thing I can say, if you have a circle,  and this is our limited growth area for this circle,  and people move to the community, whether they  retire here or they come here because they want to,  and they continually increase the prices in this  circle, then that's going to create  this affordability issue that people are concerned about.  So regrettably, you might have to expand  the circle to allow growth  in certain areas so that your community  can still be affordable, if that makes sense  what I'm trying to say.  So as far as your fire things, there's  things in place now  that any future community should  be looked at from a fire perspective,  but also from what are we doing,  who are we trying to attract,  how are we increasing our quality of life,  are we doing active living communities,  are we doing, you know, just  total senior, are we doing affordable?  The affordable is an important  element for any community,  but you also have to grow your economic base.  When I was talking, the reason I mentioned  the volume, I mean the dollars  that Salt Lake City has,  because they have a lot of sales tax revenue  come in and the property values are higher, etc., etc., etc.  We need to try to get  to a place where everybody here  behind me who comes up before  you and says, I really wish we could  build a shelter for 40  older people who are living on the streets.  Well, it's $5 million,  the city doesn't have it. Well, what if the city has it?  Well, we'll realize that someday.  Then everybody is kind of, it's not happy,  but it grows us, it gets us to where we want to be.  In the past six or seven years  of basically stagnant growth  or negative growth,  it's not even helping  where we are now, I mean,  because you want to do certain things.  If the city had more revenue to do things,  you would be able to probably chew more of your policies  than you want to do. But if you're restricted,  you just can't, no matter how much you want to help,  you can't help. So you have to ask  the county, you've got to ask the state, you've got to ask the federal.  And if they're not willing to,  I'm going on too long, if they're not willing to help,  not that they don't even want to, but if they don't give  the money to the city,  then we are where we are.  So you believe expanding that circle  with single family homes will contribute  to that economic base? Yes.  Thank you.  Sorry, long answer to that.  Alright, any more questions?  Okay, thank you.  Bryce Goldstein, followed by  Lori LaRiviere.  And if you could just hold on one  second for us.  Sorry about that.  Am I good to talk now? Yeah, go ahead.  Great, thanks. I applied  because our community needs representatives  who are well informed, have a vision  for our city, and are willing to take  action. My name is Bryce Goldstein,  and you might know me as one of the City of Chico  planning commissioners.  I'm also a transportation planner for the  state of California. I had previously  worked for a local consulting firm,  and before that, I actually  worked for the City of Chico through AmeriCorps  for a year after graduating from  Humboldt State University with a  Bachelor's of Environmental Science.  With my experience working in local  and state government, I understand  what we need to do  to make Chico a thriving, healthy,  safe, and beautiful community,  that everybody can afford to live in.  As a city council member,  I'll work towards solving  homelessness by tackling its root  causes, including our statewide  affordable housing crisis.  We'll develop a safer and more  efficient city for all modes of transportation,  including walking, biking,  public transit, and of course cars.  And I'll also work hard to  ensure that we are a community  resilient to climate change.  So,  I know all the folks  in my demographic can agree that the rent  is way too damn high, and the city  council needs to be keeping our workforce  and our families here in their homes.  Instead, as long as I've been attending  city council for the past  several years, it feels like our interest  here is in increasing property  values and rents. Families just  cannot afford to buy houses or rent  here anymore. I have a friend who's a young  single pregnant mother  who's been between motel rooms  and sleeping in a tent in the parks  because she can't afford a room, and she  is not the only one. So, that's  really why I'm here tonight, is because I'm  passionate about making sure that  people can continue to enjoy  our awesome community.  So,  I hear a lot about making Chico a  safe place for families, and I think we should  really start by making sure that families  can afford to have a roof over their head.  I will  use my skills as a planner  understanding policy  and zoning to make sure that we  remove the regulations and barriers  that prevent us from building  missing middle housing, affordable housing,  basically every type of housing  and shelter that we  really desperately need to be able  to house everyone.  So,  yeah, you also  might remember me, in my last 30 seconds,  as that person who  submitted maps during the districting process  when we drew the boundaries  of the seven city council districts.  I would also push for a more democratic  process in our  elections, including  a non-partisan redistricting  commission, ranked choice voting,  a strong mayor  system where we elect the mayor,  and, let's see,  nine seconds, I think  neighborhood councils would be a really  great idea. So, any questions?  The same one as I've had for everybody else.  Yeah, I also  live in District 7, which  won't be up for election for  what, two and a half years now?  So,  it would be kind of hard to say what I would  do then as far as  the next election. But,  yeah, I'm undecided as far as my  political career, you could say.  Sure. All right, thank you.  Thanks, Bryce. You listed a lot of  tangible policy priorities in your  application and presentation. What would be  your first priority if appointed to this?  Ooh,  first.  Let's see. I've got to pick one.  It's like picking a favorite child,  I imagine.  I think that  I would want to remove  excessive parking minimums in  priority corridors  for transit, walking, and biking.  Because right now, if you  were to buy a lot along, say, Park  Avenue, where I live, you would be  priced out of being able to build  any dense housing in one of our  corridor opportunity sites just because of  how much parking you'd have to build.  I have a lot more ideas than that, though,  if you don't like that one.  Appreciate that.  Any further questions?  All right. Thank you.  Thank you.  Laurie LaRiviere  followed by Tim Lynch.  Hello again.  I was here  last, two weeks ago.  I'm going to do better to speak up  than I was going to try.  I'm a little embarrassed.  I thought it was an interview, so  I don't have anything prepared.  I just really want to be of benefit,  and I want to help.  Just want to help. So whoever does  get it, please call me  because I really do just want to help.  With that, as far as  your question,  there's so much  I want to be able to be a part of.  And I think that this is  actually really being able to do this.  Even just having the opportunity  to stand here and put my ideas out,  I believe  it is going to help facilitate  some of what  I plan  to do in the future. But as far as  continuing as a council person,  I would just want to be able  to provide advice  and assistance to whoever would  be running.  And I think that  after me because  I just want to be of help.  And I think that for me right now,  this is what I can do.  And it's interesting.  I had planned to increase  my work hours,  and then there was a situation  where I might have had to step in,  so I backed off.  And then I was going to increase them again,  and I came to the council city meeting.  And serendipitously,  I'm prepared  to fully commit  and can be on  four, five, six  meetings. And I do  understand that it's going to be  a busy year and a half.  But  that's it.  The year and a half will probably be done.  It will be done.  So, any other questions?  Just my  same question. Do you know which district that you live in?  I just moved,  and so I keep forgetting.  But I am in District 1.  So, we've  had the benefits of  finding something.  So, yes.  Living in a house  now. No longer in  a tiny little two-bedroom apartment.  Any other questions?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Tim Lynch,  followed by Thomas Nickel.  Mayor Coolidge,  Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of council,  esteemed city staff.  Those of you who know me know that I give a considerable  emphasis to the pursuit of common ground  and reasonable discourse,  as well as attempting to understand  those with whom I may not agree.  In the spirit of this,  I have decided to give you an example  of my dedication to discovery  and willingness to seek out creative solutions.  In 2019,  I heard a radio interview of a small town  mayor in Washington State,  whose town of Marysville had recently implemented  a special law enforcement unit to social worker  embedded in it to address  the city's homeless issue.  When simply put, the program  sounded harsh. Get help or go to  jail. But, unsurprisingly,  when faced with that choice,  more people than not  chose to get help. And most importantly,  they had help to get.  As part of this program,  the social worker police officer duo  would contact homeless individuals  and offer them help getting into a 72 hour  detox center, partially funded by the county.  After completing the detox, they would enter  a 30 or 60 day rehab center,  depending on their needs.  Upon graduation, individuals would be placed in  transitional housing with  everything from job help to career counseling  to trauma counseling and more.  Those who refused could be arrested  for violating various  state or local laws.  I had the privilege to speak with the mayor of Marysville,  Washington, John Nehring, about his program.  In May of 2019, I reached out to him  by email and he was more than happy  to schedule a half hour phone call with me.  I learned considerably more than I have time  that I divulge in these remarks, but I have emailed  each of you copies of my notes from that interview.  Suffice it to say, the program was proving  to be successful in getting people back on their feet,  reducing crime, homelessness,  drug-related emergencies,  and the strain on public resources such as police,  fire, and EMS by reducing  calls for service and repeat offenders.  Beyond this, the program  had won the support of the community,  in part because it was successful,  but in large part because it involved accountability.  It involved the understanding of  two inseparable truths.  First is that people need help,  and sometimes they need help getting it.  Second is that letting people  choose not to get help was not helping them,  and it was no longer an option.  I believe programs like this have the potential  to  I apologize, I lost my place.  I believe programs like this  have the potential to inform decisions  that we make here in our own community.  I engage in this research and outreach  as a private citizen with no affiliations  or credentials because I believe  in the power of knowledge.  I'm certain each of you has done research of your own  on programs that you find appealing.  What I bring to the table is the same desire  that you have to find solutions and a proven  willingness to put in the legwork.  As a logistician by profession, my job is to move things  from one place to another.  As a manager of a team of six, it is my responsibility  to make sure each of them knows  that they're part of the mission.  I'm a part of the logistics industry  and a big contributing factor to my personal success.  I believe now more than ever that strong, bold,  and reasonable voices need to be heard  and those willing to use them need to step up to the plate.  If I am not selected, I can probably say  that when the call came, I answered.  Thank you for your time,  your service, and I'm available to answer  any questions you may have.  All right, my apologies, I was writing notes  instead of looking at your clock.  You went over a little bit there.  No, sorry.  So same question as everybody else.  Are you looking for just to fill the short term  or are you thinking something longer term beyond that?  At this time, Mr. Mayor,  I am answering the calls for help for my community  and I'm not particularly,  I've thought about it in the past.  I'm not particularly interested  in having a political career.  If I can be of service to the city  for this next 17 months,  then here I am.  But I have no particular aspirations beyond that, sir.  All right, thank you.  May I ask which district you're from?  Which district you live in?  I live in New York's, District 4.  Thank you.  A couple questions, or actually just one.  You mentioned in your application that roads  are in disrepair, but it's no one's fault  due to budget constraints.  You also mentioned building new roads  is part of the solution.  If we're not able to fund our roads as they are,  do you believe we should be building new roads  the same way that we always have been?  I believe I may not have been  as clear as I could have been in my application.  What I'm referring to is the need  to have a budget-minded approach  to our infrastructure.  You said it perfectly.  We don't have the funds to maintain  the roads we have currently,  and we have a need to build more roads  than we have as we grow and as our city grows.  So with that in mind,  what we need to do is  find ways of both funding  the continued maintenance of existing roads  while finding ways to  promote funding for growth  in a responsible way.  Like the grant you mentioned  for the Bruce Road expansion?  That's right.  How do you propose paying for the maintenance  for the Bruce Road expansion  once it's built with the grant funds?  Frankly,  grants could be a way to  accomplish that as well.  Finding ways to rearrange  funds or to cut unnecessary programs  if the city has any of those  through an audit of  the city's expenditures.  There isn't a government agency  in the country that doesn't have room  to shift things around.  Thank you.  Alright, any other questions?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tom Nichol  followed by Michael O'Brien.  Hello everyone.  Good to see you and thank you.  My name's Tom Nichol.  I've been a resident since 1965.  I was on the  Chico City Council from  2006 to 2010.  I was vice mayor from  2008 to 2010.  I was elected to  the Chico Area Recreation  District in 2018  and I'm serving as  a director and  my term goes up in  10-22.  I talked to our  attorney, the general manager  and some directors on our  board. I talked to them about what  my interest was and they said go for it.  I also talked to Mark  and I talked to the city manager  and all I had to do was confirm  that there's no programs or projects  coming up that are going to involve  CARD or the city so I'd have to recuse myself.  I wanted to make sure.  I am not going to make this career.  I'm only going to do it for the short term  because I'll be  66 and a half  and I don't want to go until I'm 70.  So,  I was on the  Bidwell Park and Playground Commission.  I was appointed there  and I worked with  Mr. Gatz and  four other people and we did wonderful things.  I saw the need to  make the park safe for people  because I was getting a lot of complaints  because I live across the street from the park  and people know who I am.  And so, we  decided and I decided to push  to arm the guards.  I mean the rangers.  And it was a big battle.  But we did it. And people  feel safer now because the park's  cleaned up.  I have a walking group  and there are people that are  rehabbing for injuries,  people that are scared  and now they're out walking in the park  because they feel safe.  And that's our goal.  I'm a 27  year veteran of the California  Highway Patrol. I spent  the rest of my career  from 1995  until 2008 when they retired me  with a disability.  I have my private investigator's license  and I was hired by an  attorney in town to investigate  research and investigate wildland  fires throughout the United States,  Hawaii and Alaska  and even in Australia.  And I did that for four years.  I was, I believe  this, I'm going to age myself, but I fought  fire with the Department of  California  Forestry  which is Cal Fire now.  I have a lot of contacts in Cal Fire.  I have expertise  in wildland fire  causation.  And I'm really concerned about our  one mile and upper park.  We need to get the handcuffs  off our police officers and start  enforcing laws.  We need to enforce traffic laws because  it's not, oh shoot, sorry.  I forgot that three minutes goes away.  So, questions?  You already answered mine.  No, I'm good.  Tom, can you  remind me what district you live in?  I'm in your district, Casey.  The best one, of course.  Alright, thank you very much for your time.  Okay, we won't do that.  Michael O'Brien  followed by Daniel Rodriguez.  Good evening,  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council.  My name is Michael O'Brien.  And it was my privilege to address you as your  Chief of Police.  Now it is my privilege to address you as an  at-large City Council applicant.  This certainly was not a position I sought.  I was happy playing pickleball with other  retirees when I was a senior  in the City Council.  participate in a call for service game,  first from our District Attorney,  then from others regarding our Council vacancies.  Hence my presence here tonight.  Obviously, I'm failing miserably  on retirement.  In all seriousness, our City is facing  yet another crisis.  This one, a crisis in leadership.  After losing two Council members  in a span of one week.  That's unprecedented.  Of course, this comes on the heels of other  unprecedented events, such as  the dam crisis, campfire,  and COVID-19, to name a few.  This level of crisis  will demand much from the candidates  you choose.  To include tactful leadership,  sound judgment,  and respectful discourse.  I could provide you with my full resume,  including almost three decades of service  to our community.  Five years of leading your police department  through what may have been a  most challenging period ever.  And multiple examples of community  relationship and collaboration  with the University,  Butte County Behavioral Health,  Chico Unified,  Chico Chamber,  and purposeful engagement with community groups  after national tragedies.  But I will end there.  Ultimately, you will need  someone who's experienced in decision making  during the pandemic,  and after crisis.  Who understands this community,  and the challenges we face,  and as important,  someone who can bring a sense of  comportment and respect to these  positions and issues.  If you believe I am best suited  for what is required  for this council  and our community,  I am willing to step in that gap again.  Thank you very much.  Alright,  and my usual question.  So, thoughts on  now versus the future in terms of serving.  So I have  zero plans to run  for a  office for the City of Chico  after this stint I happen to be in your  district, and I have no plans  to do that.  I think I stopped by your house when I was walking.  Yeah, you talked to my daughter as a matter of fact.  Alright, any other questions?  Yeah, I have a couple  questions.  Obviously we're in  litigation regarding our,  at least in part, some of our ordinances  and enforcement of our ordinances that have been  deemed unconstitutional.  How has the court  injunction affected your outlook on  enforcement of laws that the  court deemed to be criminalizing  of homelessness? That is a  fair question, Council Member Brown.  I will  say that this is a very challenging  ruling.  Boise v. Martin, I think the  judge in this particular case is admitting  that there's a lot of  information that is not  there as far as definitions.  But I will tell you that the City of Boise  actually settled with those plaintiffs  and one of the components  that they settled was if there was  a shelter for  whoever that person happened to be that they were dealing with  at that time, if there was a shelter for that  individual to go to, that they were able  then to enforce those  ordinances. And that came out earlier  this year. I don't know if people are aware of that,  but that particular lawsuit was settled  between the plaintiffs and the City of Boise  earlier this year.  Sorry, does that  answer the question as far as  your perspective about  So obviously we are going to follow  the law. Anything that is not,  I mean the police department is going to follow the law. I am  no longer its chief of police.  But the police department is going to follow the law  and whatever that law says, we are going to follow.  But as I said,  many of those things that may have been  deemed unconstitutional, at least  initially in that ruling, have then been settled  through a lawsuit,  through that lawsuit with City of Boise and  those plaintiffs, which does allow  for enforcement of those particular ordinances.  So you would support enforcing the  ordinances as is? Under the right  circumstances, absolutely. Thank you.  Alright,  any other questions? Chief, just one  because you kind of brought it up  and I blew it by referring to you by your  title, which is all I know you as. Former.  Yeah, I'm not going to call him that.  Uh,  moreover, I think to maybe  soothe the attitude of current people serving,  can you explain the difference between  operations and policy?  Because this would be a very different step for you.  It is.  And that is one that I understand very  acutely.  It is not my position to run  any department in the city,  particularly the police department.  We have an outstanding police chief,  outstanding command staff, outstanding officers,  dispatchers, the entire team  is standing by the police department.  They do not need me to come in  and run a police department. They have  that leadership. That is not my role as a council  member. We are policy and budget.  So the only thing I would do is clean up your  precedent remark in terms  of saying that actually at one point in time  it was precedented because  we did have two council members  absent in our history at one point.  Oh, we did. Well, I stand corrected.  Just once. I stand corrected.  A long time ago. Or it did happen.  Yeah.  Late 1800s. Late 1800s.  And even I wasn't around  that long.  You're going to be in trouble.  Thanks, Coach.  All right. Thank you.  All right. Thank you.  Daniel Rodriguez  followed by Derek Sanderson.  Honorable council  members and city staff.  As I look around,  I see many great  candidates, each bringing a unique element  to council.  Does that make anyone better than  another?  Then I think about the voters.  And while we vote for  an individual,  one word, one theme  keeps coming to mind.  Trust.  You see, when we fill  in that little bubble next to a candidate's  name, we are saying,  I trust you.  I trust you to do what is best for the people  and the proper of our town.  I trust you  to lead us.  I trust you to perform the will of the people.  I trust you  to keep us from harm's way  and away from conflicts of interest  and controversy.  In my mind,  I'm the best candidate because I understand  the value of trust.  Today, I challenge you  to show our citizenry  they can trust you to do what is right  rather than easy  or popular. To trust that you  will not bring controversy in your decision  or to the dice.  I trust that your decision  will be inclusive  and that you will embrace  the diversity of our beautiful town.  I embody the will  of the people and what trust is.  My understandings of  the Brown Act, Robert  and the rules of order,  the city commissions,  the city charter,  and some knowledge of the APMPs.  They're quite lengthy.  So I look forward to that four hours with Debbie  if chosen to take on the seat.  Mayor Kulich,  to answer your question,  I do have political aspirations  and as Councilmember Morgan will tell you,  there was a point where I was actually  going to be running,  and we both are in District 1,  Casey, to answer your question,  and in the interest of being sure  not to split the vote,  I stepped back and  Thanks a lot.  Councilmember Morgan  I supported him  in his bid  to become the Councilmember for District 1.  So  that's a little bit about  my thought processes.  You have my application in front of you  and I welcome questions at this time.  Questions?  Alright.  Thank you very much for your time.  Thank you.  Derek Sanderson  followed by John Scott.  Good evening,  Council.  It's been a while since I've  gotten to stand before you guys with COVID  and all the wonderful things  that have been going on.  I did prepare  some notes, but  per the Mayor's request,  uh, no,  I, uh,  some of you know me  because of comments  that I've made.  Some of you know me  as being critical  of previous Councils,  previous Councilmembers.  I believe that  citizens should stand up  and speak.  That's the beauty  of our government,  that the citizens have a voice.  Thank you.  To protect and enhance our community's  quality of life for present and future generations,  the City Council and City staff  are committed to ensuring that Chico  is a safe place to raise a family,  an ideal location for business,  and a premier place  to live. I hope this sounds familiar  to everybody in the room  as it is our City's  incredible mission.  Being  from business world,  there's a lot of wrong ideas about  what exactly is a mission statement.  So,  Almighty Google,  a mission statement is a  formal summary of the aims and values  of the company,  organization,  or individual. And so it is our  mission statement  that must be the lens that this Council  looks through as it looks  at the things that come before it to make  decisions.  There's really five questions that should be asked  for every single thing that comes before you  as a Council, as well as whoever  you determine to appoint.  Does this enhance the quality of life  of the community? Does this protect  and enhance the quality of life for future  generations? Does this ensure  that Chico is a safe place  to raise a family?  Does this ensure that Chico  is an ideal location to own  or run a business?  And lastly, does this ensure  that Chico is a premier  place to live?  My grandma once taught me, she said,  Derek, you can attract a lot more flies  with honey than vinegar.  And unfortunately, our  community, and we've seen across  the nation, have been plagued with people  putting out vinegar.  We've been uncivil, we've said things  that we probably  regret later on.  But it's time to  stop the rhetoric that stirs the pot.  The biggest question I got asked  when connecting with folks  before I put my application is, Derek, why in the  world would you subject yourself to this?  And I said, because I love  my city.  And in my eyes,  it's worth the sacrifice.  I don't take an appointment  lightly, and so  with that, my time is up.  Any questions?  Mayor, I'll answer yours first.  And to  say to everybody else, I live in District 2 currently.  I've been there for  almost four years.  At this moment in time, the focus  is the next 17, 18 months.  I think that  there's always the opportunity in the  future. However, that decision needs  to come later. The focus right now needs  to be the needs of this city right now.  And with that, I really think, somebody  said earlier, whoever  gets appointed really needs to take this seriously  over the next  17 to 18 months, because the decisions that are made  we already know can affect  generations. So, though  in this moment in time,  I'm not saying, yes, I'm  running in 2022,  I am saying that we really need  to focus on the agenda  and the items at hand.  Alright, other questions?  I have a question. Yeah.  You mentioned  in your application in the road repair  section that  hard choices need to be made and money moved around  in order to fund repairs and  continue upkeep. Where would you propose  moving money from in order to prioritize  roads and infrastructure? Yeah, that's  a great question.  Um,  similar to what somebody said earlier,  I believe there are areas that we can  I've been reading  the city budget. I don't know if  anybody else in the room other than you guys  have. It's massive.  And so,  I don't think right in this moment I could  give you a fully educated  answer that I would feel comfortable with.  However,  I do believe that as far as  also hard choices, I know that  the council discussed  not long ago, sales  tax, and there were a lot of arguments  about how would that be set up, should  it be proposed.  If  the public, if the citizens are  educated on where the budget's  at and what is needed,  because the reality  is our roads are in disrepair,  they need a lot of help.  I believe that if  the community were truly educated,  and if it were set up in such a way, I believe  there could be a majority of support  for sales tax.  And so,  about what that would look like, that would  obviously be open to discussion.  So, I believe there would also probably have to be a  funding mechanism, especially looking forward.  Other questions?  I'll just note that that is headed to the  finance committee at some point.  Perfect.  Thank you.  John Scott, followed by Larry Wall.  Council members, hello.  The city of Chico is in crisis,  and using soft words  isn't going to change the reality.  The most visible crisis we have  is available  when you go to Comanche Creek,  or drive by the parks,  or really any other public area.  We have hordes  of transients,  and it's getting worse, not better.  I've lived in Chico since  1978, so I've had a fair  view over the last 43 years,  and I can tell you in the  23 years I've been here,  I've never seen anything like it.  In my younger days, I talked to people  older than me, and I can tell you  they never saw anything like it.  In fact, I'd suggest to you that  Bidwell Park is probably in the worst shape  it's been since Annie Bidwell gave it to us.  That's the most  visible problem.  We also have an invisible,  well, maybe a little visible problem  that I'm not hearing a lot of talk about  tonight, and it's the pension  issue. Unfunded  pensions right now,  as I'm sure all of you are aware,  take over a million dollars  a month  of money. How many  roads can we fix if we had an  extra million dollars a month?  How much more can we  help the transient issue  with maybe a camping  location that  judges that don't live here might agree  solves the issue?  I'm here to suggest that a million dollars a  month and climbing, I might add,  could fix a lot of those problems.  We have other problems.  Currently, there is  a group,  a subset, a small  subset of Chico  that thinks the best way to deal with  narcotics addiction  is to hand out the tools  needed to use those narcotics  as in needle giveaway  programs. This is  ludicrous. It is parasitic  and it is flat wrong.  The people of Chico have already  spoken, which is why all of you  are sitting up here on the dais right  now. Long ago,  well not that long ago, there was actually  a solution that worked.  It was called the methadone program.  If you had a problem with heroin  and you wanted some help,  you went to a medical facility,  they administered to you  a daily dose of methadone so that  you could be  relatively free of the screaming  needs for opiates and you could go about  your regular life while you could  anticipate it in your recovery.  Today, that has basically  been bastardized to  here's a needle, here's a box of needles,  here's a tie off,  it's wrong, I won't  say it's right, I will not  use softeners, we need to  tell the truth on all issues.  I've only mentioned three,  but I'm also down to three seconds.  So at this point,  questions please.  Want to transition into mine?  Sorry? You want to transition into mine?  Absolutely.  And the answer to that is  that I have no political aspirations  beyond Chico.  I love Chico, I'm going to live here  until I die.  And the answer is that I will  run in 2022  if Casey doesn't run.  Casey and I live in the same  district. And I can tell you that  Casey's positions  almost always match  mine. And so,  you know, I like to work,  but on the other hand, if Casey's  going to do the work, I'll let her  continue to do the work.  Should she choose in 2022  to move on  to some other  work project, yes, I will  run in that district.  I hope that's clarity.  Yeah. Any other questions?  No? Thank you.  Thank you.  Larry Wall followed by  Lucille Waney.  Good evening, Your Honor,  Vice Mayor,  Council, staff.  You know, I've  called Chico my hometown  for most of my life.  I've had the good fortune  and the honor of serving both my  country and my community.  And tonight, I come before you  because I've applied for the  position based on my experience,  qualifications, background,  and my desire to serve as an  interim council member.  As is evident here tonight,  there are numerous issues  to be addressed.  I'm ready to go to work on day one.  My experience and temperament  will be of benefit, bringing council  members and a wide spectrum of  the community together to  seek common ground on numerous issues.  We especially need to work  towards solutions, not necessarily  to get there, because some of them are very difficult,  work towards solutions on the  issues of homelessness and housing,  public safety, police staff  staffing, and the cleanliness of our  parks, waterways, and public spaces.  In addition,  I believe and I trust that every  council member will be not only a  budget hawk, but a spending hawk.  And I would like to thank all  those community members of different beliefs  and values who encouraged me to  apply, and who have the  faith and confidence to support  me for this appointment.  I am truly grateful to former  mayors Mark Sorenson and Maureen  Kirk for encouraging me to  apply and endorsing me to  be selected as an interim council member.  The word civility  has only come up a couple times here  tonight, and I think that's one thing that  we really need to concentrate.  The council and the council chambers  has become quite civil recently,  and I would like to see that extended to  the community. So I hope that  people do that, and  it goes real simple.  Do unto others as you'd have them do  unto you. You know, I know it's  a biblical phrase, and we're  not necessarily a biblical  organization, but that  says it all. If you treat people  the way you want to be treated, I think we'll do a lot  better in the civility field.  And each of the applicants who  have stepped up tonight to throw  their hat in the ring, I want to  commend. It's  great to see so many people who love  their hometown. Questions, please.  So my normal question?  My normal answer.  Yes, I come here  tonight with no intention of  running for further office,  either on the council or elsewhere.  Alright.  Do you mind me asking which district you live in?  Pardon? Do you mind me asking  which district you live in?  District 4.  Couple of questions. You mentioned  the city needs, and in your presentation,  to be budget hawks,  or needs budget hawks in order to spend  less money than it takes in. Or do you  think the city is spending too much money right now?  Since I haven't really gone through the budget,  I'm not really prepared to answer that,  although the city right now is spending  within budget, if I see it correctly.  And so I think,  particularly in light of the  proposed sales tax increase,  that we need to do a complete scrub  of the budget to see where we can  cut before we ask people to go out  and vote themselves a tax increase.  Just one more question.  Do you believe that our society's  greenhouse gas emissions are  causing climate change?  I still didn't understand you.  Do you believe that our society's  greenhouse gas emissions are causing climate change?  I think they're a part of it. I don't know how big a part.  Sure, there's lots of things that cause that.  Thank you.  No more questions? No? Okay.  Okay,  Lucille Waney is the final  at-large applicant.  And then, to start district  three will be Amberlynn Avila.  And we will actually take a break  after you as well. Okay.  And that's no offense to you.  Most of  the things that I had to say  are already on my sheet,  but I want to make a couple  corrections and additions.  First place, I  understood that I was to come  and let you get acquainted with me.  And I want you to know  I lived in Chico 55 years,  instead of 54.  I think I eliminated 2020  when I figured that out.  And I  had been married 66  plus years to my husband Jeff,  who passed in October.  And I'm telling you that because  that was a commitment.  And you have to work on commitments.  And I think that's part of what  being on the city council  is, is making a commitment.  I raised two sons here.  I love  Bidwell Park because I have  many, many happy memories there.  I worked for Chico Unified School  District as an office  manager. And one of the  responsibilities I had  was keeping track of the budget  for our school.  Um,  I was, I retired  in 1996.  And I continued  subbing as a clerical sub.  For another 20 years.  So, I don't know whether  I'm a glutton for punishment or not.  But I believe  that a person  continues to grow  or she dies.  And I certainly want to continue  to grow. I,  for many years, have followed  the city council.  Have had my share of  criticism.  And finally I decided  I'd put my mind  to the money where my mouth is.  And that's why I threw my hat in.  I did serve on the arts commission  for several years and  was a rep for the  Bidwell Park Centennial.  And I worked on  the City of Chico Public Art  Policy Manual.  Which took  almost two years.  I'm a good listener.  And I listen to  both sides of any  uh,  opinion or  any discussion.  And I'm not afraid to speak up.  Uh,  I seek solutions to problems.  I think Chico  has problems.  But I think there are answers for some of those problems.  I think you have to start with  little steps.  And go from there.  Uh,  in the spirit of transparency  I do want to say that  I have two trips that I've already paid for  uh, if a  uh,  City Council meeting happens to be then  I would have to ask for  an excused absence.  I'm happy to take those off your hands.  Yeah, right.  I've heard that before.  And I have no  aspirations to continue.  Alright.  And I have to tell you  I am very embarrassed. I do not know  what district I live in.  Except that I couldn't vote in the last election.  So, it's one of those.  Okay.  So, you know it's an even number then.  Yeah, you're in an even number district then.  Alright. Um, any other questions?  Thank you very much.  So, um,  so we are going to take a short break here.  But before we do so, um,  I would tell the, all the applicants  we are actually not making a decision tonight.  So, um, certainly  you can stay and listen to  the other applicants  for the district. Or you're welcome to leave at the  time.  Um, but we do appreciate you being here.  We do appreciate your  support of the community.  And obviously, we have 21 people.  And there's two positions.  So, 19 of you are going to get news that you  don't like.  But I can tell you very much so that  we truly appreciate it. I think our community  truly appreciates it. And we also appreciate  the temperament which has been demonstrated tonight.  I think that speaks volumes to  the City of Chico and the place we're heading.  So, thank you.  We'll be back in about 10 minutes.  Back from recess.  So, this next group is for  the applicants for district  three.  The first speaker is  Amber Lynn Avila.  Good to go?  Go ahead.  Good evening, council. Thank you for taking your  time to hear all the applicants.  And I'm here because  I decided that I had the time to  take my time and energy now to do  something with the City Council.  So, since I am younger, I do have  the energy and the  perspective to bring to  the city that it doesn't already have.  I do have the experience  as noted in my application with both  federal and state government.  So, I do understand the late nights,  the extra commitments, and the  job at hand when it comes to government  and serving your communities.  And so, I'm not afraid to take  the extra time. And, you know, I'm not afraid to take the extra time.  And, at this time, I do have the  opportunity, because I have no other  commitments, to help  assist the community that is in need.  And so, I would also  like to note with the  homeless issue, it's hard to say  that it's just a City Council issue.  It is much broader. It's hard to say  that people from other communities, not just  Camp Fire or just from Chico,  turn into our responsibility.  And so,  finding a way to connect both the state  and federal resources  that are there  would be the best way to help  move forward with that.  And also, with the  roads also listed in my  application, just  getting them up to speed  with our community's growth.  We have a ton of housing going  up. We have the college  which is growing.  Come next month, our roads will be filled  with all the new college students that don't quite  know the city roads. And so,  just kind of keeping those up  to date and just making our community  better and  clean and what it always  has been.  And so, I'll keep it short and sweet  there. Any questions?  Alright, so after the original  or after the term expires, what are your thoughts?  Yeah, so  working in government, everyone's  always asked me, so when are you going to be  the representative? When are you going to run for office?  And I've always told everybody no.  Because I've seen what  it does to their personal lives and I've seen  what it does outside  of just the job.  And so, me applying today and standing in  front of you is a big commitment and  going against all of my regular  standards. So, I don't see myself  moving forward with this. I'm not going to promise  I'm never going to run again because I never  thought I'd be here today.  Alright, other questions?  I already know what district you're from.  Alright, thank you.  Thank you.  The next speaker is Dale Bennett  followed by Adam Giorso.  Good evening,  Mayor.  Do I need to stand in a particular space  or just in the middle? No, sir, it's fine.  Okay. Good evening,  Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council  members, as well as city staff.  Thank you for this opportunity  to interview for the City Council  seat to represent District 3 for the next  17 months.  I will prioritize District 3  issues and concerns,  but I will serve the entire  community if chosen  for the position.  I will be brief  and give you a couple of reasons  why I believe I would be a very good choice  for the District 3 City Council representative.  I am open-minded,  full of common sense,  not left, not right,  non-polite,  and I am self-authorizing,  and I know how to listen to people.  And I think that's very critical  in this day and age, is to be able to stop  and listen to people and try and understand  exactly what their concerns are  and what they are really saying.  I am easily trained  and I can follow instructions.  Just ask my wife.  I am familiar with parliamentary  procedures,  having served on the City of  Chico's Architectural Review and Historic  Preservation Board, as well as the  City of Chico Planning Commission.  I have attended city boards  and commission training.  I have taken  city online workshop courses  for the Brown Act,  anti-harassment, and ethics.  I am up to date on current  affairs. I've always been up to date on  what's happening in Chico.  And I think we have some  major issues, we do have some major issues,  facing  this great city.  I am very familiar with city staff  and have worked with them for many,  many years.  Finally, I can hit the ground running.  Those are my  comments and if you have  any questions, please do so.  Alright.  Oh, and my  today  right now, no.  I have no plans on running for the office.  But as I learn more  about the position, as I become  more knowledgeable as to  what it takes, I could change my mind.  So my answer is,  I don't know right now.  Fair enough.  Any other questions?  Alright.  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Adam Diorso followed by  Amber Howard Brown.  Good evening, council.  I'm admittedly a little more nervous than I thought  I would be tonight.  And in retrospect, potentially  the microwave  macaroni and cheese I ate for lunch  was not the best choice.  I don't think  that's ever the best choice.  I'm here because I want to represent  the will of the voters in District 3 and help  achieve solutions to the difficult challenges  the city faces, such as  increase in quality of life crimes,  homelessness, environmental degradation  of our parks and waterways, and  development and housing.  Short and sweet.  My main issue would probably  be the parks. I am appalled  at the condition of the  parks in Chico. I've never ever  seen anything like it in my life, and I think  there's a very real sense of  urgency here. That is my  primary issue. That's why I'm here.  Alright.  Answer to my question.  You know, I'm focused on this  right now. If I was to get a position on this council,  I'm focused on the problems  right now. I'm not even looking  at a potential run  after this. If I was to do a decent job,  and that was something  down the road that looked achievable,  maybe. But that's not  my primary focus. My primary focus  is to get solutions to these problems  that we're facing right now.  Alright. As soon as  possible. Questions?  I want to, I'm sorry to put you on the spot,  but I want to ask the question I think everybody  is wondering about.  Was it Kraft macaroni and cheese?  Or some lesser. Trader Joe's.  Trader Joe's. Thank you.  A more higher quality macaroni and cheese.  That's a tough question.  I have a question.  Yes. Kind of a long one,  so if you need to repeat it, let me know.  Try to follow along. Alright. In your application,  you suggested that the solution to  homelessness is to enforce ordinances,  empower police,  and enact stricter ordinances.  You then say that housing is an issue  and suggest regulating density more  carefully on new subdivisions. That's a quote from your  application. Are you saying  that new developments should be compact  or more spaced out and lower density?  I would say that, you know,  I think it's been a direction to  Chico to try to  get infill first,  prevent urban sprawl out into areas.  We have a very specific  situation in Chico where we draw  green lines and we draw places. We have  agricultural land that  is important to supply food  for our area. We can't,  we've got view shed  in the foothills that we can't build in.  People don't want houses up in the side of the  canyons. So we have a  unique situation of where we can  grow. I think the first priority  would be filling in  areas, empty lots. We all see them  around town.  There's nothing there. There hasn't been  anything there for 20 years and if you  provided the right infrastructure  around and planned accordingly,  I think infill first would be a good  solution. And then,  you know, moving to other  areas where we can do  development both for single family  residences, apartments, and  lower income housing as well.  I think I'm specif- I appreciate the context.  I think I'm specifically referring to  the suggestion that we need to regulate  density more carefully on new subdivisions.  Yeah, I noticed, I mean,  that  when I was younger,  things seemed to be more  thought out in the way that they  built houses.  There was more space. The roads were  wider. I know that we have  space issues, but the way  that they cram in houses to these  developments today impacts  traffic too. They just put so many  houses on such a small area.  But even, you know, some of the roads  I drive down on newer subdivisions,  if there's somebody's car  parked on the side of the road, two cars  can't pass each other  on those roads. It seems  cumbersome. It's strange. I don't know  why it was ever approved to  have things like that.  It just doesn't seem conducive  to building quality neighborhoods  in Chico. So,  does that answer your question?  I think maybe just for clarity,  so you're saying that you support more  spaced out and lower density development,  particularly on those?  Right, right. Identify  good places that we can build  and decrease  the density  while infill,  you know, infill might be a better  situation  to create denser housing  than  sprawling, you know, than  building in other areas  dense housing. Thank you.  You're welcome.  Alright, other questions?  No? Alright. Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Amber  Howard Brown followed by Sandra  Husband.  Good evening. Thank you for your time.  My name is Amber Brown and I'm applying  for the District 3 City Council  position. I would like for you  to consider me as a serious candidate  for the vacant position.  Although I do not have experience in  city government, I have an extensive  professional background that would be relevant to the issues  that our city is facing today.  I have developed and worked in large scale  budgets, led large teams to successful  outcomes, trained and hired  hundreds of employees,  worked with city planning, development,  housing authorities all over California.  My 18 years of property management offers  a kind of experience, a different kind  of experience, and I hope to bring my  knowledge and fresh outlook to the table  here today.  I prepared more, but in the  interest of time, a lot of it's already on  my application, so  I will welcome any questions at this time.  Okay.  My usual thoughts  after.  This would be a long-term commitment for me. I would  rerun. I fail  to get more accomplished that way  than just serving the short time that would be left.  All right.  Any other questions?  Amber, do you have any experience  on boards and commissions at all?  I saw a lot with property management and  different government  So, I've  been on a school board.  So,  I am Brown Act certified.  I've learned all that. And then,  yeah, I've served on some councils for like  sales and marketing and things like that. So, I do  understand the processes and have some  experience there. Okay, great. Thank you.  All right. Any other questions?  Thank you very much.  Sandra Husband  followed by Sam King.  Good evening, and I do  want to thank you for all the contributions you're  making to the city. I know it is not  an easy task.  As you know, with my  application, my biggest concern  really are the children of this community.  In every  aspect, our children are being affected  by the crime rate that we have  right now. We're at a 58%  greater than our national  average for violent crime in Chico.  31%  greater for the state of California,  which to me is appalling  when this was not the city I moved to  in 1989,  1990. This is  where we chose to raise our kids, and as I said  in my application, I probably would have  not chosen that at this time because of  the crime rate, our  homelessness is a major issue,  and I do believe that those tie drastically  into our rhetoric and  really our  public opinion of  how we have, in my opinion, degraded  our police force,  our law enforcement agencies.  We have not given them the respect they deserve.  I believe that we need to find money  in the budget to expand  our pay for our police  officers and our law enforcement agencies.  That we need to change our  public rhetoric on how we  see and view those that  are here to protect and serve us.  And I believe  as a, basically,  law enforcement runs strongly in my family.  My dad was a disabled  vet. I believe that  we're needing to teach our children respect  for our law enforcement,  for those that are in authority,  and right now  I don't see that occurring  in this  time frame. And so I'm hoping  that by helping  be part of this committee  that that would be something that would be a priority.  And I know  finding that avenue  with the money in the budget,  you know, we put our money where our value  is. So you can look at someone's checkbook  and tell where their value is placed.  And there's always a way to find money  if we see a value in it. And I do  believe that empowering our police  force is going to help that with our homeless  community. I also believe that our homeless  community is going to help us  Yes, we talk about the need for housing,  and I believe that's really important.  But even working, when I worked at parole,  I found that when there's not enough  case management to assist in these  types of situations to make sure  you can give someone free housing,  but if they don't have accountability,  if they aren't, if we're not meeting  the intrinsic needs of what's causing  that person to be homeless, then we're really just  going to have to do something. So I would  recommend that we start looking at how  can we find money in the budget as well  to hire more case management to walk  people through the process, whether it's  drug abuse, drug addiction, or whether  it is mental illness, but working with  all of our avenues to bring that to pass.  In answer to your question, Mayor,  I did not intend on running.  I didn't decide until July 14th.  And I saw a need, and I saw a post  request from the city, and I was  really excited to see that post. Whether it was accurate or not,  I saw a post where only one person had  applied for District 3.  I really truly thought I was still in  District 6 because we were re-zoned  back in 2020.  And I said, you know,  I need to check into this and see if we're  District 3. When I saw District 3, I really felt  a nudging that I needed to step up because  we can't really  have  criticisms if  we are not willing to step in and  do our best to be problem solvers.  So I am aware of the committees  that you are asking  our time regarding  the constraints.  And so I've served on committees  before, so I do know what's expected.  And I would be honored to serve  in this position. So any questions?  I have a couple questions. Sure.  Do you think that we have a serious housing shortage  and would you support policy change to change that?  You know, in some ways I believe there's  a lot of  concern. I'm a little concerned. I was a  realtor before. I'm a little concerned about all of the  apartment complex that I'm seeing  going up. But yet I know there's been quite  of exodus in some ways  since a lot of our small businesses  have, there were 399  businesses closed in the last few months  of 2020 in Butte County.  And so we've lost a lot of  our citizens, which is  concerning. I think we'll see that in the next  census that we've got  a lot of housing going up.  But I'm concerned about that we don't have the  employment to keep them here.  And that's concerning that  maybe we will lead into a 2008,  2009, 2010  market crash. So  while we do have a shortage for  our homeless,  and I do believe we don't have enough  affordable housing, I also believe that we  have more than enough housing for what  our current  crisis is right now, which is our small  businesses.  We've had a drastic  closure.  And due to the, I believe the health department.  I believe that we've had too many stringent  guidelines that have made  it almost virtually impossible to keep our businesses  open  regarding COVID.  And just one more question. You mentioned  making room for case management in the budget.  Did I understand that correctly?  Correct. So you support hiring case managers as  part of our city's response to  homelessness? I do believe so.  I believe that if you don't have the case managers  to help, again,  with the homeless situation,  if you just hand over, I believe that they need  to be there to kind of hand hold  for a while to  bring accountability. If we just  give free housing or we just,  you know, if we're not teaching them to give back  as well and not find, again, the root of  the problem. So even with our drug  issues, I don't believe a six-week drug  program, and again, working at Pearl, I saw  this, a six-week drug program  does not solve the problem.  We need a longer drug program.  We need more accountability.  We need to set up our people  for success instead of failure.  So yes, I do believe case management  is critical. Thank you. I appreciate  your answer. You're welcome. And to answer, I don't  feel I fully answered your question, Mayor. Sure.  So in regard to whether  I would want to run again, right  now my whole goal was to,  there's a need and I wanted to fill a need.  If serving on the  committee, I felt like there  was something that I could be assistance and help  and there was still a need, then I may run.  You know, but as right now,  it's what's right in front of me.  So I hope that answers your question.  All right. Thank you.  Mr. Morgan had a question, I believe.  No? All right. Oh, I'm sorry.  That's all right.  All right. Next.  Sam King  followed by Brian Logue.  Should I start? Just jump in? Oh, there's a timer.  Okay. Hi, I'm Sam King.  Thank you for your consideration for  the open city council position.  So a little bit about me.  I am not native to Chico.  I actually grew up in a small town in  central coastal California called Grover Beach.  But I spent a lot of time in San Luis Obispo,  which is pretty close to that area,  which reminded me a lot of Chico.  Kind of shared a lot of the same restaurants like Woodstocks,  The Graduate, which was here but isn't anymore,  unfortunately.  I went to school in San Francisco, though,  and then moved up to Chico when I kind of started my professional career.  And one of the reasons  we chose Chico was  it provided the  kind of quality of life that we wanted to have  for our family.  At that time I was dating my now wife,  didn't have any kids, but that was the goal.  We wanted to buy a house, we wanted to start a family,  and all that kind of stuff.  In my line of work, I can live pretty much anywhere I cover,  Northern California and Northern Nevada.  So Rockland, Sacramento, doesn't really matter.  All those areas.  Chico also works out as well.  But Chico was something special  when we were looking at places to live.  And it was affordable back then, too.  My house cost to buy  what it was costing us to rent.  A one-bedroom apartment in the Bay Area.  And so that was nice.  It's a four-bedroom house in a nice little cul-de-sac.  That's really not the case anymore, though.  Those same houses, my neighbors are selling them  for $700,000 plus right now.  Which is like Bay Area pricing.  So there's been a lot of talk about housing,  affordability of Chico and all that.  I think it's a major concern.  Because my neighborhood, when I moved in,  it was all young families like me.  There's little kids out riding bikes and the cul-de-sac  and all that kind of stuff.  And that still exists, but it's aging up.  As people start to sell their houses  and move out of state.  So I think that's a huge issue.  Homelessness is something that  or unhoused people, is something that's come up a lot.  And I watched a couple of the other city council meetings  on the live streams before  applying for this position, just to get a little bit  better of an idea, because city government is something new to me.  I just kind of do my work  and hang out with my family.  And I haven't really dabbled too much into this.  But on that issue, that is something  that in my immediate family  I've had  on the mental health side of things  some  a lot of exposure with.  So I understand it's kind of a  multi-faceted issue.  It's something that there's a lot of compassion  that needs to go into solving that problem.  But it's also something that we need to make our community  safe and usable, I think I said this in my application,  for everyone.  I have a four and a half year old, I have a one and a half year old.  Chico is going to be our home.  And I want it to be something that they can enjoy our parks.  You know, they can feel safe downtown.  I love the Thursday night markets, all this kind of stuff that  Chico, not everyone has, but Chico has.  I mean, I travel all over for work.  And this is something  really special we have in our community here.  And so I would just like to, you know,  contribute in any way I can  to help keep it that way.  I can jump right into your question,  if you'd like.  So I put in a pool last year during the pandemic,  which was, in my line of work as a sales guy,  probably not the best idea.  But it worked out fine for me.  But this is my pool time right now with my kids.  So 17 months is probably going to be pushing it.  So I'll make a commitment for that.  But after that, it's back to pool.  Other questions, please?  I have a question.  You mentioned new construction in your application  as it relates to cost of living.  Are there any particular barriers to housing  that you'd like to see addressed?  So, you know, I think you were asking a lot about  the models of housing  and density and all that kind of stuff.  I think my current builder,  I bought over by Pleasant Valley High School,  that new development was going up over there.  model of what we might want to try to improve  going forward.  Because I don't know if you guys are familiar with that,  but it has, well, you all obviously all are,  but it has different phases, right?  So they're just now building all their apartments,  townhomes, and they're finishing those up.  But then there was also like level one houses,  which were like one, two bedroom houses  for small families.  Level two houses, which were a little bit bigger.  And then like doctors and lawyer houses  a little further up the road, right?  So I think we need more of that kind of stuff.  You know, like if we're approving stuff,  let's approve it so that everybody can find a spot.  You know?  They don't all have to be $700,000 houses.  Thank you for your clear answer.  Yeah, absolutely.  Other questions?  Any other questions?  All right, thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Brian Logue is our final applicant,  and then we have one public comment from Gaylord.  And...  Hi.  Thank you so much for having me.  I appreciate you guys a lot.  I'm looking forward to being able to serve with you  as a team member.  I'm excited about the process.  I was asked to do this last Wednesday night,  and I downloaded the app and started just sitting through it.  And I'm like,  the things that affected me is what I just threw down  in writing on the application.  On a piece of paper, and...  I love my town.  I'm excited about being here.  It's absolutely crazy.  It's heartbreaking  to see what we are affected by,  and we've heard it all night long.  So I'm ready to be a participant  to heal the process  and to keep it moving.  The things I like to do is  I love fly fishing and the streams around here.  I'm a mountain bike rider.  I'm a business owner.  I'm a dad.  I play out and about.  I enjoy our community a lot.  I've been raised here in town,  and I've grown up here.  Went away to college and came back here  and got married  and have kids.  This place is amazing.  So I really thank you.  I'm open for questions.  All right.  So thoughts on the future?  My future is definitely to  do the 17-month  term,  and I will absolutely  rerun if I need to,  and I would like to.  So that is on my heart.  All right.  Anyone else?  No?  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  All right.  Again, we'd like to thank everybody for participating.  We do have a public comment, correct?  Yes.  Gaylord ends.  Yes, to the entire council.  I just want to take this opportunity  as a long-term  citizen here in this city.  I want to thank you  to our mayor, vice mayor,  the whole council  for your commitment to  this city of Chico.  We really appreciate  the work you do.  And this decision-making process  you're in is of huge significance  to us.  I think that it's  really important  as I look at the council  and having watched this over  quite a number of decades,  at least five decades plus,  I feel like  stability on the council  is really important.  Sometimes we see  major swings in the council  as it kind of goes back and forth.  And  my concern  is that we're able to maintain  a balance in this committee  that keeps us  from a lot of swings  which create confusion.  And I think part of the reason  that you're here is sometimes  it's easy to have mindless compassion  and you make a decision  and think that's the best  and then it just ends up hurting  a lot of other people.  And now I think the thing  that I wouldn't want to see us do  is swing to kind of a passionless  legal compliance  where we don't see the issues  and we don't see the parts  into finding the solutions  that really are going to matter,  really going to make a difference for people.  Because they're all people  and the needs are great  and your job is huge.  So I just want to say thank you  for what you're doing,  what you've done.  I'm very grateful for this city.  It's been home to me since 1964.  And I love being here.  I love the park.  I get to walk in it  and fit in.  So thank you so much.  And you're in our prayers  and we're praying that this  process will be one that continues  to bring the kind of civility  that I sense here tonight  which is extremely refreshing.  Thank you so much.  Appreciate your help.  All right.  Thank you again everybody.  We appreciate it.  All right.  We are going to at this point in time  we're going to recess into closed session.  And we have any  Excuse me, Mayor Kalich.  Could I just, just to let everyone know what the process is.  Sure. Absolutely. My apologies.  So I've provided you with a nomination form.  It's been included in the packet.  I've also given each council member a hard copy.  It isn't due tonight.  We know that this is a very short process.  The charter required  a 30-day turnaround time.  And so because council has decided  that on  next Tuesday, July 27th  that you will actually  be making your selections  we will need to have your nomination forms  in by Thursday  by 5 o'clock.  And I wanted to let you know that  the policy in AP&P 1044  actually allows for you to  have up to two nominations  for a vacant seat.  So to keep that in mind as you go through your notes.  And then  when the agenda goes out  which will go out on Friday  hopefully by noon  the nominees  moving forward, the finalists  if you will  will be notified and  they should be at the next  at the meeting on Tuesday night  in order if any council members have additional questions  of them before you actually do the voting.  The voting will be done  by using a ballot system  and  I believe it will go quickly  especially we have 21 applications  and being able to narrow them down  will be helpful  and that was what the council came up with  when they developed the policy.  So I just wanted to let you know that  I also wanted to ask  Council Member Tandon not to put you on the spot  but you had mentioned you might need to be  a little late for that meeting on the 27th  so if council  typically our meetings start at 6  but I want to make sure  we meet your needs.  I was able to reschedule that so  I will be on time, yes.  Oh, okay so we don't have a need to start  at 6.30 I just  if we were going to do that I would want to notify  everybody  when we were adjourning so  if you have any other questions about the process  I do want to thank all the applicants as well  it was great to see the outpouring of applications  that we received  of people who wanted to help our community  so thank you council.  I'd like to thank  our great clerk  as well as her staff for  getting us through this. I know you guys had a lot of  processing there to do so  and of course for my colleagues because this is technically  our time off we usually take  at the end of July we usually don't have a second meeting  so thanks for being here.  We can have a third.  Yeah then we can get a third meeting too.  Yes so it happens.  Any  any speakers on closed session?  We don't have any.  Alright any council disqualifications?  Alright moving to close, thank you.  Thank you.
