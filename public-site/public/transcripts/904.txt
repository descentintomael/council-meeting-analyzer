Tonight, we have invited CSU Chico President Gail Hutchinson and her team to give us a presentation on the effects of COVID-19 and the university.  So, President Hutchinson.  Thank you for coming.  Thank you, Mayor Schwab.  Good evening, council members and staff community.  Happy to be here.  We have a thorough presentation that we're going to try to get done in 15 minutes.  So, bear with us.  The title is A Time of Change and Challenges.  And at first, I'd like to acknowledge all of the peaceful protests that are happening in the country right now in response to the killing of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor,  and many, many more African American citizens who have been egregiously killed over the centuries.  So, with that, we stand in support of Black Lives Matter.  Saying that, I'm going to just speak to that briefly and also talk about our global pandemic and budget austerity.  And now I'm trying.  There we go.  So, I just want you to know that I placed a statement out really speaking in our hurt and frustration.  Thank you.  And I want to express by not only the university but across the country on these horrific and senseless deaths.  And also that we have started a number of activities, one being a social media campaign that says you belong here.  Racism doesn't at Chico State.  And we have another number of activities that are being planned by our university diversity council along with our campus activities review team.  So, I just want to give a shout out to all the peaceful demonstration that has been going on.  With that, on March 25th, we took an entire university and launched it virtually.  We gave our faculty three days of preparation, March 13, March 24, and March 23rd and March 24.  And we gave students an opportunity to go home and leave for spring break.  And then we all started teaching and learning virtually after that.  This is a picture of Dr. Kim Chappell, who is with our university health services,  who, through the entire COVID-19 pandemic, has been able to go home and leave for spring break.  And through COVID, she and her team continue to serve our students and provide medical assistance.  Our faculty were teaching at home.  Many of you may know Dr. Jason Nice.  Here he is in his living room while his nine-year-old son is playing.  And really gives you an idea of what it was like for some faculty.  Some faculty were not as fortunate to have wonderful connectivity, myself included.  So, there was a battle for faculty staff to be connected to the internet,  of which I know broadband will be.  And I think that will be much helpful in the future,  along with our students who also had struggled with connectivity.  We also stayed involved in community service.  And this is Dr. Ayers and also Dr. Watkins,  who actually worked with IdeaFab in Chico in producing these headbands with 3D printers.  So, this is Dr. Ayers at home with this 3D printer actually printing this.  We were able to print them on a limited basis at the university as well.  And then they create the hold.  If you look in the upper right corner, you'll see the headband.  If you look in the upper right for the plexiglass, the facial covering,  and we were able to help Enloe secure these masks.  In addition, our students were very active in the community,  practicing social distancing when they were doing community service.  And here you have an opportunity to see a student actually taking blood as a student is giving blood.  Our students also persevered with their learning.  We have an international student on the left and then another student on the right,  showing you University Village  and how our students were studying from home.  This is one of my favorite where we have a drama student who's actually engaged in his final presentation of the semester.  And I just love the ingenuity here as he's looking at his laptop notes while he's got his phone on the chair.  And I think he probably pushed that couch up against the door to keep from others disturbing him.  Many have asked if we are providing students services.  And yes we are.  Students pay for services and we continue to offer those services virtually.  In many instances we're seeing greater use of services virtually  because students have that access through the connectivity through their computers.  So the rec center, here we have Brooke giving a yoga lesson.  Our Wellcat Health Center, our mental health services, tutoring, academic advisory, and other clubs.  It's remained robust through the spring semester.  And with that, I am now going to turn it over to Vice President for Business and Finance  and Chief Financial Officer who will go through a series of slides about our budget  and then I'll come back and tell you about fall.  Thank you President Hutchinson. Good evening everyone.  One of the things that came out from the Federal Government stimulus board.  I'm sorry, Ann Sherman.  Vice President for Business and Finance.  One of the things that came out in the Governor's budget was that we were going to have a  budget that was some requests and some hope for federal stimulus funds.  And the CARES Act was the first of those funds to be approved at our federal level.  The CARES Act provided immediate financial assistance to higher ed, amongst other things.  And the CARES Act requirements required immediate and direct support to students.  So the campus requested what's known as tranche one, the first of the $9.9 million that the campus received.  And the first of the $9.9 million that the campus received.  And was given immediately to over 9,973 students.  So of that money, we gave an initial block grant per the requirements of the CARES Act  to students who were Title IV eligible.  That is, they were receiving financial aid.  And we gave out two-thirds of that money immediately.  So the week of May 1st to the 5th, that money was immediately distributed to students before the end of the semester.  We also had a two-week window, knowing that for some students and their families,  their circumstances would have changed as a result of the COVID circumstances.  And so students could apply for additional funding.  We received another 5,048 requests for assistance.  And in total, we were able to award $11.633 million to 9,973 students.  And that money was distributed as of the week of May 26th.  So we're very happy.  We're very happy with that circumstance.  We received Tranche 1 money, which was that money dedicated for students.  And then we also used what's known as Tranche 3.  Because Chico State is a Hispanic-serving institution, we received another $1.4 million in what's known as Tranche 3.  In addition, we contributed some campus funds.  Because there were a number of students, such as international students who were under DACA service.  And for students who were taking classes online that had not been eligible under the federal requirements.  So we awarded another $439,745 to students who would not have been eligible otherwise.  Next.  Yep.  Graduation.  So really quick on graduation.  We had to go virtual.  And we had about 4,200 graduates.  Over 3,200 registered for this virtual commencement.  There was a little bit of resistance at first.  But when it was clear that we wouldn't be able to have a large commencement in person, students really got into it.  They received a graduation box.  Students came out and took pictures.  I love the social distancing that students demonstrated here.  We had a social media post, et cetera.  So all in all, we had over 3,000 students participating.  And we had over 3,000 students in this virtual graduation.  And extended family.  Family who never could make it to Chico.  Got to see their sons, daughters, nieces, nephews, grandchildren.  Extended family significant others graduate.  And it was very cool.  So I just want to let you know that.  It was exciting for the campus as well.  As we move into thinking about fall budget planning, we're really dealing with three uncertainties for the campus itself.  One is the continuing impact of the COVID-19 virus.  And one is the ongoing impact of COVID-19.  And what's going to happen there.  That has an economic impact for our state allocations depending on how fast the state can open up.  And we've got a big health and safety risk as we think about how to ensure our safety here in Butte County and for our campus and larger community.  We're also looking at state budget allocations.  And the governors may revise.  There was a 10.8% reduction in ongoing and one-time funds for higher ed.  This may again be possibly mitigated by some federal stimulus programs.  And there is a lot of work to be done.  And there is a lot of discussion happening between the legislature and the governor as they move toward a final budget here at the end of this month.  The third thing that we're looking at that there is an uncertainty is enrollment.  We've got some declining demographics in traditional college-age students, which we were already planning for.  But in addition to that, we're closely monitoring the response to the mix of virtual and in-person classes.  And then the economic impact, which may go either direction.  On the one hand, we may have fewer enrollments as students find it difficult to fund their education.  And on the other hand, we may have additional enrollments as students decide that now is the right time to come back and finish their degree.  As of February, enrollment was predicted to be down to approximately 15,840 students from about 16,500 in this last year.  Again, that was due to the declining demographics that we're seeing.  Our current enrollment modeling suggests relatively stable forecasts around that.  So we've got a current expectation of between 15,500 and 16,000 students.  We are very closely monitoring what's known as the melt.  So how many students over the summer time decide not to come after all, despite the fact that they have indicated their intent to enroll.  And then again, that third uncertainty is around what's going to happen.  Should we get more students or less students?  And we're very carefully monitoring that as the weeks go by.  With a 10% state reduction and a 10% enrollment decline from last year, 2021 has a predicted gap of about $30.6 million from last year's budget.  So as we think about how we're going to handle that, we have been looking at a variety of various planning proposals to identify savings and cost avoidance across all of our timing plan frames.  Plans for the fall.  So what do we do?  We've got three planning time frames.  We've got three frames that we're looking at.  One is the next six months as we think about what's happening with fall.  Another is 18 months as we think about the next year and a half.  And then our long term plan that meets our strategic plan, which is four years out.  We're looking at our debt obligations and the availability of our uncertainty reserves.  We have been saving for economic uncertainty, knowing that at some point an economic contraction would come.  And we have certainly seen the reality of that facing us now.  We're restructuring for efficiencies and service delivery, looking at aligning our services with our projected enrollments, whether they go up or down.  We're mapping process improvements for implementation in Planning Horizons 2 and 3.  There is a hiring chill, in effect, across the CSU.  Not a freeze, but a chill.  So we're being very careful and deliberate about the positions that we're filling.  We're making investments in technology and training, and we are very carefully monitoring our energy and sustainability initiatives, such that in the long run, we are able to reduce our expenses.  Our planning process looks like this.  I fondly refer to it as a plumb bob, which any of you who are carpenters will know that that sort of indicates a direct line to the earth.  As I said, we've got multi-year planning horizons in six months, 18 months, and four years.  We're looking at our reserves.  We're thinking about strategic investments so that the money we spend now is going to benefit us in the future.  Looking at those infrastructure options, any personnel adjustments that may be needed, and then division-specific actions at the bottom.  With that, I will turn it back to the President to discuss the local economic impact.  Thank you, Ann.  Just briefly, we thought it would be interesting to see local impact.  So what you're looking at is, on the left side, we have roughly 4,300 employees on campus.  That includes our student workers, and their salaries and wages total about $156.8 million.  Over on the right side, last year, we had 16,673 students, and they spent, at Chico State, roughly $370.2 million.  That includes their housing, dining, books, fees, tuition, etc.  What I don't have indicated here, and Ann and I are trying to figure out how we capture that,  is the amount of spending that students do.  And that's what we're trying to do in the actual community, like restaurants, bars, other retail shops, and things that they may go to.  But on the right side, we thought it would be of interest to you to know that $10 million is in support of our about 631 suppliers that we have.  So the categories that we broke this down by over the last 12 months is the top at $5 million with construction and installation,  followed by $1.1, almost $2 million, $1.2 million facility services,  and supplies, $537,000 office equipment and supplies, $264,000 in financial services, and then $258,000 in engineering and design.  I wanted to bring this to your attention because we understand fully our responsibility as an economic driver in Chico.  And we are in the middle of this global pandemic, and we are working very closely with you as our close partners.  You always have been trying to figure out the best way forward.  But we are also trying to figure out how to do this in a way that will be, first and foremost, public health, at the same time trying to drive the economy.  So that said, let me get to what are we focusing on.  We are going to be, as Chancellor White has said for the entire CSU, predominantly virtual.  But it doesn't mean we're not going to have any students here.  As you see in the picture on the left, that is a student who's studying in her trailer, her fifth wheel.  Virtual learning will continue for just about 90% of what we're doing.  But we are going to have a lot of lab classes going on on campus, and that is depicted by the picture to the right.  So here's what Paul is looking for.  This is a very inclusive process that went through our campus.  I have approved this, but I have to get the endorsement of the Chancellor.  This sits on the Chancellor's desk right now, and I have confidence that we will have an answer by early next week, which is great because we've got to get moving.  So we have proposed 209 in-person courses,  which equates to $419,000.  And we have a total of 150 sections.  Sections means you can have one or more sections of a particular course.  10.5% of total sections we've requested to be in-person.  They're predominantly labs like biochemistry or engineering or maybe an arts studio lab.  But that's 10.5%.  Now the 10.5% equates to roughly 3,000 students who can be attending these courses in-person at any one time.  And close to 50% of those students are students who are in the classroom.  So we have a total of about 1,500 students on campus at any given day.  And roughly 150 faculty and support staff who may be on campus on any particular day.  Our residence halls cover about, I think we have roughly 2,246 beds, maybe a little bit more.  So we're really asking for 1,036 students to be housed on campus in our residence hall.  They will be in single rooms, but they'll be charged the double rate.  So they're not going to be in a room.  They're not charged anymore.  And we believe with 1,036, we can work to keep them safe and certainly keep up our health protocol and sanitation protocol, especially in restrooms and bathrooms.  And then 100% campus events for the fall really to this point have been canceled or postponed.  Now all this said, you know as well as I that we're in Phase 2.  The governor is moving us perhaps into Phase 3.  Higher education sits in Phase 4 of the reopening of California.  Anytime we have a new governor, we're going to be in Phase 3.  So we'll be in Phase 4 of the reopening of California.  Anytime we see a lessening of restriction, we will be looking for ways to invite more people onto the campus.  Anytime we see a spike and again public health first, we'll have to probably dial it down and clamp down and keep people safe.  I say all of that and then we just produced last week kind of a return to campus protocol that we hope to do in the summer.  We're looking to bring a few more faculty and staff back to campus this summer in ways that will change our lives.  keep them safe, allow them to work, but allow us to practice as we work to scale up for the fall.  And with that, we will get through this, and I thank you for your time.  Does counsel have questions?  The percentage is a little lower than your preliminary numbers, I think.  You were hoping for 15% before?  We were. We were.  The chancellor made it very clear that he wants us between 10% and 12%.  So the chancellor has made that clear.  And then let me also add that I'm on the phone with my enrollment folks almost daily.  I'm on the phone with parents.  I had a phone call today from a friend who's got a friend whose daughter is coming.  She's coming in as a freshman.  She's hoping if she can be one of the 1,000, she's psyched.  But if she can't, she's already looking for property.  So we have a number of students who really just want to come back,  and they may not get that full campus experience,  but they're going to get that full campus experience,  but they're coming for the Chico experience.  So we don't know how many students may be living off campus,  but at the same time, Dan Herbert is working very closely with our property owners,  trying to get an estimate on number of leases signed by students, et cetera.  So we're hopeful that we'll have, I told you, 3,000 on campus.  I don't know how many will be living in the area.  It could be more.  Thank you.  President Hutchinson or maybe Ms. Sherman,  I had a question.  I had a question about financial aid.  Do we expect that to be available to students in the fall, and so no change in that?  None, yes.  So that will be an incentive for students to attend?  As we look at our percentage of change with regard to our budget.  Can you come up?  Because it's aired and people won't be able to hear you.  As we've looked at the changes to our budget, actually financial aid comes out first.  So that is protected as we look at percentage changes to our other operating budget.  Okay, good.  Yes.  Both summer and fall, by the way.  Okay, good.  President Hutchinson and Ms. Sherman, thank you so much for being here today  and for your presentation at the Town and Gown Committee previously.  Obviously, this conversation came out of a dialogue at the council level  about how we can support efforts to get more students back onto campus.  Is there anything that you could think of that the city could do to help you  in your advocacy efforts and your planning and your forward motion,  whether that's in the fall or in the spring?  Whether that's lobbying and supporting the efforts that you're putting forward or anything else?  So first, let me begin with a thank you.  I wish to thank the city for the letter that they sent in support of all the efforts in town  and also for Chico State.  Sent it to the governor with a copy to the chancellor.  I think that was incredibly helpful.  And I think all that we're doing with what you're doing and what we're doing with our local legislators  in terms of helping the city.  And I think that's what we're doing with our local legislators in terms of helping,  asking them to really continue to support the local economy,  especially for rural California.  It's really perhaps bringing money up to help us out is what we need right now.  And we welcome not only your support, but we'd like to be a partner in that as well.  So I appreciate that.  Thank you so much.  Yes.  Can we say one more thing?  Yes.  One thing that I've been really watching carefully is some,  some,  some move afoot by a number of agencies to try to reduce liability.  Should we have students or employees become sick?  At the moment,  the governor has an executive order that requires that any employee be assumed to have caught COVID-19  through their workplace and therefore is covered under workers' compensation.  Workers' comp is self-funded for us.  And so that has potential significant concerns with regard to our expenses for students,  it would be more a tragedy of a youth being ill or, unfortunately, if they were to pass away,  but significant liability around that.  So there are some opportunities through some agencies to try to limit liability  at both the state and the federal level, and that might be of help as well.  Thank you so much for coming and sharing the information.  We'll continue to be in dialogue so that we can continue after this COVID-19 to be a stronger,  have our partnership continue, but to be a stronger community,  and we look forward to those discussions.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay, so we'll continue to our meeting.  I did want to make a note of something.  I did note that I was just reading from the agenda and said we were gonna be convening our meeting of June 2nd.  Of course, it's June 9th. We just continued the agenda.  Make a notation that this meeting is being conducted in accordance with executive order N-2920.  The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via Access on the Streaming video,  which can be found on the city's website under Minutes and Agendas.  view meetings online. Public participation during the meeting, the Engage Chico Civic  Engagement Program is available for citizen input on individual agenda items both prior to and  during the meeting, and this program can be accessed through the city's website where you  will find the Engage Chico Civic Engagement platform on the home page. Public comment will  also be accepted by email. We know that. They found us. The public found us. We got a lot of  emails in the last couple of days. They can, the emails specifically can be sent to publiccomments  at chicocca.gov during the meeting prior to the close of the public comment on an item. The public  is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one  email.  We appreciate the public's comments to give us direction on the issues that we are deciding and  look forward to the time where public health allows us to have larger meeting gatherings.  So on the agenda tonight, we'll start with the consent agenda. The consent agenda is for those  items that are routine in nature and can therefore be enacted in one meeting.  The consent agenda is for those items that are routine in nature and can therefore be enacted in one  motion. Are there any council disqualification comments or no votes on consent?  I'd like to ask a question about 2.5. I don't know if that means we need to pull it.  Yes, pull it. I'll pull 2.5.  I need to notate that I need to recuse myself from 2.2 due to a property leasehold.  Okay.  City Clerk, have we  recused ourselves from 2.2 due to a property leasehold?  Yes, we have.  Have we received any comments through the city's engaged Chico platform?  Yes.  We have a total of 18 for the consent agenda, 11 comments on item 2.2, four comments on 2.3,  and then three comments on 2.4, and I'll read those names for you.  Okay.  Jessica Giannola, Julie Threat, Kelly Moakley, Margaret Hicks, Megan Zimmerman, Larry Coleman,  and I'll read those names for you.  Stephanie Barrett, Myra Juliana, Gina Bax, Claudette Ritter, Nicole Nava, and then on item 2.3,  Anna Kirchhoff, Jessica Giannola, Terrence Lee, Heidi Wetzel, and then on item 2.4, Jessica Giannola,  Terrence Lee, and Michelle Rettlinger.  Deputy Clerk Rogers, have there been any comments received at the public's comment email?  No.  No.  Okay.  So we have received a total of 18 comments.  Let's take a couple of minutes to review them, and if we need more time, we will take that soon.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Has counsel had enough time to review the comments?  We will...  I'll entertain a motion for the consent agenda  with the exception of 2.5, which has been pulled,  and the notation that I need to recuse myself from item 2.2.  Is there a motion?  So moved.  Motion and a second.  Roll call vote, please. Council Member Huber?  Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Ory? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone?  Vice Mayor Brown.  Mayor Schwab.  Carries 7-0.  So item 2.5, a resolution.  The City Council of the City of Chico approving the conveyance of surplus city property  to the State of California in connection with the improvements at the intersection  of State Route 32 and West Sacramento Avenue.  Vice Mayor.  Thank you.  And thank you, Mr. Adabani, for coming up.  I'm not necessarily opposed to this,  but from your knowledge of the project,  will any improvements be made in the widening of the road  with consideration to bikers and pedestrians?  Could you speak to that?  Yeah, absolutely.  I'll give a little bit of context, too.  There's a whole history to this project.  Originally, actually, the city staff submitted, with council approval,  a Highway Safety Improvement Program grant to construct two roundabouts.  Okay.  Unbeknownst to us, we had to actually get Caltrans approval unbeknownst to us,  so they had actually programmed their own funding for that same intersection.  With some of the complexities, we actually made an agreement with Caltrans  and said, we'll actually give you our grant dollars to construct this project  and you take lead on the project.  So after some additional operational considerations and evaluation,  as well as some community meetings with some of the local businesses around that intersection,  they determined that the roundabouts were not the appropriate application at that intersection.  So they're going with more improved signal modifications,  including bike and pedestrian upgrades and improvements.  Caltrans, the last couple years, has especially taken on a very proactive bicycle and pedestrian  implementation.  We've been able to get a lot of information into their infrastructure.  So we continue to coordinate with them on those things, and it absolutely is included.  Thank you for that answer.  Thank you.  Does anybody have any questions for Mr. Ottoboni?  Comments?  Eric, can I get a motion?  Yeah.  Move approval.  Second.  Motion is second.  Can we have a roll call vote, please?  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ori?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed  on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the mayor  based on the number of speakers.  We have accepted comments on engaged cheekpads.  And through email.  The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section  of the agenda.  How many public comments have we, were made through engaged Chico platform?  We received 58 comments under business from the floor on the engaged component.  Do you want me to read those names all in?  Maybe we could ask the deputy clerk how many were received during engagement?  email. Fourteen. Fourteen. So we have a total of about 70 comments. It'll take at least three  minutes to review them and then if you could call the names while we're reviewing. While you're  reviewing them. Okay. So Jessica Montgomery, Jamie Damon, Bryce Goldstein, Sue Jeffries,  Amy Stolman, Karen Henderson, Jessalyn Ayers, Juanita Sumner, Ashley Jones, Jessica Giannola,  Sonia Antoine, Margaret Hicks, Jenny Walker, Terrace Lee, Misha Wallace, Ariel Anthony,  Ciceree Sherry, Erica Adams, Brian Albert, Michelle Rettlinger, Tina Ortega,  Jody Taylor, Michael Barr, Megan Zimmerman, Andy Wilhoyt, Taylor Skinner, Lisa Salzman,  Denise Ware, Jamie Strigge, Carissa Casey, Yvonne Johnson, Roxanne Eldridge, Jason Winton,  Carolyn R.P., Michelle Cooper, Kimberly Burks, Amy Chess Chavez, Stephanie Berger,  Sarah Barrett, Maya Juliana, Laura Russell, Claudette Ritter, Gina Backs, Amy Marie, Peggy  Gerolin, Michelle Burton, Deborah Jones, Pamela Copping, Karen Wilhoyt, Nicole Nava, Jules Brown,  Larry Coleman, Susan Smead, Julie Threat, Michelle Hale, Daniel Rodriguez, and Rob Berry.  The !  The  The  The  The  The  The [inaudible]  The  The [inaudible]  The  Thank you.  Thank you.  Has counsel had enough time to review the comments?  I just wanted to note that a lot of people may think,  well, three minutes isn't very much to review all the comments  that we receive.  I think it's important to let people know that these comments  have been submitted for the most part through the Engage Chico  platform, and many have been on here for many days,  and counsel has had access to them.  So we're not all speed readers.  Many of us have read the comments prior to coming to the  counsel meeting.  Under public hearing,  our first item is 4.1, hearing to approve the 2020-2024 HUD  Consolidated Plan.  And this report is by Marie Demers, our housing manager.  Good evening, Mayor, Council, and the community.  This is the final hearing for the 2020-2024 HUD Consolidated  Plan for the use of federal community development block  grant at home funds for the next five years.  As a brief recap, various demographic data was analyzed  through substantial public outreach conducted over the past  eight months to inform the plan.  The following priorities were identified for the use of the  funds, affordable housing, homeless prevention,  homeless services, neighborhood revitalization,  and economic development.  The plan in the agenda packet is a redlined version that reflects  what was presented to you at the May 5th meeting,  and the only changes that were made were the inclusion of comments  that were made at that meeting, as well as the removal of the  CDBG coronavirus funds as a source.  They were removed because HUD gave us direction that they should  be only incorporated into our fiscal year 19 plan and dealt separately.  So they're not part of this consolidated plan.  This consolidated plan includes the 2021 action plan and the analysis  of impediments to fair housing.  At the end of the hearing, I ask that you accept the analysis  of impediments to fair housing and authorize submission of the  consolidated plan to HUD.  And I'm happy to answer any questions.  Questions or comments from council?  I would just note exceptional, great work.  I didn't recognize Sherry last time, but it's great to have her  assistance with this technical stuff, but it does feel like we're in  good standing with HUD.  And it's a lot of detail and communication to be in that position.  Appreciate it.  Great job.  Thank you.  So we're being asked to hold the public hearing, consider any public  comment, and then take action on approval.  How many comments did we receive through engaged?  We received three.  Yvonne Johnson, Jessica Giannola, and Gina Bax.  Thanks.  Did we receive any emails on this item?  Does council need any additional time to review the comments?  The three on engaged, I didn't get them.  Okay.  Very good.  Let's take a minute to do that.  Okay. [inaudible] [inaudible]  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  Ms. Council had enough time to review the comments.  So we're looking for direction to approve the plan.  Move approval.  Do we have a roll call vote, please?  Okay, just a second.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ori?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  We'll move to 4.2, a hearing to consider the final annual engineer's report and the levy  and collection.  Of the 2020-21 assessments for the Hoosa Ranch Knob Hill Neighborhood Park Landscaping and  Lighting District number LLD001-08, we'll have a report from Eric Gustafson, the Public  Works Director, Operations and Maintenance.  Thank you, Mayor Schwab and Vice Mayor Brown.  Council Members, pleasure to speak to you tonight.  This is quick and routine.  This is just an annual assessment and approval of the final engineer's report for the Knob  Hill Hoosa Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District.  The annual levy is $66.06 per parcel and that has not changed since last year.  That concludes the report.  Questions?  And comments that we received through Engage Chico?  We received one and that was from Yvonne Johnson.  Did we receive any emails?  Okay.  Just take a few seconds to review that comment.  Okay.  I've already done that.  Okay.  Council feels that they have had enough time to review that.  We're looking for a motion.  Move to approve.  Motion and a second.  Have a roll call vote, please.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ori?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Item 4.3 is hearing to consider a resolution to temporarily close Old Humboldt Road to  vehicles pursuant to Chapter 10.53 of the Chico Municipal Code.  We have a report from the public...  Public...  Works Director Eric Gustafson.  Thank you, Mayor Schwab and Council Members.  Let me bring up this presentation real quick.  So, thank you.  It's a pleasure to finally bring this forward again.  We've been talking about this.  We've been talking about this for several years and have worked quite hard on this.  I know at the local government committee, I think we've talked about this in the potential  closure in conjunction with Butte County since 2017.  So, I'm pleased to be here and I think we finally have some resolution on this.  As we all know, the old section of Humboldt Road, there's a handful of historical values  up there, historical rock walls that were built in the 1800s.  They're always compromised, stolen quite frequently.  And commonly damaged or driven over.  There's also historic wagon wheel ruts with pretty significant historical reference.  You know, they were created by wagon wheels in the late 1800s and of course with the help  of storm water runoff kind of carved some wagon wheel ruts that are quite common up  there and pretty extensive.  So that's a very interesting historical feature that's up there and commonly impacted by cars  being parked over and illegal dumping.  And this kind of represents what we all know takes place up there quite often.  Consistent and constant illegal dumping.  That's a huge strain on resources.  A lot of illegal camping in the area and a lot of vehicles parked well off the road in  a high fire danger area and we've had a handful of fires in the area.  So that's always a common concern.  So the public safety issues that we experience and I know council has discussed this before  and is well aware of.  What takes place up there. !  Chico Police Department averages over 30 calls for service annually that range from pretty  low level crimes to pretty high level crimes.  There was a bullet that went through a roof in some of the new development a year or so  ago and we commonly see calls for service up there from the police department.  Chico Fire Rescue is also concerned with ongoing fire danger in the area.  There's a pretty significant 2008 Humboldt Road or Humboldt Fire that we all remember  and the origin was from that particular area and then a handful of other recent grass fires  in the last few years.  So there's a lot of issues that we're seeing in the area that are quite concerning.  I think one of the biggest issues with this from a public safety perspective is when resources  are deployed in that area it removes them from a rapid response model that's here in  town and kind of the downtown or the core of the city limits.  It's a bit of a ways up there especially in a fire apparatus or a police vehicle and so  it kind of impacts calls for service and response times in the city proper if you will when  resources are deployed in the area.  So that's always kind of concerning.  Consistent resource drain on public works staff for illegal dumping.  I think those numbers are a little bit misrepresenting.  We're able to log about 30 cubic yards annually from that area.  I think it's a little bit more, it's a little hard for us to delineate what comes from that  particular area versus other areas in town because we typically do kind of a route type  deployment model.  So we're pretty confident though in those numbers, 30 cubic yards annually.  But I think the more important factor is there's a significant volunteer effort in the area  to combat illegal dumping and those folks are removing about 20 cubic yards monthly.  So I think that's why our numbers are so low is a volunteer effort in the area is so significant  it offsets our numbers.  So combined it's close to 300 cubic yards of trash and debris that's removed from that area on an annual basis.  So that's fairly significant.  Then of course the picture there was from several weeks ago that at least the illegal  dumpers are getting a little nice if you will.  The green pallets represent the Save the Rock Walls advocacy group.  That's their meeting spot once a month to remove trash and the illegal dumpers have  just dumped the trash right in front of their meeting spot.  So they don't have to go far to find it.  But at this point the road serves no essential requirement or throughput at this point.  It's not a major thoroughfare or arterial or collector roadway.  However, it will be in the future.  Future development will require.  Access to the road at several different points.  There's active development that's happening quite quickly with Oak Valley development on the  north side of Old Humboldt Road and then the other parcels on their south side will most likely  developed at some point as well.  So there is future development there that will require connections to Old Humboldt Road.  So we think we found the proper mechanism at this point.  There's a temporary closure Authority under the California vehicle code that should be  the best path forward.  California vehicle code to be specific.  It's 21104.4 allows a local authority to temporary close a road of criminal activity and continued  illegal dumping exist which we all know they both are and they have been for some time  and it continues to increase.  This is the key point to that makes it temporary and I think really satisfies some of the concerns  of the local property owners up there that they want to develop their property at some  point or sell their property to be developed.  At some point the local authority can extend the closure for not more than eight consecutive  periods of 18 months if prior to each extension a public hearing is held which we're doing  now and conditions continue to exist.  So every 18 months we have to come back to Council and confirm whether or not the conditions  exist and determine whether to maintain the closure or to open it back up.  So that's really I think a compromise mechanism that it's not going to be indefinite.  It's temporary and will continue to go through those.  So we're going to continue to go through those 18 month increments and take it from there.  As you recall at the February 4th meeting Council adopted an ordinance adding that chapter  or adding a chapter excuse me 10.53 giving Council the authority to temporary close a  road pursuant to that vehicle code.  So we added a chapter to our municipal code under the authority of vehicle code 21104.4.  This specifically states local authority finds and determines that based upon the recommendation  of the police department or in case of a highway in an unincorporated area on the joint  recommendation of the Sheriff's Department and California Highway Patrol one of the  following concerns exists along the portion of highway recommended foreclosure.  A serious and continual criminal activity or B serious and continual illegal dumping.  And of course we have both of those.  So this is the proposed site.  Look at this real quick.  So it shows some parcel layers, city and county jurisdiction and then future connection points.  So this is the proposed site.  So here's Bruce Road down here.  Of course State Route 32 is here.  And this is Yosemite from the Cal Park neighborhood that Johnson crossed and then there's a roundabout  there that's existing from the Oak Valley development that will ultimately connect to  Old Humboldt Road here.  And that future connection is slated to take place in a few years.  So it's right around the corner.  So we felt it doesn't make sense obviously to place a gate in this area and then have  to move it within a year or so.  So we've opted to place the gate right about here.  Just above that connection point.  And it's important to note too that there's a pretty clear line of sight from Bruce Road  here to the proposed gate location.  You could see, you know, there's not a whole lot of elevation change in this area.  It's pretty wide.  You can see up here quite easily.  Once you get past this proposed gate area, there's a significant elevation.  Well, not significant, but in these terms there's an elevation change and you lose a  line of sight.  So this is the, at this point, the best proposed location we feel for the gate.  The county is looking at somewhere in this neighborhood on where to put their gate as  long as it's passed here and their Board of Supervisors also passed the temporary major.  This is just an aerial shot of where the gate will go.  You could see the Yosemite connection here.  Here's a roundabout.  There's a future bridge that will be placed over the slough.  And then the connection point will be right about here.  Do you have a question?  No.  I was going to make a bad joke.  It's fine.  When you're running the road, it's a significant elevation change.  You've written it, yes.  When you're running it, right.  Absolutely.  And this is just kind of a design concept.  What we're looking at as far as a kind of a Forest Service-style gate with some bollards  to still allow pedestrian and bicycle traffic through.  And then maybe some boulders to the adjacent property owners.  And we've worked with both adjacent property owners and they're amenable to placing boulders  to prevent people from driving through.  But we've also worked with other community owners to do a lot of other things to prevent  people from driving around and getting around the proposed gate with a vehicle.  So here we are.  This is the recommendation.  Council approve temporary closure of a portion of Old Humboldt Road pursuant to section 21101.4  of the California Vehicle Code.  OK.  Any questions for Mr. Gepstis then?  Great job.  And I'd like to tell a little history story if I may.  This started in 2017 after a bullet went off.  It was found in a woman off of Yosemite in her home that had gone through all the way  through the wall and then dropped into her living room, which was the immediate call  to action that something should be done on this road.  Of course, the Humboldt fire or the fire in the area added to that.  And they respect the walls.  I want to thank them for the work that they've been doing and continue to do.  That organization and Debbie Mullen, I believe that's how you pronounce her name.  I think that's her name.  I think that's her Twitter account.  I think that's Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter That organization and Debbie Malin, I believe that's how you pronounce her name, have just been doing an incredible job to make sure that there isn't riffraff and it's limited and less dangerous. So kudos to them. And I'm sorry that this has to be temporary. I know the reasons why. I'd love to see it where you have access for a period of time, you know, a day or something like that. When we get further down the road and there's greater options, understanding that we're a long way from that.  Twitter  Twitter  it and staff's effort on this in conjunction with the city and county. Great job. And I know the  property owners in the area and those that love this area, including Respect the Walls, very much  appreciate this action. I would also like to remember one of my dear friends, Francis X.  Farley, Xavier Farley, who had a mission to close Humboldt Road primarily because of his passion  for cycling and he was well into his 80s and would take a ride up Humboldt Road with  Spanish verb conjugations taped to his handlebar. So Fran, as we called him,  will forever be remembered on Humboldt Road. Oh, any other comments? How many comments did  we receive on this item? We received 25 on Humboldt Road. Okay.

Call our meeting back to order and go to item 4.4,  which is a hearing to consider accessory dwelling unit ordinances amendments.  Report from Brendan Vig, Community Development Director, Planning.  Oh.  Good evening.  My name's Kelly Murphy, and I'll actually be presenting the report from Planning tonight.  The proposal is to amend the accessory dwelling unit ordinance in Title 19  for consistency with state housing law.  To provide some background for you,  the 2019 legislative season was very active in California in terms of housing laws.  Six new bills went into effect.  On January 1st of this year,  that specifically apply to accessory dwelling units,  with the most significant changes coming from AB 68, AB 881, and SB 13.  These bills are intended to streamline the application process  and reduce requirements for ADUs to facilitate the production of smaller  and more affordable housing units on existing residential lots.  Local ordinances that do not conform to the new state laws have been deemed null and void.  As such, the majority of changes proposed  to the new state laws have been deemed null and void.  The new state laws that were proposed tonight are more mandatory to ensure compliance.  With that said, I'm just going to highlight a few of the most significant changes  to the development regulations and permitting process  for ADUs contained in the staff report.  While you may be familiar with accessory dwelling units or ADUs,  as I'll refer to them tonight, a new land use definition was established  for a junior accessory dwelling unit or a JADU.  ADUs can either be attached or detached from the main dwelling unit,  and they provide complete independent living facilities.  While junior ADUs are defined as a unit created entirely within the walls  of an existing single family dwelling unit that's no more than 500 square feet in size.  A junior dwelling unit may share or include separate sanitation facilities.  And previously, one ADU was allowed per lot  where a single family home was existing or proposed.  So the allowance for a JADU is significant as it creates the potential for a total  of three lots to be permitted on any lot where there's an additional unit.  And that's a lot of the same amount of space that's required  for an existing single family residence.  Another key change is the allowance for ADUs on multifamily properties.  New regulations allow for a maximum of two detached ADUs on the same lot  where a multifamily dwelling structure exists when minimum height  and setback requirements are met.  In addition, at least one ADU may be created  within the existing multifamily dwelling.  Per state law, the approval of ADUs must be a ministerial process and can be restricted only  where there is a lack of a single family home.  So that's where you have sufficient water or sewer infrastructure to serve the new unit  or where a new ADU would create a significant traffic or public safety hazard.  Discretionary applications to permit an ADU can no longer be required.  And as a result, the use permit requirement for ADUs in the SD4 West Avenues neighborhood area  overlay zone has been eliminated.  Further amendments include a streamlined process for ADUs where standards such as proportionality  to the main residence, lot coverage, and lot size,  can no longer preclude the development of an ADU up to 800 square feet  when minimum setbacks and height standards are met.  Another important thing to note comes from SB13 and impacts the extent of fees  that can be assessed for the creation of new ADUs.  ADUs with an area less than 750 square feet will no longer have to pay development impact fees  so long as the ADU utilizes the same sewer lateral as the primary residence on the property.  In an effort to further improve the development of the ADUs,  staff is recommending the elimination of the ADU planning permit application  and corresponding chapter 1919 in the code.  Rather than going through the planning department first,  ADU plans would be submitted directly to the building division for permits  and reviewed by planning staff for compliance with all standards at that time.  On February 20th, the Planning Commission held a public hearing to consider these amendments.  I do want to acknowledge that a few minor changes to the proposed ordinance  have been made since the date of the meeting.  The proposed ordinance is now in the state of that meeting,  which are identified in the memo to council.  This includes a clarification that junior ADUs are allowed only on single family properties,  not multi-family properties,  and that detached ADUs proposed on multi-family properties are limited to 16 feet in height.  The City received a letter of correspondence from Californians for Home Ownership,  which has been also provided to the council.  Staff has responded to the letter and acknowledges that  while some discussions are still happening at the state level,  an additional cleanup language and refinements are anticipated.  We are comfortable with the ordinance as proposed today.  This has been a collaborative effort with the City Attorney's Office,  and the ordinance will be submitted to HCD for review upon adoption.  The Planning Commission and Community Development Director recommend  that the City Council hold a public hearing regarding the proposed amendments  and introduce the following ordinance,  contained in attachment A,  to amend Title 19 of the Chico-City Code.  And with that, that concludes the report from staff,  and I'll take any questions.  Thank you.  Any questions?  Seeing none, we will open the public hearing  by reviewing the comments that we have received,  and perhaps council will have questions after we review them.  How many comments did we receive?  We received from the Engaged platform.  We received 11.  And how many emails did we receive?  One.  Okay.  So let us take two minutes to review them,  and if you could please read the names of those who submitted.  All right.  Jessica Giannola, Mike Trollander, Sonia Antwin, Margaret Hicks,  Cindy Walker, Michelle Rettlinger, Michelle Cooper, Pamela Copping,  Nicole Nava, Jules Brown, and Rob Berry.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I had a question.  It was asked to me just recently,  and it's only kind of related.  I'm curious if most ADUs also are separately metered  or is that even a factor  and whether they would have a separate address  or is the addressing scheme such  that they have to have the primary address?  Bring in the experts here for that question.  Sure.  ADUs can have a separate address,  and they typically do, Unit 1 and 2,  and they can be metered off the same home  or typically they have their own meter.  That's your way.  That's your way.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Thank you.  For you.  I did have one quick question while you're up here.  I just want, for the record, so we can be sure,  when we originally went through this,  we had made a lot of painstakingly,  I think, very diligent,  look at where we were doing this  and the overlay that we had over in the Enloe area,  and we're saying now state is coming in  and telling us that we can't have an area in our community  that we don't want to continue to grow, correct?  Correct.  This is not, okay.  Just want to make sure.  There's a lot of people opposed to it,  and that's a very compacted area,  so I just want to make sure everybody understands  this is the state telling us what we have to do.  We don't have a choice on this.  Correct.  Okay.  Thanks.  Okay.  All right.  Can we have a roll call, Will, please?  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ory?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Item 5.1,  resolution to approve the fiscal year 2020-21  proposed and final budget report from City Manager Mark Horne.  Final or preliminary?  It's preliminary.  Nice.  Yeah, so we've modified that.  It's just a preliminary budget tonight,  and hopefully we'll be coming back in two weeks with the final,  and hopefully it'll be a consent calendar item on that final,  so I appreciate your willingness to be able to come back  in a couple of weeks to finish that up.  Typically, you see these proposed budgets coming to you  much earlier than this meeting.  This has been a unique year,  so bear with me as I kind of share a little bit about that with you.  Building the city's annual budget can be very complex  during normal times,  but building the city's annual budget during a pandemic emergency  while still in the recovery of the campfire  brings about an ever more challenging situation altogether.  Very unique.  It's critical in this environment to take in multiple layers of information  to make decisions based upon accurate and timely information,  not based upon emotional reactions or uneducated guesses.  This approach will allow staff and council  to effectively take necessary actions,  to ensure the sustainability of essential services  to the citizens of Chico.  Fortunately, Chico is a well-balanced, full-service city,  financially speaking.  With a measure of sales tax, property tax,  along with a dash of transit occupancy tax,  as well as some other revenue streams,  the city is not solely relying upon one area for revenue generation.  The numbers before you are the best numbers  that staff have available at this time.  And they have been reduced by almost $6 million  to ensure that the city continues to live within its means  in a very conservative fashion.  In these complex times,  many of the financial impacts are out of the city's controls.  Because this virus recession is largely man-made,  however, it did necessitate the city being proactive  to proceed with various reductions and operational changes  to counteract the evident and anticipated effects,  as you will see.  Respected and very much appreciated Administrative Services Director Scott Dowell  will take you through a budget in a concise and efficient manner.  But be aware that weeks of work had gone into the original preliminary budget document,  yet at a moment's notice, everything was turned on its head.  And I was so proud of that originally proposed budget, just so you know.  So the past few weeks have been dedicated to reversing that prior responsible growth-oriented budget,  into a still responsible, yet flat-line budget.  Staff will be returning in the fall, October,  to have a deeper dive on the budget  and looking at really the best financial path forward through our recommendations.  As I know, the Council desires such a dive as well.  And that's after we have more known  as to the impacts of this unique economic event,  which we're still experiencing, as we all recognize.  Rest assured,  though,  that we're not going to be able to do that.  So that in the meantime, staff will be keenly focused on monitoring,  better understanding,  and will properly respond to any necessary further belt tightening,  should it be warranted.  After tonight's discussion, staff has asked for a special meeting in a couple of weeks,  as I alluded to earlier, that'll be on the 23rd,  to bring forward the final budget resolution with any changes from tonight,  if it's requested.  So staff can operationalize essential services in the fiscal year.  So just so you know, the city's charter reads  that we are to have a  original preliminary budget resolution,  which would typically come forward earlier,  and then a final budget resolution,  which is in our city charter,  authorized to come forward at the first meeting in July.  We don't feel comfortable with that  because we need to operationalize our departments  in order to afford them to start expenditures on July 1.  So hence why we're going to have the special meeting,  which I thank you for your indulgence of that.  So with that, I would like to ask Director Dowell to come on up  and take you through this budget as it currently exists.  There's a PowerPoint in our report.  Do we have a physical copy of that? Do we have a physical copy of that? Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Great. Thank you for letting me come up and share with you this evening in kind of a little  abbreviated format than what we've been accustomed to, but as our city manager shared with you,  these are different times, and as such, I want to just publicly thank the finance team.  Of any year that they've always done a great job, but this year has been more stressful  than ever. We kind of joked internally that we changed this budget 15 times,  because each day we would think we got something, and then everything would change.  So with that, I want to salute my budget team. This is how we did a lot of meetings,  is as we're all familiar with doing Zoom,  our teams, but I'm just so thankful for the team. Barbara Martin is here today,  and I appreciate Barbara's leadership getting her team together, and just a fantastic,  fabulous job. And I got a good picture here, because everyone was smiling,  and that doesn't happen, but here's Barbara here, and Catherine Mathis and Amanda in the car.  And down here, you can't really see her, but Crystal's hiding down here, and Casey Chappot  didn't have his photo that day. So anyway,  kind of moving forward.  We appreciate, again, the opportunity to share.  I've got an outline. There's three main areas I want to cover tonight with you.  Again, my job is to kind of give you an overview, and then towards the end, if you want to ask  questions, we can dive into things deeper if you'd like to do that.  But my preliminary items I want to talk about is the COVID-19, give you a financial update,  where we're looking at that, talk about projections, five-year projection, and then we'll talk  specifically about the rollover budget and the financial plan associated with that.  You may recall that I came and shared with you the first meeting in May and gave you really kind of a  direct and  dive into the details of what we were finding out, particularly with the COVID-19 effects on our budget.  As was already mentioned, we have incorporated about $6 million in reductions from our previous projections of revenue.  That's different than what was actual budget last year.  So I just want to clarify that difference.  Did you give us that?  Give you the...  So this is the increase of the rollover?  This is the decrease, yes, the decrease.  What's the...  So I'll show you that here in a few minutes.  Yeah.  So with that, when we last talked, we weren't aware that Chico State was going to go virtual,  and we got to hear that.  We're going to hear that presentation today.  But as a city, we took our original figures, and we reduced them down by $600,000 in revenue,  trying to utilize the consultants that we had.  As the president mentioned earlier, we don't know what those effects are, but we try to,  and those things affect us by sales tax, utility users tax, cable franchise fees.  All those kind of things affect us in those ways.  So we did reduce.  We're proactive in reducing.  We reduced the general fund budget by another $600,000.  The other thing that we don't always think about is our downtown area.  Parking fees are collected.  Meters are fed.  And so we've reduced our revenue for the next year by about $494,000 in the parking fund.  So again, we don't know if those may be higher.  The losses may be higher.  They may be lower.  But we're just trying to take, I think they're going to be lower.  To be honest with you, I think they will be.  But I don't know.  But as your finance director, I've got to be conservative.  I don't really want to mess that up.  As we talked about at the last meeting, there were some initial things that were taken care of at that time  to address the projected revenue losses even in this fiscal year.  Utilization of an allocated prior year fund balance.  We talked about that.  We had a fund balance.  We had a fund balance carryover that we're utilizing here in this next year.  I'll show you a graph of that here in a few moments.  We laid off hourly positions, 11 hourly positions.  City Manager Institute, a hiring freeze for 24 positions.  And we deferred some capital projects.  We also reduced general fund, interfund transfers, as we've talked about before.  The general fund is the main fund.  But there are some funds that need additional help.  And allocations.  So the funds that are healthy, we have frozen those.  And you'll see that as we talk about for next year's budget.  And as we talked about that last meeting, we came up with a contingency plan.  So if things go really, really bad, we've come back.  Staff has come back.  The directors have worked out a 2%, a 5%, or a 10% budget reduction.  Now, the plan is to come back to you in October with those additional requests if we need to do that.  So that's just kind of a summary there for you.  Let me highlight, if I can, the positions that are being frozen right now.  And those are in your packet, if you can see.  Just going down the line, there's several positions in the police department that are frozen right now.  Seven police officers, four dispatchers.  Out at the animal shelter, there's a couple positions that are frozen there.  O&M.  O&M.  And that has another four positions that are being held back.  So you kind of get an idea.  The airport manager there is not necessarily a general fund position,  but that is an important position that is being frozen.  Now, this I find interesting because last time I met with you,  I shared with you the cash position of where we're at.  What this shows you up at the top is the cash projections.  date. So back in October of 2019, we were forecasting what we expected our cash and  investments at the city to be $130 million. We just had our last finance committee meeting,  and at that meeting, we were projecting the cash at June 30th to be $134 million.  So to me, that gives me some encouragement to know that we're still tracking in a better shape  than we were, you know, back in October. The other thing that confirms this is if we take a look  going forward, this bottom part of the slide shows actual cash at 12-31-2019, $104 million.  So back January 1st, December 31st, we had $104 million. We're projecting  at the end of the year to have $118 million. So even through this process,  over the last few months and everything, we're still holding our own. We were having some really  significant revenue streams that were coming through before COVID-19 hit.  So and as we look at cash flow, and as I mentioned last time, there are some revenue streams that are  being deferred and delayed, namely sales tax. So we still believe we'll get the sales tax figures.  They may be reduced, but those figures may come in July, and the  rate over the next 12 months. So we're anticipating at this point to be able to get through the next  six months and through the next year, as I'll show you in a few moments.  Now, if you'll allow me to, I want to shift over and talk about our cash flow projection for five years.  And this is in your packet that you've got there, I believe. It may not be in the packet, I just can't  review, because this is referencing to the actual budget. So looking at the PDF pages that are there,  I think it's, if you were to look, PDF pages 35 through 38 in your packet. This is a five-year  projection that we share with you every year.  This is our mechanism of trying to look to the future.  The estimated final is for this current fiscal year of where we're at. I'm going to go back up one,  up a little bit further here to the first slide here. Actually, one more.  So up at the top, it shows you, here's the estimated final for 2019. So Mr. Orre had asked  that question, how does it compare between the two years? So this is what we're estimating this  fiscal year for. So we're going to go back up one, up a little bit further here to the first slide here.  So this is what we're estimating this fiscal year to work out to. This is what we're recommended for  this next year. So basically, if you go down here to the total revenue, an 8% reduction between the  two years. Now, it's a little skewed last year, because this $5 million over here, you may recall  we received $3 million from the state as a result of the campfire trying to help us through that  situation. So that was additional revenue that was there.  You can see that the revenue sales tax between the two years for what's budgeted and projected  is not significantly different. But again, if you go back to what we were projecting,  it is significantly different back in February. This 2021 is a tough year on the revenue side.  As we go into the next year after that, 21-22, we're looking at a bounce back here. And you can  talk to everybody.  Economists, they've got different perceptions. How I put this together and how our staff has put it  together is based on our consultants that we have, particularly with sales tax and with our TOT  projections. We're looking at bounce back years for next year. Not the 2021, but the year after.  So if that's the case, it's probably about a 5.6% on those revenues, 5.5% overall.  And you can see for those subsequent years,  there's a 2% increase. So these are my words. This is not from an economist, but for what I can  project at this point, we're looking at this as being a shorter recession. Again, my words.  But this is how I kind of look at it. We're getting hit with a recession that could be a short-term  deal, and then maybe we're back up and going. With any projection, we know that those things  can change at a moment's notice.  So I want to go down the slide here, if I can, with you to walk through this a little bit more.  Down here, we get to our expenditures. We put at the top, and this is focused on our general fund,  which is a general fund and the park fund together. This line up here shows you  our projected salaries and benefits. And our salaries and benefits includes  anything that we're looking at. We're looking at the  budget that we know about, basically step increases. These budgets are not built with any  COLA adjustments, including the budget that we're going to talk about in a few moments.  There's no COLA adjustments. There's step increases, which are the employees can get those if they're  eligible for them. And then any kind of benefits that are tied to PERS, tied to medical, and those  kind of things, those kind of statutory things that we have to have and provide, we have no control  over those costs.  So those are built in here. The other item that is always noted is how much the employees above the  employee share are kicking back to help out with this. You can see that figure is also highlighted in red.  As we go forward into, I'm going to jump to the next slide. I'm going to go all the way down to the bottom of this next slide  and highlight what I call the ending cash balance. This is what we talk about, the ending fund balance.  So if you have a good year, which we did,  purely just  purely talking about revenue standpoint, last year ending June 30, 2019, that revenue is carried over to the next year.  So it's held in what we call the fund balance to be carried over to the next year.  Highlighting down here, and this is on a cash basis, sometimes we use different terms for our accounting or audit, which are based on accrual base, but we're using a cash basis here, which we use for our budget processes.  Again, we're carrying over eight point.  We're anticipating  to carry over eight point eight million dollars.  So June 30th this year, we're anticipating that that fund balance will be eight point eight million dollars.  The start of the year was thirteen point two million dollars.  So we're utilizing some of that here.  This number gets carried over to the next year and so on.  You can kind of see the goal in this projection is we always want to keep this positive.  Now we have a desired reserve and you can see,  we're meeting that desired reserve here this year.  We're getting close this next year and then it is severely impacted.  We're still in the positive, but how do we continue to be the positive?  That's this very top line item here.  What would we need to do?  What adjustments either revenue increases or budget reductions in costs to get us to a positive number?  So that's this three million dollars here.  So forgive me as I scroll through.  No one have motion sickness.  We go through a twenty two twenty three is a year right now.  We're projecting that we would need to have some dramatic cuts.  OK, so that's if I look five years in the future or the next five years, that's kind of how we're looking at.  Now, needless to say, there's some positive things in this which I'm happy to share with you.  This next slide shares.  It shows you, as I alluded to earlier, we have the general fund.  We have transfers of revenue into the general fund from other funds.  By the way, we have over 200 funds.  Why do we have so many?  We keep track.  There's some things that we have to keep track of legally.  There's restrictions apply.  We have to keep track of them, but also for accounting purposes.  It's it's we want to be transparent and be able to know how these accounts are working.  This top line reflects transfers in.  The biggest transfer in that we have is our gas tax.  But now that why do we do that?  The premise is we keep track of our maintenance costs related to roads in the general fund.  So we track our costs in the general fund.  Then we transfer over, which is a legally possible thing to do.  Transfer funds into from the gas tax fund into the general fund to cover those costs.  You can see this continues on every year.  Now here's where I'm happy to point out something to you.  As we're projecting our transfers or our uses, these are transfers to other funds that are  highlighted throughout this section here.  But the very top one is the emergency reserve.  You may recall that back through the Great Recession, our reserves were trashed.  They were bye bye.  Even though we're facing difficult times.  The city manager.  The city manager is still proposing that we continue to fund the emergency reserve.  So next year we're looking and asking to fund and put in a separate account $1.4 million.  We're not looking to modify that at this point.  Now there are some things that we wish we could do.  For instance, we like funding the Section 115 trust.  This year we're suspending that or requesting to suspend that.  But if you look forward here.  And I'll show you the slide.  We're not going to go through the last line in just a moment.  But we are planning to continue that.  So we're not giving everything out.  We're still trying to plan for the next disaster that, God forbid, that happens.  Okay.  So we're still trying to be proactive even in these stressful times.  Some items here of note that we are transferring over is for this current fiscal year is transferring $1.4 million to the airport fund.  You may recall earlier this year.  We applied for grants.  We have a grant.  That's our share of receiving a grant of over $10 million.  So we're still looking to fund that.  Now, again, I know staff is working diligently to get that match waived.  But still we're being we have that there available to us.  The other area that is highlighted, this number two here, is private development funds.  Again, the private development funds are funded by user fees.  Okay.  The user fees were calculated approximately four years, four to five years ago.  And they have not, not all of the funds have been set at 100% of what the projected cost of that was.  Those particular funds have generated and they have a positive fund balance.  So we feel comfortable suspending those transfers to those funds at this time.  But here's the caveat of what we're looking to do.  And staff is talking about is we look to come back with a fee study done that would say here's 100% cost reimbursement.  So that the general fund would no longer have to subsidize those in the future.  Is that going to happen this year?  Probably not.  That's probably next year's budget where that would kick in.  But that's a process.  But, again, as we're looking forward and doing that, we're cognizant of that.  One area that we have.  That frankly is these areas are in tough spots.  And that's our replacement funds.  So what's a replacement fund?  Well, let's say we buy a fire engine.  Okay.  It has a life.  I'm going to pick a life here.  Where's the chief?  What's the life?  20 years.  Okay.  We buy a fire engine for 20 years.  You know what?  We pay for that.  We need to start putting money away when we renew that 20 years.  Okay.  Staff spends a lot of time doing that.  Over the last few years we haven't been able to fully support those.  This particular case is showing you more of we really need to take those seriously.  And really start to plan and put funds accordingly in there.  The last slide on this, and then I'll take a break and see if you have any questions.  Because I'm throwing a lot of stuff at you quickly tonight.  This last slide shows you the effects of putting dollars aside into our emergency reserve fund.  At the end of this period, end of the five years, we would be fully funded.  In fact, we would have over funding in that from what we were projecting it to be.  We could adjust that down that last year.  But I appreciate the foresight here to not just look at the initial emergency but also to plan long term.  Okay.  Any questions about five year projection?  Because then I'll dive back and talk about the current year budget a little bit more.  Okay.  Thank you for that.  Let me jump back into our PowerPoint.  All right.  So you can see in each of you, I think a lot of you have gotten your own copy of this.  I'm willing to share it with you.  I'm willing to autograph this afterwards if you'd like.  No, I'm just kidding.  But a lot of it were over 600 pages, 680 something pages.  Staff has done a lot of work.  And the new caveat this year is we have made some physical improvements to the budget that I think everyone will appreciate as you read through this.  We're trying to follow the procedures by the Government Finance Officers Association for their preferred methods for presenting the budget.  So we're following those documents.  One of the things you'll see a table of contents there.  You'll see page numbers this year.  You'll see some pictures there of capital projects if you spend that time going through.  So staff has really made some real effort to go forward with that.  Next time we've already talked about, Mr. Orms already shared with you about the format for approving the budget.  So this is a rollover budget.  Okay.  What's a rollover budget mean?  You've approved a budget in the prior year.  And we're using that as the base.  And we're carrying that over on the expenditure side.  Obviously we've talked about the revenues.  The revenues we've had to adjust.  But from a departmental standpoint, we're carrying those dollars over.  Now there have been some minor adjustments and tweaks here and there for some things that are essential that the city manager recommended that those be.  But we're going to do that.  But by and large it's carrying those dollars over.  So this is really, and I appreciate our city manager sharing this in the introduction.  This is to get us a spending plan, the authorization to begin spending July 1st.  And that's really the goal.  But again, we're coming back.  We're trying to be proactive.  I really do think by October we're going to have a better understanding, particularly from the sales tax revenue side.  So we're not trying to defer or hide anything.  It's just really a necessity of we want to be able to give you accurate information.  And there's a lot of questions on the revenue side that we're dealing with.  So as we come back there in October, we'll share that information with you.  In your handout there's some pages, I think page 10 through 13.  This is a summary.  These are Excel spreadsheets.  These are Excel spreadsheets that show you things that our city manager was approving before COVID-19.  So had we had the budget going forward without any issues, those things would have been in the budget.  They're not in there now.  They're being deferred so we can come back and have a discussion on those in October.  So then you can come back and we can propose and say here's where it is.  But just to be clear, they're not in here now.  But we wanted to show you.  I think it's, what is it?  $2.9 million.  Yeah, $2.9 million in general fund and park funds that are being deferred.  So we're not incurring those costs.  And then another $640,000 in other funds.  I want to spend just a few moments talking specifically about the general fund.  And I highlighted this here because you may recall earlier in the year,  we came back with a supplemental and there were a few things on there that you'd requested that we defer and wait during the budget process.  So one of those items is a community choice aggregation loan of $350,000.  That is included in this budget that we're presenting to you as well as $1.4 million for the AIP grant and then $250,000 for Fire Station 1.  Fire Station 1 is kind of in semi-limbo.  They're in this reconstruction period.  They're waiting for funding to do.  They're waiting for funding to finish that.  So those three items I want to just highlight and let you know that those are included in this particular budget that we're asking you to approve tonight.  And then I will share with you an investment policy update.  These next few slides here are some summaries of our general fund operations.  So,  in the general fund,  we have detail sheets for the general fund.  I think they're on page PDF 41 through 45 or the bottom page is 37 through 41.  What I've done is I've summarized these to kind of give you a snapshot of where we're looking.  So if we were to look at our estimated final for this year that we're in,  these are the figures that we're estimating.  You know,  taking the approved budget and then our revenue enhancements that we know about that we will come back with a supplemental with and adjust those.  This is what we're looking at,  what we're projecting.  Our net operational revenue,  so our revenue minus the expenditures would be $5.6 million this year.  This next year,  you can see the revenues reduced.  Our expenses are really not going up significant.  Our park operating expenses are actually going down a bit.  And our debt service on the lease is there.  See how close that is?  So we usually like to operational income.  We call it operational revenue.  You can see the effects of this on our budgetary process because of that revenue.  So I thought it was important to show that and reflect that to you.  This next slide is going to take that very bottom line and carry it forward to this next page.  You can see here going down the revenue minus capital projects.  We had some significant capital projects this year that we're working on.  We're really deferring these and holding back on these.  There's some that are critical that need and have been requested to go forward.  You can see the transfers in.  We've just talked about that through the five-year projection.  And then the emergency reserve,  as I've mentioned,  and the other things that I've also shared.  So to highlight the bottom line is this year we still anticipate to end the year with a positive fund balance.  We carry that over to the next year and we're still anticipating a positive fund balance.  You may recall last time we met back in May,  I shared that we were hoping for a target of $1.5 million,  and we're coming back with $3.1 million.  Again, from the finance stand,  that gives me some comfort in that we're not burning everything.  We still have our emergency reserve established.  Those dollars are still there.  This is just in the general fund operating type reserve.  This next slide I've added,  and I apologize it's not in the copy that you had because I just added it today because I was thinking about it and thought this would be beneficial.  So you see,  on the far right,  you see that bottom line,  $3.1 million.  The budget that you have before you,  we have kept in there the positions that the city manager has frozen.  Okay?  So if those positions are not filled over the next 12 months,  there would be an additional $1.8 million in savings.  Okay?  So that even gives us more of a cushion.  So we're up to about almost $5 million.  That again gives me greater comfort to help me sleep through the night.  Again,  am I happy with everything in this budget?  No.  And I know the city manager is not happy,  but we're trying to do the best that we can to navigate through this.  So I thought it was important to share that with you.  The last item that I want to share and talk about that I think is important,  and then I'll yield the floor to any particular questions you may have.  At our last finance committee meeting,  staff presented an updated investment policy.  Our last investment policy was updated in 2008,  and we've utilized that.  We've,  uh,  especially over the last few years,  if you've seen our cash position has increased.  And what we're finding is we want to have every avenue available to us.  So we've reached out to comply with California Government Code.  And this policy that we're presenting is included in your document here tonight.  It's in,  uh,  PDF.  I think it's all the way towards like 312 or something like that,  320,  towards the very end of your documents.  This proposal updates that budget,  or updates that policy,  brings us into compliance,  but then gives us some options of new investments.  So let me highlight those new investments because,  um,  I want you to be aware of it.  We're not pulling off and going,  Hey,  let's dive into crazy town.  We are very conservative,  uh,  with where we're at.  But on the flip side,  if we can maximize our returns legally and safely,  we want to do that.  There's three main areas that have changed,  uh,  and updated.  And by the way,  as we presented this to the finance committee,  they approved three zero to bring it forward in this budget.  So number one is we can,  we,  under this new policy,  we would be able to invest in municipal,  municipal obligations from other states.  So if the state of Nevada issued bonds,  we could invest in those.  Okay.  The other area is corporate commercial paper and medium term corporate notes.  These are instruments that large corporations will issue,  uh,  corporate commercial paper are short term.  They're usually under 272 days,  I think is where it's at.  And you can get a return of dollars,  uh,  in that with investing with them.  Medium term are up to five years.  So five year notes,  there's criteria for,  uh,  reviewing those,  uh,  with risk factors and everything.  We,  the document declares we're,  we're going to follow,  uh,  very stringent,  low risk areas in that way.  Um,  but as you know,  interest rates right now are going like this and hopefully they go up.  I like that.  I like your optimism.  I love that.  But,  uh,  in the short term,  we may have some opportunities along this line.  The last one I want to share with you is a new term for some of us,  Supra nationals.  And I apologize again.  I,  I created another slide here because I wanted to dive into this one because this one is,  is new to us.  So Supra,  uh,  nationals are institutions are those owned by or established by governments of two or more.  Countries.  Okay.  There's primarily three organizations that are considered super naturalist and they issue them.  One of them is the international bank for reconstruction development,  commonly called the world bank.  The United States as a whole has a 17% ownership in that organization.  International finance corporation is another one.  22% us inter America development.  Bank,  uh,  30%.  These are actually,  um,  they're,  they're basically these institutions may issue bonds or they may issue some kind of debt or we're,  we're able to invest in those,  uh,  terminologies under five years.  State of California has allowed these to go forward.  In fact,  uh,  during our discussion at the finance committee level,  we had our,  uh,  investor broker on the line,  explaining these in greater detail.  And he shared that in some cases,  these are higher rated with lower risks than us treasuries.  Okay.  Hard to believe us treasuries.  And he said that's under the S and P.  And so he's,  he sent me a list today,  uh,  on some of these S and P for us.  These organizations are usually triple a rated,  uh,  S and P for us treasuries today,  a double a plus rated.  So again,  this is an opportunity to,  uh,  expand and have options there.  We're not looking to dive into anything crazy,  but we're coming to you to see if you would authorize that as part of this budget.  So that concludes my formal comments.  I'm available for any questions that you may have.  Our directors are here,  uh,  for any particular questions that you may have on their budgets.  And so with that,  okay,  questions,  run.  Uh,  thank you,  Mr. Dowell.  Uh,  and,  and thank you to your staff for having to go through this several times and,  uh,  and,  and even more pressure on you to,  to make adjustments towards this,  uh,  uh,  last July 1st,  uh,  deadline.  Um,  I,  I too had questions about the super nationals because I'd never,  uh,  experienced that.  Of course,  I'm a financial planner,  so this is,  this,  uh,  uh,  ran,  uh,  uh,  rank and file for me.  Uh,  but,  uh,  the super nationals was an interesting one and,  and I'm,  I'm suspicious of that,  uh,  investment performance given its risk,  uh,  uh,  return because internationally things,  when you call 911,  they don't necessarily show up.  So it's a,  a greater challenge.  I,  I'm wondering if you've given some thought to,  um,  what the community has been,  been clamoring for as of late,  which is,  um,  some changes in,  in budget design.  And I know that's not,  uh,  a question for,  for your department,  but rather,  um,  how that,  how you might juggle that if,  if that was something that the community was throwing your way.  So,  I'll,  I'll yield that one order.  Thank you.  And I understand why.  Thanks.  I didn't mean to put you on the spot.  Sure.  I mean,  one,  one of the things that,  that we are driven by is the purse strings and,  and the city council controls the purse strings.  Uh,  from a staff perspective,  what we're doing is our best to bring back a recommended budget,  uh,  so that we can ensure essential operations of all the departments of the city.  Um,  if there are modifications that you're bearing witness to from a public perspective,  we definitely want to know about it.  If there's an interest in the city council in seeing us bring those back,  whether it's in this or when we go into the deeper dive in October,  that'll at least allow us to prepare for October to come back with some answers to questions that you might have.  We're definitely,  uh,  open to hearing those.  We want,  we want to understand those.  So it's a good question.  We're seeing a lot of those emails too.  Yeah.  definitely something if the city council is interested in evaluating any of those,  then definitely let us know.  So when we come back,  we can,  we can have some answers to those questions.  Because the questions that we are going to get immediately after this meeting is you've got $1.8 million in a,  in a hiring freeze or staffing freeze and $1.8 million would go a long way to healing some of the wounds in gosh,  the three or four,  um,  issues and concerns that this community is most concerned about at this immediate moment.  Understood.  And I just want to highlight what I feel like I'm echoey.  Um,  I just want to highlight the fact that in some of those,  those hiring freezes,  I don't expect I'm going to be able to hold the line on some of those.  So just so you know,  throughout the entire year,  I'm holding tight as long as I can,  which is why you're hanging on to them is exactly.  And so just realize,  I mean,  one,  for example,  are the dispatcher positions.  If we know that some dispatchers are going to be retiring or going to other agencies,  which we do,  I believe,  think that some will be,  um,  we need to make sure and operationalize,  get those being filled while we know those other ones are going.  So there's this balancing act.  So we're trying to ensure there is a,  a vacancy,  but sometimes there's gonna be a little overlap.  So for whatever that's worth.  So hiring chill rather than freeze.  There's a freeze,  but there's a little bit of a chill on the edge.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Speaking of chill,  it's awful cold in here.  Can we take a break and get jackets?  I'm in it.  I don't know if anyone else is shivering.  Can we take a break when we're finished with this item?  Well,  yeah.  Okay.  I was pleading for somebody to turn it down.  Um,  I have some general comments or questions,  but the one I,  I,  that's the overall budget is,  um,  I prefer seeing come back late September,  but I,  I want a date specific,  uh,  October.  I mean,  I hope we're at least can say the first meeting in October.  That's,  that's what we're going for is the first meeting in October.  We just want to make sure we have the sales tax numbers.  Accurate from that quarter.  So yeah.  So first meeting in October.  Great.  Thank you.  You bet.  Um,  and I think that when we bring back the budget,  we have a,  a fuller,  uh,  presentation so that we can understand where,  um,  all these allocations are coming from and going,  um,  and where,  and maybe we'll have a better understanding of,  uh,  funding that may be coming to this community.  Um,  I think that's what I'm following up on that.  I think that's what I'm following up on that I think that's what I'm  following up on that I think that's what I'm following up on that I think that's  what I'm following up on that I think that's what I'm following up on that I think  that's what I'm following up on that I think that's what I'm following up on that  I think that's what I'm following up on that I think that's what I'm following up  on that I think that's what I'm following up on that I think that's what I'm  following up on that I think that's what I'm following up on that I think that's  what I'm following up on that I think that's what I'm following up on that I  think that's what I'm following up on that I think that's what I'm following up  going for. Because one of the things that I bore witness to, and I know that a number of you have  been here the same number of years I have, there's at least three of you who have, and the rest of  you who have been here long enough, we've scraped by year after year. There hasn't been any secret  treasure chests in any department, and I've unfortunately had to bear witness to that year  in and year out. So to be able to have that clarity, I mean, going through a budget with 200 funds  isn't easy for the average citizen. And so to understand those complexities, we're happy to  walk you through that. Every two years, we have that publicly open Budget 101, and so I think  that's beneficial to those members of the public that can attend that. Well, hopefully we can do a  similar version to that, maybe at that first meeting in October, really take the time necessary  to do the deep dive for everybody. One of the items in the presentation that I'm concerned of  is the  the !  reduction in the capital projects budget, because, well, capital projects are funded primarily  from other sources, state, federal dollars that come to the city of Chico, and we provide some  type of match to that. So it's just a fraction of what we are spending for that capital project.  So the concerns that I have with that,  are,  number one jobs.  Those construction projects, capital projects provide high paying living wage jobs that are essential for our community  in the economic development of it. And those capital projects are important for us as we are moving forward in our housing projects and and  and those types of projects.  So what is the impact of cutting that budget,  and why do we have to cut it so much?  I've got good news for you.  Okay.  They're not the capital projects that you're thinking.  We have the terminology.  We use general fund capital projects  and then non-general fund capital projects.  So it's not those capital projects.  For the Brendan Otto Boney projects,  this is just the general fund that we're highlighting in there  that we're cutting back on.  So just for that level of reassurance,  Scott, if you want to add to that, feel free.  But I have the same concern when we use that terminology,  but it's a little confusing.  It's not those types of capital projects.  Okay.  So, yes.  And I know this is a serious subject,  but I just wanted to know, will there be pie in October?  Okay.  Other comments?  Are we going to go through different departments,  or is this the time if we want to suggest changes?  I think this is...  We would love to hear if there's any modifications.  So you've got a two-fold thing going on here.  The first fold is we're going to come back  with a final proposed budget in two weeks.  If there's modifications you'd like to see  to this rollover budget in order to be modified for that  in two weeks, yeah, we definitely need to know tonight.  More than that, though, what I'm hoping for is  if there's some changes that you would like us to evaluate  for October, please let us know.  Because that gets us to the end of the day.  That gives us adequate time for me to be able to work  with each department to say, hey, look,  you know, council was talking about this.  Let's work through this, see what that might look like.  That would be very beneficial as well.  So as long as that clarity's there,  then I would love to be able to hear what you have to say.  So my memory is that last year it required a $300,000,  maybe it's less, transfer from the solid waste franchise fee  in order to pay for public safety for police officers.  So I'm hoping to see what's the status in this budget.  Scott, if you want to come up and help with that.  It's, I believe, well, I'll let him speak to that,  but it's still there, so.  It's still there.  So that's how we're, so we receive those revenues,  we retain, so we receive all that franchise revenue  in the general fund, and then we retain that portion in there  to cover that, and then the rest goes into the 904 fund.  So you're correct.  Thank you.  It's still there.  Thank you.  My comment on it is I said last year that I wouldn't,  that's not an ongoing strategy that I can support,  that we're stealing from the infrastructure fund  in order to pay for another important function,  and we need to address that.  And if the way we're addressing it is changing council policy  and saying we're going to use franchise fees for public safety,  I mean, I guess that's a majority vote,  but I'd like to see alternatives to that.  I don't think that's going to be an ongoing strategy.  I don't think that's going to be an ongoing strategy.  I don't think that's going to be an ongoing strategy  might have other ideas too. I'd like to see the streets around Hooker Oak School, Arbutus and 3rd Avenue, that are old county roads with poor drainage be included in our planning.  If nothing else, in the schedule, perhaps engineering, whatever, but I'd like to see whether or not the council, and there may be other school sites that would benefit from a focus.  I know there is a more traditional program of safe routes to schools, but to me that's our version of it, that we start looking at neighborhood improvements.  And then,  similar to that, I consider it a school. I've been embarrassed by the North Campus area for years. I mean, it's a ghetto.  1st Avenue, Machuptah, Rancheria, North Cedar, those are old county roads and, you know, the front door of the university.  And I would like to see if there, perhaps I'm just not seeing it, if there's a comprehensive way to, you know, it's a classic example.  If we  have public dollars into that area, I think we could have social benefits as well as other quality of life improvements.  So those are two areas that I'd like to see at least some progress on or acknowledgement on.  Thank you.  I'd be cautious of the ghetto language, but I would concur with that particular section of neighborhood as well as the southern section of that district, District 5.  I've been pretty adamant about fixing that safe routes discussion.  I think that's one way that I would agree with thatahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah  Other comments?  Yeah, I have a couple comments, especially as we're looking into the fall to having these continued discussions.  You know, as we're talking about the potential of expanding training for staff and for particularly for law enforcement professionals,  I just would like to see a breakdown of kind of what it would take over the next two years to get us to, from my end, a pretty specific goal,  which is to have all of our officers trained in 40-hour crisis intervention and de-escalation.  I know that it'll take a little time to kind of figure that out, so I would just appreciate an analysis of that so that we can look ahead and see how we can implement it.  Thank you.  Okay, so how many, any other comments before we read the?  Public comments?  Sure.  I think it's important to make note of what's happening in the community and expectations that if not now, towards October,  this council has not approved moving a community review board or something along those lines,  but that's definitely something that I would like to see, if not an immediate budget.  And I have no idea what the expenditures on that staff would know much better.  I don't know if that's something that can be done to establish pretty quickly, assuming that it's the desire of council,  which we don't even have at that point.  But there is.  My initial question was, there are some contingencies and some concerns that we should have on the forefront,  either up front or expected in October, that I think this council may be asking for.  The extent of those, I don't know.  I have some in my mind.  But I think this community is clamoring for action, and so staff and council should be prepared to take some action.  Appreciate that.  So can you be more specific?  No, I can't, right?  Because I have no idea what this council is going to approve.  I don't know what council is deciding.  The community is clamoring for something.  I've got over 1,000 emails from people calling for all kinds of things.  So I don't know.  It depends on what council is in power.  I have one email 1,000 times, but I have 1,000 other emails saying the other thing.  I had, you know what, I have no idea because I don't know what you're going to want.  All right.  Well, let's go to public comment.  How many comments did we receive?  On the Engage Chico platform?  On this item for the budget, I have just six items for Engage.  Really?  Because in our Engage, it looks like I've got six, seven pages.  Wait.  So the other item that has all of five has 83.  Five points.  is 5.2 and I can check in that copy.  Let me see. I'm directly in the system to see if  there were any new updates.  Oh, I see. I'm sorry. It's 5.1.  Three comments. You're right. And then the following page  is for 5.2. Okay. So we've got  So I have six. Six. Okay. And how many emails  did we receive?  Okay. So let's take about three minutes  to review them as you read the names for us. Okay.  There were easily  I filtered through. I had 1,000, 1-0-5-5  brand new emails that said something along the lines of  defund this and specific code words mentioning budget materials. There were a lot of emails mentioning budget materials.  I will take direction from counsel on how many  how much time you need to review them.  The reason that I didn't bring up  the large number of emails that came in for either  defunding  budget related items  is because those went directly to the council  and yes, we have it in the public record, but  for Engage Chico, that is  specifically tied to this agenda.  So we'll put all those emails over here.  And then public comments is during the meeting.  And that's the difference.  So what you're saying is we received 17 or whatever it was  during the meeting about this item?  Correct.  And then I had received six.  Danny had received that number.  And then obviously in the past few days and even last week,  we've received a lot of emails.  My comment was I don't know how to sift through these  and figure out which 17 you're describing, but I'll do my best.  Okay.  So the ones that are addressed to public comments will be falling in your mailbox.  Thank you.  I apologize.  So how much time would council like?  I had suggested three minutes.  Yeah.  I've already gone through them.  Sure.  Okay.  We'll start with three minutes.  And if we need additional time, we will do that.  So the six individuals speaking through the engaged platform was Mayor Lipman,  Bryce Corrin, Karen Henderson, Mary Kay Benson, Jessica Giannola, and Lincoln Bone.  And in public comment, we have two members.  Sarah Anderson, Anna Wester, Devon Dilley, Mary Evans, Debbie Zinger, Matt Dutton, Ryan Schwab,  Mary Page, Blake Ellis, Joe McKinnon, Jessica Giannola, Brogan Cotton, Nancy Ogle, Jack Lee, Amber Holger, Mike Perlman, Lou Brown, and Joe Green.  So we'll start with three minutes.  Okay.  So the first question is, what do you think about the  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Has counsel had enough time to review?  So are we being asked to approve the preliminary or proposed budget?  And what is the term that we need to use?  Sure.  I appreciate that.  If you wouldn't mind, I would just like to kind of recap what I've heard.  To make sure I got it correct.  And also to bring clarity on one of those items as well.  So what I've heard from council members is that you want staff to come back in October, I hope, on a number of items.  One is with regard to the refuse franchise fees paid to PD, the transfer of dollars, to see what other options might exist to be able to modify that.  The clarity I wanted to bring to that is pursuant to your budget policies, that ends in two years, that transfer.  So what it looks like there maybe is a discussion of, or at least a consideration to look at, is can we do it earlier?  So there's that one.  There's also a review of streets and kind of how our process is with regard to localized roads and streets,  hooker oak, arbutus, some neighborhood improvements, north campus area, Rosedale, and things of that nature.  So we'll have Brendan and Eric kind of tag team on how that is working.  And we'll do that in October as well.  And then also training for staff.  So we're really looking at it holistically of how can you get all officers trained over a two-year period, what that might look like,  what are the costs associated with that.  And so we'll bring that back in October as well.  And then just a heads up on council maybe looking at other things that you just gave us a heads up on that are still yet to be defined,  but there's a lot of public who's discussing that right now.  And so with that, we'd be requesting that council approve the proposed or the preliminary budget resolution,  for the preliminary budget.  And then we'll come back for the final budget resolution in two weeks.  But right now we're just asking for the proposed budget.  I would like to add one more thing for consideration in October.  The homeless services coordinator position, I believe, is only funded through October.  I actually changed that.  It was originally proposed through that time period, August.  And I went ahead and changed it.  And I had, coming to the last two months of meetings,  I've heard council really give a sincere interest in seeing that.  And so I've asked, I asked them to put it in my budget for the full year's worth of funding.  So that's already in there in the proposed budget.  Okay.  Well then, I appreciate that you have done that.  I'm trying to be insightful sometimes on those types of issues.  Yes.  Thank you.  I think that's an investment in our community that we can't go without.  Thank you.  Any other questions?  Any additional additions?  I would move to approve the preliminary rollover budget with a couple comments.  A, and I met with the skipper after reading it the first time, a little concerned that there weren't more cuts.  And then I saw how much it could have been.  And I think I speak for all of us.  I remember eight years ago when Randall and I first came on council and what the budget looked like.  And there was some rollover at the top.  And I remember when Mr. Constantine came in and the work of Scott Dowell and the team that they've put together.  And I really do appreciate how much the staff continues to give credit to the council.  Oh, you guys have been so good with your physical policy.  Whatever.  We're only as good as the information that you give us.  And you guys live it every day.  So any other city run almost any other way would be in a really, really bad, I think I've mentioned a few times, financial Armageddon.  And that's what we'd be faced with.  But given the fact we continue to put the money away, we didn't do a bunch of one-time spending, I hope we can weather the storm rather well.  But there's just no doubt in my mind without, I'm not going to name everybody, but certainly the department heads, the skipper, assistant city manager, and then Scott.  Without your leadership, we wouldn't be here today.  This would be a much different discussion.  Other cities that have gone through the campfire and then the COVID and then having the university shut down.  For all intents and purposes, would not be sitting here going, gosh, can we fix these roads?  Can we get more training for the police department?  Can we do some of these other things?  Because it wouldn't even be an option.  It's an option because you're that professional.  You care that much about the community.  You do it without, frankly, being compensated like you could a few other places.  So for me, thank you sincerely for making how we're moving ahead possible.  And now you're having to do twice the work.  Because you've got to do twice the work.  And I know that's not fun for anybody.  I know if the chamber were full, the people that actually can do the math would be very appreciative of all the work that you've done.  So I'll make that motion.  And thank you.  And I'll second it.  I appreciate all that the finance staff and every one of these departments has done to tighten the belt.  And I want the public to understand.  These were dual federal disaster events.  I don't want to create more than one problem.  million dollars in the bank, or excuse me, 2%, much more than that in the bank, much, much more  than that, 2.1 million dollars ahead of what we budgeted tells you just how conservative we've  been over the eight years that I've been on this council. And Sean's right, Council Member Morgan's  right. When we first came in these doors, there were grand jury reports about staff not reporting  financial details to council members and not being able to steer the ship correctly. And that  has not been the case. I'm looking at Mr. Dowell, but the entire city staff really deserve  the gold star for the entire state because it's impressive. When I hear of other communities'  financial difficulties, when I'm talking with League of California Cities member cities,  we really do an incredible job here. And for everyone that knows what this community has  been through, the region has been through, when they learn we had 2.1 million dollars  over the last year, we've been able to do a lot of work. And I think that's a great thing.  That's astounding. And when they have a difficult time making those numbers in perfectly rosy  times, and so we're doing an extraordinary job, and that's the reason why we can get away  with what we can come October when things really have to start tightening the belt.  So thank you. And as a second of that motion. Council Member Reynolds has a comment.  I just heard a comment that I wanted to bring up a couple of things that I definitely  again echo everything that was said by my predecessors and the appreciation of  all the work that's been done by staff. Seeing the revenue increase needed for  22 and 23 it sounds like there's some good work ahead of us that we need to do  in economic development and focusing our city efforts towards really looking how  we can grow things coming into that 22-23. I want to give a shout out to  Assemblyman Gallagher and Senator Nielsen. That three million dollars that  we got is really coming in handy in a nice little cushion right now with  everything that we got going on. And then just as far as you know the thousands of  emails we've been having and that we've all read and we've all seen. Just a quick  reminder that we're at 89 officers right now and the last time we were at that  was 2004 which was 16 years ago. We had 81,000 people approximately in Chico  then and we had about a hundred thousand people in Chico. And we had about a hundred  thousand and we have 98,000 now. So I don't feel like we're way over going and I think the  first 20 positions to be put on freeze were all from our you know police  department. So I think the community would be happy to see that we're not  about the same as we were 16 years ago. So thank you staff for all your hard  work and look forward to reviewing some of that stuff in October.  And when I was reading the the many emails that we received one thing  that I kept reflecting on was the desire of this community to see social change  rather than social services. And we've I've talked about this before and I have  an analogy of where we provide help for a situation. And you can imagine a river  flowing along.  People trapped in it because there are problems and it goes over a cliff. There  are some people who feel comfortable serving the people who have dropped off  the cliff. But that is or that could be a solution. That is a solution. You're  providing services to those people who are down on the bottom. However and that  then that is the traditional model.  However if we invest in services at the top of the cliffs before people fall off  we can have some real systemic change. We're caught in a situation where we have  to transition to that if that is what our desire is. And we need assistance  from our state and federal partners in this government because traditionally  people are not going to be able to get to the top of the cliff. So we need to  start building that way.  I think that's an important thing that I think that's important that I think that  I think that's important that I think that I think that I think that I think that  I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that  I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that  I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that !  I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that  businesses, unemployment business benefits, and we needed that.  We definitely needed it because it was a crisis.  But we're experiencing that crisis as a community,  and a community bigger than Chico, a community of our nation,  where we need help fixing things at a social change level.  So as we move forward, we need to work with our federal and state partners  so that we can have that systemic change that we need,  so we're not reacting and we're going forward.  I wanted community members to know that I really took to heart  and I'm very grateful to the community for their support.  Their emails and their asks of us as their directly accessible community leaders,  but that understanding that we need to reach beyond the municipalities.  Any other comments before we take a vote?  Okay, we're ready for the vote.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ory?  Yes.  Abstain.  Council Member Reynolds?  Yes.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one abstention.  Had a request for another break, so let's take 10 minutes.  Restahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah  Thank you.  Thank you.  Call our meeting back to order.  Next on the agenda is 5.2,  ordinance adding chapter 3.90 to establish a one-cent sales tax.  Report from Chris Constantine, assistant city manager.  Good evening, council.  Thank you.  In November 2018,  the council approved the finance committee recommendation to engage a  consulting firm,  to conduct a survey of the voters on their,  on the feasibility of bringing forward a tax.  In April, 2019,  the council heard the presentation from our consultants,  EMC research,  who are experts in this field and gave direction to proceed going out to  the community and assessing a one cent sales tax measure.  We did so in September of 2019 and EMC research came forward in  August,  October of 2019 to present the results.  And the results showed a very strong support for a general sales tax measure  that equaled approximately two thirds votes with the margin of error being  just above and just below the passage threshold of two thirds.  So for a general sales tax,  very solidly support in our community to pass that tax.  You clearly know times have changed since that time.  Card went forward with their tax measure at the beginning of the pandemic as it was hitting the United States.  They had tweaked their measure from what they went to the voters with.  So making their survey invalid at that time,  but also the addition of the pandemic added another variable which wasn't in play when that survey was actually conducted similar to ours.  And their measure passed,  failed,  I'm sorry,  the two thirds measure threshold that they had passed.  had proceeded with. In terms of our city, in any city we're not a money-making  organization. We're a service organization. We provide a product, a  service. We spend money, we spend the tax dollars earned and generated by  hard-working residents of our community and those who visit our community and  decide to spend their tax dollars and with assets such as Chico State, the  percentage of people on the outside that come in and infuse economic dollars  is larger than it would be in a community that doesn't have an asset  such as that. And so when we evaluate a government's ability to provide service,  we focus on its revenue capacity. And revenue capacity to create a measure  that's comparable against different jurisdictions, we look at revenue  capacity per capita. In this case a number we can measure being the number  of residents,  in a community. Understanding that when you take that measure, you're also, you're  not taking into account that if you're a high visited tourist area, there's  revenue coming in from non-residents, but when you do a revenue capacity number,  that community, let's say Napa, will have a far higher dollar revenue generated  for each number of residents that they have in their community. And so we wanted  to take a look at what was our revenue  capacity and how does it compare to others. Sales tax is our largest revenue  source that we rely upon for general services in the city. So we looked at all  482 cities and found that only 38 cities in total had the 7.25% sales tax rate,  which is the lowest California sales tax rate there is. With only eight of those  cities being populations greater than 50,000, of which Chico is one.  And being mindful of those eight, only one city, the city of Chico, doesn't receive its  full 1% increment of sales tax. So at the 7.25% sales tax, the city will receive, the  city's typically only receive one. So if you spend $100 in a community, $1 goes to the  local jurisdiction, unless it's an agency that's entered into an agreement with the  county to split and share that percentage differently in that city. So that's the  generated in the community. And that's something that Butte County did do. So we  received 95 cents, not the dollar, on every $100 spent in our community. And  then looking at that revenue capacity, so now we have these eight cities that are  at the lowest sales tax rate, which would imply the lowest revenue capacity  generation, we have to ask ourselves in terms of what capacity do we have to provide  service. And the service, when you're looking at the general fund or your governmental funds, that is the most predominant, but the  cost is way more than that cost. That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  That cost is way more than that cost.  services like parks and a variety of others as that has evolved over the last seven years.  And so we looked at public safety expenditures as a percent of the general fund and ranked  order those eight cities to determine how much of a priority has this community, Chico,  put on public safety.  And in ranked order, you can see on page six of the staff report, out of the eight city  at the lowest sales tax rate, I'm sorry, I know there's a distraction.  If you want me to stop, I can stop.  Of the cities that generate the lowest sales tax rate, of which it's a large revenue of  ours, and of all cities greater than 50,000, there is no other city in the entire state  that has spent more of its available revenue capacity on public safety than Chico.  So I think we need to make clear that we have made it a priority.  And I think it's also clear, and what you've heard over the number of years, is of a demand  and desire for even more.  Even broadening that definition of public safety, we need more.  But if we're a city that now, when comparing our capacity of revenue, which is the driver  of our services, are now a city that is highlighted and given the largest percentage of their  available resources to public safety, there is a demand for still more, the question then  becomes, how do we do that?  How do we provide that?  And how do we provide the remaining services at the level that the public and the council  desires?  We take a then look later in page six, as a comparison of a couple other cities.  Redding comes to mind.  And when I look at a revenue capacity of Redding of $801, and the city of Chico at $659 before  the campfire, and $546 after the campfire, very clearly, anybody who's been to Redding,  anybody looking at that sees a massive difference between us and Redding in terms of their general  fund and governmental funds revenue capacity.  But if I ask myself, the cost differentials between here and Redding are non-material.  A police officer here costs similarly to his police officer in Redding.  The construction cost is similar to Redding.  The streets and the standards they use are similar here as they are to Redding.  So you look at that and you go, what is happening that there's such a massive difference?  Right?  Between us and Redding.  It means that Redding has far more resources to provide the services they want to provide.  And I would venture to guess if I ranked what's a better community, Chico or Redding, I'm  sorry, Redding, Chico is.  And we want Chico not only to stay better, but to do the best in the North State.  And so what you're left with is what level of service do you want and what revenue is  needed to support that?  A couple of years ago, the city manager created.  A comprehensive staffing plan of each department and the services that were deemed priorities  and desires.  The council has spoken very clearly about what those desires are.  So each department head was requested to present what those items were that they absolutely  need to accomplish those goals.  And we estimated the cost associated with that.  And we came up with a number of far greater than $20 million a year.  Just the roadways alone at the time we did the assessment was over $380 million.  Today that number is over $400 million.  Today, on the item before this, public infrastructure came up as priorities.  And we are being asked to come back to you with how we prioritize and how do we provide  these services.  And our staff, who is professional and wants to accomplish the goals the council desires  and what the community needs, will do so.  But a sales tax measure, any tax measure, a sewer increase, a development impact fee  increase, any change in revenue that means another dollar is coming out of a resident  of this community garners a phenomenal amount of positive, negative, more negative feelings  in our community.  When we did the development impact fee review, where we were asking developers to pay 100%  of the impacts of this.  And if their developments are causing developments that adds to our community's vitality and  economic development, but also create additional costs, we did not ask for 100%.  And we subsidized that to the extent of 10%.  And doing that, and in that analysis, we also looked at county roadways, which is something  that the council spoke to on the previous item of the budget about what are we gonna  do about county roads and infrastructure and bringing it up to a standard that you're not  walking through puddles or they're not up to speed.  a terrible condition or we're not creating a hazard around our schools.  Well, in that development impact fee study, there was an urbanization fee presented that  was intended to upgrade county roads brought into the city to city standards.  We didn't approve them.  And what we made very clear in the finance committee with regards to removing that, the  road, the Cusick Road north of east has come up as a complaint numerous times directly  to the city, directly to city staff, and will continue to be an item that will be a thorn  in our side.  And that's not even the worst street in the city that's counting.  And we made very clear it was black and white.  By removing this urbanization fee, we are guaranteeing that we will not be upgrading  that roadway.  But I can also guarantee that the day will come that either a member of the council,  the council, the whole of the community will come forward and say, you must do something  about that road.  And so our obligation as public administrators is to advise you and provide you information.  And we need to do so not like our predecessors who didn't give you what you needed to know  about what decision and implications that decision would have.  And then you had to live with the results.  And then we pointed to the administration of the past to say, it's their fault for not  telling us creating the situation.  We didn't when it came to the urbanization fee.  We made it very clear.  Your county roads will stay county roads in crappy condition.  Because we chose not to do what we needed to do to accomplish that.  And what we're left with is to reduce services somewhere else to be able to accomplish that  goal.  And we'll trade it off.  And we've been doing those tradeoffs for the last seven years.  The last tradeoff that we did that was of significance came up in the last agenda item  also.  It was the gas tax.  The gas tax, I'm sorry, it was the franchise fee.  The franchise fee was passed.  And.  And the gas tax was conveyed as resources that would go to address the impacts caused by garbage  trucks on our roadways.  And the council committed to for five years put that towards streets and that infrastructure.  And a year later, we committed $300,000 to cover half the cost of a specialized unit in the police department,  which is an absolute priority.  It is.  But the question before us when we made that decision was a question of tradeoffs.  Public infrastructure, public safety.  And now we're tearing ourselves about what we're going to fund.  On the public infrastructure side, every day that goes by, the cost of replacing a linear foot of roadway goes up.  So to the taxpayers, it's a worse deal every year we wait to do that improvement.  On public safety, every year that goes by that we don't adequately staff, perform, operate.  Is a quality of life condition in our city that gets worse.  And that's a whole heck of a difficult decision for us as policymakers to make.  For us as administrators, we just convey that information to you and present and allow you to make that policy decision.  So the city manager and I are not going to tell you this is the policy we think you should do when it comes to the sales tax.  We understand how device it is.  We understand that in the business community, we have to be able to do that.  The organization of the chamber desires a special tax focused on public safety and infrastructure to avoid the council having the ability to spend it anywhere else.  We understand others in our community want the taxes to provide enhancement in other services, whether it be parks or social services or dealing with the homeless situation.  All of which have a nexus to public safety one way or another, but that's just a different category of services that they want to provide.  And we know we have an administration that has worked on that.  We have an administration that has worked tirelessly over the last seven years.  And I want to thank Councilmember Sean Morgan and the rest of the council members who recognize that work over the last seven years.  That seemed to have done miracles in the time of a city that should have been going bankrupt in 2013 and didn't.  Who was eighth worst financial condition in the state that we no longer are.  We are now above 50th and we continue to climb.  Who, unlike other cities, have drastic turnover.  We don't.  Where the council has asked a phenomenally wide ranging demands and requirements and quite honestly I've got to tell you it's destroying us at times.  And I'll give you personal evidence myself.  It's destroyed my family.  I am no longer married because of what this city has done for me.  But I know it's for the greater good of this community and I'll continue serving as so.  So I tell you this, that while you see an organization that's done phenomenally well.  It is an organization that is broken.  In ways that the community sees certain aspects, you see different ones.  And the staff who live it day to day see even a third dimension to that.  And it's so significant and pervasive that there are no more rabbits to pull out of the hat.  It's a guarantee.  There is actions we can take.  The concern that comes up the most I hear is pensions.  We don't want a dollar going to pensions of the sales tax.  There's solutions to that.  We can mortgage the future and make future generations pay for it.  So that when no longer we have any retirees benefiting from it.  Our community will still be paying for it and our services won't have that type of resource.  They'll still be going to a debt obligation for pensions.  And so what it comes down to, what we have before you is really a question.  The level of services that we've asked for that we want.  Do you want that level of service?  And do you want to pay for it?  And the question before the council today is do you want to ask that question of the public and let them say yes or no?  Or do you want to take the action or not take the action to ask the public and by default create the situation that in the next two and three and four years the cuts that need to occur to balance the budget the way we've done the last seven years are put into place.  And I can tell you those cuts will be massive cuts to public safety.  Massive cuts to parks if not the elimination of any kind of service we offer in the parks.  A complete degradation of our roadway.  An evisceration of the administrative functions that provide the base foundation for those services.  And then the secondary and tertiary effects I can't even predict what that means for our community and how we recover for it.  That's what I see as one of your staff persons there.  Thank you.  And I'm speaking now not as the assistant city manager I'm speaking as the city auditor who you've appointed to look at fraud waste and abuse and efficiency and effectiveness in your organization.  And so this is a big question.  It's very emotional.  And the question we asked before you was do you want the public to have a chance to vote on the impacts that they're going to have?  Or do we feel that there is enough information that's been given to you from the community to decide?  we already know they don't want that and that we should start preparing for those impacts  over the course of the next two to three years in which case we as professionals will do so  we'll do so saving the highest priority services the the least amount of those cuts as possible  but we'll do it in a way that still can provide some stimulus of service to the community  and so with that I'll turn it over to the city manager and I do apologize for being emotional  on this matter but it's been a two-year saga working and hearing the needs demands concerns  the anger and vitriol that comes with a tax measure and we're now finally at the end to  decide which direction we want to go so thank you thanks Chris and I know that I know that  you are an amazing asset to the city you've done a tremendous job so I just thank you for that  so really just comes down to that question council you asked us to go out and hold  a meeting and I'm not going to do that I'm going to do it in a way that's going to be  community community gave us an answer they are interested in seeing something come forward  and it's really a question as to not necessarily if you agree or disagree with the tax it's a  question of whether or not you want to allow the community to be able to vote on it and so this is  that step and then we'll be coming back to get further direction in July so with that the floor  is open questions comments  I have  you  several comments but I just  I would say that it isn't just putting something in front of the voters it's putting a measure in front of the voters that we have confidence will pass I'm not interested in  band aids I'm not interested in symbolic measures and if that's the direction the council wants to go I won't support it but I think we have a very narrow window for bipartisan support in the  way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way  City Manager Orem, I think that says a lot that we are at that point that if we want to struggle  through the next year or two. And the other last thing I would do, and I think I interrupted you,  excuse me, is that I don't, I'm not as optimistic of the recovery that we see in the five-year plan.  The five-year plan we saw a year ago when we finally hit the recession, we bottomed out.  And it took a while to come back. I'm not sure why this recession would be any different.  If anything, it could be worse. So those are my beginning on this. But I do think that we need to  tonight come up with a consensus that five of us, or really seven of us, can agree on.  And Scott? So we're talking about a general rather than a special, which is 51% versus 67%  What mechanisms are used in communities to provide the greatest possible oversight when you're talking about a general rather than a special?  That's always a good question. And we saw our neighbor to the north, you know, put one forward and it didn't go through.  And it's a tricky time nowadays because there's a lack of trust in the community, in the public,  with government and the public. And I think that's a good question.  And I think that's a good question. And I think that's a good question.  And I think that's a good question. And I think that's a good question.  Well, on the special tax, obviously the committee's obligation is to ensure any expenditure fits what the voters' intent was.  On the general tax, there's a fine line moving forward an item that is in substance special,  but going for a general election just invites legal intervention.  And so the diagram that you see on page eight,  the closest example, and I can't give you a city that actually has this framework because we would have to look at every city.  So the city can pass a general tax.  The city can decide under its authority and powers what budgetary approval processes occur.  And so what it would involve is deciding,  does the city want, the council want to cede some authority and power to an independent body?  That's not an emergencyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah  The council could also consider revising that and putting very stringent requirements as to how you pick a member of that committee.  It also could empower that committee that when it makes a recommendation,  and this is one approach, that the council has to vote up or down the entire package that they recommended for where that revenue goes.  And if they vote it down, pushing it back and forth until a majority of the council agrees with the package that's being brought forward.  Or those kind of measures that doesn't constrict.  It all has to be one type of category of expenditure.  It's all public police.  It's all fire that has to come forward, thereby making a general special.  So it really comes down to how you formulate this ordinance in that committee and what authority you want to grant it.  And the one that grants it broader authority, which reduces some of yours, strengthens the strength of that recommendation that comes forth.  And are those things decided before?  Or it's put on the ballot?  I believe it is right when the ordinance goes forth to them.  Because what you're seeing before, if you voted yes on what's before you today,  that action alone does not place this measure on the ballot.  It approves the framework of the tax and the framework of the oversight committee.  We would then be coming forward at the next council meeting, which it looks like would be July,  with the resolution and this ordinance together.  And that one would be...  And that one would require the five votes to put forth.  And so the goal was, if you decided to take an alternative approach, which there are some options that Mark can present to you,  you can make that change in this ordinance to be reflected when we come back forward to you.  And so if you want to strengthen the restrictions you put on the council as a whole,  and what type of expenditures this new tax goes for, now you can, if you so choose.  Okay.  Yeah, thank you.  John?  So, wait, Chris, come back.  You sold the hell out of that, by the way.  That was phenomenal, I feel for you.  And I also feel threatened and chastised, which that part I don't like.  I apologize.  I understand.  I'm attending this.  I guess my question is, why would the council abdicate its authority to a committee,  which we have the finance committee, we have the council.  Why would we...  Why would we go out and appoint some other committee to be between us and the city to decide whether we were spending the tax dollars that we asked the citizens if they wanted or not?  That's completely lost on me.  Well, I'll say it depends.  State law has ceded the authority by giving the planning commission certain requirements before it comes to the council.  Here, you would be the body establishing that.  It really comes down to, is there a policy goal you're trying to accomplish?  So if the concern...  Because the concern I've heard the most with the folks I usually interact the most, being the economic developers, the business community,  we don't want it going to pensions.  We want police, fire, and roads.  That's what we want.  So isn't the easiest way to do that require the two-thirds vote and be done with it?  The two-thirds vote becomes a very stringent restriction, but it also increases the threshold.  And because even as we polled before the pandemic, the... because even as we polled before the pandemic, what came back as a result says there's a  The...  The...  The...  The... ! !  The...  The...  isn't where you want it to be.  You can make that change with that committee.  So if I can paraphrase,  if we think that the citizens won't pass a two-thirds,  so if we want it, and I'm not saying that's what we want,  it's what I want,  public safety and roads and keep it specifically there,  but we didn't think it would pass,  but we're also not willing to go 50% plus one  because we're afraid we'll start funding all manner of things  that we might not all agree on.  We're going to split the baby and appoint a committee  and ask the citizens to trust them,  even though we appointed the committee.  Let me clarify.  The public did speak in September  when they gave you the results that showed  more than 67% would pass a general tax  with no restrictions, just as written.  Except you already said that what the public said back then,  now after the virus thing is...  The big question mark is we don't know,  we do not know what the implications of the pandemic are.  Now, later on in the agenda,  we're going to talk about the business update,  and I can provide you information about what mobility data says,  talk to you about where our hotels are versus other cities,  and where some of our biggest sales tax generators are,  which is very encouraging,  but we don't know what the sentiment of the average resident is  seeing that our unemployment rate now is 14.9%,  so 14,600 people are out of work.  We don't know.  How could we get to feel their sentiment?  We would have to go back out to a survey,  if you wanted it statistically,  or the reason I bring up the answer to your question  as to why we would cede some of your authority to another committee,  there are constituencies out there that have a desire  that may not necessarily reflect the majority of the electorate,  and a lot of the times the council acts on that.  We all do.  The business community wants to tie the council's hands,  but the general community may not.  Well, the council can decide.  We could accomplish the desire of the public,  but enhance the control through the committee change,  as opposed to a two-thirds vote,  which then puts the entire measure at risk  when we know that we are at literally the 11th hour  in terms of if we want to avoid some of the repercussions  and service changes.  This is the last election to do so.  This is the last election to do so?  Because in 2023,  we will be implementing those cuts starting in 2023,  and a tax measure passed in 2022  wouldn't take effect into the later half of 2023.  And so it's a tough one.  I mean, again, I apologize for being emotional,  but I've heard both sides of the argument incessantly for two years,  and I wanted to stand here and be objective  and provide you what I've done for the last seven years,  but when I became a public administrator,  I put my whole life into it and gave up the private sector work.  I was making much more money,  and I think for our community,  as much as many people don't like a lot of the aspects  of what we're recommending,  as I saw in 2013 with Mark and Brian,  what we could be, and we are now with what we've done,  I see where we could be with the right amount of resources.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Any additional questions?  Any questions or comments?  We have a number of community members  who have contacted us through the Engage Chico in emails.  We could take a moment to review those  and then come back to our discussion.  Let's do that.  How many Engage Chico comments did we receive?  I believe it was 83.  Okay.  And how many emails did we receive through the form?  Ms. Schwab?  Yes.  Would it be possible of the 83, do we have a,  I mean, it seemed like pretty clear reading through,  but could we get a,  do you have a tally by chance on how many were opposed  versus how many supported?  If we could get that.  I'm not saying you need to tell every single person  whether they support or not,  but just if we have a tally in general.  I don't know if you have a...  It is available in those statistics.  Okay.  If those statistics are in there.  Mayor Schwab, would you like me to just state what those are?  88% opposed.  Correct.  8% support, 2% are neutral, and 7% did not indicate.  Okay.  Okay.  So let's review the comments while you read the names.  We've got quite a few.  Let's...  Give five minutes to review,  and we'll take more if we need that.  Okay.  So in the engaged platform,  we received comments from Bryce Corrin,  Jonathan Riley,  Chelsea Scheinberger,  Sue Jeffries,  Robert Stofka,  Karen Henderson,  Amy Stolman,  Yvonne Johnson,  Betty Napolk,  Raina Borg,  Christopher Fowler,  Kathy Birdseye,  Jessica Giannola,  Jay H.,  Kevin Claiborne,  Charles Wilhite,  Lenita Federchuk,  Kelly Moakley,  Kat Malonics,  Ed Rogers,  Matt Donner,  Cindy Walker,  Brad Smith,  Jamie Damon,  Tom Dixon,  Steve LaFori,  Lee Robert,  Karen Hightower,  Larry Coleman,  Fred Ludwig,  Kim Knott,  Tina Ortega,  Michael Barr,  Amy Moore,  Megan Zimmerman,  Andy Wilhite,  Gary Fertel,  Carissa Carey,  Heidi Witzel,  Pat Murray,  John Brown,  Emma Walsman-Phillips,  Mark Owen,  Taylor Skinner,  Roxanne Eldridge,  Erica Wright,  Juanita Sumner,  Leonard Ross,  Michelle Cooper,  Margaret Hicks,  Kimberly Burke,  Maya Juliana,  Stephanie Barrett,  Ann Nielsen,  Peggy Gerrolin,  Jamie Stregi,  Deborah Jones,  Gina Backs,  Harry G. Pamela Coppice,  Dean Karen Wilhite, Ed Holfen, Nicole Nava, Michelle Burton, Jody Taylor, Jules Brown, Daniel  Bringhoff, Theresa Lesk, Suzanne Wong, Susan Smead, Julie Threat, Dave Leask, Allison Hart,  Deborah Pitcher, Stephen Messer, Ashley Eisenbarth, Michelle Hale, Lisa Salzman, and  Joseph Pratt, Michelle Rettlinger, Bryan Bolin, Dave Howell, and Rob Barry.  I did want to note that you received this for the June 2 meeting, but for that public record that was turned in,  I did not receive this for that public record that was turned in,  There was an online survey of sorts, and that was brought in by Terry DuBose,  and there were 1,536 local residents who were opposed to the taxes proposed.  That came in, and we sent that out.  Yes.  Correct.  The addresses are on there, but the...  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I did not set my timer, so I wanted to find out, is everyone completed reading?  Okay.  I guess it should be noted that our action takes a five-person majority to put this on the ballot.  I'd like to ask the city attorney what format a motion would need to be in for this.  What are we...  What exactly would we be saying in a motion?  A motion to...  A motion to approve the staff recommendation.  Okay.  Well, I will make that motion to approve the staff recommendation with the additional instructions that I'd like to see it come back to us with  something like...  the maximum amount of oversight that a advisory citizens advisory committee can  have in helping administer the expenditures. And for the record you should also be  waving the full reading of the ordinance. So I need to say I'm waving the full reading?  Yes. Okay that's what I'm saying.  Chris? We had revised the staff report to remove the resolution but we didn't take the last  sentence out. The ordinance itself is not in the resolution. It's not in the resolution. It's not  in the resolution. The ordinance itself only requires four votes. The actual resolution to  place it on the ballot when you do so, if you should do so, would require the five.  So to go forward at this point we only need a simple majority. Correct. But then once we decide  on the actual ordinance it would require five votes. The simple majority would give us the  direction to make the revisions to the committee structure and authority and then your final  action would be to remove the resolution.  So the final action would be the resolution and the ordinance approval of a vote of at least five members of the council.  Mr. Reynolds? Mr. Constancy, I have a question for you and sorry not to beat a dead horse here but  I want the voters to be able to make a choice on this and I want to take care of our city the way  that staff members the way that we should.  Here's my concern.  If we have 85%, 88% or whatever the people saying they would not support a general tax.  We have 1,500 signatures saying we would not support a general tax.  Every single tax measure that was on the ballot last time around was defeated in the state and in the city of Chico.  I want to set this up for success, not for failure.  So if everybody is already telling us that a general tax isn't going to go, I just feel like we're not doing the right thing.  My question is, if we do a special tax that goes to police fire roads, which is what people have said that their primary,  won't that free up money on the other end that theoretically we could then spend on whatever other things we want to spend it on?  It doesn't mean we're going to do a police fire and roads special tax and all that money is going to go to,  and all the money that's currently allotted.  So if we pass that special tax, that money is locked in for those items,  and then it frees up money in other places to do the stuff that we need to do it.  Or am I seeing it wrong?  Let me address a couple of points there.  Depending on how you write that measure and its restrictions, yes, you can.  How it's been conveyed, albeit not very clearly, when you make statements like what the chamber requested,  enhancing.  In effect, adding more, it would create an artificial floor the same way that the safer grant created a minimum staffing level for fire,  then ties your hands.  And so the question then comes up, well, what do you do with the pension liability of the existing police officers and firefighters?  Can it be paid out of the new tax or not?  That would be a question of how you construct the language.  In terms of taxes that have passed, at one of the previous agenda items, we provided a listing of all the tax measures that went to the voters.  No, there hasn't been a time.  In the last three to four years, all tax measures failed.  There were a variety, and they tended to be at least 50% or more passing,  whether it be a bond or a parcel tax or other measures, depending on what the measure was.  And so lastly, I don't want to discount 1,500 folks that signed a petition or 80-some folks that just provided input and engaged by any means.  There are...  Opinions and perspectives matter.  But as our consultant would tell you, in the area of surveys, if I'm really pissed off, I'm going to tell you I'm pissed off.  I'm going to tell you I don't want it.  Or if I'm really supportive of it, I'm going to come tell you I'm supportive of it.  And if you have a room filled of...  If 86 people here said, we want the homeless to run the world, it doesn't necessarily mean that 92,000, 110,000 do either.  And so I think we need to be very careful.  If we're going to make a decision on numbers, I would...  If you need that to make a decision, I would say give direction for us to immediately go out with another survey,  authorize the expenditures, and see if our consultant could go out on emergency and do so.  I don't know if they could in time before the August deadline.  And so the other piece to consider, if you do place it on the ballot,  you buy yourself the time to see what the data says from sales tax when it starts coming out in August  and seeing leading up to the election, what does our budget look like and what are the impacts on our services.  The committee structure was intended to give you still the flexibility for items that we have no idea what we're going...  There may be something in the future we have no idea what we need to spend on.  A special tax may completely tie your hands from it.  A committee...  A committee that you granted greater authority to say,  we'll let you recommend to us and we'll either accept it as a package or not,  and go back and forth until both the committee and a majority of the council agrees to it,  or a super majority of the council, allows that kind of contingency discussion to occur.  And a priority that you may not know today, that had we...  If we knew it today, we would have built it into the special tax.  You still have the ability to do so with the general tax, but with higher level of safeguards.  So I think kind of that hits all the items.  I'll give it to...  Mr. Constantine, can you talk about how a campaign would be run for this measure?  Because as a city, I don't think that we could run a campaign in favor of it.  But certainly, those that are opposed to it would run a very vigorous campaign against it.  That's where those 1,500 signatures and 88 comments...  we can't expend any public resources, staff time or otherwise, advocating one way or another into a measure.  Usually what happens is when the governing body decides to place something on the ballot,  the affinity groups that support or oppose come forth.  I mean, the council could decide to give direction to make this a special tax and to limit it to those categories,  and we would proceed with that, but I wanted to raise the caution that our consultant raised.  Whatever we do different than what was already surveyed negates the survey,  and we will be floating without that objective data,  albeit the caveat being with the pandemic and the number of changes,  we may already be in that situation right now,  and so we may just be operating on the premise of we need more resources,  should we or should we ask the public, and maybe no measure is a measure that could pass.  We just don't know.  And then the danger of putting something on the ballot that fails,  when would it be, if that's something that a future council wanted to go and ask again,  what effects does a failed tax measure have on the success of another one?  It could vary.  The council had put on the ballot the UUT measure when the laws had changed  that UUT needed to have the support of the electorate.  They put that on the ballot.  It was the first time that a UUT measure had failed in November of,  I think it was before we came to the world, 2012, I think is when that occurred.  I can't remember what measure.  It really comes down to the desire of the electorate when you poll them at the time you poll them.  The polls are only good technically the day or the timeframe you poll them,  and that the next week, events that occurred between the survey  and that date could completely change the results, which then puts you in the position  of not having solid data.  I mean, you'll never have absolute data.  You will have some data.  And now you have not just that.  You have the data of 1,500 folks and the folks that did the engage,  which say completely opposite to what your survey said in October and September.  So it's a tough decision.  So, Chris, to your point, and I'm arguing against the motion on the floor,  given the chamber's letter,  I think we can.  Probably expect the chamber to fight against the 50% tax.  Well, and these are the people running the businesses that are now being hammered,  trying to come back from just being destroyed by the virus.  They said they would support the special tax, pushing the two-thirds, requiring the two-thirds.  If the chamber was willing to do that, maybe they would be the group that would actually speak out in favor of it.  Yeah.  I agree with that.  I agree with that.  I agree with that. But then it also negates the use. I understand the reason for the committee, it's splitting the baby, which never works. It's what the Chancellor's trying to do with the CSU system, we'll be there, but we won't be there. I'm opposed to abdicating the responsibility to the Council, very much like people want us to, some people want us to put together  together a police community overwatch board. I'm like, that's what the council's for. If we're  going to do the job, let's do the job. And if we're not going to do the job, let's not run to sit here.  But I appreciate where you're coming from. You're trying to, how can we pass this and still give us  some control? But it's not real control. At the end of the day, if we don't put it on the ballot  and say, we will only spend it on these things, some other council can come and, and we've seen  it. We saw it happen in Paradise. Let me just clarify. I know I made an emotion of plea.  City manager Nakamura had said, don't marry your project, right? Because the objective, well,  I'm fortunate with all the time we spent here. I married my project, so I may have to deal with  the divorce there too. It's okay. But one of the other things that city manager Nakamura said  when we were about to go into bankruptcy, said, Sean, don't ever even think about putting a sales  tax on the ballot when the public doesn't.  I don't think that's the right thing to do. I think that's the right thing to do. I think that's  the right thing to do. I think that's the right thing to do. I think that's the right thing to do.  And I would say public trust for, not this government, but government back then was probably  better than it is now. Not this council necessarily. I mean, they've been lied to by WHO and CDC and  all these people, not purpose, but it's like they change their minds every 10 minutes. So I think  we're at an all-time low as to, will they really spend this on the things they say they will?  And that's the 50% plus one. Yeah. And that's where I want to clarify it because I made an  impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it.  I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it.  I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression  of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it.  of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an  impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made  an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made an impression of it. I made  What was that crazy guy not telling us when he asked us about this?  Had we known that, we may have supported it.  Please don't take what I'm saying as a course of action.  Mr. Stone said it, so that's one of the things we appreciate about your admin services department,  that it's full disclosure.  I get it.  Awesome. Thank you.  It doesn't mean I like it.  I'm just thinking I'm ready to make a substitute motion to accept staff recommendation.  We don't have a second.  Well, then I'll make the motion.  To accept the staff recommendation?  Yeah.  As written.  He asked for additions to oversight.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I know.  I didn't hear the answer.  Mr. Huger asked for additions to oversight.  Oh, okay.  So he's got an amended recommendation.  So moving that we accept the recommendation in front of us.  May I ask those?  So 50% plus one with no constraint.  There is a board written into this ordinance.  It's just not to the level.  It's just not adding those things that Council Member Huger requested.  May I ask when this needs to be approved to put on the ballot?  So there are a couple of points I'll make.  So in answer to your question,  the...  July 10th is...  July 10th is the deadline to the County Registrar's Office  to add things to notify them and present them in final form.  This requires this action that you're taking is an introduction of an ordinance.  There will need to be a second reading of the ordinance.  The second reading needs to take place at a regular scheduled council meeting,  which means second reading has to happen July 7th.  So if you're going to...  So your introduction with an amendment, we don't have those at this point.  It's sounding like what you're wanting, what that motion was about,  was to amend the Community Oversight Board section of the ordinance.  That then is not really first reading tonight.  That really is giving direction to staff to bring back for first reading  an augmented version of this ordinance.  That would become first reading.  We can do that September or...  September.  We can bring back July...  June 23rd with an amended version of that.  The Vice Mayor is correct.  There is a section of this that deals with a Citizens Oversight Commission or committee.  And that is at...  The proposed section 3.90150.  That's on page 14 of the ordinance where that begins.  And the actual composition of it happens on page 16.  So...  And then the final point, as far as expenditures of advocating for or against a ballot measure,  the Assistant City Manager is correct.  You cannot expend any public monies to advocate.  You can, however, spend monies to advocate for or against a ballot measure.  You can't spend any public monies to educate on what it means.  And so, that is a nuanced position.  But I would strongly recommend that that truly be educational as to what the mechanics of this are  and what it ends up meaning.  So, yeah.  So, I have a question.  So, it...  The ordinance is...  The recommendations as it's written are...  The following authority includes provisions for citizens oversight and accountability.  If we were to approve it as written,  would we still have the opportunity to discuss further at the next meeting  to what extent we want those provisions for oversight and accountability to look like?  Yes, you could.  The difficulty with that, however,  is that you need the first reading and the second reading,  and the second reading has to happen  at a regularly scheduled council meeting.  So if at the June 23 meeting you have further discussion on this,  you can't vote for second reading  because it's not a regularly scheduled meeting.  We'd be calling a special meeting at this point.  So the level of oversight has to be part of  what's approved or disapproved?  No, it should be yes.  I have a follow-up question to that  to make sure that I understand Mr. Constantine's point.  So it requires at least four people saying yes  that we'll move forward with this,  but then eventually it requires five people  to actually put it on the ballot.  Did I hear you right, Chris?  Right, for the ballot measure.  Thank you.  And when would that vote come?  The next time?  That would be the July meeting  when you take the formal action.  But let me provide one clarification.  When we say strengthening the oversight board,  the implied is strengthening the language  that the voters will vote that you can't change  unless you go back for a vote.  The council still has budgetary authority.  Just like you write your budget policies,  if we want to transition,  transfer $25,000 from one category to the next  that needs to come to council,  or if I want to move personnel funds to non-personnel,  your budget policy says council must approve that.  You can revise outside of the election process.  So approving something like this,  if you want to strengthen and safeguard it,  you can pass budget policy or other ordinances  that define your appropriation authority  and provide limits to that  that you would self-impose  that you could always change.  Now, when you apply those limits,  you could, when you put them in place,  put into place to change these limits,  it requires six of the seven council members  or seven of it.  So if it's so important...  I'm sorry?  At what point could that be done?  That could be done at any time.  That aspect of it,  if it's not part of the ordinance  and restrictions you're putting to the electorate,  if you're tying your budgetary authority  and the process,  it would be done no differently  than what you currently have authorized  through the budget process.  So you said self-imposed limits,  we can always change?  It's kind of like the rules that govern  the way we run our meetings.  Well, no.  That should scare everybody.  But right now, the implication is  if we pass a municipal code change  or a budget policy with four votes of the council,  you can put into place a restriction that says  we're putting this into place  and to change this going forward,  it requires a higher level of affirmatives  from the vote of the council.  And so if something's so important,  comes forward that it's like,  you know what, we have to do this.  And if you said six of the seven have to say yes,  then if you can garner six,  then yes, you can change it.  Otherwise, it stays.  I would not recommend that you tie that aspect  to tonight's vote.  There is case law out there  talking about calling something a general tax,  but putting layers on it that imposes it  like it's a special tax,  like you're doing restrictions.  And then it being challenged.  I can't recall the city that that happened to.  Yuba City, I think.  There we go.  And that would then invalidate all of your efforts.  But we could enact a budget policy  prior to the election that would reflect that.  Again, I would not recommend you do that  in Money of the Waters.  Keep it.  Keep it clean.  Those were the,  I don't know if those are the exact facts  of Yuba City's measure,  but anything you're trying to do  to make it look like a special tax,  but not calling it a special tax  and not having the two-thirds requirement  is opening you up for legal liability.  And I agree with the city attorney.  In Yuba City's case,  there was a lot of language  about the kinds of things that they would fund  with this general tax  that was more akin to passing a special tax.  What I'm advocating for is  nothing about the category of expenditures,  just focusing on how you make budgetary decisions  the same way that you've defined  if I want to move personnel to non-personal expenditures,  there's a process and there's a vote  that has to take place.  Is there a second to the motion?  There is not.  I have not heard a second to the motion.  The motion being...  The motion being...  Council Member Hubris' motion.  The substitute motion.  Well, I didn't hear one for...  Let's bring back Council Member Hubris.  I did not hear a second for that.  With all respect,  I feel this is going to be a fateful day  and I don't envy you  that are going to continue on next year.  I think many of the comments we read  were talking as if we were voting on a sales tax tonight,  not putting it in front of the voters.  So there may be some misunderstanding.  So let me get my motion out there,  see if there's a second.  I do believe that a two-thirds vote  will not work.  And...  I don't offer any excuses for that.  If you guys want to blame that on our liberalism,  I don't...  You know, fine.  But the truth is,  a two-thirds vote won't happen.  The card vote didn't not just get two-thirds,  it didn't get a majority.  I hear from staff a very clear message  that they're counting on this,  they need this,  that we need these revenues.  Sorry.  I'm sympathetic to the impact on business.  So,  let me go through it.  I would move that we have a half a cent sales tax.  If we do well,  we can go back to the voters in 2022.  I think we need to prove to the voters  that we are accountable.  That the council in 2021  needs to prove that to the voters.  I would want it not to be a vote,  to take effect into 2022  to minimize the impact on business.  My motion would have it sunset  in 2028-29.  We certainly could go back to the voters  and act for an extension  if they're impressed by  the impacts on the community.  I've heard  that this  public safety and infrastructure,  my own definition,  in one way or another,  I would go forward to try to  anyway,  would include parks and creekways.  About a third of the money  would go to parks and creekways.  About a third would go to infrastructure.  About a third to public safety.  We have a written statement of intent.  I know it's only $9 million.  I know it's only $3 million.  I know it's only $10 million.  I know it's only $10 million.  I know it's only $10 million.  I don't think that's enough.  I don't think that's enough.  I don't think that's enough.  I don't think that's enough.  I don't think that's enough. Those of you that made those cuts eight years ago, six years ago, know how hard it was. And that's why I'm supporting the least amount of measure that would gather majority, but not majority, unanimous vote of this council  council that understands what solvency means and to avoid the kind of deep cuts we we already made  and will have to be even deeper this next time maybe there's not seven votes tonight but if we  do put something that is passable something that um it respects the concerns of the voters and  concerns of the chaotic times we're in but keeps us solvent at least it gives us to july 2nd to  see whether or not we can get true community support if we go with a two-thirds vote it's a  fig leaf of those that really just don't want a tax  i'm hoping that the i've asked the chamber to reconsider their vote was in march  i'm told by people that  attended those meetings that there is not necessarily that it was there was a straw vote  we're about 50 50 but i think if we show them that we're very interested in just exactly what  we need for solvency that should just trump everything else that we're talking about  that that that should be our our obligation our duty to bring something in front of the voters  that can pass gets us through and um  you  know is is a consensus of this council majority i i don't i should just stop there but that's my  motion is a half a cent um sunsetted in 20 28 29 not take effect into 2022  and it would be a general tax i'd like to have mr constantine speak to that proposal  and kind of give a sense of  what you think that would do i i want to hear what chris has to say too  but he can't say what's going to pass in front of the voters and that's what we have to decide  i i will start by saying i'm thankful for the kind of discussion that's occurring about such  a significant item that we're not just flowing through a yes or no as i mentioned earlier  irrespective of how strong i've spoke because of the demand and the need  the position of what we're going to do is to make sure that we're not just going to do what we're going to do  but to do what you should do or what we're there is no demand from staff there is no this is what the right action is it should be a tax  you shouldn't vote for a tax you should be special or not i i think what council member ori is speaking to is  an acknowledgement of we're hearing the concerns about a one cent general sales tax in this  environment in this totality and is there an alternative that could proceed in the current  budget year in the current election year to fill a hole that the senate can't do to provide a tax to the city of ori  and that's what the city has coming up starting in 2223 and do it in such a temporary manner that you've bought time to address it i think a half cent sales tax would do that too one cent would cover the other items we had to identify but if the goal is to try to avoid the pitfalls service pitfalls that should accomplish  this mayor if you if you would let me i i know that i've kind of placed a tremendous burden on chris  um you know he's been done a fantastic job here and i just i think it'll be helpful to council just to understand  and i know that there's a motion on the floor and i don't want to delay a consideration of that but it  sounds like there's a real desire to truly understand where staff's coming from i've heard  a lot of different um suppositions with regard to this tax and really what my obligation and  responsibility to this council is which i think has been iterated i think well enough  is in the city charter  and it says keep the council advised of the financial condition and future needs of the city and make such recommendations on any matter as may the city manager seem desirable  i've informed you we've done a terrific job i think over the past almost well over seven years  of where we are financially and all this simply is is an opportunity to see if the council is willing to put something on the ballot for the public to vote on i'm not  following through with thatahah  saying a lot of strange things about what the intentions are behind this.  It's just a matter of numbers and we know what the numbers are likely to be  and so we're trying to figure out if this is something the council would be  interested in doing. So I hope that helps bring clarity to it as well not only for  you but the public. I want to make a couple comments on council member Orry's  motion. I think that the sunset is something that would be very attractive.  It would be an opportunity to gain the community's trust. I hear time and time  again that there isn't trust that this particular council will spend the money  reflective of what the community's wishes are.  When you  look back on our history of our expenditures it has been very consistent  on how much we allocate for public safety for all the different categories.  So that that really questions me that when we as a council decide what is  important our budgets say that public safety is important to our community.  I think that's a really important point. I think that's a really important point.  This is an opportunity for the community to build trust with us. It is attractive  that it gives another year before it is in effect showing that our economy will  have an opportunity to start recovering. Would give  a lot of opportunity to build trust with us. I think that's a really important point.  I think that's an important point. I'm very interested in this. Madam Mayor, there are two points in the motion that I'd like a little bit of clarification about because we obviously have to bring this back  they have to bring this back for an introduction.  It doesn't have a second.  No.  I understand.  And that would be as to the sunset date  and the implementation date.  Years were given.  I'm assuming those would be the effective date would be January  1st, 2022.  And the sunset date would be, you mentioned, 2028 or 2029.  Fiscal year.  And that would be, I guess that would be then June 30th, 2029.  Okay.  So, and I do mean this with all due respect.  Lowering it to a half a cent and delaying the start  and having a sunset date.  To me, feels a lot like throwing darts at a dart board  and you know, hoping that combination  of things gets us to 51%.  I really believe that the enhanced oversight is the thing  that would be the more convincing factor for voters,  to my way of thinking.  But I'm willing just to move this forward and try  to get.  Something out there.  And I'm willing to second your motion and see if the rest  of the council agrees with that.  So that's a second.  Throwing darts at the dart board,  you're usually looking for the bull's eye.  Okay. Okay.  Any comments before we take a vote?  I guess I'd like to add.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That I'll vote against this next week, next time it's on.  If there's not, if this isn't a consensus  of our community to go forward for salvency.  I will not put us in a position where a good hit piece knocks us  all out and it, you know, it's just a waste of effort.  We really need to work, whatever we vote on tonight,  we really need to work to July 2nd to make sure  that business leaders, you know,  Republican Democratic leaders, car sales owners, all parties are behind something  that will that they understand that this is what plugs the hole in the dive. So  there's a motion on the table and it's been seconded. Can we have a vote please?  Yes and I wanted to clarify did that also include a third for parks, a third for public safety,  and a third for roads or were you just indicating? I will argue that at the next meeting of what I  think would get us to the finish line. So yeah I will not include that in my motion. Okay thank  you I just wanted to double check. All right Councilmember Huber. Yes.  Yes.  I'm sorry my system is dragging. Councilmember Morgan. No. Councilmember Orry. Yes. Councilmember Reynolds. No.  Councilmember Stone. Nay. Vice Mayor Brown. Aye. Mayor Schwab. Aye. Who carries 4-3.  That's not anahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah  hoping that we could finish things by 9.30.  So the question before us is do we vote?  Well, no, our new rules do not allow us to take up new items.  So the old rules didn't allow us to take up new items.  We just didn't follow them.  Yes.  We have some items that I feel are time-sensitive.  Reports about business response to pandemics, ballot measures,  some issues that council members want to speak on.  I would suggest I would be interested to know if council is available tomorrow night,  tomorrow sometime to continue this meeting.  I only speak for myself.  Okay.  And I know there's a lot of things on here that are very important to everybody,  and I support talking about almost all of them.  But I also know what happens when we start making decisions at 11 o'clock.  So I can only speak for me.  I will make myself available whenever necessary.  Okay.  Can we then, I would like to have the city clerk poll the council tomorrow  to find out.  Actually, I can't do that.  I have to suggest to see if there is a time that the council can meet.  We would need to.  The rest of this week.  Thank you for giving me some help.  We should adjourn now.  Okay.  To that.  Okay.  Okay.  So suggest that we look at our calendars right now to see when we could meet.  You want us to end the meeting now and then discuss a calendar for continuance?  Or.  Well.  My recommendation is to continue the meeting at this point.  Oh, got it.  So we.  Can you tell me more specific?  Would you like us to select a date today?  Correct.  Okay.  And then you would adjourn to that date?  Yes.  And then it helps.  Okay.  The continuance of the thing.  Continue.  Okay.  Okay.  So is council available?  Yes.  So is the meeting scheduled tomorrow night at 530?  Why 530?  That is our normal time.  Our charter time is 6 o'clock.  We keep going over this 530.  I don't know why we keep going back to that.  Okay.  For following rules, we're following 6 o'clock as the start of our meeting.  6 o'clock start of the meeting time.  Is anyone not available tomorrow at 6 o'clock?  I should probably speak to the boss, but it looks clear.  Okay.  All right.  Do you have a social worker?  No.  No, but two kids at home and a wife that's an essential worker.  That'll do it.  Okay.  So we, council will adjourn our meeting, or we'll continue our meeting until tomorrow  night at 6 o'clock, including our closed session continuance.  Such important stuff.  Okay.  Thank you.  Are we allowed without any questions?  I was just out of curiosity.  I don't know if you can conference us.  We have a closed session after the session.  Sure.  I think she was, are you, were you continuing it, the closed session portion to tomorrow  night's meeting?  Yeah.  Okay. [inaudible]  I appreciate it. [inaudible] Okay.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.
