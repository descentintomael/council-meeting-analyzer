 Thank you. Thank you. Okay, good evening. I'm going to call the regular Planning Commission meeting of Thursday, July 21st, 2022. And we will start with the pledge. Salute. And pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And roll call, please. Commissioner Wall. Here. Commissioner Poulin is absent. Commissioner Goldstein is absent. Commissioner Deremedy. Present. Commissioner Cooper. Present. Vice Chair Ober. Here. Chair Scott. Present. Thank you. Before we move on to the rest of the agenda, I just want to remind everybody, if you are here to speak on any item on the agenda, I think you're all here for the consent agenda. But if you're here for item 4.1, please make sure you get in a speaker card and have that in before the staff report's done. We won't take any speaker cards after that, so please make sure you get your speaker cards in. I see a few people trickling in. Just to remind everybody, no signs are allowed. If you're out in the audience, we have a few spaces allowed in the back where you can have signs, so feel free to stand there. Anything else I'm missing? Okay. So we'll move to item 2, consent agenda, and I will entertain a motion for approval. Move to approve. So is there a second? All right. We have a motion and a second to approve the minutes of June 16, 2022. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion passes 5-0 with two absences. Item 3, business from the floor. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. Do we have any business from the floor? All right. We will move to item 4, public hearings, and I will start with asking ex parte communication, and Commissioner Wall, I'll start with you. Any ex parte communication? Yeah, I would announce that I did have a meeting with Mr. Stevens. I did have a meeting with Mr. Stevens, and I drove by the site. Yes, I had a meeting with Jim Stevens from Northstar Engineering and drove by the site. I also had a meeting with Mr. Stevens, drove by the site, and I did meet with Pignol, the HOA. Great. Thank you. And I will turn it over to City Council Member Steph. Thank you, Madam Chair, Commissioners, Bruce Hambo, I'm the principal planner, and I thought it would be helpful to introduce some of the presenters and give you a snapshot of tonight's meeting. So we have our director, Brendan Veague, with us tonight. Kelly Murphy is going to present the analysis of the staff report for the hotel, the use permit, and the design review as it relates to the four-story building. In addition to that, we have made a statement to the City Council about the staff report. We have our consultant, Matt Johnson, who we're used to seeing. They handle engineering, traffic issues, any kind of technical engineering issues. We have our consultant with us, too, John Hope, who prepared the environmental document. He's with Michael Baker International. And then we have Captain Aldridge here that also may be able to respond to questions about evacuation procedures, and he's also here to give us some of the details. And I'm going to address in tonight's presentation some of the features of the environmental document, the response to comments that we've gotten. We've got a lot of comments on this project. And then wrap it up with some of the alternatives that we're presenting for your consideration and then the recommendation. But before we get going, I'd like to talk about the review process. We changed the review process. We reordered the review process many times so that we can take the most cogent issue, the main issue that needs to be addressed first. Sometimes we see design review first. In this case, we thought it would be in the public interest to deal with the major issue of whether or not a hotel should exist at this site first without getting involved with design before the question of whether or not the hotel should exist has been addressed. So we're presenting, we reordered the process to deal with the question of whether or not the hotel should exist first and foremost. If this project is approved and it's not appealed, then there will be a subsequent hearing at the Architecture Review and Historic Preservation Commission next week, next Wednesday at 4 o'clock. That's only if this project is approved and if it's not appealed. Where are the rules? And the focus of that review will be on the design review of the building, the architecture, the landscape, the lighting, the site features, all of the aspects of design of the building. But as it relates to tonight's presentation, we're just talking about the use of the hotel, whether or not it should be there, and then also whether or not you agree with the building volume as it relates to that site. Right now, so I'm going to go ahead and give the presentation to Kelly Murphy. She's going to get through the use permit, the technical analysis, and then it'll come back to me, and then we'll walk you through the rest of the presentation. Okay. Bruce, before you do that, can I make one more announcement? Because I did see some people wander in. If you do want to speak on this item, please make sure you get a speaker card in before the end of the staff report. And just to give you a little bit of overview of what tonight's presentation is, what tonight will look like, we're going to hear from city staff first. They're going to present the project, and then we will hear from the... We will open the public hearing, so that's when all of you will speak to us. We're going to have the applicant speak first. Then we will have the public hearing, and then we will wrap up with the applicant. So during this time, what the commission's going to do is hear from city staff. We're going to ask the questions that we have on the project. So they will be talking back and forth to us. If there's anything that comes into mind that you have questions on, feel free to jot that down. But this is not your time to ask questions. Thanks, Kelly. Well, good evening to the commissioners, and thank you, Bruce, for the introduction. The project before you today is a proposal to construct a new four-story, 112-room hotel building on an approximately four-acre site at the northeast corner of Bruce Road, Highway 32, and Sierra Sunrise Terrace. The project site is designated commercial mixed use on the general plan land use diagram and is zoned CC, community commercial. Pursuant to the Chico Municipal Code, a hotel may be allowed in the CC zoning district, subject to use permit approval. Adjacent parcels to the south, east, and west are also zoned CC. Beyond these commercial properties, medium and medium-high density residential zoning is present. Low-density residential properties of the California Park subdivision extend further north of the site. The project site is lot 59 of the Sierra Sunrise Village Unit 2 subdivision map for California Park, recorded in September 1986. The subject parcel has historically been designated and zoned for commercial development. The proposed hotel would have a footprint of approximately 16,655 square feet. Other site features would include a covered passenger drop-off area near the building entrance, outdoor swimming pool and patios, commercial trash enclosure, parking and landscaping. The proposed building would be situated central to the site and oriented towards Sierra Sunrise Terrace, with parking offered around the building. The CC zoning district allows for building coverage up to 95% of the total site area. The project's total building coverage would represent approximately 10% of the site. The project does not abut a residential zoning district, therefore no setbacks are required for the proposed structure. However, generous setbacks have been provided, with the hotel building setback 157 feet from Bruce Road, 89 feet from Sierra Sunrise Terrace, 80 feet from Deer Creek Highway, or Highway 32 as I'll refer to it in the presentation, and 344 feet from the eastern property line. Dead Horse Slough, forms the western boundary and serves as an overflow to California Park Lake, therefore the project is subject to the city's Creekside Development Standards. Consistent with these standards, the project has been designed to accommodate a minimum 30-foot setback from the top of Bank, no development, improvements, grading, filling, or removal of native vegetation is proposed within a Creekside setback, and stormwater will be screened by landscaping to the south and a bioswale to the west, before being directed to an existing concrete storm drainage system along Highway 32. Consistent with code requirements, vehicle access is proposed from the lesser traveled street on a corner parcel. Access to the project site would be via two driveway entrances off of Sierra Sunrise Terrace, a two-lane collector road, which extends westerly to Bruce Road, a four-lane arterial roadway. Sierra Sunrise Terrace is, a private road dedicated for use by all of the lots of the Sierra Sunrise Village subdivision, which includes the project site. In addition to deciding on the proposed land use, staff is requesting the Planning Commission consider the architectural review application, specifically as it relates to the four-story building volume and total building height. The maximum height for main buildings in the CC zoning district is 57 feet. Parapet walls are permitted height projections that may extend up to six feet, above the height limit of the structure. The four-story building would have a height predominantly 49 feet, three inches, with tower and parapet elements extending to 59 feet, three inches, consistent with building height requirements. The applicant has provided color renderings of the building, which provide more of a perspective on the look and feel. I'll pause briefly on these slides and we can go back to them. Hotels are required to provide a minimum of one off-street vehicle parking space per guest room. The applicant proposes to provide 117 off-street parking spaces and 20 bicycle parking spaces, exceeding parking requirements. Bicycle parking would be located near the building entrances and separated from vehicle parking areas. Per the requirements of the CC zoning district, a minimum of 5% of the site shall be landscaped. The project proposes to landscape approximately 57% of the site. Landscaping features are proposed around the building and site perimeter. A total of 69 trees are proposed throughout the site, 59 of which would be used for parking lot shading. Parking lot shading is projected to reach 78% at tree maturity, exceeding the city's requirements. A minimum landscape buffer of 10 feet would be provided between the parking areas and adjacent streets in compliance with the code. Plans are in progress to provide a maximum of 7% of the site's area. Planting of 3-foot high evergreen flowering shrubs in this buffer area would screen vehicle parking from public views along the street frontages. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this screening, the applicant has prepared visual simulations at the pedestrian scale from five different viewpoints around the project site. Each of these viewpoints have provided a day and nighttime perspective. The potential impacts to traffic and circulation were analyzed in a traffic study, which concluded the project would create a less than significant impact to vehicle miles traveled. As shown in Table 1, traffic data confirms that a hotel use generates significantly less traffic as compared to other commercial uses, such as retail, office, and restaurant uses, which are permitted by right in the CC zoning district. For instance, the table shows a medical office use or restaurant retail use is estimated to generate approximately four to six times as many average daily trips as a 112-room hotel use. The signal warrant analysis suggested there will be future need for traffic signal at the intersection of Bruce Road and Sierra Sunrise Terrace if application is made for development on the west side of Bruce Road, which is not within the scope of this project. However, traffic and development engineering staff have recommended installing a traffic signal at this intersection to improve intersection safety, and the developer has agreed to that condition. As mentioned, the CC zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for a wide range of retail businesses. For example, the following land uses are principally permitted in the CC zoning district, including alcoholic beverage establishments, grocery stores of any size, multi-family housing, offices, restaurants, and retail stores of any size. The proposal is consistent with various general plan goals and policies, specifically under land use goals two, three, and four, community design goals one and five, economic development goal two, open space goal two, and circulation goal one. Specifically, the project would be consistent with economic goals and policies to enhance regional tourism opportunities to attract visitors who support the project, support the local businesses, and encourage the development of tourism businesses and industries such as hotels. The proposed hotel would be subject to a transient occupancy tax generating revenue for the city's general fund. The project is consistent with the purpose of the commercial mixed use designation and the community commercial zoning district and meets all applicable development standards. Special design considerations were made to minimize visual impacts, such as providing large building setbacks, and extensive landscaping around the site. Additionally, the project has been designed in compliance with Creekside development standards and would provide a minimum 30 foot setback from the top of bank to any development or site improvement. Most of the site would consist of landscaped area and the landscape plan would incorporate new plantings as well as enhance the existing natural environment. Development of the project would result in installation of a new traffic signal, improving traffic and circulation, and improving traffic and circulation patterns. The project sites in an area of Chico that is experiencing significant growth and development. The project would activate a second corner parcel at this intersection and new landscaping and site design would improve the aesthetics along the north highway 32 corridor. The general plan provides definitions for compatibility. Staff's recommendation to the planning commission and assessment of compatibility is based on the project's compliance with the land use design and development standards of the city's general plan, design guidelines manual, and municipal code. Those staff's analysis did not result in the identification of any significant adverse impacts as a result of project implementation. A substantial amount of public correspondence was received concerning neighborhood compatibility. While staff has responded to comments relating to traffic, safety, and environmental concerns, the planning commission may wish to consider how the project addresses the general plan goals and policies listed on the slide. To the question of whether the project would enhance the character, identity, and livability of the existing neighborhood, staff would respond that the project site is proximal to medical facilities off Bruce Road which provide outpatient services for Enloe Hospital, including an urgent care and surgery center, making this an appropriate and desirable location for traveling healthcare and medical professionals. Also, the hotel would be located near the terraces, a senior housing development offering both independent and assisted living facilities, making it a sensible option for relatives of patients and residents in the senior living community. To the question of whether the project would be considered compatible in full development, providing a missing neighborhood element, such as circulation improvements, or that otherwise contributes to the existing neighborhood, staff would respond that the project represents an infill development project and complies with all the standards of Title 19, including lot coverage, landscaping, parking, setbacks, and building height. The project is located within a widely permissive commercial zone adjacent to a key transportation corridor and represents a land use that would have lesser impacts to traffic, parking, and density of development than other principally permitted land uses. Additionally, installation of a new traffic signal would improve general traffic and circulation patterns of the greater area. To the question of whether the project would reinforce the desirable elements of the neighborhood, including... Kelly, could you hold on just for a second? Sure. Hey, everybody. We're going to be spending a lot of time together tonight. So, I was going to wait for these ground rules until we started with the public hearing, but we're going to do them now. A couple of things. With great power comes great responsibility. It is your responsibility to communicate civilly and respectfully to us on what your opinion is. It is my responsibility to make sure that this is a safe and respectful meeting to our city staff and to this commission, who has worked very, very hard to present something to us to make a very important decision on behalf of Chico. If there are any more outbursts, whisperings, anything like that, please let us know. And, Scott, this is my meeting to run, and we will stop it. I don't want to do that. So, please be respectful to city staff as we're going forward. You will have your time to speak, and you are at liberty at that time to express your opinion. But going forward, if we could have it quiet for city staff so that they feel comfortable up here, that would be great. Thanks, Kelly. Thank you, Chair Scott. I'll just begin the slide again. To the question of whether the project would reinforce the desirable elements of the neighborhood, including architectural scale, style, and setback patterns, and if the project reflects a context-sensitive design, staff acknowledges that several multi-story residential buildings exist in the project vicinity, including the three-story Sierra Sunrise Apartments off Sierra Sunrise Terrace and Sterling Oaks Apartments off Bruce Road. As previously mentioned in this report, new residential projects along the south side of Highway 32, including the Sierra Sunrise Terrace, are approved for several three-story apartment buildings. While the four-story hotel building would represent one of the taller structures in the project vicinity, at predominantly 49 feet, 3 inches tall, the building height would be comparable to the four-story assisted living facility, the terraces located approximately a thousand feet east of the project site on Sierra Sunrise Terrace, which has a building height of roughly 45 feet. Special design considerations were made to minimize visual and visual impacts, such as providing large building setbacks and extensive landscaping around the site. Visual impacts of the hotel building would be further reduced by the natural topography of the area. For instance, the proposed location of the hotel sits at approximately 20 feet lower than the terraces facility and approximately 20 to 40 feet lower than the building sites for the three-story apartments being developed just south of the project site. The project site is adjacent to other CC zoned parcels, which would be entitled to the same maximum building height of 57 feet, so future development resulting in a similar height to the proposed hotel could be expected. At this point in the presentation, I'm going to pass you back off to Bruce and he will finish this up. Thank you. Thanks, Kelly. Um, we prepared for the project site in the early days of the project site. We prepared for you an environment. The environmental document that we prepared for you is a categorical exemption for infill development and that is in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act, also known as CEQA. That document is a robust, thorough document that's based on site-specific environmental studies of all the environmental factors that could be considered to be impactful. This is not the same kind of category. This is not the same kind of categorical exemption that you normally see like a one-pager. This is a document like this where we're able to conclude based on the results of these site-specific studies that there is no potential for an impact. And that's why we did this. It's a robust environmental document that's based on all these studies that concludes there is no potential for an impact. That's what's recommended for approval. Um. And then, um. The other thing I'd like to mention is that we've had considerable comment and response on this project. For example, as you know, we've got 265 pages of comments and letters on this project. We also have 96 postcards that are not part, that we didn't copy for you. We have copies of those here. But we didn't make copies of them, but we have them here if you'd like to review them. And in addition to that, we understand that we have proof that an online petition has been submitted with over 1,300 people that have signed it that are in opposition to the project. So we get it. There's a lot of unhappy people that are not in favor of this project. What we've tried to do, though, is respond to those comments in the form of a master's. We've tried to get a master response to these comments. And we're able to distill all of the, all of the concern into some major issue topic areas. Those include emergency evacuation, dead horse flu and bio, and biological resources, traffic impacts, general environmental impacts, and, and concert, and conclusions. And lastly, the use of common areas in the California Park District. So that is, those, those master responses to comments are an attachment L of your staff report. And those get at the majority of what we were able to discern from all the comments that we heard. In addition to that, you received a memo that I forwarded with a cover memo from me that addressed weaknesses with the environmental document and using the categorical exemption. In my memo. I'm sorry. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's done. and drain there and there's no site work that's going to occur in proximity to any of the sensitive habitat. And lastly, dead horse flu is neither defined as a designated environmentally sensitive habitat or is a resource area. So we're just reaffirming that there's nothing particularly sensitive environmentally about dead horse flu. And then now I'm gonna summarize the alternatives. We understand, we completely appreciate, understand that people don't want to have this hotel here. And if you agree with that, you don't have to do a lot of gymnastics or anything. It's pretty simple. If you don't believe that this is a good fit for the community, all that's needed is just to say, we don't think this is good for the neighborhood or the community and that's it. That's the only finding that's necessary and you can recommend denial and that's all that's needed. You don't have to do a whole lot more than that if you're inclined to vote to deny. If you feel that this project can be modified so that it could be acceptable changing in some form, you can give us direction to modify the project. But from a planning standpoint, we can find, the staff can find no basis to recommend denial for this project based on the findings that Kelly's just reiterated for you. So therefore, we're recommending approval of this project because we can see no basis for denial. So we're recommending that you approve the project and then after this, that you open the public hearing, you hear from the applicants, hear from the public. And that concludes my presentation. Our presentation, if you have any questions, we'd be happy to answer them. I'll start to my left. Commissioner Wall, any questions? Yeah, I have two questions. The first one being the site coverage. I believe 10% is gonna be covered by the hotel and about 57% by landscaping. What is the maximum allowed for the coverage of the building and the minimum requirement for the? The maximum building coverage, for CC zoned parcels is 95% and the project's proposing 10% building coverage. Okay, and how much parking would fall into that if you wanted to put a 95% building there? You would also be required to meet the city's, all the city's development standards, including parking. So realistically, we wouldn't see a building that covers 95% of a site. You'd have to provide all the other development standards, including parking. Thank you for that one. And a roundabout at a Bruce Road, Sunrise Terrace Road, has that been considered and is that feasible? As an alternative to the traffic signal? Traffic signal. I would defer that question to Matt Johnson. Okay. Any other questions for staff at this time? So Larry, the project analysis traffic at all was conducted last fall and earlier this spring by the city's traffic engineer. He left and went to work for Caltrans in January. So I don't have the background or had worked on the project, but I know the project's traffic engineer is here tonight and is available to answer any traffic related questions that we would have with this project, so. Okay. May we hear from him or her? I'm sure he'll. Here he comes. Why don't we, can we hold that question and then maybe see if there are more questions and come back to it? Sure. Okay. Fine. Commissioner Ober? I think in the interest of giving people a chance to speak, I'll hold off on my questions. I do have a couple of very specific questions for staff, but I think I'd rather, you know, get the full picture before we start going down that path. I'll wait. Okay. And I don't know if this is a Kelly or Bruce question, but I, in the volume of public comment that we got, there were some comments about the number of units. Could you maybe explain to us a little bit what the difference between maybe a hotel unit and an apartment unit would be and why there would be maybe a difference in the number of units that would be allowable? I run a lot of public comment, but I think the difference is that a residential unit versus a commercial unit are, have different standards. Residential density would be specific to any type of residential use, single family, multifamily. Commercial hotel rooms do not receive a residential density calculation. Great. Thank you. That was my only question. Commissioner Dermody? Yes. . . . . . . . . Commissioner Cooper? I don't, yeah, other than I wish I had an architectural review board already ahead of time. So I'm trying to have visions and it's confusing me, but at this moment I think we're good. Okay. Could we have the traffic engineer come up and discuss the potential of a roundabout? . .! Good evening, I'm Lauren Chilson with Headway Transpor, prepared the traffic studies for the project. Prior to starting our analysis, we discussed the project with city staff, as Mr. Johnson eluded that. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I can stand a little bit closer. Again, Lauren Chilson with Headway Transportation. Prior to starting our analysis, we discussed the project with the City and the scope of work for that traffic analysis. And at that point in time, a traffic signal and a warrant analysis was the primary interest. The reason that we evaluated a traffic signal first and foremost was that it's for quite a while now been on the City's Nexus Improvement Plan, which is, in short, a master plan of roadway and intersection improvements for the City, to which funds get paid in and allocated to various projects. And Mr. Johnson can probably speak more to the details of that than I can. But the short story is that intersection has been planned as a traffic signal for quite some time. For that reason, that was the analysis. It could around about be there, be placed there. Potentially. We did not review that in detail because of the prior master planning. It would certainly take up a large footprint and have other impacts to adjacent properties and a variety of issues there, which we did not look at in detail. Commissioner Wall, any further questions? Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you. Commissioner Dermedy. I'm back. Just a question for staff in terms of if it was a three-story hotel and if it was designed differently, so it took, you know, there's a lot of land available to meet all the criteria and still provide the number of rooms that might be economically viable. Is that something that the applicant or any discussion within the department? Madam Chair, we haven't had that conversation with the applicant, but the applicant's here, and I think that's a fair question to ask. applicant good okay I do have one other question and just to clarify for everybody in the room because it's unclear to a lot of folks and myself included is why the ARB meets after the Commission and when did that happen and for what reasoning we we have done this in in different situations and the other cases where we've done it the applicant has said well why do I have to go through all this expense of doing design when I don't even know if the use is provable so we thought it would be in the public interest to deal with the main issue of whether or not a hotel should exist first and if that if yes then fine-tune the design because in countless hearings where we do this through our the other wave of majority of the projects go through we hear time and time again and then we have to make sure that we have the right design and time again how people get confused when they show up to these hearings and when I don't like this it's like we're only talking about design we're not talking about whether you you agree with the project that's at the next hearing so this time we move the hearing to deal with the the most contentious issue first and foremost because we believe that we be in everybody's interest to give us an on and off switch right away whether or not the hotel should exist first okay how many speaker cards do we have we have 21 well we have 20 speaker cards and then we have three speakers for on behalf of the appellant I'm not the appellant but the project 20 speaker cards do some math here really quick okay here's what we're gonna do we are going to hear from the applicant first and the applicant will have a presentation and then we will have 10 minutes to give a presentation to us sorry yes 10 minutes to give a presentation to us at that time the Commission will ask questions of the applicant then we will go to the public hearing everybody will have three minutes to speak that is a gift that we will be giving you tonight because we do have the opportunity to restrict that time but we recognize the effort that you took to come out here and we will be able to hear from everybody if you have submitted a letter I can tell you that this is the best Planning Commission in the state of California and everybody has done their homework and read through all of the letters I see highlights I see paper over here so if you have submitted a letter just give us your name please give us anything else above and beyond what might be in your letter that would be really helpful to us going forward I will say that we are going to hear from each other next week next week next week next week next week next week well and I hope that we can all do that in the room here tonight so if you do have any questions this is a big one so city staff cannot answer your questions during the public hearing and that I know feels really disappointing for me it's always tough to have you maybe leave the podium and not have those questions answered so I have some paper up here I keep notes on what the questions are I'd ask that you direct your questions to me and then when we close the public hearing we'll have city staff address those but this isn't really the time to have a back-and-forth this is really the time for the Commission to hear your testimony on why we should or shouldn't approve this project and then to go forward from there is everybody good okay one more kind of housekeeping thing because of the number of speakers I'm going to try to take a break you! I'm going to take a break and then we'll come back and we'll start that over again and then our lovely city clerk staff over here are going to keep a timer for us we're going to have the current speakers name on here and then who's coming up next if you're able come next is next is next is next is I've been here 30 years or more. This is excellent. I don't think I said one of the best. I think I said the best. Thank you for that correction. So we're here to talk about the Town Place Suites Hotel. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Jim. Can we keep working on volume? I know people are having trouble. I'm much shorter than Lauren, so I thought I would be closer. So talk about the project, which is a hotel project at the corner described by staff, and the staff did a wonderful job in their presentation. And the most important thing is, of course, the use permit and the determination whether or not this is an appropriate use for that particular site. We've been working on this for a couple of years now and have made significant outreach, and I think it's fair to say that not all of the responses were positive. But we're here to talk about that. And I want to thank you for the initial parameters. I like the fact that there's going to be a public hearing and then there's an opportunity for us to respond to any questions you may develop after hearing the public testimony. We concur with Mr. Ambo's memo of the 13th recently on talking about, and he actually made fine mention of it today, about responses to a letter that questioned the, some of the staff's assumptions about the use permit. And I think it's important to note that the memo has been very helpful in the process regarding the project description, the exemptions and the determination. And we think that that memo serves very well to demonstrate the staff's position as well founded. And we further concur with this in the project reports that we have demonstrated that we're within the height limitations, as required by the code, as set forth in the code. We've demonstrated that we have exceeded the scope of the use permit. We've exceeded the required number of parking spaces. That we have exceeded the required front, side and rear yard setbacks significantly. And that we have exceeded by a significant factor of 10 the landscaping requirement. And this is important because it will serve to be able to construct a very robust landscape, and which will aid both the timing and the density of the screening which will eventually occur. Not unlike the terraces project up the road. We're not asking for any favors here. We're not asking for any rezones, any changes, any modifications. We're just asking for an implementation of the general plan as it exists. And we believe we brought forth a project that meets that. Another letter surprisingly stated that this project provided nothing for the neighbors or for the community at Sierra Sunrise. And we strongly disagree with that. Sierra Sunrise is one of the largest senior communities in the region. And you throw in the senior facilities up the road. And it's a significant number. And having a hotel available for family to come and visit in a walkable use. Very proximate to that is I think is a wonderful benefit to the community. Putting in a traffic signal on a pretty hairy intersection. If you're at stop and crossing four lanes at peak with people going 40 miles an hour is scary. And so this is going to take care of that. So I think that that's a wonderful community wide benefit. And as mentioned, so it will be, we believe it will be an attractive building that will add to beautify the corner and serve to help activate it and actually be a waypoint for entrances and for location. You can imagine a conversation where someone says, hey, grandma, how do I get to your place? And they'll say, well, go up Highway 32, turn left at the hotel and turn right. And you're there. It's going to be a guiding element for getting around. We will have mentioned it's going to provide the first average of the first five years at averaging between 75 and 85% occupancy, about $3 million a year to the general fund. And it's going to provide roughly 30 jobs. I'm going to hand this over to my colleague, Mr. Wolf, who's going to talk about the sequence. Good afternoon, Madam Chair, members of the commission. First, I'd like to say that I think the environmental document that's been presented to you this evening is really something is probably the most comprehensive exemption I've seen in over 35 years of practicing in this field of local government planning. So kudos to staff. That was a very well done document. I'd like just to reiterate some of the findings that were made. And some of the other findings that were made. Perhaps you can just remind me of some of the elements of that review. First, starting at the base, looking at the soils, there was a geotechnical report. Everything is okay there. There was a look at hazardous materials. Is there anything there that we need to be concerned about? Nothing there either. There was a biological review of this site. In fact, that was just done about a year or so ago. There was nothing there biologically to be concerned about either. There was a noise study as well. Nothing on that front either. There was also a look at air quality impacts and energy consumption. And all these reports are a part of that categorical exemption. Nothing there either. I'd like to talk maybe about just a couple of the issues that are addressed in that document that are, I think, of greatest concern. And some of these things have been said already, but I think they're important to maintain in the record and clarity for everybody here. But just on the subject of traffic, and how much traffic this project is going to generate versus other potential development of this property, there's a significant difference between what this project would generate, and what other possible development of this site could generate. It's estimated that this project will generate approximately 500 automobile trips per day. And, off, is there a, is there, is there, is there, is there, is there, is there, is there, building on this site would generate about 2,000 that's about four times the amount of traffic that would be associated with this project similarly a neighborhood shopping center would generate about six times the amount of traffic as this project these are important considerations there are concerns about traffic and connection with this project throughout that neighborhood I think it's important to maintain that just that that awareness this is a very low-impact project so far as traffic generation is concerned speaking to the the visual analysis and the visual impacts of this project I think that the work that's been done in that document was really excellent and I think it's important to keep in mind that simply because something is visible doesn't mean that it is a significant or substantial adverse change in the visual context of a project and with respect to context This is a part of town that has changed quite a bit just in the last, you know, year, year and a half. It's very, very different from what it looked like just a couple of three years ago. So we're going to be seeing in the very near future a progression of that development over in the Oak Valley side of 32 and the south side of 32. That's going to be moving farther to the west. And those are all multi-story buildings. So the context within which this project exists is changing. Similarly, across Bruce Street, Bruce Road there, a 20-acre site, the owner of that property is looking to develop it as well. And that's going to have some higher density housing on it and some commercial as well. So just as the commission deliberates on this, I'd ask you to consider the findings for a use permit. And it speaks to the design of existing and future conditions. That's an important part of this discussion, in my opinion. So. With that, I'll conclude and introduce Michael Bowers. He's from the applicant team. Thank you. Can you hear me? That was good. Madam Commissioner and distinguished commissioners, my name is Michael Bowers. I'm from down the street, Bakersfield, California. I represent the owners. I'm the vice president of the H2H properties. And a little bit about the owners. Physicians. If you know a little bit about Kern County, we are an ag in a wall county. So we've got a lot of similarities. Why Chico? Well, if you look at California, it is absolutely arduous to do business in certain pockets of California because of some of the strenuous regulations. And Chico was that business, is that business-friendly community and is that business-friendly town. So we're here to give a shot in the arm. I mean, we're. Essentially providing a little bit over 500,000 a year in TOT taxes. The estimated revenue to the city over 12 years, excuse me, over the life of the project is essentially about $12 million. Plus the jobs. The jobs. The jobs that we will add to the community. And most importantly, you have at Chico State one of the most phenomenal hospitality programs. And we look forward to partnering with Chico State. And we look forward to partnering with the students. What better place to have students intern? We will have this property managed by Marriott's gold standard. We believe of management companies who will be managing this property. We're happy. We're thrilled. We're honored to come to Chico and move Chico forward together. There's going to be a lot of construction going on. Housing is tough. We're going to have to move it. We're going to have to move it. And as you know, the work to rebuild paradise. Staff, well, not staff, but folks are going to need places to stay. Professors are going to need places to stay. We're in the medical industry business. And we understand that there's going to be an influx of physicians coming here. They're going to need a place to stay. And we believe that this project is a shot in the arm to the community. We're honored to be here. And thanks for having us. Thank you so much. Are there any questions of the applicant before we move on? And I would ask the commission just a friendly reminder. I do not want to reopen the public hearing. So if you have any questions of anybody that came up to speak, let's get them out now. But we will have the applicant up at the end. Commissioner Deremeade? For the applicant? For the applicant, yes. Probably a question for Jim Stevens. In reviewing the site several different times, different points during the day, whatever, the building I call it, the Coletti building, but the building across the street basically from the subject property, any kind of elevation you can tell? I mean, that's a two-story building, but because of the topography, I just wondered if you. We weren't able to get out and measure that. Okay. We thought about it. But it is up. It is up, you know, several feet from where our base is. So it's probably a little bit lower than what we're going to end up being. Yeah. But it's pretty close. Yeah. I tried to measure it myself. My car nose dived into the street. Okay. But anyway. Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Ober? Vice Chair Ober? Yeah. Probably for you, Jim, also. Okay. Kind of a big picture question. Okay. So, were any other sites considered and or any other sites considered or any other sites considered and rejected? And part of the background of this question is whether some of the outcomes that, you know, that are being described, whether they can be achieved somewhere else. That's a good question, actually. And the, what brought this group to Chico was this particular site when it came up for sale. It was, it was free of impact and it was graded perfectly flat. So that was an attraction. Two, the proximity to the senior community was a, was a huge attraction to them. They are, this group has several hotels that they operate and they, they noticed the, the benefit of proximate uses and, and having an opportunity for families to come visit, you know, a constated group of senior folks that don't always, can't return the visit. So, that was, that was a primary motivator for that. And I think that they came up and saw the site and liked it and put in an offer. So, I'm not sure if they did any other research. Okay. Thanks. Commissioner Dermied? Dr. Rameen? Yeah, one more, Jim. I'm somewhat familiar with the history of the site there. It's gone through different thoughts, proposals, offers, whatever. It might be helpful for the commission if we heard what that was. I'm trying to remember. Because I, I know it's had some difficulties in terms of would it work for being retail or whatever. So. Sure. We've been involved in that site for a long time. There was, there was a fellow that owned it two ownerships ago that wanted to do a retail site. He bought it and he could not find tenants. He owned it for two or three years and could not find tenants. It was also kind of low. And so, he had, he was doing another project in town and he did a, he dumped a bunch of his spoil on the site. And if you recall, there were just big humps of rocks and, and spoiled dirt there for many, many years. Another buyer came in and bought it. He was in the process of, of collecting properties around the Merriam Park project. And he ended up deciding not to construct there because he bought the Merriam Park project. And he wanted to sell it and he knew that it wasn't going to be terribly attractive in its current state. So, he hired us to permit the grading of it. There was a little bit of wetlands on the site. And we, we secured a 401-404 to, to take those. Those features and graded it flat and, and in that permit described a developable site. And then this project fits well within that site. Commissioner Walz? Yes. There's been a lot of discussion in the letters that we've received about the footprint of the building and the height of the building. Is it at all possible on that site to reduce the height of the building to three stories and expand the footprint? If we expand the footprint, it, it forces an expansion of the parking area, which encroaches into the landscape area. One of the benefits of the landscape is that we're going to be able to, there's lots of room to generate, like I mentioned, a very robust landscape. But another function is that, is that we're going to do all of our MS4 treatment. MS4 is a post-construction stormwater treatment obligation that the state has. And we're going to be able to develop, we're going to be able to develop a lot of that into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, into, materials and then we have a much cleaner outfall into the system into the public system it's a requirement of the state and and we saw that this with the footprint that they provided this gave us a great opportunity not to have to do mechanical treatment and provide a much more robust landscape so that was why we did that so the answer to my question is no I presume yes yes it is okay okay the other question I have is will you be participating in the road maintenance security patrol and trash cleanup along with the homeowners Association and Sierra well that's an interesting question because I know you're not required to but will you join in voluntarily well actually we haven't been asked you know we have you're right this this would be a good question I think that's a good question I think that's a good question because we have done a tremendous amount of research into this but we have parcel is the next from the Association several years ago I'm not sure why parcel is the next from the Association several years ago I'm not sure why parcel is the next from the Association several years ago I'm not sure why surprised me to find that document but surprised me to find that document but surprised me to find that document but but at this point you know we we have but at this point you know we we have but at this point you know we we have the right to use the road but don't have the right to use the road but don't have the obligations the Association but the obligations the Association but the obligations the Association but haven't been approached frankly you know haven't been approached frankly you know nice gesture on y'all's part. Anything else? I have a couple questions. Matt's favorite thing is when I try to be a traffic engineer up here. So I'm just wondering if you could share kind of with the commission and with the public. It seems like a lot of the concerns and comments that we got were on that use of Sierra Sunrise Terrace. So why wouldn't we have entrance and exits off of Highway 32 or Bruce Road? Well, in full disclosure, I'm a land surveyor. I'm not an engineer either, nor a traffic engineer particularly. I do know that Highway 32, this Caltrans, will not allow another access point on the highway so close to the Bruce Road intersection. And Lauren can probably tell you what the minimum separation is on a state highway is, but it's 1,500 or 2,000 feet. It's significant. Secondly, it's from the same reason. If we take on a second access across Dead Horse Slough and back out onto Bruce Road, once again, we eclipse the city's minimum separation for intersections. So we really can't. And the design guidelines ask us to, you know, take access off the lesser traveled street. And then one other question I was pleasantly surprised. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of a sense of the use of the Sierra Sunrise Terrace to save bike racks, which doesn't seem like we'd have too much use for those with the hotel use. I'm wondering are there any state regulations or city regulations where you would have to have hookups for electric vehicles? I'm not sure about that. I think Mr. Chilson could probably be a better answer for me. But if there's anything else for me. Is there anything else for Mr. Stevens? Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry to put you on the spot. It's all right. Again, Lauren Chilson with Transporation. I personally do not know the state requirements for EV hookups, but just spoke with the applicant, and it's commonly done in their properties. Okay, great. Thank you. Yes, gaining access to a Caltrans facility is difficult at best. I'll just characterize it that way. In general the best practice is to take access to existing roadways where we can serve traffic with you know improvements like a new traffic signal rather than trying to create a situation where you're trying to achieve full access on a state highway near a left turn pocket on a high-speed road, right? That is not the preferred solution. Yeah, it would be exit only and entry off of Bruce. Right and then, sorry to interrupt you, and yes that's true to a degree but people still want to make left turns. So then they make left turns at a signal or u-turn or a median or somewhere else and it introduces other access and circulation issues as a whole in the grand scheme. So very truthfully the the best solution here is to use Sierra Sunrise and local street consistent with city policies and then improve the intersection so that we've addressed those issues. Anything else? I have a couple questions. First for, okay, for staff? For that. Okay, you can go ahead. So I don't know who would answer this. One, you talked about all the jobs. How many actual local jobs versus this management companies that could come in? And what type of jobs are you talking about? Are we just cleaners, maintenance? Well I think that's two different things we're confusing here. The hotel itself will need to hire 30 employees to operate the business and they were initially excited also about hearing about Cheap Estates Hospitality Program. The management of the hotel which is the hiring and firing of the employees, the operational oversight of the of the general manager of the hotel and the review of all the books and stuff like that, that comes from Marriott's program and as a franchisee that's one of the obligations. So the management will be from out of area property? Likely, yes. So your cleaners and handymen? No, no, those will probably be local vendors. Yeah, it's just management of the business end of it. Cheap Estates will have a lot of interns, right? Hopefully. Yes. Building, who's building? I mean it's that could be out of the area too or is there gonna be local builders? Oh, I'm sure that they're gonna want to look locally. That once the plans are once we seek approval here and we get approval at that architectural review then we will go ahead with with the actual construction drawing designs bring it to these good folks and they review them. And then we'll have the next step is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is property and it's been the last couple of months at 92%. Interesting. And this is, as Michael mentioned, there's lots of out-of-town labor coming here to assist in the rebuild up in Paradise and just to assist in the builders here in town. Thank you. And then back to Larry's question, was that a yes or no on the three-story? So yes, you can, or yes, that was a no? It was our decision to go with four-story. What was your question, Larry? Have you considered it? Yes. Thank you very much. We are right at 7.04. We started at 6. How about we take 5. 5 speakers and then we'll take a break. Does that sound okay? Okay. So just a reminder, three minutes. One of the most awkward parts of my job is to let somebody know that their three minutes is up and I kindly need them to sit down. So I hope you can help me by not having to do that because the timer will be right behind me. So if you could kind of keep a watch on that, but I will ask you to sit down once we do hit that three minutes so that we can hear everybody. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Again, if you have submitted a letter, more than likely we have highlighted, underlined, and read that cover to cover, but so if you have anything new to add, it would be great for you to share that with us. And then I would ask, too, that you keep it very on topic to the planning side of this. So we're really looking at land use, neighborhood compatibility, those type of issues. So we're looking at land use, neighborhood compatibility, those type of issues. So we're really looking at land use, neighborhood compatibility, those type of issues. I did see some letters that went a little bit off topic, so I would ask that you, again, keep that to planning. Bruce, do you have anything for me? Okay. Debbie? Good. I'm ready to start this process, if you are. Okay. All right. Let's have a first speaker and then the second one waiting. Okay. So we would ask, we'll call two names. The first two speakers are Kathleen Lamkin and Jeff Lamkin, and if you could both come to the aisle, the front center aisle, and be ready to speak, and then you will have three minutes. There will be a light that comes on that will indicate that you have 30 seconds left, and then it will turn red. So Kathleen is our first speaker with Jeff Lamkin in the aisle, please, and then go ahead. And then the microphone is a sound bar that is straight ahead, and you're not going to see a microphone that's just stand poking out. So go ahead. My name is Kathleen Lamkin. I'm a former president of Sierra Lakes IAEA. I'm a former president of Sierra Lakes IAEA. I'm a former president of Sierra Lakes IAEA. I recently acquired some promotional literature regarding the proposed town place suites hotel, and I'm here this evening to address and refute some of the misleading statements made by its developers. Developers of the hotel would have you believe, and I quote, decades ago the city of Chico earmarked the corner of Bruce Road and 32 for future commercial development to include a large-scale hotel. I don't know which of those statements are true, I don't know which corner they're referring to, but this corner of Bruce Road and 32 was never planned for nor zoned for a hotel, or we wouldn't be even be here tonight considering a use permit. The city of Chico zoned this northeast corner as community commercial because it was intentionally earmarked for the types of businesses that would enhance and support our community. An ideal project for this site as envisioned by our community, these founders, is already under construction on the corner of Bruce Road and East 20th. It's called the B20 Senior Apartments. It's a three-story building housing senior apartments on the second and third floors with the ground floor comprising of restaurant, coffee shop, retail, incidental stores, and the like. A project such as this would not even require a use permit in California Park. The developers also told me that the B20 Senior Apartments would be a great place to build a community of people who are interested in the community. I asked what nearby area are they referring to, certainly not ours. The plan for this hotel does not include a restaurant, coffee shop, or anything else that would benefit our residents on a day-to-day basis, and even the hotel guests are going to have to travel elsewhere to find any amenities that are generally located in, adjacent to, or very nearby a typical hotel. The developers then stated that they would be able to build a community of people who would be interested in the community. We will also be looking at the location of this hotel, and we will be the losers. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Lampkin, and then who's our next speaker? Valerie Perola. Good evening. I'm here to speak on behalf of Judy Sitton who is unable to be here but did write a prepared statement so I'm gonna read that. She says I have lived in the greater Chico area for the past 50 plus years. I've loved going to college here, working, teaching, running a company and volunteering. As an active citizen I've agreed and disagreed with development projects but have understood their importance and the need for the growth and vibrancy of a community. I now have the opportunity to live in Cal Park, an exceptional area with a lifestyle and community for many, particularly seniors. After my husband passed I evaluated this community for its mix in population. Its safety, access to medical services, beautiful views and landscapes with a lifestyle of stability and permanence. A neighborhood where people support and help each other with friendliness and camaraderie. California Park provides this sense of place. It's a permanent living area for people at all stages of life and health from all living situations from those independent to those dependent. It's the largest senior community in Chico. All of these characteristics support a residential community that promotes longevity, a sense of belonging and neighborhood. Cal Park in its current state provides these qualities which should be the focus of our future. Any services added should support that lifestyle. The addition of a hotel does not. A hotel supports a transient population. One that stays for a short period of time, a guest, a board or a traveler. The presence of a hotel in the proposed location would impact wildlife, promote traffic congestion, diminish the quality of the neighborhood's lifestyle and beauty, be a safety hazard to the population and particularly threaten the possibility of meeting evacuation needs required in an emergency. A hotel, excuse me. A hotel is a place where you can live in harmony, harmony with your neighbors, and where you can be a part of the community. A hotel would erode the core of what this community provides now and could in the future. A hotel is driven by a completely different mindset, landscape, set of values and goals and population from what the Cal Park community represents. Please vote no on this hotel in this location. Thank you. Next is Valerie Priola. And Brad. Brad Azevedo is next. So I'm Valerie Priola. I'm the president of the Sierra Sunrise Village. I'm here to speak in opposition of the Town Place Hotel. I wrote nine letters detailing a wide range of issues with the hotel being built on Sierra Sunrise Terrace, a private road adjacent to Chico's largest senior community. Sierra Sunrise Village is a senior component of the Cal Park, a planned community. Sierra Sunrise was designed around a man-made lake with exclusive use path, lots of trees, lush landscaping to give seniors a safe place to enjoy fresh air and keep active. The plan for Sierra Sunrise was to accommodate senior needs. It was a plan that Chico signed off on and that people bought into. People bought their forever home, they bought their home, homes here with the peace of mind that they would live in a private community where they would age in place and be with people their own age and governed by seniors that understand their needs. The vision of the village plaza, lot 59, the site was of the proposed hotel, would sit just outside of Sunrise Village, which was expected to provide services for the seniors that they could walk to. The design of Sierra Sunrise is a gold standard for senior community design, so much so that Chico's homing, City of Chico's housing element just adopted the attributes of our community, i.e., future neighborhoods should include safe, walkable neighborhoods near services, planned housing communities where seniors can age in place. It doesn't make sense to put a regional hotel in a commercial district when there are already 599 rooms in South Chico, 241 are 1.5 miles away, 184 are 2.5 miles, 171 at 3.0 miles. So there's really no need or shortage of rooms on the south side of Chico. Consider the demographics. Seniors to the east, and families with children to the west, neither compatible with an extended stay hotel. This hotel, if built, would portray the trust of this entire community. Thank you very much. Brad Azevedo, next is Jessica Chanola. Good evening. Good evening. modified how I'm going to say this because I have something to refer here to. But my name is Brad Azevedo. I'm the executive director of the Terraces Senior Living Community. Right there, that's about a thousand feet, apparently, up from the proposed hotel. I was asked to come here and share my experience with the Terraces when we were evacuated on November 8th of 2018. You heard that right, right? The Camp Fire from Paradise, directly across the street, Highway 32, was a mandatory evacuation. And we have, at that time, we had 210 seniors living with us. And what I'd like to do is because there's no way I could eloquently describe the story to you in two minutes that I have. But my friend Valerie, who just spoke to you, she wrote you a letter dated March 10th, 2020. It is regarding evacuating senior residents in the Senior Center. It is about a thousand feet away from the Terraces when we had to evacuate. We had to make that decision. It was a difficult one because we were not under mandatory evacuation. But when you have 210 seniors, we had two full tour buses. We had U-Hauls. This isn't something that happens within a 15-20 minute time span. This is something that takes four to six hours to choreograph. And so getting our community to know that we're not going to be evacuated together, evacuating them, as I mentioned, this letter right here is the most eloquent way of expressing what we went through. We have multiple residents right now. We currently have 224 residents on our campus. They're all seniors. Our average age is anywhere from 84 years to 88 years, believe it or not. And evacuating an emergency response is very, very, very high on their list. It's something that's very important to them. They're always asking questions of me of how we're going to evacuate people out of the building. I tell them if we have to do it again, I don't know. It's a miracle we did what we did, but it was what I would call controlled chaos. The site for the hotel is, I think at this time, I think there's multiple other more suitable locations for the hotel site. And I think at this point, I think it'd be probably poor planning to have them on that location simply due to the traffic and the 112 rooms, I believe, what it was, what it was. But that's what we're mostly concerned with is the evacuation. Our seniors are very terribly concerned about how that would work there. So thank you very much. And once again, I please, I refer you to Valerie Priola's letter dated March 10th, 2020, evacuating senior residents in Senior Sunrise Village. So we'll have Jessica and then we will take a break. Hi, Commission. When I heard that there was going to be another hotel, I wondered if somehow I missed something that we were short on hotel spaces. I know we're short on housing here in Chico, especially post-campfire, but the hotel use, I didn't know that we were down and that one was being proposed kind of in a way that was going to be a little bit more of a, you know, a little bit more of a, you know, a little bit more of a, you know, a little bit more of a, you know, a little bit more of a, you know, middle of a neighborhood was very strange. I do support my district six neighbors in asking that you deny this permit. The location is really far from pretty much everything aside from Enloe, that's right there. I can't think of anything else that would be near. So people who would be staying at the hotel would have to drive for anything and everything, including dinner for the night, which typically there's some sort of restaurant next door that you'd walk over to. The extra driving is going to cause, that's just more. And then the other thing is, you know, we're already suffering from the emissions in the air. We are already suffering at a great global warming side effects just everywhere across the world. So any future building we do, we really should be taking the opportunity to keep in mind, are we building safer? Are we building where there's local access to resources? Just when we're building, build safer and smarter. For the environmental impacts, that driving is going to be there and include, it increases the fire risks. And it also includes, with a hotel, their water consumption is greatly impacted. When you have a home, even apartments, people are more considerate of their water use because they have an investment. There's an invested interest in how much water they're using, are they conserving? I've even been guilty in the past of we're going to a hotel then we can take a bath or you know, something that's using more water we typically wouldn't at home. And so we have this hotel use, we have this huge... Charmaine Cagliari... water crisis on top of everything else, and that is just going to use more of our limited precious resource. Banking on the storm runoff, that's a huge gamble because that involves having storms and rain, which is something we don't have in the area very often anymore. We have these extreme droughts. With fire risk, we also have to think about how are we getting people out, like it's been mentioned. My mom, she lost everything in paradise, and it was terrifying knowing that so many of my family and friends were trapped trying to get out. So if there's a fire and we need to evacuate, where are they going to go? They're going to go down Bruce, they're going to go down 32, possibly the Skyway, 20th Street. Those areas are going to be heavily congested because we already have people in homes living in those areas. We're adding in people that are staying in a hotel way into a residential area. I just ask that please just honor the requests of the people who are mostly impacted by such a build. And reconsider at this time, this location, the size of this build that maybe now is not the right time for it. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, we're going to take a 10-minute break. Before we break, I just want to remind my fellow commissioners and then also kind of give you a little bit of a heads up. Since we are in the midst of a public hearing, we can't really converse with you one-on-one because then that would be maybe some information that somebody would have. That would influence their decision versus everybody sitting here today. So everybody up here is very friendly. I know they'd love to chat with you, but to respect and honor that process, we cannot do that. So we'll be in and out of the bathroom, in and out of getting a drink of water, and we'd love to talk to you after the meeting if you're still around after that. But 10 minutes and then we will meet back here at 731. Okay, we're going to get back on track here. I'll let everybody find their seats. That's great. Okay, Chair Scott, Tally Sturm, and Martha Ellington. Good evening. My name is Tally Sturm. And I have come before this city once before on behalf of my neighborhood. I came to Chico in 1967 and moved to California Park in 1984. California Park was the first to have a vision of creating community offering beautiful grounds and neighborhood services. California Park was the first to offer scenic walkways beside waterways in a park setting. California Park was the first to offer scenic walkways beside waterways in a park setting. California Park was the first to visualize a village which would nurture the needs of its neighbors. In fact California Park was so visionary and the concept so far ahead of its time the park stood empty for ten years waiting for society to catch up. When it did Sierra Sunrise Terrace enthusiastically embraced the village concept for its seniors and stated in the 1987 newsletter that quote design work had begun on the village plaza which was to be the commercial center immediately outside of the village gates along Sierra Sunrise Terrace. Quote this is from the newsletter potential success in the community of Sierra Sunrise Terrace is the first step in the development of a new community. The new services to be offered will include travel agency, pharmacy, convenience store, a dinner house, brokerage firms and financial institutions. The intent is to provide the services that residents within the village would be most likely to use and provide them within easy walking distance to the campus. So what happened to that vision? That careful planning, that fabulous design, the commercial strip, the last remaining land designated specifically to build a village for the residents is now being snatched from the very people who created the best and largest retirement area in Chico. In return for their dream of a peaceful retirement in a serene walking community a hotel is being proposed which will offer absolutely nothing to the neighbors who pay for their beautiful backyard. You, as city planners, have a vision for Chico. You believe in going green, you believe in walking, biking, communities, you believe in closely knit neighborhoods, you believe in the village concept and lifestyles. So we ask you, why would you create more car use, and increase traffic, why would you herald additional pollution, why would you decrease the quality of life for your citizens, why would you even consider construction of an ill-suited building in the midst of a retirement community. We are your citizens, and we say a resounding no hotel in California Park. Thank you. Martha Ellington, and next is Greg Steele. Hello, my name is Martha Ellington. I'm the president of the California Park Homeowners Association. I'm here to speak in opposition to the proposed project. You have heard and will continue to hear many compelling reasons why a four-story, 112-room hotel is absolutely a wrong fit for this location on a private two-lane road, which is the main access to Chico's largest senior community. As the president of our homeowners association, I'm especially concerned with how the proposed hotel would affect our residents. The town place suites, as seen in the video, are not the only places where the hotel is located. The town place suites are located in the area of the that alone reveals that this small parcel of land was never intended for a hotel. It was intended to house services and amenities for our residents, specifically within walking distance to our seniors. I would like to focus on item C of the use permit, which is one that must be met. It states that the proposed use would not be detrimental and or cause injury to property and improvements in the neighborhood of the proposed use, as well as the general welfare of the city. The inherently transient population of a hotel is of great concern to the safety and well-being of our residents. I would say that it is especially true of an extended stay hotel, where the population is encouraged to settle in and feel right at home, as it states on their website for the Redding location. Feeling right at home would likely lead to venturing out and exploring the surroundings. Trespassing onto private property and trails is inevitable. Security costs, as well as cost to maintain trails, will increase. Approval of this project would add a financial burden to our residents, many of which are on fixed incomes. This commission may not be aware that the residents of California Park have been very good neighbors to the city of Chico. We pay to maintain the lakes into which runoff from city streets flow. There's been sediment from city-approved projects that contributed to the need to dredge our ponds at the cost of tens of thousands of dollars. The lakes will soon need dredging as well. The lakes are important for wildlife. They are also used by CAL FIRE to siphon water to fight fires that have threatened our area. Approval of the town place suites will be detrimental to safety and would increase the financial burden to our good citizens, who are already shouldering a great burden. I would like this commission and the city to please consider the best interests of their citizens, especially our seniors, rather than the interests of outside developers and outside corporations. Approval of the town place suites will be detrimental to safety and would increase the financial burden to our residents, who are already shouldering a great burden. Approval of the town place suites will be detrimental to safety and outside corporations. Approval of the town place suites will be detrimental to safety and outside corporations.

My concern is the bridge and the road. The bridge is not even discussed in any of the information you've seen, nor the status of the bridge. The bridge was designed by a local firm in 1987, signed off by, 96, 86 signed off by the city. Because of concerns by the bridge, we hired Quince Engineering to do a survey of the status of the bridge in 2012. One of the recommendations for safety of the bridge is biannual inspections. I don't think the city has any information about the status of the bridge. And yet city staff are recommending that this project be expanded with additional traffic on the terraces, which are paid entirely by the Homeowners Association. Two-thirds of our assessments go and pay for the road. Now, attached to what I'm giving you is in October 2004, this is when we met with city staff 18 years ago, in which city staff identified very stringent and costly requirements that we complete before they would even consider accepting the bridge and the road. They basically did not want it. Attached also is a March 6, 2012, letter in which city staff say that the dedication of the bridge provides no clear benefit to the city. In other words, the city as an entity, not the city of Chico. While they maintain that the primary users are local residents or persons associated with the facilities of the area. So they're saying, we will not accept it, and the users of Zero Sunrise Terrace and the bridge are local people. Well, now we have a totally different situation. We have a different situation. The hotel generates significant revenue for the city. That's been pointed out. You're going to get transit tax, you're going to get development impact fees, you're going to get building inspection fees, and yet what's the city willing to do? It can be fairly argued that this will present a high cost liability cost to the residents, and they are responsible for it. Proposed hotel, well, let me just point out, the hotel on December 3, 2019 and March 2, 2020, I gave city staff of 2004 letter and asked still the policy position that we're not going to accept it. There has been no response from city staff to date. It's not included in the information which has been given to the public. I have a lot more to say, but I only have three minutes. Thank you, Mr. Steele. Would you mind giving that to Nicole over here? Sure. Here you go. Here's the documents. Thank you. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole. five years ago and Chico is a special place. It's what brought me here and it's different than other places along 99 like Red Bluff, some of the places that are just stops along 99 and we've kept it different and I'm trusting that our commission will do that tonight. I had some questions for Mr. Chilson that I sent directly to him regarding the traffic analysis study. One of my questions regards one of the statements in his study that says there is little desire for hotel visitors to wander through residential back streets and that it is anticipated that little if any traffic will travel into residential neighborhoods. My question I'm hoping can be passed on to Mr. Chilson is what is his expertise in this area and what was the data used to make that statement? Hotel guests don't travel into neighborhoods. I have some visual aids with me. I can't use I understand but I have a photo of the lake from the fourth floor of the proposed hotel and when I check into a hotel the first thing I do is go for a walk after my long drive and I think a lot of other people do too. Actually the Marriott Corporation thinks that too because they sponsor R.I. Runs, resident in runs and a lot of their properties will give you exact detailed maps of the place you are and where you can go to. I think that's a great idea. I think that's a great idea. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. It is a great approach. principle, complete neighborhoods as community. That's why I'm here. Walkable neighborhoods with multimodal access, bikes, buses, pedestrians. Pedestrian and cyclist traffic were curiously omitted from the traffic analysis and as I understand it, they're part of the highway capacity manual, the requirements for the project, and it was done in San Jose for a similar project, so I'm wondering why our developers did not submit that. I would consider that incomplete, but that's a procedural issue. Also, in the headway traffic study, and Mr. Chilson can probably answer this for you also, it didn't agree within itself which version of the HCM it was using as a reference. It referenced the 2010 manual, but it was submitted to you in 2020 when there was another issue of that. The sixth edition was failed. Available at that time, which was published in 2016. So this does not meet professional standards. It was not a complete study. And similarly... Can I have you wrap up? I'm sorry, we're out of time. Okay. All right. The environmental aspect was my next statement. Do I have 30 seconds? No, I'm sorry. Thanks for asking, though. Mr. Carter, I think I've read your letter twice now. Thanks. Thank you. Knowing that I'm guilty of eight pages of the 265 pages that were attached to your board packet, I apologize, but for fear that maybe it had been overlooked among the other grouping of pages, I provided your staff with additional copies to be handed out to you to date. The general plan is an extensive document. And city staff dealt with it, and there are comments. The two words that we heard, and there are brief, description, was, neighborhood compatibility, with literal description. My letter discusses each and every provision, in the general plan, which deals with neighborhood compatibility, which deals with, in fact, there's a provision, in the general plan, that is, plan mentioned in my letter that deals with the intersection and the importance of the intersection of Highway 32 and Bruce Road to our community. And it deals with the need to work in conjunction with the neighborhood there to make certain that neighborhood compatibility is achieved. Now, as I was sitting here in the comments tonight and thinking about what can I say here? So I'm going to leave you with a word. Ghostbusters. You're saying Ghostbusters? Well, you are the keepers of the key. And I believe in Ghostbusters that person was Zuul. So you are Zuul. First, for whether this project goes forward or not. But more. More importantly, because this is one project that is subject to the general. More importantly, you are the gatekeeper to our Chico's realization of the vision of the 2030 general plan. And my letter is replete with specific references to the vision. And it goes beyond two words, neighborhood compatibility. But neighborhood compatibility is key. So let me just read. I'm not even going to take that time. So please, I urge you to spend some time on that letter. And spend some time determining whether this project can occur in a manner that is consistent with the realization we're only eight years away from 2030. It's time to realize the vision of our 2030 general plan. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I commend you. And I thank you for your attention and for the job you're doing tonight. Thank you. Sandy Gullert and Tim Donahue. Good evening. I'm Sandy Gullert. And I'm going to go back to the beginning. Because that's kind of where I was. The first newsletter by this group. I've lived in Chico since the 1960s, graduating from Chico State in 65. I never envisioned getting old or having to sell my family home in Chico 45 years and move across town to a senior community, Sierra Sunrise Village. Like most younger people, they don't think about the needs of their elders until they are one. In the 1970s and 80s, I played tennis at the Chico State University. I was a member of the Chico Racquet Club with two of the early founders of Sierra Sunrise Village, Jack and Marge Windsor. Jack was a Chico State ceramics professor and recently our new fine art ceramics building to Chico State was named in his honor. A nonprofit corporation was formed with a board of directors that act as advisors to the developers and chaired eight committees. The Endowment Fund Committee was chaired by Marge Windsor. Health Committee, Dr. Hubbard and Bob Rankin. Recreation and Social Committee, Frida D. Bernardi. And Les Wall was elected as the very first president and chairman of the board. They gathered for three years with a common goal to have available a variety of housing and lifestyle options that answer specifically to the needs of the senior living. Sierra Sunrise Village. The park has been written up across the country as a model for other states to replicate. The City of Chico should not forget these senior founders and honor their legacy and vision for a peaceful, safe and walkable senior community. Their plans for the corner Sierra Sunrise Terrace as in their everything's in here was a place for businesses that would support the needs of their community. Such as a gardening center. A coffee shop. Retail stores. Medical offices. A deli. And possibly a weekly farmers market. Not a four story, 112 room, monolithic hotel that would virtually offer nothing of value for the community would operate all hours of the night and threaten their very safety and peaceful way of life. Not only is this project incompatible with the founder's vision. Very simply the hotel is not. It is incompatible with the City of Chico's use permit and their general plan. So please vote no and turn down this use permit. Thank you. Tim Donahue and then Durinda Salvo. Good evening. My name is Tim Donahue. Long time resident. 32 years in California Park. Integrated with Sierra Sunrise. I want to point out a couple things that may not be obvious to people. I left my notes at home. So bear with me. First of all, we're not building the hotel diamond here. This is nothing more than a monolithic four story box designed on a computer aided design. There's one of these on every exit between Tijuana and Bellingham, Washington. There's nothing unique about this. This isn't a community architecture. It's just a hotel. It's unimportant. Secondly, I want to pass out or share. I just happened to get a message. I'm going to catch Mr. Bowers on TV. You're a TV star in Chico, Mr. Bowers. And he said two things when he was given his chance to hit a home run. And I thought we're kind of interesting. The first thing was, if we build this hotel, we'll let Chico know or we'll let the people outside of Chico know we're open for business. Well, the last time I looked, there was not a no vacancy sign anywhere in Chico. And Marion Park is on a rip. And you know what? I like it. I support it. I'm not against building hotels. Hey, that's a nice hotel you guys want to build. I'm all for it. I've spent 35 years living in hotels. Residence hotels are good. But here's another thing I can tell you. Hotels never get better. They always go bad. And they always change names for tax purposes. Let me also point out that Mr. Bowers also said that Chico will benefit $500,000 a year from the hotel use taxes of this hotel. First, I will point out that this hotel will be built somewhere, anywhere with respect to the city. It doesn't matter. You're going to get another hotel. You're going to get many more hotels. This one's just wrong. But it's good to know that really what we're talking about tonight is $500,000 for the city or respect for a community. Now, last of all, I just want to point out that the people who are up here tonight talking, they live here. When people talk about traffic, they drive it every morning. They drive it every night. It's changed. Paradise, the paradigm in Chico traffic completely flipped over after Paradise. When these people talk about fire and evacuation, there's people in this room that ran through a gauntlet of fire to save their lives and watch their homes be destroyed behind them. They're not kidding about this. They're very serious about it. And when they talk about the environment, the people at California Park, the homeowners, Sierra Sunrise, they've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars making this community what it is, the beautiful community it is. So they don't want to see it lost. They pay a lot of money to maintain it. Everything from water permits, treatments, landscape maintenance, and everything else. But that's primarily what I want to point out today. Listen to these people. These people live there. They're Chico. They're Sierra Sunrise. There's people in Sierra Sunrise that have lived there, have been in Chico their entire lives, and I doubt any of you, with maybe one exception, is in that same boat. Thank you. Dorinda Salvo, BT Chapman & Law. That's a tough act to follow. Good evening. I'm Dorinda Salvo. Like many who currently live within the California Park, Sierra Sunrise Terrace, Sierra Lakeside, and Village Green neighborhoods, my husband and I are campfire survivors. We lost our forever home to the devastating wildfire of 2018 in Paradise. And after being in six different zip codes within three months, we were thrilled to find our replacement home on the eastern edge of Chico. The City of Chico has identified the eastern portion of town as being the most susceptible to wildfires in the future since we are at the base of the foothills. I urge the City not to place its most vulnerable residents, the senior citizens, at increased risk by permitting a large number of people to live in the area. We are also looking to build a large commercial building with overnight visitors to occupy a hotel at one of the most congested intersections in town. The need to evacuate your home, even if you are familiar with your surroundings and your community, causes massive chaos. If you're not a permanent resident, the likelihood of fully understanding the magnitude of the emergency will put hundreds, if not thousands, of people directly in harm's way. I've seen literature from the proposed hotel that states we want to be good neighbors. My comment is that my neighbors live permanently in my neighborhood. Guests at a hotel are merely passing through as their permanent residents are elsewhere. I'm sure that some of the people who do not live on the east side of Chico think that a hotel at this location will have no impact on them. While it may not impact on them, it will still be a very important part of the community. It is a flash flood, but there is a flash flood, but there is a flash flood, but there is a flash flood, but there is a flash flood, but there is flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash flood, flash the city. Please do the right thing. Do not abandon the general plan and permit this to go forward. In my opinion, the potential room tax revenue gained from this hotel does not outweigh the safety and welfare of Chico's citizens. Thank you. BT Chapman. After BT will be Janet Pierce. Good evening. This project does not meet three of the five requirements of the Title 19 Chico Municipal Code. Finding B, the proposed use is out of character and detrimental to the general welfare persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use. The immediate use is quiet, restful community of retirees and those requiring assisted living in their own homes. And again, a hotel or other similar business structure was never intended in the California Park general plan. Finding B, the proposal that entitlement is not consistent with applicable specific plan and applicable neighborhood or area plan. California Park is designed for residential housing with no noncompatible structure or uses as the hotel would be finding E, that The design, location, size, and operating characteristics of the proposed use are not compatible with existing and future land uses in the vicinity. The vicinity in this case is California Park and the residential west of Bruce Road. The vicinity excludes the area south of Bruce Road. That's a whole other area. The hotel is pure and simple, out of character to the surrounding buildings and the community. And to the point of future single dwelling and multi-unit construction nearby, driving more residents than the associated need for hotels, 117 rooms is a drop in the bucket and totally out of character with the surrounding area. And besides, the VMT analysis portion of the environmental analysis identifies, quote, a large underserved area west of Bruce Road. And a limited supply of hotel rooms on the east side of Chico. If 589 rooms is limited supply, I don't understand it. Fully defining that term is critical to the overall analysis. And if there is a true need for a hotel, why aren't we looking at some place that has future expansion instead of slam dunking a spot in California Park? Consider the sense of this over the dollars. And that's S-E-N-S-E. Thank you. Janet Pierce. After Janet will be Pam Giuliano. Hi, I'm Janet Pierce. Thank you for having us and hearing us. I know this is a difficult kind of thing to go through. It's very emotional. I know a couple of you have lived here many, many years. So you know what Chico was like when it was newer and when it was simple. And fun and light. Well, a lot of things changed. I became the president of California Park Association, gosh, forgive me, three years ago. And in that time, I decided to make the seniors at Sierra Sunrise my goal. And I spent a lot of time over there with them. One thing that hasn't been discussed here is what the parking on that street will do to the ambulances that go by there and the fire trucks. And all the vehicles that go to, say, save lives of our citizens over there. We have a hospital up there. We have rehab centers. There are multiple buildings, apartments of seniors. Brad spoke of just one building, but there are multiple. When the campfire happened, these people moved into Sierra Sunrise. They moved into Cal Park and literally locked themselves in. They didn't want to talk to anybody. They didn't want to be neighbors, except for people that went through the same experience that was that traumatic for them. They are so concerned. They are so concerned about safety. And as president, it was my job to make sure that I could, anyway, I could help them feel safety. On the brochure handed out by Town Place Suites, they were talking about the benefits to Chico. First of all, a hotel in the corner of Sierra Sunrise Village will be a reminder that people's kids aren't coming to visit them. You know? Many people don't go visit their senior parents. Most people live in town that have senior parents in town. It's kind of universal. Very few travel from out of the area to stay there. The other thing is, my husband is a doctor at the Inlow Outpatient. Actually, he built that building originally. There are no traveling doctors to that facility or nurses. And doctors are rented a house or they're put up by Inlow Hospital in one of their buildings. So that is not necessary for over there. The services that are needed are for the people doing all the construction, which are across the highway. It seems ridiculous. To put that building in Sierra Sunrise Terrace. Those people are terrified to drive anyway. That is just too much confusion. There's been multiple accidents there. One lady even got hit and killed. So I really want you to consider what the city has promised these people by approving this development and letting them believe that they would get things to make their life simple and easy there. I ask you to please vote against this hotel. At the least, consider, I know the owner of Merriam Park owned that lot, consider switching corners so that the people that work over there, the people that need to go to those facilities can walk on foot anywhere in Merriam Park over to food or shopping and put their seniors where we are. I have this for you. If I can send this up. This is a picture of the backup of traffic during the campfire coming from Forest Ranch. Thank you. Pam Giuliano and then Marsha Birch. Hello. My name is Pam Giuliano. I've lived in CalPAC for some 20 years. And I want to commend all the people who have been speaking tonight. Because I feel like the most important thing that you hear from us tonight is the human factor. Reports are great. Analysis are great. All of it. All of those things tell you all these facts. But the people sitting here tell you the impact it will have on their life. And it will. I walk my dogs every day. I walk around the lake. How many people am I going to see coming from that hotel with their dogs who maybe, you know, they don't care about the place like I do. I'm going to make sure I clean up after my dog. I see other dogs I know. I see people that I know. You live in a neighborhood like CalPAC, and you walk, and you're careful. You watch people. Now there's going to be these people who, like that other gentleman said, you know, you stop at a hotel after a long drive, first thing you want to do is go for a walk. This is a great place to walk. Lots of inclines, then there's little flat areas, and there's a beautiful lake. What could be better? But if I see somebody walking in my neighborhood, then I'm like, whoa, who's that person? I've never seen them walking before. And it keeps happening. These days, those are things that we're suspect of. And it's something to consider when you're talking about a long-term kind of a stay hotel. But I really hope that of all the things that are said tonight, that it's the human factor that you're really looking at. And what it is that you would sacrifice for the money that you might make on this hotel, for the human lives that it would impact. Because that's really what's at stake, and that's what Chico is about, or what I, at least, always believed it was. So, thank you very much. Marcia Birch and Marie, I'm sorry, Maureen Kirk. Good evening, Chair Scott and commissioners. My name is Marcia Birch. I represent the California Park Homeowners Association and the Sierra Sun Rise Village Property Owners Association. I sent a lengthy and detailed comment letter. There was a response to that letter prepared by staff on July 13th. In my view, dismissing a lot of really important environmental review issues that I do not think can be swept under the rug. The first one is deferral of the design review. I've dealt with this issue. The city of Stockton was stopped from doing this exact thing by the 5th District Court of Appeal. You cannot say that. You cannot segment the site plan review or the design review in order to save money or time. It's piecemealing of the project. There's an avalanche of case law. It simply can't be done. So, the other problem with segmenting that piece of the review and putting it off to a later time is that you cannot, tonight, make the findings that this is consistent with the general plan. Because there's a design element and you have to make a finding, supported by facts, that this is consistent with that design element. And yet, the design review has been postponed to a later date. So you do not have the factual support to make that finding tonight. And that's item A in the guidelines 15332A in order to approve the infill exemption. One of the things I heard tonight was how voluminous this exemption is. Like, that's a great thing. Exemptions are abbreviated environmental review. It's basically the most truncated version of CEQA review. And you do that when you don't have anything unusual. You don't have any potential for a significant environmental impact. The reason this is so voluminous and you've heard it here tonight, it is an unusual situation. And this is the kind of project that you review with an EIR so that you can look at alternatives. Alternative sites, alternative number of stories, and that's what a full environmental impact report does. It's not generating paperwork. It's fostering excellent decision making. And right now, with this monstrous exemption that has all of these things cobbled together, that's not going to foster an excellent decision. And I really think that these CEQA points are really important. Water quality is not sufficiently addressed. I think the memo, the memos that were online, some of them used the previously expired permits. Those are part of your record. And they are part of the record of proceedings for this project. That is evidence before you tonight. And those agencies found the slough to be a sensitive water body with potential impacts to habitat over the long term. And there's been no analysis of that. So just in parting, I just want to make sure that those documents are part of the record of proceedings for this project. Thank you. Thank you. Irene Kirk. Vic Macau. Good evening. We're here tonight to consider a use permit for a four-story hotel on Sarah Sunrise Boulevard Terrace. And the fact is that because it's not endemic in the community commercial, we have to give it a use permit. I would submit that it is not compatible with our surrounding areas in California Park. And I'll give you some of the examples, the problems. Emergency vehicle access on Sarah Sunrise Terrace would be a problem. Emergency fire evacuations has been mentioned by other people for Cal Park, Canyon Oaks, Sarah Sunrise, and the surrounding community. Security for the lakes and the common areas, which are funded by the Homeowners Association, which has been mentioned and is really a big problem. No amenities within walking distance for the hotel guests. Overflow parking for employees, and I can't quite figure this out. There's 117 spaces and 112 rooms. I know it's not always full, but when it is, where do these employees that are going to have these wonderful jobs, where are they going to park on Sarah Sunrise Terrace? It's a two-lane road. That's just not compatible with California Park or any place where you want to live. And then the signal on Sarah Sunrise Terrace that they're proposing would be so close to Bruce and Highway 32 that when people are turning left, if they're going east and then they turn left on Bruce, all of a sudden they're going to hit this traffic light. The same on coming around down Highway 32, you turn right on Bruce, whoops, all of a sudden. I mean, it's not that many cars there from here, but it's not that many cars there from the traffic light to Highway 32. So I thought the idea of a roundabout was a lot better than a traffic light, but the idea of the hotel is even worse. So let's see. So the community commercial zoning does not include a hotel unless it is granted a use permit, and I would request that the use permit not be granted. And then I have one question for later on. So I'm going to ask you, there's only one week to do an appeal, so I don't know how, isn't it only one week between this and the next one? I believe it's 10 days, but I will make sure that the city staff address that. Okay, I just wonder what the appeal process, thank you. Vic Macau, Sandy Macau. Wow, what everybody's said so far, I can't imagine you guys could do anything but no. But anyway, the reason we're here is really because, I believe, it's because Dan Gonzalez, the developer of Merriam Park, sold this lot as a great location for the hotel. That's basically it. 1.8 million, and look at this. There's a lake right there. Isn't this a great place? It's obviously not compatible with the largest, as everybody has said, it's not compatible. It's blatantly not compatible. And there are many other locations in Chico that a next four-story hotel could be built at. For example, the new Holiday Inn Express is next to Winco, as well as the Hampton Inn is behind the mall. And there are examples of locations that work. These work. That's called excellent planning. I can understand that the city of Chico would like to have more hotels, as we're desperate for more income. The Marriott Corp believes there is a need, and that profits can't be made by building another four-story hotel in Chico, and so they will. They'll find a more compatible location, such as the Hampton Inn and the Holiday Inn Express Fountain. If you allow this project in this location, the vast majority of us in Chico will no longer have faith in the word planning. Thank you. Chair Scott, this is our last speaker, Sandy Macau. I've already sent a couple of letters, but tonight I'm going to talk a little bit about lighting, which is appropriate to the impact. Oh, I'm sorry. I've already sent a couple of letters, but tonight I'm going to address lighting that the hotel will bring to the neighborhood. I do live in California Park. My home and many other homes along Lake West Drive, Edgewater, and in Sierra Sunrise Senior Community will look directly into the four-story hotel and see its constant 24-hour lighting. This hotel is a 24-hour business, which is inappropriate for a neighborhood. The hotel lights will be on day and night, including early morning or early evening, and on overcast days, so there will be a lot of light generated. For security reasons, the hotel will need lighting, rightly so, to keep their guests safe. So our neighborhood will see constant parking lot lights, spotlights, area lighting, flood lights, security lighting on the buildings on all four stories, and lights through each guest's window. This 24-hour light pollution will especially affect the senior community and local wildlife. The hotel is a 24-hour business with in and out traffic at all hours of the day and night. The races get out at 10 o'clock. People go out to dinner. It's really in and out traffic. Even if the hotel is a residence inn, it is still a 24-hour business. And right now, from our home, we can see the two-story office building, which you've referred to occasionally, that's already there on Sierra Sunrise Terrace. It's an office building. They have 24-hour security lighting that we can see from our home, from our backyard. But the building closes after that. It closes after 5 o'clock, making it less impactful to traffic, the environment, lighting, because there's no one in the building after 5 o'clock. This is not the case with this hotel. It will be open 24 hours a day. The Planning Commission supports Chico neighborhoods as well as the needed commercial development. I feel that no neighborhood in Chico should be compromised for the commercial development of our town. A fully lighted, four-story, 24-hour business doesn't belong in any neighborhood or senior community, no matter how good it looks on paper. There are other commercial areas that could better accommodate this hotel project with less impact on traffic, fire evacuation, environment, and light pollution. Thank you. Thank you. And if I could have the applicant come up, we'll have three minutes for them. We'll have three uninterrupted minutes, I will say, and then I'm certain that the Commission will have some questions, so I'd ask for you guys to stay up here. You're not going to send Mr. Wolf up? He will probably need to come up. Okay. I will begin. Do you have questions? Does anybody have any questions for Mr. Stevens? I'll start with one. Okay. We heard some testimony about this being a special use permit, or that this is not a use that would be allowed in this zoning area, and that's why we're hearing that tonight. Can you talk with us a little bit about why we're here tonight from your perspective? Certainly. In the zoning code, it lists all of the potential uses, some of them which are anticipated for this zone. Some of them are by right and need no further review. Some of them, like a hotel or like a multifamily project, need a use permit to, for the hotel, a specific use as a hotel. For a multifamily, they need a use permit to allow residential on the ground floor, which is pretty typical recently. With our housing needs, there have been a lot of those. And so, from our perspective, the hotel is allowed if we can demonstrate that we meet the test of the five findings and that we are compatible, and we believe we do. Any other questions for Mr. Stevens? I think I had a couple questions from the audience, and I think that's our traffic. Let me make sure I have that special use permit. While I'm doing this, Bruce, could you talk to us about the appeal process? Because I know that was a question. Yes, Madam Chair. The appeal process is 10 calendar days beginning the day beginning tomorrow. And it's 10 days. If it falls on the weekend, then it rolls to the next day. So in this case, the appeal period would extend until March, the end of the day, March 1st. Excuse me, August 1st. Okay. Yeah. Mr. Chilson, your expertise in the statement that you made that hotel guests do not wander. Sure. That sentence specifically states in the report, it is anticipated that little, if any, project traffic, that's specifically vehicular traffic, is that reference, specifically vehicles. Will people walk? Sure. Is that a traffic impact? No. In fact, general plan circulation policies call for walkable neighborhoods and the lack of barriers between adjacent developments. So we didn't dive into whether or not pedestrians walking in the adjacent community are a traffic impact or not. They're not. Thank you. So I'm going to say one more time, if there is any question you need to ask of the applicant that will impact your decision, I'm going to ask you to ask it now because I'm going to close the public hearing and you will not have the opportunity to ask that. Done? Yes. Sure. I don't think we have the timer going, so I think we're planning good. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I'll just make this comment with respect to the extended stay. Typically, people are there three to five days, but it's not common for people to be there, you know, 10 to 12 days. But those are people that are going to work. They're going to, you know, I heard the question was raised about, you know, physicians. There's a shortage of nurses, and there's been a full-on race to get traveling nurses to come. So, you know, those traveling nurses would occupy and use that, you know, our type of facility, physicians, professors, so on and so forth. So these are working people that are, you know, leaving typically. So please follow up. Okay. Thank you. Okay. With that, I will close the public hearing, and I will bring it to the Commission. So what happens now is we take into consideration I can't even lift it. It's all over. Everything we've read, everything we heard tonight, everything that was shared with the applicant, and we talk through what our decision is. Okay. So the great thing about democracy and us all being on here is we all come from different viewpoints, and what we're doing is we're balancing what those viewpoints are. Some of us value some things a little bit more than other people value other things, and that's okay. That's how we get the best planning decisions. Tonight, we may not vote the way you want us to vote. We may vote the way you want us to vote, but either way, I would say that nobody on this Commission did not take this decision seriously. Nobody didn't do their homework, and nobody is a bad citizen. We've all been engaged in this process, and we all want to do the right thing. Kind of what we put in our buckets of what the right thing is differs, and that's what makes this a really good Commission. So I hope whatever our decision is, that you all walk out of here, know that you were heard, that you were respected, and that this was something that was not taken lightly by us. So that's my hope. I think we can get there. I'd ask as we're deliberating sometimes, especially on something so emotional, one of the Commission members might say something, and you want to rebut it, I would ask that you just refrain from doing that, take a deep breath, think you're watching a sports game and you're not liking what's going on, so no Sunday quarterbacking. This is an interesting time. I think we're in our realm right here. We might ask staff questions, and if you don't like those answers, that's fine too. I would just ask that you keep those comments to yourself. I have a question for a staff member. Yes, go ahead, Commissioner Wall. For Billy Aldridge, we saw Brad Acevedo come up and discuss the evacuation from Sierra Sunrise, and I would like to know what the police department's opinion was on the evacuation process for Sierra Sunrise is, has been, and would they be working with him in the future to smooth out an evacuation scenario? Thank you for the question. I did pay attention to Mr. Acevedo. I would say that some time has occurred, time and distance has occurred since the Camp Fire. We've worked with the county to create a robust evacuation system, and we've worked with the city to create a robust evacuation system. You've probably heard it, know your zone. And so what we did is got onto the same pattern as the way the county did with their evacuation processes. I actually did the city's evacuation plan, and taking into account that the Cal Park area is one of our greater threatened areas from wildfire. Fire typically, if it's going to come to Chico, is going to come from the east. We already had a wildfire management plan through the fire department. I took it a step further and created zones throughout Cal Park. And what that allows us to do is have a very manageable way to evacuate neighborhoods. So if you get onto the city's website, get onto the police department's website, the sheriff's department's website, you'll see the evacuation mapping. And so looking into the future, if we had a significant incident requiring evacuation, coming from the east, we would be able to manage that through those zones. We would know it's coming, and it would have, I would agree that we had significant time to evacuate that community in a more manageable manner than we did during the campfire. Having said that, you know, I can't control a business's evacuation plan, but I can work with them to make it more efficient. And that is something that we have to do. And I think that's something that we have the pleasure of doing sometimes. And I look forward to any business that asks me for assistance in reaching out, and I can do that for them. Great. Thank you very much. Any other questions of staff? You thought you were just here to keep the room decorum, huh? I do have a quick question. parking on the streets. It is a private street. Therefore, do you agree, of course, on the word? Sorry. There we go. That would be me. So we have had this question multiple times about traffic laws in Sierra Sunrise Terrace, behind the gates up in Canyon Oaks. Typically, when it's a privately owned area, we have to have an agreement with those folks that we will enforce traffic laws. And we do have a lot of traffic laws in those areas. The one thing that doesn't apply is, you know, an unsafe condition or, you know, someone parking in a disabled spot. Those are all, you know, things that are mandated by the state law, the vehicle code. So we would have access to enforce that kind of stuff. Having said that it's a private area, it still doesn't mean that they can't request our assistance. We always do what we can as calls. You know, as calls come in and we can manage those to respond to any of those complaints that come into us. So in this case, if we had a significant issue where the residents were seeing, you know, reckless driving or speeding or unsafe parking or even someone trespassing, parking on those private lands, they could certainly call us and we could have them removed. So if we don't have... I know we don't have a traffic law, but we do have an agreement with Sierra Sunrise residents to have a traffic enforcement in those areas. So it's kind of good and bad. It's good in that if someone's parking in that area, their residential area, the person's then trespassing, which is a violation of the penal code. So they can have them removed per that trespassing section. It's bad in that if they want us to come work, you know, we have complaints about speed in that area, you know, we have to come back to the area. It's private. Therefore, we'd have to have an agreement with them to enforce those laws on their private land. I know you're not busy at all. Just slightly. Thank you. Question. The road has come up a number of times. From Bruce Road going east on Sierra Sunrise Terrace, what is... Is parking allowed at all or not at all? I've... Everybody's alluded to it and... It's private road, so I just... So I believe Sierra Sunrise Terrace is private from Bruce Road all the way to Idlewild. And so I don't believe they allow any parking on that roadway. I do know in the residential areas, they have signage that allows parking for those folks. I can't remember, and I'm sure someone here could answer the question, but I believe there was some signage on permitting that... You have to have a permit to park in some of those areas. Just like we do... The city has that on, like, the East Washington, you know, West Washington, East Francis Willard, all of those areas here close by. Thank you. Do we have a representative from the city attorney's office here? Okay. I'd love to ask the question that was brought up on the order in which we are reviewing this. And are we violating... Oh, no. Sorry. That literally is the Zoom app, so I apologize. Okay. Are we violating any laws or ordinances or anything by hearing this tonight and then it going to the architectural review? And then it's going to the architectural review and historic preservation board? Well, it's pretty terrible when you can't see yourself, so that's probably good. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and ask the question. So, I'm going to go ahead and ask the question. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and ask the question. So, I'm going to go ahead and ask the question. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and ask the question. So, I think that you can proceed in that way. Thank you. Any other questions? All right. Who wants to talk about bridge inspections? Matt? Got a call, I think it was last Thursday or Friday from my old friend Greg Steele, and he had asked me that question if the city would consider accepting the bridge in that portion of Sierra Sunrise Terrace adjacent to this parcel. As a result, I sent out an email to the department heads requesting input, knowing that I owed a response to Greg and the Planning Commission if the issue came up tonight. I think it was Monday, didn't get a response, sent another email, a couple more emails on Tuesday, and it was decided by our Public Works Director, both Engineering and Maintenance, that we would not. be interested in accepting that portion of the roadway. So I did talk to Greg this morning and let him know the decision that were made by our Public Works Directors. The one thing I talked to Larry Wall about a little bit, too, is the fact that when this map and subdivision was created, it actually has a 100-foot traffic device easement over the first 100 feet. So when the subdivision was created, there was thought that sometime in the future, there may be some need for a traffic control device, either signal or something like that. So it actually created an easement so we have the ability to put in the signal poles, cut in loops, have cameras or whatever we need to do that that already exists. Thank you. Well, I'll offer just some observations and comments as we get closer to making an actual decision here. One is I found it interesting that in the trip generation comparison, that the comparison, and this is an important piece because we're talking, a major concern of the neighborhood, the neighbors, is the amount of traffic, both related to disaster response as well as just general congestion and traffic in that area. And I find it kind of interesting that the comparison that arrived at this being a fairly minimal impact compared to other permitted land uses, and the comparison was to a medical dental office of 60,000 square feet or a fast food drive-through restaurant, as opposed to... a flower shop or a health food store or something. So I found that interesting that that comparison was made. But I think as much as that, the rationale for this specific location, and I asked this question earlier, the economic impact, the benefit to the community through TOT, the fact that we have a need for, you know, professionals to stay, a place for professionals to stay, as they come for a slightly longer duration of time, the fact that it's near senior care. And I asked the question, and I... all of those same benefits, it seems to me, could be found in any number of other locations. So I'm not clear why those benefits, that rationale, leads us to this specific location. And I guess for me, it comes back to what a number of people spoke to, which is the importance of the general plan as it relates to both compatibility and kind of the foundational principle of the general plan, as I read it, which is this concept of complete neighborhoods. As well as what I think is important as a planning commissioner, as well as just a 30-year resident in Chico, that the general plan asks us to make these kinds of decisions based on actual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. I mean, that's a key component of this, all through the general plan, creating walkable, bikeable neighborhoods, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and then our reliance on automobiles, increasing in density, particularly in the city core. And so, as well as the need to focus on infill, and I understand that technically this is infill, but I think by the kind of common sense, as well as some very specific neighborhood elements and references in the general plan, to consider this infill as a bit of a stretch, I think most of us would tend to point toward more of the core or the opportunity corridors as places, which as far as I can tell in my research, this is not an opportunity corridor. Highway 32 beyond Bruce Road is, I believe, not. So infill really applies in the general plan, as I read it, to the core as well as opportunity corridors. And so again, I'm not sure that infill, that it meets the standard there. I think it's a good idea to have a lot of for me. So I'm struggling with finding a way to to support this. And I have some other thoughts too, but I'll say them, because I'd be curious to hear other commissioners. Just as a basis for a couple of my comments, as a, I guess, public notice or whatever, I spent 40 years in real estate sales in Chico and spent a lot of time in these neighborhoods, sold a lot of houses in those neighborhoods. It's a great place and it's a special place. And so I'm very sensitive to, you know, what some of the people have been saying in terms of feeling it's detrimental to the health and safety, their welfare, whatever. And so, yeah, I'm struggling too to feel that this is the best place for this hotel. Anyway, I'll start off with that. I've got a couple of things to... I guess I'll jump in. I'm always careful with my words when we have attorneys and press in the audience. So I really didn't want to speak much. But I guess I will say, one, thank you all for coming out. I wish we had this kind of turnout on all of the projects we had. You know, everything that we approve impacts the neighborhood. And it's great to see all of you here and participating and really trusting us and knowing that this could be a place where you would be welcome and be heard. So I want to start with that. I really respected the speaker who said something about the human element of this. But I want to put that aside for a minute and say one of the things that I love about being on the planning commission and I love about land use is a lot of the times we don't consider the human element. And that gives me security in knowing that what we're looking at sometimes is very black and white. There is some wiggle room. But most of the time the opportunity is to provide consistency to property owners, consistency for investors, consistency and upholding of private property rights. And so what we're looking at is what we have to balance is when we have hard decisions is where does that line cross and what piece do we uphold more. I think for me, if I take away the consideration of TOT tax, not even something that I'm considering for this project, I take out, you know, any of that soft element that those things that pull on our heartstrings when I look at the black and white of Title 19, which is what we are called to do. The council has another charge. But what we are called to do is to look at the black and white of Title 19. Title 19 actually doesn't say that hotels aren't an allowable use. So there's something very specific with use permits. It either it's allowed if it's spelled out, which is really easy because if it's not there, it's not allowed. Or there are some uses that we say you can have a use permit and we just take an extra look at it. Hotels are under that. And so this is something that when somebody went to buy a piece of property, they didn't know what they were going to use it for, but they said here's the list of what we could do without a use permit and here's the list of what we could do with a use permit. What we're not here tonight is here's a list of what we could do with a use that was not spelled out that we could do in Title 19. And Mr. Stevens was exactly right. We're not asking for a rezoning of this property. We're not asking for any extra modifications of what's allowed. 57 feet is allowed. That's more than four stories if we're thinking 10 to 11 feet per story. So everything fits in with the integrity of Title 19. And that's what I struggle with. Somebody made an investment in this property, trusting in the integrity of Title 19, knowing that there would be a public process, but that this would be something that would be as long as they hit those metrics of the use permit, they would be granted that. Now, we could argue the neighborhood compatibility, and I will fully admit I don't live in the neighborhood. I am going to walk out of here, and not see the day-to-day impact of that. That doesn't mean that this decision doesn't weigh heavy on me. But I really feel like when we're looking at a decision for this, that is the only thing that we can consider is the neighborhood compatibility. There's nothing else that doesn't meet the nature of Title 19. And that was a lot longer than I wanted to talk. I agree with you, and I'm very conflicted, because I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this. I believe in building and doing what you do with your land. It's your land. You bought it. Build on it. But there are two things out of the five that I'm having some struggle with this. So I'm writing down notes and going through and cross-crossing. And yes, there's black and white. I agree with you, Tony. There's black and white, but some of these are not black and white. They are opinions, and that's where I'm having some trouble, because my opinions are reading emails. I know these. So it's going to be tricky, and I wish there was an easier solution, or we could get both groups together in a back room and figure some things out, and both parties win. But we're not at that stage. But that's it. And I do thank everybody for being here. You guys have been a great group. I was expecting a little bit crazier. So thank you, and just know that I'm having anxiety attacks up here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I am. Thank you, Larry. So yes, I mean, we've got essentially the five things to consider here. And I believe that the use permit does not meet two of them. It is, I believe, demonstrable, demonstrable, that it's inconsistent with the general plan. I also believe that it's not compatible with the neighborhood. And so therefore, I'm going to offer a motion. I move that the Planning Commission not adopt resolution number 22-04, thereby denying the use permit application of 19-25 and the architectural review application 19-22 for the property identified as APN 018-2302. Can I pause for a minute? Can I pause for a minute? Am I allowed to have a negative motion that we not adopt something as opposed to... Yes, Mr. Chairman, this is Scott Emman from the City Attorney's Office. Any new staff report, any new staff report that the person recommended that there's going to be a denial that you voice your opinion voice why you think there should be a denial and each planning commission should be allowed to do that. And then we would take that information and prepare a resolution with those findings for your adoption at the next meeting. Okay. So maybe I could have you change your motion to move to deny as opposed to move to not approve. Certainly. I mean, the intent of my motion was simply to deny the use permit application. So if that triggers, you know, something coming back to us, I'm okay with that. But that's certainly my intent. I think from what Mr. Nichols is saying, I think he wants us also to reference a particular letter. And I thought I had met that threshold, but I'll say it again. Just give us the letters again. Yeah, sure. Again, I believe that it fails to meet the threshold of two of the five components of the – that would have left the – Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee Use permit application. Let me get the exact number here. The permit number? There we go. Okay, so we have a motion that the Planning Commission deny resolution number 22-004, use permit application 19-25 and architectural review application 19-22 for the property identified as APN 018230001 based on the fact that the project fails to meet the threshold outlined in item D and item E. Is there a second? I'll second. So we have a motion by Commissioner Ober and a second by Commissioner D'Armendi. Is there any further discussion? All right, I'll call for the vote. All in favor? Signify by saying aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. And all opposed? No. No. So that motion carries 3-2 with two absences. I'd ask that everybody please stay in your seats and we'll get through this very quickly. Bruce, can you outline what the process is from here? Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to commend you and thank you. Those findings are good. We have those D&E and that's clear to us. That you do not believe that they can be made in the affirmative. That's good enough for us. All I need to remind everybody and I think the applicant understands this is that there's a 10-day appeal period. It expires on August at the end of the day on August 1st. The hearing that was originally anticipated to be scheduled for the Architecture Review Board will, even though we had to notice and send out the staff report and the notice and everything, will post that. We will post the notice of cancellation tomorrow. So there will be no need for the subsequent hearing on the Architecture Review Board. So as it stands now, the project's been denied and the appeal period is open until August 1st. Okay. And we will post the notice of cancellation for the special meeting that we were going to have on the design of the project. Okay. If everybody could give me two more minutes, I'll close out the meeting. All right. So we will move on to reports and communications. I don't have anything to add other than we're going to recommend continuing. We don't have any items for your August 4th meeting. Okay. And that's great. I will not be available at that meeting. So fabulous. Okay. Item five, regular agenda. We have none. And we will move to item seven, adjournment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I was going to amend yours and add another letter to it, but that's all right. We didn't need to. What? Oh, let me hear. Yeah, I think we'll see. Yeah, pretty sure.
