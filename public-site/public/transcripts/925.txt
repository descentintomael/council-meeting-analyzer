 All right, well, it's 6 o'clock.  Calling to order the City of Chico Planning Commission meeting of Thursday, November 5, 2020.  And Mike, should I first read this note about public participation, or should I do that later?  You can do that at the start of the public hearing, maybe, or now, whatever your preference.  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure if you're accessing the meeting through WebEx,  you are aware that we're hosting the meeting in part through WebEx.  So thanks for joining us.  Our first item on the agenda is the call to order and 1.1 Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.  So please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.  Pledge, salute.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right, you may have a seat.  And we're moving on.  1.1.2, roll call.  Could we have the roll call, please?  Commissioner Rensick?  Present.  Commissioner Scott?  Present.  Commissioner Wilbur?  Here.  Commissioner Howlett?  Here.  Commissioner Deremedy?  Present.  Vice Chair Arumal?  Here.  Chair Goldstein?  Present.  All right, item two, consent agenda.  It looks like we just have 2.1 approval of the minutes.  Hopefully everyone's had a chance to review those.  And...  Do you have any minutes, Madam Chair, for this one?  Okay.  We don't have any...  Sorry, I didn't hear all of that.  We don't have any minutes to be approved on this agenda.  Okay, yeah.  Normally we would have put none on there,  but we overlooked it.  But we'll have those minutes on for your next meeting.  That makes sense.  Why I didn't see them.  Thank you.  So then we'll move on then to item three,  business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the Commission  at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda,  with comments being limited to three minutes.  The Commission cannot take any action at this meeting  on requests made under this section of the agenda.  And as I mentioned, we're holding the meeting  through WebEx, so those of you who are attending,  virtually using the city's WebEx platform,  you're encouraged to register in advance of the hearing  by emailing zoning at chicoca.gov.  And I believe Mike can add to that.  I think you can raise your hand  or otherwise say that you have an item.  Yes, during the public hearing when people wish to speak,  you can raise your hand using the hand raise button on WebEx.  You can also just, you know,  just wait, we will go down the list and just invite people  to address the Commission one by one.  So if anybody has business from the floor,  please raise your hand or otherwise alert staff.  We have a question from staff.  I don't know if it's a question or not.  I'd just like the Planning Commission to meet Chris Duffy.  He's been working for the city for how long, Chris?  Two and a half years.  So anyway, he recently, well, he had been working with me,  but he recently got reassigned and he's now the senior engineer  for storm drain and sewers.  So as we move forward, there's a lot of discussion  about capacity of sewers and storm drains and all.  So he plans to come to the meetings to just get a feel  for working with you folks  and understanding the bigger projects as they come along.  So anyway, glad to have you here tonight, Chris.  Thank you.  Thank you and welcome.  Congratulations and welcome, Chris.  There are no hands raised.  I believe the people in the attendee list are all here  for the item.  That would make sense.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  And I think we can move on to item four, public hearings.  So the public hearing guidelines will have our announcement  of communications, staff report,  commission discussion, and then we'll open the hearing  to public input where we'll hear from the applicant,  and the public, and then further commission discussion after that.  So if you're a member of the public, make sure that you alert us  that you would like to speak, but I think we'll also go  through the list in case anybody is having difficulties contacting  us so that we can all have a chance to speak.  So moving on to the item, it's 4.1, use permit 20-02.  And I think we're going to have a little bit of time  to get to that.  First, any ex parte communication?  None.  None here.  I have nothing to report.  None.  All right.  I think we can move on to our staff report then.  Thank you, Madam Chair,  and good evening Planning Commission members.  This project is located at the southwest corner  of Greenfield Drive at Esplanade.  It's zoned OR, office residential,  and it has an overlay district  of a corridor opportunity.  It's a corridor opportunity site where the city allows higher  densities and taller buildings.  Surrounding uses include R1 to the west,  CC community commercial across the street to the east, and OR  up and down the Esplanade north and south of the project site.  Currently undeveloped, the site is 2.85 acres in net.  It's 3.14 acres gross.  We use the gross calculation  to determine the allowable density.  Site plan shows one driveway access off of Greenfield Drive  leading into a parking area situated along Greenfield Drive  all the way out to the Esplanade and along the rear  of the property abutting the R1 single-family homes behind.  Primarily featured on the site plan, there's three buildings.  And I'm sorry I mentioned there's a high-rise building,  but there's 128 parking spaces proposed in the parking area.  The main building is an apartment building.  It's L-shaped at the southeast corner of the site.  It would be three stories in height with cantilevered floors  above the first at the ends of the L.  It would contain a total of 62 units,  and it would have the minimum front setback of 15 feet  and a 60-foot rear setback.  I guess this is a good time to mention that the site plan  provided in your staff report as attachment C  has now been superseded by one that we provided to you  yesterday in an agenda that we posted online  and forwarded to you and also printed out.  It's on your chairs tonight.  And that includes five-foot parkway strips along Esplanade  and along Greenfield Drive that we were able to obtain  from the applicant this past week.  In addition to the L-shaped building,  we have a two-story clubhouse, recreational-type building  with two additional units in it.  And between those two buildings, there would be a pool area,  an enclosed kind of yard.  Also, there's a 2,000-square-foot cafe proposed on the corner.  In the O.R. district, multifamily residential uses  require use permit approval.  Tonight we're here with a use permit where they're proposing  to have the multifamily use on this O.R. district.  for the design review application for the O.R. zone site.  And in the future, a design review application will be  required for site design and architectural reviews.  But we're not really looking at that tonight.  However, I do have some drawings that depict the massing  and what we can expect at that future design stage.  This slide shows a south-facing view from Greenfield Drive  with that clubhouse that I mentioned in the middle, with,  of course, that building that is that of that of that of that  of that of that of that of that of that of that of that of that  of that of that of that of that of that of that of that of that Here you see the massing from the Esplanade side of the project where the front of the building facing the Esplanade would look like that. And then you see the cafe  You see the cafe in the lower right hand corner of the slide.  Here's a section diagram that would show  how this three story building with its cantilever  toward the, off the rear,  how that would relate to the single family home behind  and a presumed street tree in front.  And then there's also this fourth story element  that's situated in the middle of the building  that would provide some rooftop open space.  As we stated in the staff report,  this project is a housing development project  pursuant to government code section 65589.5,  the Housing Accountability Act.  So we evaluated the project,  whether it met the city's objective design standards,  and we believe it does.  And like I mentioned, design review would be at a future date.  So with that, our recommendation tonight  is that the Planning Commission hold a public hearing  and determine that the project's exempt  from the California Environmental Quality Act  as an infill project and make the use permit findings  by adopting resolution 2014  and approving use permit 20-20.  And with that, I'll answer any questions you have.  Thank you.  All right, questions for staff from the Commission?  If we have one.  Well, I'll jump in.  Okay.  I got a whole bunch.  Me too.  First of all, reading through the comments  from the neighbors, in particular one gentleman,  some of them raised some questions for me  that I also highlighted on my report  when I was reading through it.  Have you addressed those to the letter writer,  or has there been any communication with him regarding that?  Questions that we received early on,  have had a back and forth with Associate Planner O'Connell.  We were getting some comments back in August  after the neighborhood meeting for this,  and there was some back and forth more recently.  And as we approach the meeting,  we tend to just forward those onto the Planning Commission,  especially when they're voluminous.  But I'll answer any specific questions you have  about any of those.  All right, well, I'll jump in with a couple.  I'm having a little problem with the compatibility  and complimentary to the neighborhood.  I'm doing this from memory,  but I believe when that Webb Homes  did that whole Amber Grove subdivision,  I think there's around 420 houses or something.  This is gonna add, you know, a substantial,  you know, about a sixth of what they have there,  all in that one street of Greenfield.  Anyway, so I have issues with that.  And also, just the fact that we're in a neighborhood  where we have a lot of commercial areas,  and the other commercial areas,  like for example, on Amber Grove,  Robert and Toby Stornetta's project  that they did on Amber Grove Drive,  the one up where Webb Homes and Rolls Anderson rolls,  all that at Yellowstone, you know, are all single story.  Ray Morgan obviously is a little taller,  but nothing's three stories long there.  So I had problems also with the compatibility  in that respect.  So I don't know how much latitude we have in terms of,  defining what the applicant can do  in terms of how many stories.  So that would be a question to you.  Okay, yeah, the other buildings in the area  don't determine the allowable number of stories,  the heights for this project.  The city's zoning code does,  and I believe since all of those buildings  that you mentioned have been developed,  the city has adopted a new general plan,  which points toward these highly traveled  commercial corridors like the Esplanade as places  where we can have a lot of commercial space,  and that's where the city wants to see higher densities,  larger projects to support bus transit  along those corridors.  So this project is consistent with that sort of direction,  which would allow an even taller building here.  Yeah, I understand.  I'm just, it's the whole compatibility issue,  not whether, I mean, we're running into this a lot lately,  where, you know, is it, you know,  sure it fits the little zoning things and, you know,  all the overlays, et cetera, et cetera,  but is it right?  Is kind of, you know, is it compatible?  Is it the best thing for the area?  So anyway, that's, I'll stop there and come  up with some more later.  Well, I think that, if I may jump in.  I think that the, I have quite a few questions.  Can you please go back, and we'll start from the top.  Go back one screen.  Not that one.  The one where you can see the back of the house, and,  there we go.  So we have, this is a,  this is a highly contested project,  and we are in a housing crisis.  We understand that.  And so I want to preface my scrutiny here,  because I have quite a few questions for you, Mike.  I read the memos from our neighbors,  from our community members, and they are concerned.  They're concerned with compatibility.  They're concerned with the height.  So.  So before I go through my notes of replying to these memos,  because I think it's really important that we respond  to our community and we answer their questions.  What I heard you say right now was that because of the,  because of the Housing Accountability Act,  we have some limitations.  We, that you are, and also some opportunities to develop.  But.  But the pressure, the pushback is that it's so big.  It's so tall.  And it is in an existing neighborhood.  So looking at this, one of the things that I read from one  of our neighbors is that are they going to be able  to see in my backyard?  Are they going to be able to look in my kitchen window?  Where we, where we, where we reside?  So.  Okay.  How do you, how do you respond to that?  How do we respond to that?  I know it's not you, but.  I guess I would say I don't know the answers  to those questions specifically.  But I believe there will be windows rear facing  on the building.  And where potential sight lines exist, visibility will occur.  Where there's vegetation blocking those sight lines,  they would not be able to see through the trees.  So, well, maybe they would  if they're deciduous trees this time of year.  So I guess I don't know the answer.  I think it's a good answer to those questions.  Because I also notice in this photograph that you talked  about the fourth layer.  Because there's going to be some space up on the roof.  I think that's super cool.  I just don't know if, you know, I mean I'm thinking if I lived  in the house behind there, would I be, would I be concerned  with parties or activity going up and going on up there?  And I'm home with my kids or my baby and, you know,  do I feel unsafe or?  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that that is the concern here.  I think that that for me, I understand  that we have limited, that either we approve the,  either we approve this or we don't.  I think it's kind of what you're here for.  The question is whether we're going  to approve the permit or not.  I'm not going to go there.  But I do want to address some specific questions.  There's a lot of talk about Ray Morgan and issues  with something that occurred in the past.  And oh, you know, it was a, I'm thinking to myself  as I'm reading this is why do we continue to talk about Ray Morgan?  So can you please enlighten us on what that whole thing is about?  Ray Morgan is north across Greenfield Drive  from the project site.  And it's been developed initially I believe in 2003.  And then there's an additional building constructed in 2015.  Okay.  And when they approved that project in 2003,  the site plan showed pad sites where  that new building was constructed.  And the lag between the two I think resulted  in misunderstanding of the neighborhood  and what could be built and where it would be built.  If anybody had asked planning staff at any point in time,  we could have shown them that site plan that was approved  in 2003 and showed them that there's a building pad  right there, you should expect a building right there.  So it was just kind of a surprise.  The development was a surprise for?  I believe it was a surprise to many of the neighbors.  2003 I think is also close to the time  that those houses were constructed.  So there may not have been very many neighbors  that could have been around to watch, see that meeting occur.  The other consistent concern is the traffic.  And how are we going to be able to, the disruption  to their lives is a big concern.  And I think that's a big concern for us currently.  Tell us about the traffic, control of traffic.  Well besides the one driveway on Greenfield Drive,  which is where we prefer to see them start, I guess I'd defer  to Matt Johnson to talk about what kind  of traffic we could expect.  I mean there will be traffic.  I will say that.  Well there's 62 units.  So 62 units, they're one bedroom, two bedrooms.  Or they're both, I think.  I think traffic's based  on the number of people that are in the building.  on the number of units.  So on a single family home,  they develop one peak trip per hour.  But I think on a multi-family residential, it's like .7.  So .7 times, how many units, Mike?  Sixty something?  So that's about 40.  So it's less than one a minute peak trip.  Some of them will be coming.  Some will be going at the intersection.  So from a traffic standpoint,  there's not going to be any changes.  We're going to have continuous traffic  on Esplanade with a stop controlled intersection  at Greenfield.  Obviously when we did our general plan and traffic studies  for the entire city, this was noted as a multi-family project.  So it was expecting that much traffic.  This isn't a surprise.  So that's pretty well it.  Thank you.  Personally, I think it's an exciting project.  I just don't.  I don't like the pushback because it's not my neighborhood.  It's somebody else's neighborhood.  One of the other, thank you.  One of the other questions, I'm really concerned  about the barriers between the, we had discussions,  neighbors that are talking about car lighting, car lights,  headlights going in their backyard.  Just real basic fundamental concerns  that can disrupt our daily lives.  How already it's high?  It's high.  So that's already a negative.  I don't know what we can do about that.  I mean, do I tell the developer, hey, can you bring it down?  Can you cut it down?  Is that appropriate?  What is that?  What do we do?  What kind of, what is it that we can do  to impact this type of project?  I guess I don't really understand that question.  Well, the developers have, they have a design.  The design is in front of us.  We are here to approve the permit.  The first fundamental issue is that it's too high  for the community and the community members are concerned.  What sort of, what sort of repercussions, what sort of power,  what can we do to help decrease that concern?  I think it's accurate to say that the Planning Committee,  the Commission has three options tonight.  It is to approve the project, approve the project with  conditions or deny the project.  Denying the project would trigger the additional burden of  having to make findings that are required by the Housing  Accountability Act that this project would cause a  significant health and safety issue in the neighborhood and  that would need to be supported by substantial evidence and  there would be further findings that our Assistant City Attorney  could elaborate on that would require us to also find that  there are no feasible options to prevent said significant impacts  of the project.  Who would do the research on doing that sort of?  We have done the research and we don't feel that those findings  can be made.  I'll take a break.  I'll be back if anybody else wants to, I have more questions.  But, sure.  You can go first.  Yeah, okay.  I'll just speak really quickly.  I think, and I'll just say this.  I'll speak in favor of the design.  I think, I know the site pretty well because I used to teach at  the Montessori school that was on the other side there.  So I've retrieved many of all from this site.  The way the project is laid out, I think, really looking at it  makes minimal impact on the neighbors, the adjacent  neighbors and I say that for a couple of reasons.  One, if you're looking at the way the, the design is being  laid out, the buildings are laid out, there's really, in terms  of impacting the neighbors, first of all, there's 65 feet of  distance in the back, or 60 feet of distance in the back.  Right.  I don't want to 60.  So that's, that's quite a bit of distance.  I mean, they obviously could have developed closer.  Is that right, Mike?  If they...  Yes.  They're exceeding the minimum setback.  Right.  Yeah.  Exceeding minimum setback by quite a bit.  And, you know, there's plantings there.  There's a tall fence.  And so I think...  I think, Lupita, that would help with the lighting, the lighting  issues of cars pulling in there and that kind of thing.  That's absolutely a concern.  But with proper fencing and proper plantings, you can  minimize that.  And then the other thing is, in terms of where the buildings are  positioned on the site, they're positioned up near the front.  And most of the height of the buildings appears to be up near  the front on the street side, where it's, you know, going to  have the...  So the impact really is going to be from people driving by the  project.  And so in terms of having views into yards and that kind of  stuff, I only see a couple apartments on the very end.  And I'm trying to see if they're numbered.  Is that like 16R, 18R, whatever that is right there?  Yeah, it's like...  I'm looking at it upside down.  Right next to the trash bin.  X0...  X01, X02.  You know, I'm thinking there's windows on the corners of those  units.  I'm not sure.  Those would obviously be, you know, fairly high.  But is the parking going to be covered, Mike, does it say?  There are some covered parking spaces where you see it  cantilevering over at the ends of the L.  Yeah.  So that's going to do...  You know, that'll...  Their view will probably be covered parking.  And again, I think those things can be minimized by having  plantings and that kind of stuff.  It's not like there's a large number of apartments that are  directly overlooking adjacent homes.  On the site where the old Montessori school is there, that  would probably be my biggest concern in terms of having an  impact on the use on that site.  So that would...  That's a little concerning, but again, I mean, I know there's a  There's mature trees that are on that side.  And I know for a fact in those particular buildings that there's  no...  On that property line side, there's no doors.  There's nothing.  All the uses of the buildings on that site open up toward the  other way.  So it would really have minimal impact.  So I think they did, to reach the density requirements that are  where they have to achieve under the objective standards, I think  they did a pretty good job of planning.  I think they did a pretty good job of planning for replacement  and having minimal impact on the surrounding neighborhoods.  People may not like the height of the building, but like you  said, I mean, we are in a housing crisis.  We do have to build to a certain density to provide housing for  folks that are already here and folks that are moving here.  So I think it's a pretty good project, and I would support it.  I guess when I'm hearing some of these comments, I want to know  if you have any other questions.  I would suggest that we just ask any clarifying questions that you  have for staff right now and save valuation statements for later  and have the public hearing in the middle.  Okay.  Thanks, Mike.  So I have a process question.  So what we have before us tonight is the approval of the use permit.  So what we are finding compatibility with with the neighborhood is the  use, correct?  The use and in combination with the fact that when we see the site  plan later, it has to be substantially consistent with the site plan  approved by the Planning Commission under this use permit.  So they are kind of related.  Okay.  Because I went through the conditions and circled every time you said  proposed use versus the actual design.  I only see one place where we talk about neighborhood compatibility  with design.  Okay.  But that is a piece of what we can look at?  A little bit, yes.  Primarily, I mean, like, if we're talking about the design of a fence or  something, I would suggest that we forward a recommendation to the  Architecture Review and Historic Preservation Board to consider that  during the design review.  But the major components of the site plan, we're kind of setting with  the use permit.  Okay.  And if I may, there is a mention of compatibility again, and I want to  just let everybody know that there is a definition of compatibility  in the general plan that I was able to locate.  And it says compatible.  Capable of existing together without significant conflict.  So we have a definition to kind of go by, and it's pretty broad, like I  just read.  But continue.  That's a really low standard for relationships.  Okay.  So then the other piece of this, so this is a vacant piece of property  right now.  It's zoned in the OR zoning district.  Correct?  Yes.  So this use is allowed by right?  No.  We're here for a use permit.  An office use would be allowed by right and only subject to site design  and architecture review.  A multifamily use requires use permit and site design and architecture  review.  But we are not asking, they are not asking for a variance.  There's no land use designation change.  Correct.  So this is allowable with a permit by right?  With a use permit.  I say by right when you don't need a use permit.  Okay.  We're here for a use permit.  Okay.  So a project like this, when we did the general plan update, what was that?  Four years ago?  Eight years ago was the, nine years ago was the, but this would have been,  this is a property that we would have known this is a use that could come  here.  Yes.  It would have probably been assumed to be some sort of office use.  But the OR district would say that it's primarily office and a range of other  small commercial type uses and allowable multifamily subject to use permit.  Okay.  Something like that.  Yeah.  When we reviewed the proposed general plan 2030 and 2010 and 11, which was my  first year, all these areas along like Esplanade and these, they were all zoned.  Okay.  And they were all zoned OR or office or something or mixed.  There was nothing just like pure R1 or R2 adjacent to major throughfares.  So my best memory is that this zoning has remained consistent since at least 2010.  Okay.  And I have a clarifying question on that about the COS, the corridor opportunity site  designation.  How old is that designation?  Mike, has that been there since?  Since the zoning ordinance that implemented the general plan that was adopted in 2011.  So back in 2010 also?  Yeah.  We might have drug it out to 2013 to actually, well, no, we did that pretty quick.  So 2013 or 12, 11 or 12.  Okay.  2011 or 12.  All right.  Yeah.  I believe it was the first part of 2011 that we approved the entire general plan 2030.  Right.  At that time.  Okay.  Okay.  So we're going to go to the next question.  Oh, one more question.  With the ARHPB, do we have any authority to give them direction or can we only give them  recommendations?  I would recommend that the planning commission for recommendations for them to consider.  We don't know exactly what they're going to be facing when they're looking at the project.  Some of the details can change.  The facade of the building could have a completely different siding or something like that.  So if we forwarded a requirement along those lines, we might be trying to tie their hands.  And there's no real authority for the planning commission to do that.  It would be more of a peer to peer sort of recommendation.  Okay.  Could you refresh our memory?  Under this current zoning, what would be the maximum height of a building allowed and what  would the maximum density be?  60 feet.  And I believe 60 feet would be the maximum height of a building.  So it's 70 units per acre.  I think that's in the staff report.  So about five stories.  Yeah, it's 65 feet.  Okay.  65 feet.  And what was the density of this project again?  60.  40.4.  40.4.  Yeah.  Okay.  And the top height was 48 feet?  Is that right?  I think.  That's correct.  Yeah.  48 feet.  Okay.  I think Rich had a question.  Yeah.  Well, I have kind of valuation thoughts that are very much aligned with John's, but I'll  save those for later.  I think you're right in our holding off on that.  I do have one specific question, which I don't know if the applicant is on the line or not,  so I'll ask it here and then maybe that'll come back as a question later.  So I tend to agree with the way that the building has been positioned on the lot as really a  kind of threading of a needle very cleanly, it seems to me.  But my only thought, based on the concerns of those couple of neighbors and the units  that we were talking about before that on our plan are labeled as 02, 04, maybe 06, on  that side of the building, I understand those concerns.  On the other side of the building, given the depth of the setback that they seem to have  accomplished.  I think they've accomplished a lot by pushing the building toward the front of S-20.  So my question, I guess, Mike, and it may be for the applicant, is there any way on  that, which would be the south essentially side of the building for everything to be  shifted a bit?  And I'm not sure what I mean by that.  Right now it looks like it's 15 feet.  Could it be 20?  Could it be 25 and still accommodate the parking and the rest?  I'm not sure that it could.  So it's a question for you and maybe for the applicant.  Or is that as tight as it can be?  Or does it need to be that tight, I guess?  It looks like we would start losing parking if the building were to shift too far that  way.  And I would affirm definitely the applicant, the architect is in the queue and probably  champing at the bit.  I do have a presentation that he would like to go through as well.  I'll save anything else for later.  Thanks.  Tony, do you have a question?  Well, I just wanted to ask, so what about the bike parking?  How many spaces are there?  That would be established at the design review stage, but there's bike parking in front of  the cafe along Esplanade near the corner.  There's also bike parking, several racks shown just to the left of the rec building.  Two, four, six, eight, 10, 12 over there at the rec building.  Yeah.  Okay. !  And it's all outdoor racks unless the architectural review board changes that?  It's the type of an element that could change along the way to the board.  But we would be looking for a hefty amount of bike parking here, especially at the cafe,  which could presumably be generating bike traffic from the neighborhood.  Okay.  Good to know.  Thanks.  Okay.  So some other concerns that are in the letters.  We were talking about the  received coast, I think like 19 letters.  There was a recommendation of why do we need to have it here?  Can't we find a new location for it?  Especially across the street with the gas station.  Yeah.  That's not really a question that we ask as planning staff.  We just look at the applications that come in and evaluate what they are proposing.  So you can't just say, don't put it here, put it over there?  No.  And practically speaking, the applications that come in, they're not going to be the same.  So the applicant probably controls this property, but may not control any other property.  So it would only make sense that their project would be located here.  Okay.  I just want to make sure that our neighbors understand that.  These are not decisions that you're making or that we're making here in the office, but  it is the applicant with the development.  The other thing, I think I hit them all.  I think it was pretty consistent.  I think it was pretty consistent.  Would you recommend if the...  No, I will wait.  I'm done.  All right.  Thanks for your questions.  Thank you.  Do we have further questions for Steph?  Okay.  Great.  Good questions, everybody.  I think we can move on to opening the public hearing.  Yeah.  So first up for the public hearing, I think we have a question from the audience.  So if you're in the public hearing, we're going to hear from the applicant if they're  on the line.  It sounds like...  I think I am.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, buddy.  You're kind of loud.  Sorry about that.  Is that me?  Can you control that side of it or is that...  You're a little...  Am I getting better?  It's pretty loud and a little distorted.  I don't know.  I'm having to go through a mobile phone for this one.  Okay.  So I'm going to go through a mobile phone.  So I'm going to go through a mobile phone.  If I talk softly, is that going to work?  That sounded all right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Can we get started?  Yeah.  And how much time should we...  Do we have multiple representatives on the line?  No.  We have just me and I'm going to be less than 10 minutes.  I couldn't hear all of that.  So it's just you?  Okay.  It's just me?  Yeah.  We actually...  Yeah.  We have a lot of representatives.  So we're going to have about 10 minutes to the applicant.  So...  Yeah.  I'll make it quick.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Thank you.  Good evening, Planning Commission members.  Thank you for letting us present today what we think is an exciting project for the City  of Chico.  You're jumping the gun right there, Mike.  Hang on a second.  I represent the architect of record for this project.  My name is Buddy Williams.  I'm the partner, senior design associate, and director of multifamily for Studio KDA  Architects.  And I'm going to be talking to you about the project.  We're located here in Berkeley.  All right.  Let's go next, Mike.  Go ahead.  Thanks.  So this development team has worked with the City of Chico before on another multifamily  housing project, a 53-unit apartment building that is six stories and 65 feet in height located  on Normal Avenue near downtown south of campus.  That project is currently in plan check for a building permit.  Okay.  And we look forward to that building to break ground and provide housing for students and  professionals alike.  Next slide.  Hey, Buddy.  Buddy, I'm sorry to break in on here.  I don't know if you can give your microphone some more space, but I'm pretty sure you could  pull it twice as far away from you and we would hear you better.  Okay.  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drop this headset and go direct to the phone.  Give me a second.  Try using your inside library voice.  How about that?  That is awesome.  That's way better.  That's great.  Yay.  Oh, is he back?  Nice.  That was my fancy noise-canceling head phone.  Anyway, so I'm going to do a quick summary because I want to tell a story to some degree  about how we came about this design.  So one of the first things we do when initiating a design project is we look at the planning,  zoning maps and identify the possibilities and best use for the site that is allowed  in the current code.  So this code has been established for a long time.  It's been around for a long time.  And this area along Esplanade, you've got all kinds of different commercial uses, office  commercial, community commercial, in our case, office residential.  So this kind of variety can create a good mix of uses to liven up a city in our viewpoint.  And our site is about three miles to the center of campus and it's located on that major corridor,  the Esplanade, which drives all this zoning activity along that corridor street.  Next slide.  Okay.  So here's an aerial view looking the other way.  Downtown, the top of the page.  North is to the bottom right.  So the purple color is the office commercial and office residential zoning that was shown  on the previous image.  So it's important to keep in mind that in these purple areas outlined to the west of  Esplanade, those corridor opportunity sites could be redeveloped 65 feet in height at  a 70% lot coverage.  So the purpose of this is to provide a good mix of use for the site.  Some of that is of course of course of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of  of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of  of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of  of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of  of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of  So we have a single family on the right or west with commercial uses north and south.  There's a bundle of mature trees along the south and western edges of the site.  Primarily it looks to be primarily on our neighbors' properties which will help in providing  privacy between existing neighbors and proposed buildings.  And if any of those large trees are on the proposed parcel, we would like to keep them  undisturbed.  That's a really important hedgerow of trees that are really tall there on the right of  that image.  So let's go to the next one.  And here's another view looking west, southwest with RV parks in the foreground and Esplanade  running left to right.  So next one.  So I'm not going to read all this.  Just a few little highlights before we get into the site plan.  A few numbers.  This is Dunning District.  On this vacant lot is about 2.8 flat under-developed acres.  It's a site that the city council, I want to reiterate this, turns the opportunity site  through the adoption of the general plan.  It's designated as a corridor opportunity site geared towards high density residential.  So this site could support up to 186 apartment units under the current density allowance  with a maximum height of 65 feet.  And it's also in its work.  Before noting that with a state-allowed density bonus, this near three-acre site could support  a seven-story, 254-unit apartment complex that would cover about the maximum site allowance  of 70%.  So we're proposing 64 units of housing.  That adds up to about 83,000 square feet of building area.  42 units of housing is a minimum allowed under the COS overlay for this size of property.  So there's also a minimum threshold.  And we're not too far over that for this site.  For COS.  We need to provide 101 parking spaces by code.  And we're allocating 128 spaces instead, which is about 20, 21% overage.  So let's go to the next image.  So you've already seen the site plan for a bit.  So I've got a few prospective images to show to reinforce some of the design.  And as was mentioned, we oriented the building away from the single-family, lined it up on  the urban street of Esplanade and made it so that just a thin portion of it is the  60 feet adjacent to the R1 neighbors to the west.  Okay?  The required setback is 25, and we're up to 60, so that we get more privacy to existing  homes on Weedle Lake Court.  And this clubhouse and amenity building is really cool because it's going to form the  gateway into the apartment.  And focus.  Everyone would go through.  And the main thing is that it's going to be a very large building.  And the main primary entrance of that clubhouse, say hi to your neighbors, see what's going  on, grab your mail, and then enter the apartment building, lobby from a walkway leading from  the clubhouse.  There's also a corner cafe to work as a neighborhood amenity and gathering space, too.  Next slide.  Talk about that already.  Let's go to the next slide.  So here is a view from Greenfield.  It's a little drive from the residential area.  And our neighbor, Mr. Hurton, some time ago in our meeting online, community meeting,  asked during that time what would the project look like from this property.  And this view is an indication of that.  It's about 300 feet from their property to the main apartment building behind a landscaped  parking lot.  So next image.  I just want to point out that the dashed orange line there.  Is the maximum height allowed.  So we're not coming in here hot and heavy.  We're doing a very modest proposal for a site that would allow a project up to 65 feet.  Let's go on to the site section.  This is an important one, too.  Next one.  So you pointed most of the items already.  But it's important to understand the relationship of the fourth floor amenity space relative  to the single family neighbors over to the west.  The first point out is that the amenity space opens to an outdoor patio on the opposite  side of the single family neighbors.  So that plan up there right above the section helps show that part.  You come up the elevator.  You go into the amenity space.  But the outdoor area is to the east.  Opposite that physical structure.  Next slide.  We did it on purpose.  Obviously because we're trying to make sure that any noise impacts would be mitigated to  the degree possible by that physical structure in the way.  And so it's also over 200 feet from the neighbor's residences.  And there's no direct view from the amenity space to the neighbors.  We're not going to have people looking over the guard rail down in somebody's backyard.  We're a couple hundred feet away.  We're on the opposite side of the amenity space.  And we're looking towards the east because that's where the cool views are.  Want to make that clear.  Next slide.  There's also that big long row of mature trees which is in that image there on the  top.  They're really big.  And we've got a 10-foot landscaped edge.  8-foot fence.  Solid.  In terms of getting for headlights and the lights.  And again, we've got a 60-foot setback on a smaller portion of the building.  Okay.  So next.  So as stated in the final plan.  The findings of the agenda report, the approval of this project would not result in any significant  effects related to traffic, noise, air, water quality.  And the site can be actively served by all required utilities and public service.  One of the main north-south airfares of the city.  Hence the designation as a corridor opportunity site.  So as proposed as project, 64 apartment units is near the minimum allowed by code.  I mentioned earlier it's 42.  It's 30 feet under the 65-foot maximum height limit.  It's set back from the single family neighbors 35 feet beyond the minimum distance.  The site coverage is about half what's allowed.  The parking is over parked by 21%.  It's currently an existing vacant lot.  It pays very little in property taxes.  And the rental housing will be created which meets a wide range of renters and future needs  throughout the city.  And the corner retail and patio can liven up the neighborhood.  And additional residents who would live there could provide additional patrons for all the other local retail services  in that neighborhood.  We're not asking for any special favors, waivers, or variances.  And the project asks for no public funds.  This project is entirely at the financial risk of the applicant.  So it meets all the objective design and development standards.  And as previously listed, it's under the minimum standards for height and density and over the minimum for parking setback.  So I have one more slide.  And that's just to iterate what our understanding is commissioners are based on your determination and the five findings for approval.  That multifamily is allowed.  Wouldn't be detrimental to health, safety, and welfare.  C, wouldn't be detrimental to property and improvements in the neighborhood.  And D, consistent with the policies and language of the general plan, which is adopted by the city.  And E, that will be consistent and compatible with existing adjacent commercial and nearby residential uses.  One more paragraph.  Finally, as stated by one of the neighbors in their letter to the planning department, a very difficult attitude must be overcome to move forward boldly.  Well, I think that's well said.  The people who could live in these apartments would appreciate the forward thinking of the planning commission.  And their true consideration for all citizens of Chico, not just the ones who can afford single family homes.  So we also agree with the neighbor's sentiment that bold leadership is needed to provide the kind of density and design variations that can make for a stronger, more interesting city fabric.  For all types and styles of citizens.  As outlined by the general plan.  And zoning code which guided the design for this project.  So we appreciate your consideration.  And hope that you agree with the findings and approve the project.  Thanks for your time.  That's it, Mike.  Thank you for your presentation.  Sure.  Do we have commission questions for the applicant before we go on to other speakers?  Yeah, I have a question.  I'm sorry.  My name is Lupita.  And when you introduced yourself, it was still a little fuzzy.  Where is your firm?  Sure.  We're in Berkeley.  Studio KDA.  Okay.  You're in Berkeley.  Now, do you have any, from this development, it's very impressive, low income housing in this complex at all?  We do not at this time.  It's market rate.  Are you planning on considering that?  I have not been told by the development team to do so.  So it wouldn't, because we have a lot of people who are in the community.  We have a quota for low income housing.  Would that be something that you would be, that you would consider?  Well, it wouldn't be me considering it, but I can certainly ask the development team if they'd consider it.  I'm sorry, buddy, Mr. Williams.  I didn't understand you.  Yeah, it wouldn't be me who considers it, but I am more than happy to ask the development team if they would be willing to consider that.  Thank you.  Good question.  I have one question, but if there are other speakers, would we circle back to the applicant, or is it now the only opportunity to ask the applicant, or is this the best opportunity?  It's at the will of the chair whether she wants to give the applicant another shot at the end.  Okay.  Well, it's a relatively simple question, I think, so maybe go ahead and do it now.  Just for reference, generally there is a rebuttal period.  If I remember to include it after the rest of the public speakers.  But if you have a question.  Okay, no, yeah, this really is just a question for Mr. Williams.  So I've had a couple of very interesting conversations recently with our Butte County Health Department, and I think that there, I would predict, there's likely to be a little bit of movement toward and traction around making exactly this kind of  new development in Chico, at least engaging the opportunity or the possibility that this kind of development would be smoke-free.  And this is not something that we've talked about very often, but my recent conversations with the Health Department raises it.  So it's not a condition of use or anything like that.  I'm just curious, while we have this opportunity to talk with you, Mr. Williams, is that something that you or your partners have talked about or have embraced with other groups?  Mr. Mr. Mr.  Mr.  Mr.  Mr.  and safety code as a requirement to live here or be on part of this property.  Right. Have you seen that happen anywhere else where  someone as a developer or architect could demand there's no smoking on their property?  Well, no, I certainly haven't personally and again, I'm just taking  the opportunity to explore this as a conversation, not really  related to the specifics of this project or of your application.  But these conversations that I've had with the  health department and I think that there are some proposals that perhaps  have happened in other communities and maybe are coming forward  both in terms and the way that it's been explained to me,  both in terms of making the, reducing  the cost of maintenance for the property  owner and mitigating some risk associated  with smoking in an apartment complex as well as  making it more attractive to people who might be looking for a place that they are  assured that they won't be living next to or above and having the risk  of secondhand smoke and things like that. So again, this is not, this is just a  conversation. It's not, I'm not looking for that to be a part of the use  permit in any way. I just thought it was an opportunity to say, to  explore this idea and to hear if you've, and it sounds like you haven't  and that's fine, but if you've been asked that before or are considering  that with other projects.  No, I haven't been asked that, but that would be awesome and we'd support it if it  could be applicable to planning or a building code.  Okay, thanks very much. I'm truly just curious whether it was something that you've  encountered.  I have a quick question for Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams, on the  apartments on the south side of the project, so  it would be X02, X04, X06,  X08 on that side?  I'm curious about the,  it appears in the drawing that the orientation of those  looks forward out over the pool area and the hot tub and  that kind of thing. What's the window  situation like on the back side of those apartments that's  adjacent to the property next door on the south side?  Well, we haven't  got there yet. Typically what will happen  is in this example, we're looking at making the sill height  at around three feet and going up to the ceiling  height for the head of the window. We're going to  have a certain percentage of glazing we're allowed to use at that distance  from the property line and we would have typically  one, maybe two windows in the living room and one window in the bedroom.  Is that something that you're particularly concerned about?  As a particular concern that you want me to focus on as we move forward?  Yeah, I think to me, privacy on the lot next door would be an issue, definitely.  And the way I'm looking at your drawings, it appears that the orientation  of it really is toward the north on that part.  So I'm thinking something along, as you're looking at  the window placement on that back side, something that really takes  the, you know, being a good  neighbor and looking at the privacy of the people that are going to be on the other side,  on the south side there. So, you know, like a clear story type window,  something up high that still lets in light. We don't have  the opportunity to look at any of the actual bedroom layouts  or anything on this design, I know. So, you know,  I'm thinking just in my head, bedrooms oriented toward  the back there and, you know, maybe minimal windows just enough  to let in whatever natural  light is needed. And maybe  even, you know, the further up you go, even the more so  with that. And are you referring to the adjacent office  residential zone? Yes, I am. Okay. Yeah, that's  worth considering. Okay. Yeah, great. Thank you.  Any questions? Go ahead.  Where are you next? Never mind.  I saw you leaning over. All right. Did anybody else have any questions?  If not, Mike, do you want to take it  away with the rest of the public hearing if we have folks?  Sure. I'm going to mute you, Buddy, and we're going to move on to the  other speakers. First, in the public hearing,  we have Patrick Hurtin. Mr. Hurtin, would you like to address  the Commission on this item? Question, how many total do we? Oh, there's about  eight. Okay. Great. Yeah, I would, Mike. Thank you.  We can hear you. I'd like to make a comment to the architect and tell him  I'm not interested in destroying the project to the point where I wind  up with a six-story building on that corner. So please rest assured.  I have several issues with it. Some of them involve you.  Some involves the city. I'd like to make one other general comment.  I've submitted not quite a read,  but a substantial amount of paper to the city.  Some are commentary. Some are real questions.  I have not received a single answer to any question.  I've received some information this evening  that helps, but all the information I've submitted to the city,  I have not received a single response from. Not one. Okay?  So that's just to clear that up. And that's very, very frustrating.  Very, very frustrating. But most of these could have been answered  over the past two months. I got this agenda  about five or six days ago.  It laid out what you're going to talk about.  I'm heavily involved in the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and it's been a very busy  week for me. And I've had to try to get more comments that I've  submitted to you that Mike did give to you.  His attachment, H, I believe, Mike, or whatever, J, or whatever.  Anyhow, I have not received one single written comment  on anything I've submitted. Okay. In a macro sense,  I realize we're probably not here to talk about architecture,  but the architecture of the building is a subject,  and I guess that, Mike, would come up at the Architecture Review Board.  It's not a subject for this meeting.  Okay.  Can you hear me?  Yes. Architecture would be reviewed at the  Architectural Review Board specifically.  Okay. Yeah, because the architecture, I realize you're not here to talk about architecture.  Can you hear me if I do it this way?  No, I've got to talk into the phone.  I'm sorry. Can you hear me if I talk into my laptop?  We can hear you.  Okay. Is that better than the phone?  Sure. We can hear you either way.  It just gets a little fuzzy.  Okay.  So, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Is it fuzzy on the computer or fuzzy on the phone?  That feels fine right there. That sounds fine.  Okay. Good. Thank you. I'll use the computer.  I have what I consider to be a safety issue.  You may not, but regardless.  The playground that's laid out looks to me to be approximately 60 by 60.  My front yard is almost 55 by half of my front yard.  It's 55 by about 40.  Kids playing, we have six kids that play on the north side, north end of Eagle Lake Drive.  They occupy the whole court, Eagle Lake Court, which is ten houses, when they play.  They play on big wheels. They play on bicycles, tricycles. They play basketball. They play all kinds of stuff.  These kids are seven and under.  How would you accommodate the kids of a 60-unit apartment building in a 60 by 60 place?  That's a great question.  All right.  Thank you for your comments.  Okay. Now, let me go on from there for a little bit.  Well, we do have a three-minute limit, sir.  I'm sorry?  We do have a three-minute limit per commenter.  I'm sorry, but I've got a raft of questions that have never been answered.  All right.  Okay.  Let me summarize another. Parking.  I'll try to get to the three minutes.  I'm sorry?  We'll give you 30 more seconds.  Okay. Parking is a major issue.  Reef Hill Drive is packed with cars now when it's open.  People will not tend to park in the parking lot. They'll tend to park in the street.  If you go by the apartments on North Avenue, I just drove by there this morning on my way to Willows to a BFW meeting.  Half of the North Avenue is a BFW meeting.  Half of the North Avenue in front of the apartments was occupied with cars.  Where are people going to park?  Ingress and egress to the Esplanade.  Is it somebody I think mentioned a stop sign?  Okay. They didn't.  There should probably be.  They did a traffic study and said there's going to be one car per minute or something.  The commute hours, trying to get on to the Esplanade from Greenfield Drive,  or get off of it, it's a nightmare.  You add 60 units, and I would guess in this day and age that's a minimum of 90 cars, to that.  How's that going to work?  I don't know. Probably not.  Sir, we're going to have to move on to the next speaker to give everybody an equal amount of time.  Let me stop. How do I get my questions answered?  How do I get my questions answered?  Who are you looking to answer them?  Pardon?  Who would you like to answer them?  I have no idea. I submit them to planning,  and then I would assume that the city takes care of distributing them to whomever,  before it ever gets to this point.  That apparently doesn't happen.  You got the package the same time I did, about six days ago.  I doubt seriously if you read it.  It appears as though, and I apologize for this,  but there's a gentleman and a lady that spoke that appeared to bring up some of my points.  I don't know who they are,  but obviously they've read some parts of it.  part of what I did.  So, I'm very, very frustrated.  The answers I got, when the rate morg...  I just moved in before the rate...  I moved in five years before the rate morg...  And I got the answers built in accordance with code.  When I asked...  Okay, excuse me.  I get no answers to any of my questions.  Sir, I would recommend that you call the planning department during their normal business hours,  8 to 5,  and I think they can help answer some of your questions.  A lot, most of us planning commissioners are...  We're just learning about this project ourselves.  We're making a decision.  We don't...  I mean, we have spoken with the planners too,  but we probably don't have every detail to tell you.  The planning staff knows more than us.  Chair Goldstein, if I may?  Mm-hmm.  The...  I understand, I hear Mr. Horton's frustration,  and we...  I'm sure that...  Every...  You know, we all want to feel that we are being heard,  and if we submit questions, we would like them to be answered.  So I would...  I would recommend that staff respond to Mr. Horton.  We are looking at the whole package here.  He has some specific questions, and I think it's fair.  If he has...  He has access to the...  The packet that you've submitted to us with all of the...  He has everything.  So he can probably take a look at this and maybe have some of his answers.  I believe he's read the report from some of the correspondence he subsequently sent.  Okay.  So that would probably be a good recommendation for him  to relieve some of that frustration that I hear,  to take a look at the report and evaluate it.  And then once...  If there are still some questions, to possibly submit more questions.  And hopefully,  we'll be able to...  To...  To satisfy some of his concerns.  Yeah, I'm happy to answer any of the questions  that the Planning Commission has after the public hearing.  Just briefly on some of the issues you just heard was...  I know for a fact in the file,  there's evidence of the fact that Associate Planner O'Connell  has corresponded back and forth with Mr. Horton.  There's indication in the record  that was given to the Planning Commission  where he's thanking Dexter for that exchange.  And...  Any other questions?  When we come back,  we get a litany of very late questions.  We forward them to the Planning Commission.  Anything that the Planning Commission feels like  following up on and actually  asking for an answer that doesn't...  You don't believe to have been provided yet,  we're happy to provide that.  But we find that when we do a lot of back and forth  with the applicant, it can generate an endless  set of questions.  So with that, we can move on.  Yeah, thank you for clarifying that, Mike.  And I...  I want to clarify that a little bit more,  just from what we heard.  There are emails from our  that have been received on August 27th,  August 28th,  multiple August 31st  from Dexter responding.  What may not have been responded to  was what was received  Monday,  this Monday at 1040.  And then as well as  Wednesday,  so yesterday at 3 p.m.  So I understand the frustration there.  I would want my questions answered.  But there has been extensive dialogue  with city staff on this.  But I enjoyed reading all of that  and really did take your comments to heart.  So thank you.  If I may even add to that,  I did offer twice to speak to Mr. Hurtin  over the phone,  and he replied that he was too busy to call me.  So if we're ready to move on, Madam Chair?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, next speaker is Rich Utter.  Rich...Richard Utter,  would you like to address the question?  Would you like to address the Planning Commission  on this item?  Yes, thank you.  Can you hear me okay?  We can.  Yep.  Excellent.  My dear Planning Commission members,  my name is Richard Utter,  and I live in the Amber Grove subdivision,  and that's near the site of the proposed  Greenfield and Esplanade departments.  Frankly, I do not understand  why a four-story project  is being considered for this site.  To me, the height of this project  does not fit the area.  Where I live in the Amber Grove subdivision,  my nearest access to the Esplanade  is Amber Grove Drive.  As an illustration  of what is typical  for buildings in this area,  at the intersection of Amber Grove Drive  and the Esplanade,  there's an office complex on one side of the drive  and on the other is an assisted living care home.  Both complexes,  single-story buildings,  are two-story in height.  However, the care home does have a second story  at the entryway.  The second of three access roads  to the Amber Grove subdivision  is Greenfield Drive.  The intersection includes the site  for this proposed project.  At present, the proposed site is a vacant lot.  On the other side of Greenfield Drive,  facing the Esplanade,  is an office building that looks to be  two stories in height,  although one story in appearance.  The third of three access roads  on both sides of Yellowstone Drive  at the Esplanade  are office buildings one story in height.  Expanding this review  to include the streets  of the southern and northern perimeters  of the sub-division,  specifically Shasta Avenue  and Eaton Road,  existing buildings at these intersections  are one story in height.  Covering all the Esplanade  from Shasta Avenue  to Eaton Road,  I see the !  There are no buildings greater than  two stories in height.  There are no buildings of four stories,  no buildings of three stories.  Why are we proposing a building  for this site  that is out of character  for the area?  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  All right.  Looks like we're ready for the next speaker.  Thank you for your comments, Rich.  Okay.  Because she found the hand raise button,  I'm going to skip to Jamie Jin.  Jamie, would you like to address the commission on this item?  Yes, I would, please.  Go ahead.  So I am a resident on Greenfield Drive in Calistoga.  I didn't really prepare anything like I usually do, and I'm sorry if I'm emotional.  I'm a single mother who came from low-income housing.  So to whoever brought that up, I appreciate your concern of needing low-income housing in our area because I lived in it.  I lived amongst college students as a single mother who fled an abusive relationship.  And I worked really, really hard to buy a beautiful home in one of the nicest middle-income neighborhoods in Chico  to provide a living.  And I certainly did not buy this house to live so close to an apartment complex, which I feel like I escaped that whole lifestyle.  And I certainly didn't buy this house to live next to an apartment complex, which accommodated low-income families.  And I'm sorry because I do feel for them.  I've been there.  But this is, I really don't even want that to be considered.  And I'm sorry.  I think it was Lupita.  She's what her name was.  But that's just not even an option.  Sorry.  I know I only get three minutes.  I'm active in city council, so I'm going to move on.  So I would ask, I know that there's no stopping this because the person owns the property and they're within the guidelines.  So my ask is that we would approve this with conditions.  I don't see the necessity for there to be an entrance on Greenwood.  I don't see the necessity for there to be an entrance on Greenfield Drive.  My daughter plays on Greenfield Drive.  She's five years old with a group of children that were addressed earlier.  I believe that that entrance could be moved to the alternative parking area if we take out those trees that is next door to the cafe on Esplanade.  I would prefer to see it there.  I don't want an influx of traffic on Greenfield Drive because it is already horrendous getting in and out in the mornings and in the evenings turning into a parking lot.  I would also ask that basketball court be moved possibly to another area.  I do not want to listen.  I was a basketball player in college.  I don't want to listen to basketballs anymore in my life.  And then I think, again, the most I would really want to see is that that outdoor area.  I don't want to listen to people congregating really.  I don't want to listen to people congregating.  I don't like that kind of kind of kind of kind of  but thank you for your comments.  We can't see a timer on our end.  At least I can't.  We couldn't see that.  If you're closing statement,  you have a few seconds on this one.  Okay.  So I would really urge Planning Commission  to approve this with conditions.  I really would like to see that driveway on Greenfield  moved to the Esplanade.  I don't see why you couldn't open up that space  next to the cafe to be able to allow for a driveway  in and out of onto the Esplanade  and closing off that back area  and then also moving the basketball court,  the trash can and the storage  to the opposite side of the building.  I don't want to smell trash drifting towards my house,  again, that I purchased and worked very hard for.  So if we can move it to the opposite side of the building  or even out by the other enclosed trash area,  I don't know.  I just,  if there's a big building blocking the trash,  I don't know.  I just feel like that those  could maybe be away from the neighbors.  Thank you.  Yeah, your time is up.  Appreciate your comments.  Thanks for coming to our meeting.  Next up is Becky Tate.  Becky, would you like to address the commission on this item?  Becky?  Doesn't sound like it.  Here we go with Austin.  Austin Barron.  Austin, would you like to address  the planning commission on this item?  Austin Barron, would you like to address  the planning commission?  It's indicating that he's not being attentive  to the conference.  Ben Barron, would you like to address  the planning commission on this item?  Ben Barron?  Okay.  G, G, would you like to address  the planning commission on this item?  No.  G-3, no, I'm good.  Okay.  One more time with Becky Tate.  I'm not sure you heard me.  Becky, do you have,  would you like to address  the planning commission on this item?  I think we're hearing none.  All right.  Is that all the speakers?  That is, yes.  We've gone through them.  Thank you to our speakers  who came to the WebEx meeting tonight  and spoke on the project.  We appreciate you participating.  And I think next we can have the applicant  do a rebuttal if he would like.  Sure, I'll take one or two sentences.  Yeah, go ahead if you'd like.  Does it sound crappy?  Sure you are.  I can go back off.  You sound all right.  All right, here we go.  Just in front, I want to reiterate,  keep in mind that...  Now you're a little crappy.  Buddy, that went away.  If you could go back to...  Hang on.  The other method, that would be better.  There we go.  How about that one?  So it was just to reiterate for,  that this is a corridor opportunity site  that years were spent  with much public input  on preferred paths,  a development that worked into the general plan  for to create those corridor overlay zones.  And they were intended to spur increased development  along certain particular areas of the city.  That's what the city council signed up for.  And this one, unfortunately,  is one of the first larger scale developments  that's still very modest,  as I've outlined previously.  We're over what we need to be,  in terms of parking.  We're way low on height,  way high on setback,  et cetera, et cetera.  You've already heard all that.  So this project checks all the right boxes  and it's modest in scale.  And the cities grow,  and preferably in a considered fashion  with a vetted planning and zoning code  that forecasts future development,  not just what they're now.  We have to...  That's laid out there for us  that give us that guidance.  We're not pushing,  we're not pushing any boundaries on there.  We're complying with code  and we're asking you folks  to grant the use permit.  That's it.  Thanks, Mike.  Buddy, might you have anything to say  for some of the comments  regarding the ability  to potentially move the trash enclosure  and basketball court  further away from the rear property line?  Yeah, so the trash enclosure we did move  and the site plan we saw this evening,  we had it over to the,  the far west side,  and that was just being stupid.  That wasn't a good move.  It was too close to the residences.  So we push it off away  and push it off towards the middle of the site.  But the basketball court,  I thought it was a really cool idea  that it takes over the fire lane.  You're not going to have anything developed there.  You're not going to have any physical structures there.  So it was part of the amenity play space  to keep the kids from not bicycling  out in the street on Greenfield.  So,  it is a good open one question to consider.  I think it's also important to consider  what type of landscaping is preferred  between that corner or edge of the site  versus the neighbors.  They don't want really too tall trees  because they didn't plant those themselves  because they didn't want that in their pool.  So we do also want to hear from them  because they're really the only people  with a gap in the fence line of trees,  not huge, large trees.  So that also could play in that bottom.  But the trash is moved.  We also increased the height of the fence  and we'll make sure that it's opaque.  You can't see through it.  So it takes on  and landscaping in front of that too  also wants to be fairly robust  to make sure that we don't have light  bleeding into the neighbor's yard.  That's it, Mike.  Thank you.  Great.  And I think next,  the commission can ask,  any further questions of the applicant  or members of the public?  Or to one another.  Or to one another.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, we can also close the public hearing  and we can further discuss.  I guess a question,  maybe suggestion for Mr. Williams.  The basketball court issue,  do you have plans for lighting for that?  No.  That's hard.  The basketball court,  were you planning on having that being lit at all or not?  We haven't gotten that far in the design  in terms of if that wants to be lit or not.  I wanted to hear from you folks too.  I mean, my thinking would be to not have it lit  so we're not playing games too late.  And it would be kind of a natural thing  when the sun goes down,  you're done playing on the basketball court  and the noise in the area would go down.  So that would be a suggestion.  It would be great to pass on to the developer.  And then my only other thing would be really looking  at the windows on that south side of the project there.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks.  If there's no further questions for the applicant,  then let's go ahead and close the public hearing  and move on to commission discussion.  Can I ask Matt a quick question?  Go ahead.  I'm assuming a separate driveway off of the Esplanade  would not be your preference,  but could you comment on that?  No, I think the traffic department is really following the code  now to limit driveway accesses.  I live up north, so I drive that section of Esplanade  going to and from work.  And, you know, the traffic speeds along there  are 40, 45 miles an hour.  And to introduce another intersection  where people have a chance of being hit,  it's from a safety standpoint,  we want to have the driveways come off a secondary street  and limit the access or the conflicts  to the one existing driveway at Greenfield.  Great, thank you.  I've got a question for Matt also.  What about traffic signal?  Has that been looked into at all?  It doesn't meet, it wouldn't meet the warrants  for a traffic signal.  There's just not enough side street volume  to warrant that, given the volume of traffic  on the two-lane Esplanade going north and south.  Madam Chair, I have a few notes  that I would be happy to respond to.  I think I'll just go to the Commission  after the public hearing.  Sure, that would be great.  I believe it was said that there was this question  whether or not the open space area was large enough  to accommodate the children of the project.  And I think that was just one of several recreational areas  in the project.  There's also a pool area, an indoor recreational building,  outdoor basketball court, as mentioned,  in addition to that, what looks like a grassy play area  on the site plan.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I think all the other ones were pretty much addressed  by either the applicant or Matt.  I think we need to put in a plug, too,  that obviously this site is located  within the Amber Grove and Peterson subdivision,  and they do have a five-acre neighborhood park  in that development, and I need to put in a plug  for our northwest Pacific Plan Park.  We had a walk-through earlier this week,  looks...  Like, everything's acceptable,  so we're hoping to take down the safety fencing tomorrow sometime  and get it open to the public.  So, anyway, we felt that that would be a good opportunity  for people to get out of their house with the COVID  and their kids and run around a little bit.  So tomorrow's going to be a great day for a new park opening.  Wow, that's exciting.  Thanks for sharing that.  Yeah, it was asked why four stories,  everything else around is one.  We don't use existing.  We use the development to basically determine  how tall a new structure can be.  We look at the code and what it would allow,  and as pointed out, the corridor opportunity site  really opens up for larger buildings.  There's no special conditions that would preclude usage  of the four-story open space on top of the roof there.  There are no limitations on that,  just a limitation that the stairwells  that's on the westerly side of the building  not open up to view that way.  And I'm not sure it was clear, but the site, not the site plan,  but one of the attachments shows that I'm going  to share the screen real quick,  that the rooftop area is really limited  to the middle of the building.  So there's the elevator, I guess, that would take you  up there, and then there's this little corral sort of area here,  and I believe that's the extent of the access  to the rooftop area, and that's why we call it a much smaller  area, and it's predominantly a three-story building.  So it's a much smaller area, and it's a much smaller area  than the other three-story building  with that additional rooftop element.  Thanks for clarifying that.  Yeah, basketball court is part  of the fire truck turnaround area.  We've seen that on other projects be successful  where you don't want cars parked where the truck,  where a fire truck needs to turn around,  and people tend to not park on the basketball court.  So that's kind of a clever way of also adding  some more double usage of that space.  And that's all I have.  Thank you.  I'm a fan of the basketball court fire truck turnaround combo.  I like it.  I have a question for Mike or whoever can answer it.  Kind of for general reference, since Lupita brought  up affordable housing units, I'm pretty sure that's probably  beyond our purview to, like, you know, put in a condition  to an applicant that they have to have affordable units,  but I'm just wondering what the, you know,  like for future reference, we have any power  to say that kind of thing.  I don't know of any code authority that would allow us  to require that sort of thing.  That's what I thought.  Okay.  I do imagine that the balance here, I'm not,  I haven't seen their P&L and I don't know, but the balance  of not having low income probably allows them to be  at a lower story as opposed to if they did allow  for low income housing.  They'd probably have to build more units  to make the project pencil out.  That's a good point.  I think that's true.  And probably have to increase more density on the lot  and less parking as well.  Well, I would consider, Mr. Williams seemed  to be amenable to the idea.  So I think it would be appropriate that we ask him  if he would, because I'm thinking we do have a quota  that we're trying to meet for low income housing.  I was trying to look it up as we were speaking.  And I think it would be, we just lost Paradise  and Paradise was our low income area for housing.  And we are in a housing crisis where our streets are filled  with homeless, houseless people.  And I think it would be prudent for us  as the planning commission to not wash our hands  from the conversation.  If Mr. Williams is amenable to consider, to provide us  with some information on, we have six months  of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of  requirements, if any.  I don't think we have any authority to do that, Lupita,  unfortunately.  We can suggest all we want, but I don't think it's anything  we can put in any kind of a motion or a condition  of approval.  Well, I understand that, but we have three choices.  We could either approve it, not approve it,  or put some conditions.  And we have issues in our town.  Yeah, but my point is until we actually have something  in code, in statute, city statute, to say we have to have  a certain number, like you said, a certain number of units  or percentage, our hands are tied.  There's nothing we can do.  So it has to come from above us and not from us.  I want to disagree.  I think this is probably one of the bodies  that we can litigate.  And I think that if Mr. Williams would consider  that, that's where I would like to get my answers,  with all due respect.  Madam Chair.  Yeah, I think we can, if the applicant's willing to do it,  wonderful, but I don't think we're in any position  from a regulatory standpoint to require them or ask them  to do that if they opt to choose to, wonderful.  That's my understanding, too.  And I know we're probably all trying to go home,  but could you summarize how they would make  the affordable housing happen?  My understanding was generally, they're, you know, they're not,  they would have to, well, generally,  the developers would like to maybe get a tax credit  or something to kind of subsidize their ability  to create affordable units.  Is there anything that maybe we should know in the future  for just, I'm not sure how it would happen.  Yeah, I think one of the,  Commissioner Rensick mentioned it before.  Normally, these projects have a really high density,  ask for forgiveness on parking and all kinds of other things.  And in order to, you know,  to make them, so to speak, pencil out,  they have to really get the density up  and attract all kinds of layers of public financing,  tax credits, all these other things have to come together  in a real complicated kind of fiscal perfect storm  to even make one of those projects doable.  And they're very difficult.  We were fortunate enough to have a few come through  towards the end that took advantage of tax credits  that were kind of in a position that were,  so to speak, shovel ready.  But getting an affordable project to move  is a lot of combined effort.  And it normally takes a lot of people  with a whole lot of experience  that have got a successful track record of doing this.  If they can bring it on, then wonderful.  But it coming and asking them to do that  and requiring them to do this,  something that we don't have the ability to do  from a regulatory standpoint.  But we can ask for a friendly consideration.  Sure, absolutely.  And that's something that we maybe as just general people  in the community should be pushing for developers  to consider earlier on in the project,  because I feel like it would be hard for somebody  to incorporate that later on.  But also, I mean, as commissioners too,  I think this is something that should be discussed  if we have the power to...  I know city council has been discussing  inclusionary zoning and other things.  And I think we should work with our city council members  or as a commission discuss other policy changes  that might make it easier to build affordable housing.  Yeah, I agree 100%.  I think it's typically the role of the planning commission  to interpret and apply the policy that already exists,  not to create new policy.  That's the role of the city council.  And so I would say that's outside the main purview  of the planning commission.  That's not our role to create policy.  It's to interpret existing and apply it.  Yeah, I agree.  And I think it does come down...  I agree with this spirit of this discussion 100%.  But I think obviously our role, as Ken just described,  is to apply current code to create something like a quota  or a requirement really does get into,  we would be changing code,  we'd be changing zoning.  And that's something that I think that is a conversation  the community is having right now appropriately,  but it's not something that we can really apply  to any given project that's before us right now, I think.  My other comment echoing something  that Commissioner Howlett said early on  is that I'm very, very impressed with this project.  And it clearly in terms of density and height,  which are a couple of the,  aspects of this project that some of the neighbors  struggle with have concerns about.  And I understand those concerns  and I respect tremendously their participation  and bringing those concerns forward.  But we certainly are in terms of whether we approve or not  and what kinds of conditions we might apply to the project  were constrained by, again, existing codes and standards.  And so I think that this project,  not only meets those,  but I'm very impressed with the way that this project  takes advantage of a couple of things.  And that's,  the community has been talking a lot  about infill development and how the best way for,  and the general plan calls this out,  the best way for Chico to achieve higher numbers  of available units is through increasing,  to the extent possible and allowable,  increasing density.  And that in some cases,  when you're talking about infill development,  which this is, means increasing height just a bit.  And this project does exactly those things, it seems to me.  Whether it fits design wise, again,  is really not in front of us tonight.  The design, the facade, some of the specifics,  although I do think it is appropriate to call out  some of the security and,  privacy issues,  but generally speaking,  the design elements really are not in front of us  right now tonight.  And so that piece where the,  I did read all of the exchange of emails and comments  from all of the public members,  and some of them expressed some concerns  about whether it really fits design wise.  And that's yet to be determined what the ultimate look is.  Everything else about this, not only in my opinion,  I do support it because it fits the code  and the,  the regulations and the parameters with which we are,  we can or cannot,  whether we can approve or deny a project.  It fits all of those, both,  in terms of the technicalities,  but also in terms of meeting what I think the community  is asking for, which is infill development,  very much like this.  So, I support the project.  A couple of little tweaks that we've talked about,  but I think it has done a really, really good job.  Given the needs that we were facing right now for housing.  Thanks, Rich.  I agree.  I,  I believe that the developer has done a good job of  taking into consideration the fact that,  you know, there is a surrounding neighborhood,  not going to the maximum density and height,  even though I would support that because we need more housing.  Yeah.  Just generally, I think it's a,  a project that fits what we need in our community.  And what it's done for.  I guess I'm on a roll tonight.  I think it's a, it's a lovely development.  I'm just really eager and concerned about low-income housing.  And it's, it's burdensome.  I see all these units that are going up.  We absolutely need it.  I am, I do respect the comments from our public.  I think it's, they've been, you know,  they've been really engaged.  And I think that,  I hope that they feel that we've represented them properly.  And I would like to throw a,  a plug in from Mr. Williams regarding any,  anything he could do to help us.  I mean, we are a community recovering from crises,  one after another.  And if there's anything that you can do to help us with our  housing, 64 units, I think is phenomenal, but we also have,  we have low income issues here.  Yeah.  I appreciate your bringing this up and being persistent about  it because we absolutely need more affordable housing.  And the minimum we can do is increase housing.  Right.  But yes, affordable would be awesome.  And I hope he'll consider it.  I got just a couple of comments real quick.  Yeah.  I think the applicant's done a good job in terms of,  of parking height, density, everything, design.  Well, I don't know if we'll see it again or not.  Or does it go to the architectural review and then back to us?  Okay. That's what I thought.  I think the cafe is-  Sorry. I didn't hear the last part.  Oh, does it come back to us after?  No, the use permit would be decided.  And then the only left would be design review and that would be  done by the board.  Right. So we're done tonight.  I think the cafe is a great addition to the neighborhood.  My only concern, and once again, we can't do anything about it,  but if you're over there between 8 and 8.30, you know, for example,  in the morning, turning left on the Esplanade,  if you want to get up to Eaton Road, get on the freeway,  it's not easy.  You know, you got to avoid Matt Johnson coming down to go  to work, you know?  Oh, no.  I've been working since 6.30.  But, you know, it is an issue.  If you, I went over there early in the morning and the,  I think what's going to happen is, you know, I'm going to have to go to work.  I'm going to have to go to work.  And we heard from people on Eagle Lake Court and,  which is on the cul-de-sac from either side behind us  and Greenfield Drive.  But I think it's going to have an effect and dramatically  on the people that live on Calistoga,  which is the main north-south road,  close to the right to the west of Eagle Lake Court.  And that goes to the feeder streets, Yellowstone  and Amber Grove Drive.  You're going to see a lot more people  that are going to be coming down to Greenfield Drive  to avoid the traffic backup, which I can see happening  on Greenfield going down to those other streets,  which obviously more cars going down Calistoga, more cars trying  to get to those other two exit streets.  So that's why I asked about the signal.  But, yeah, we're adding a lot of cars.  And so it's going to have an impact on the neighborhood.  Once again, I think that it meets all the guidelines.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Can I add a comment?  Of course.  So I really think the site design is really well done,  really looking to mitigate the impacts on traffic.  Also, just I love the basketball court and the distance  that we're getting there from the backs of those houses.  I think the use is compatible.  That's really important.  That's really what we're looking at is the use.  Is this use compatible with the neighborhood?  And yes, it is.  I really appreciate the comments on affordable housing.  I also think we just need housing in general.  And a big piece of that is workforce housing.  And we're struggling with that as a company right now of people  who want to relocate here  and just don't have the workforce housing,  the professional workforce housing to support them.  And so I think that's a really important thing to think about  I really do not like the design of this project,  the building elevations.  And I know that's not something that factors into our decision,  except for we do have a condition D on attachment A  that says it maintains neighborhood compatibility  and context sensitive design.  And that, this project doesn't quite do that for me,  in this neighborhood.  I think the design would work somewhere like Miriam Park.  But with this neighborhood, I, it's just not my taste  for what the neighborhood, the rest, a lot of it is stucco housing  or something a little less modern, not as many angles.  And so that would be a condition I'd love to see or recognize.  recommendation to the architectural review and historic preservation board is to this might be a more palpable project for the neighborhood if it didn't stick out so much design wise.  Thank you for the comment. I like the angles, but I'm sure we all have different ideas there.  That goes to what I was speaking to originally, the compatibility with the neighborhood. I agree with Tony on that. Thank you.  I would say what they did on Nord fits with that neighborhood. Kind of picking that up and moving that to this neighborhood. I just don't see that working as well.  Anybody else have comments? Discussion?  I don't see that as a deal breaker for most of us, the design, but I would encourage the architectural review board to take a good look at it, decide if they believe that that's...  Madam Chair, I'm sorry to interrupt again. I just was seeing an email that may not have been forwarded to the commission yet or in a timely fashion that you may not have seen.  Okay.  So I would offer to read that if you want. It is not short.  Are they doing it?  I want this person to know that their comments were forwarded to the commission. We're trying to tighten up our noticing so that people have a better understanding of how and when would be best to be most effective with their comments.  But okay, here we go. It's five or six paragraphs.  So this is from Jean Ping.  I'm writing to protest the planned apartment complex on the lot at East and Greenfield.  Other corner lots in this area have small offices.  That fit into the neighborhood.  Well, a large multi-story apartment block of 68 units would not fit into the neighborhood and it is far too many units for the lot size.  It seems to me that such a building would be subject to better suited on the other side of the Esplanade where there would be room for the building to be set back from the street and adequate parking as well.  Excuse me, Mike.  It is in our packet.  I'm so sorry.  It's my number 17.  Okay.  I missed it.  Good call.  I probably didn't read through the additional.  Jean Ping, it was forwarded to the planning commission, so I'm going to stop reading now.  As you were reading, it sounded very familiar.  I was pretty sure.  I know the name and I thought I had heard a lot of that, so thank you.  We received a lot of correspondence, so I didn't pick up.  I appreciate making sure that in case something was missed that you bring it to our attention.  I think people do deserve and I appreciate that care.  I agree.  Okay.  All right.  So we have a motion and a second.  If anybody wants, we can have further discussion.  All right.  I can probably get over it, but really that D, the LU 4.3 and CD 5.3,  and if you guys convince me you think that it's context-sensitive design,  then I'll just drop it.  But that doesn't seem...  Can we put in a motion, something to make sure that the architectural review committee  pays attention to that?  The motion maker may consider a friendly amendment, I believe, at this time.  I guess I'm not sure what we would be asking.  Is it just putting a condition in that says the architectural review board  will consider this for consistency with the surrounding...  Isn't that just...  Isn't that just what they do?  They do.  Yeah.  They do.  So it would be...  It sounds to me like there's, you know, a couple of objections to this specific design,  but that's a little different.  It sounds to me a little different than, you know, recommending or changing a condition to me.  So it wasn't my motion.  It doesn't sound like a super specific thing to put in there.  I can make something super specific, but I don't...  I mean, just recommendations.  I'd like to see.  I just don't know if that's the will of the commission.  So I...  And if it's not, you could communicate with the ARHPB and...  I don't think I'm allowed to.  Not?  I don't know.  Am I?  We will be eventually writing a report for this and summarizing the details of what happened tonight.  And we will mention the things that were prominent in the discussion, including the concerns about the design.  Just like they sent us recommendations on lights or anything, I would...  Mine would be the...  The angles and the general spaceship looking design.  So, okay.  Further comments on that?  Specifically on this discussion of adding a staff.  What were you going to say?  Sorry.  So I think that right now it was either you were going to accept some sort of amendment to the motion,  but there really wasn't a...  Clear amendment or not.  So I think that the motion we still have on the floor, it's first and seconded.  And we're open for discussion.  Yeah.  And I would be open to adding an amendment.  I just wasn't sure what the amendment would be and how specific we want to get.  So...  And I would...  I mean, we can vote.  If I were to amend it, we can vote on that with the amendment, then...  I don't know what the amendment would be.  So it's unclear.  So I would recommend that you just...  I would prefer not to have the amendment and just have the report reflect that we had this discussion about concerns about the design.  Is that all right?  Okay.  Then let's do that.  So I'll reject the amendment and move forward with the motion itself.  All right.  Any further discussion or should I call the question?  All right.  All right.  So all in favor of approving this?  Signify by saying aye.  Aye.  Any objections?  Are there any abstentions?  All right.  Motion passes.  All right.  So that was our only public hearings item.  Item five is regular agenda.  It doesn't look like we have any regular agenda.  And then reports and communications.  Do we have any?  Well, no.  I just wanted to let you know, Madam Chair, just to let you know, since housing is such a hot topic, we are going to update the housing element of the general plan next year.  So that's where these topics about inclusionary housing and whatever the city's policies are in housing will be brought up.  So the timing is pretty good.  That has to occur next year.  And also behind that, we have a pretty ambitious work program to get at making residential development easier.  And to follow up on things like objective development standards and the Housing Accountability Act.  So we have to do a lot of work that's coming at you next year, too.  So it's going to be a housing, a prolonged, meaningful housing conversation throughout the year.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  What's the time frame on that, Bruce?  Is there a date when we need to have the element done?  I think March 22 or something like that.  Okay.  Okay.  So.  But we need to get.  We need to get most of the work done now.  I mean, next year.  It's going to come quickly.  Okay.  All right.  Great.  Thanks.  Bruce, I was wondering, and I want to keep the health and safety of the commission and the staff our top priority.  But I'm wondering, has there been any discussion on opening back up the ability for the public to be here physically?  I know there's some limited aspect of that happening at the city council level.  But it does really.  We generally have less.  People.  That's a work in progress.  And Mike, thankfully, is kind of playing a key role in that because he's obviously more capable with with those tech issues.  Maybe he can give you an update because this is something we've been working with the rest of the organization on because we obviously have different needs for our hearings.  Mike, maybe you can fill them in.  We're definitely having discussions.  We're all in alignment in what we think would serve the commission best, which would be to go back to.  In person meetings.  But we do have to balance the concerns, the health and safety concerns.  We just do not have the staff to accommodate a successful separation of people in this room and potential overflow observation of people who might have to sit in the other room waiting for an item.  But we're definitely trying to get there.  Well, thank you for the updates.  All right.  See you next week.  Two weeks.  All right.  And it seems likely that meeting will take place on the 19th.  Great.  I will likely not be able to attend that meeting based on what's on the agenda, which I will email the commission once that report comes out.  But I just wanted to let you guys know so that, you know, ahead of time planning any absences to have a full commission.  Thanks for letting us know.  All right.  Seeing no other reports and communications, I think we can adjourn.  All right.  Meeting is adjourned.  Have a great night.  I was just glad when I first heard you get some lights.  Oh, thank God the coffee shop doesn't have a drive-thru.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . !  .  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
