And if you're looking at all of these things with the idea that something good is out there, the major cities in the United States, with the exception of mostly California, is frozen. And it has been frozen consistently for a very long time now. And there are winds buffeting. This is just from yesterday's blizzard buffets east coast with snow, winds, and flooding. This is 1-30-22. This is from your own newspaper. You've got to learn how to know what's in your newspaper. Because it's telling you something important. Now, if you have frozen weather, and it's what's going on right now, and there are more than one article on it, and that is important. And I just want to speak to the fact that that is part of the supply line. And if you want to keep building on layer after layer after layer, then... I mean, the only... The only thing worse than a finished product that uses the last water, or cutting it back and trying to do something sensible with what you have. And some of the places, some states and some bridges are now being closed to heavy traffic. And the articles are all there, but you have to read the whole paper. And I hope classified in fictitious names. And all that's in the classified is in the part that you get. And that's time, Ruth. Ruth, also, if you can make sure to keep your comments relative to what we're discussing, that would be helpful. You're certainly welcome to speak from business from the floor on other items. But we would ask that you keep your comments just relative to the individual items that were on. Or you can link them in any way you can. And we'll try to keep them in any respective way that you wish to do that. Madam Clerk, what else do we have to speak? Our next speaker is Julie Threat. And you can unmute yourself. I did, Ms. Debbie. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm getting to learn the Zoom. So I think we should keep the Zoom because now I know how to use it. And actually, Ruth, I missed seeing Ruth at the actual meetings, at the city council meetings and chambers. So I love hearing her. So there's got to be a way we can kind of marry these two. I think it is important to always have an online opportunity for people to see and speak. And God bless Ruth. I really enjoyed hearing her. But, yeah, I guess for me, I'm just trying to figure out what it is that we're trying to accomplish or not really accomplish, but what we're doing here. We know we know that it's state mandate. We know that it's coming from the governor. But every other. Every other meeting we go to is interpreting that differently. So are we being ultra conservative with how we're interpreting the rules? Or are we making a political statement about not wanting to wear masks? Or at what point do we get and we know that this is going to come to an end? So I'm trying to figure out exactly why we're interpreting it one way when the county board of supervisors, the Chico School Board that we're meeting at tomorrow are all in person. Thank you. Thank you, Julie. Our last speaker is Nicole Nava. And Nicole, go ahead and unmute yourself. Yay, that was quick. But the timer's not for me. Okay. So I would like to speak on 2.1. And what I would like to say is similar to Ms. Threat, I also appreciate the duality. I would sincerely appreciate a reentrance into the city council chambers. I really don't understand what's going on with our city council. I think our inability to be in there literally the mandate in the state of California is only that masking occurs indoors. So when you guys say to be compliant and all of that, you're actually taking it way overboard. Other cities, communities are having indoor meetings. And I don't even see anything about the social distancing other than it just as a good practice. The mandate has to do with masks being worn indoors. And further, honestly. Honestly, I believe you should get with other communities and letting the governor know that things like that maybe need to be reexamined in light of his own practices recently. It doesn't appear that he even takes the mandate that he is behind seriously. And so I find it kind of offensive that we can't even go into our own chambers and he's at an event with over 50,000. So that's at the state level. But you guys are taking that information and running with it. And I just feel like it's doing a disservice to the community. But I do like and hope that you find a way to keep the Zoom option for those who can't get around as easily. Disabled people might appreciate being able to stay in their house and be able to participate without challenges of people to get them around. So that's one thing. Another I wanted to bring to your attention. I held like a little mini class the other night on Facebook and we were highlighting some of the opportunities for public conversation. And one of which, of course, the mayor brought up was Engage Chico platform. There is something that the class said that they were concerned with, which was the 500 character per comment limit. They did not feel that equates to what right now, like my public speaking opportunity is for three minutes. And I was telling them, you have to be ready for one to three minutes. I think you should examine what a normal pace speech would be and translate into that into the number of characters. And I think you would find it would be more than 500 characters because it does include spaces and commas and all of that. So I think if you really want citizenry to have their full input opportunity, you should make that change. And that might even be something falling under the Brown Act since you are leveraging that as a public comment platform. And thirdly, maybe if there's any way that you could have it be even more hours, I don't know up till what time they can feasibly do. But it's hard for people that are working to kind of get last minute things in it wraps by 430. So thank you for your consideration of my time. Thanks. OK, and Mayor Coolidge, I believe I am not sure, but Davey has his hand up and I'm not I will allow him to speak. I don't know if it's on this item or another item. So, Davey, go ahead and unmute yourself. OK, thank you. Thank you. My name is Davey. I appreciate the service here that everybody. Is offering. I appreciate the leadership. I'm very thankful. I hope to offer my time or I hope to offer my time and accommodate the time that we have here as well. I would just like to say I'm very thankful for the lessening of roadway demise during these times. I'm thankful for the for the environmental forward thoughtfulness that we have in our times with lessening smog. I feel there's very many good ideas that we're finding here. I also find with with with the attendance that we're finding here, it rallies a good fiscal regard for our communities. I'm very thankful for this. I recognize that, you know, quantitative and qualitative data are recognized throughout our Governance and I value very much that we can find the funding when when these data are collected. So yes, I'm very thankful for this. When we have more attendance from from the larger communities. I also very much respect is that if if people like to travel, that's very cool. That's that's very, you know, that people like to see each other and people like to have the humane interaction. However, I do try to. I truly feel that with our progress in humanity toward environmentalism, toward care for toward care for our environments, basically like our cities and in our areas where we live. It's not entirely all about, you know, ecology. However, our environments is this is something that I value very much. And I feel that it's very important to have safety on our roads. These are our environments and how we reflect on such. And it seems to me it lessens. It lessens. It lessens. The real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real I do hope that there's some more, you know, return to a feeling of comfort in our futures. However, I do believe in evolution. And I do believe that this is a wonderful, wonderful platform to be able to help our environments and our reflections and such. Thank you all. I appreciate you all very much. Thank you, Davey. And that is it for hands up on this item. All right. Thank you very much. Do we have any council disqualifications or no votes on this item? I like the poll, item 2.3. For quick questions. Okay. So, Madam Clerk, should we go ahead and vote on the rest of the consent agenda at this time and then move to 2.3? You can do it either way. You can actually ask questions without pulling items. And then if there's a no vote, I can register that. But it's entirely up to whatever the council wants to do on that. Council Member Brown, go ahead. I'd like to pull the item, but thank you. Sure. Go ahead with your question. On the item. We'll take it first. Yeah. So, truly, this is for the sake of transparency. I think we're, you know, there's a lot of folks who are expressing a little discontent with transparency. And so I want to ask a couple questions. This may be from Mr. Orm. There are five positions being budgeted for in this report as part of the shelter site operations. The report states that this is a preemptive measure. Can you explain what that means? Absolutely. And if there's been any lack of transparency, it's only due to legal constraints that we've been under. And I just want to. Yeah, I know you are. I just want to make sure the public hears that as well. So thank you for calling it out when the opportunity presents itself. Yeah. A preemptive measure as it relates to the items surrounding any positions that we might hire related to site supervision is for the pallet shelter site. And we are still in the midst of working through. Evaluating and making a final determination, hopefully in the next week on a site operator. And so this is preemptive in that if neither of those two options before us are readily chosen because of whatever issues may arise, which I hopefully I don't anticipate any. We would then have to operate the site as a city and hire those positions. So this is simply for the site operation of the pallet shelter site. And those are. Being flown right now. And there will also be two other positions being flown. They will be out tomorrow. And so those will be coming back on a B3 appendix at a council meeting near you soon as well. So just to preempt that one. And those are for outreach type of position. So there you go. Great. And the report says that the administrative services allocations will be from ARPA funds. But the shelter support division staff that we're preemptively budgeting for would be general appendix. So we're going to be going for grant funding as time goes on for a number of aspects of site operation. So we may find other grant funds that can offset that general plan. But if you look at it from a worst case scenario, general plan, yes. Thank you. I appreciate the time. You bet. All right, Mr. Mr. Orm, can I ask you another question, if I may? Of course. I just wanted that reiterated. For the public, too, because sometimes people don't. They just hear a particular aspect of that. So do you anticipate these positions being needed or no? At this point in time, I don't anticipate them being needed. However, we have to cover our trail to ensure. So just good planning, then. It's very good planning. Okay. All right. And if, in fact, we had those positions, it's not a certainty, although we'd have to bring them forward under the other two positions. That Councilman Brown alluded to, we'd have to bring them forward as general fund, but they may be able to be paid for by grants. Absolutely. And there's so many grants coming out right now. Those opportunities are consistently coming out. But, yes, we expect that. I will tell you that the individuals that have stepped up to potentially operate the site have been astounding in their competency. And so far, we've had some great conversations, and those are ongoing over the upcoming days. So we anticipate. We won't need to hire these, but just in case. Okay. All right. Thank you. Councilman Brown, do you have anything further? No, nothing else for me. All right. So, Madam Clerk, why don't we take Item 2.1 and 2.2, unless anyone else has anything they'd like to pull, and we'll move forward on the vote with those. So the motion would be to approve the consent agenda with Item 2.3 removed. All right. Do we have a motion? So moved, Sean. I'll second. Alex, go for it, Mike. Okay. All right. A motion by Councilmember Morgan and seconded by Councilmember O'Brien. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Carry 7-0. Aye. Aye. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .! . . . . . . . . council member Tandon yes vice mayor Reynolds no and mayor Coolidge aye okay carry six one all right uh we will now move on thank you very much we will now move on to business from before members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined based upon the number of speakers if you want to speak on business from the floor at this time please raise your hand the councilman cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda and this is the time for any comments that you want uh that are not relative to agenda items so how many hands do we have raised or speakers do we have um right now we only have two um and I would suggest we just start and then see if other hands come up sure let's go with three minutes okay so Nicole Nava go ahead and unmute yourself thank you good evening council so a few things uh first up do you have an update on the letter that you guys were going to be sending to the state requesting some mental health services for the area I'd love to hear an update about that and whether or not the other municipalities were informed and asked to join in at the meetings you guys had noted before um secondly regarding um homeless and shelter provisions so the city council now has a paper the city yeah has a page now called shelter provisions I think and I was noting that there's a quite dated shelter bed count that was up because it really hadn't changed from before and I'd like to ask that since it really is important that the community be aware how many beds are at Torres or at Jesus center is it going to be a relatively mature year prior to this year's! are eventually at the pallet site, that that be kept up to date every day. Like maybe there could be a cutoff for submissions for Ms. Amber. And I think the gal's name is Taylor over at Taurus that's taken over. It would be appreciated by the community. And I think it would cut down on phone calls that some people make to those entities to check on beds. And there's a lot of misinformation out on Nextdoor and other sites about is there, isn't there. I think that level setting that would be a good idea for the community. Also, I wanted to say, I saw the live feed about the Jamboree site and it sounds like there was a lot of collaboration and all of that. I heard all the run through of people who are doing things. I just think sometimes tighten up on numbers because a couple of people said different number of units and all of that. And so some people are trying to track cost and how much, was on the city and okay. And how much per unit. They are pretty pricey per unit. But I know that that's also due to the prevailing wage issues. But congrats, it looks like it's going to look good and I'm glad there's going to be affordable housing. I hope it's primarily all the seniors. That's what I think we all were told. Also, I'm wondering if Mayor Coolidge was able to obtain the answers to the questions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the homeless community to try to encourage that they take advantage of the resource and referrals and also where we mitigate weak points wherever possible. So thank you for your time tonight. Thank you. And Dr. Katie Posey, go ahead. Hi, everybody. Good evening. Let's see here. I did want to also second the last comment that Nicole made about getting an update on the mental health support letter. That would be awesome to hear about. I know in some cases, you know, it's like a letter's written, it goes out or it doesn't go out or we don't know what happens, right? So it would just be great to get to get info on that. The other thing I wanted to mention is engaging on the platform and writing comments. And this is the second comment to an earlier point about the 500 character limit. I wanted to mention... I wanted to mention that because I don't know if, you know, the tech people or whoever create that site can figure something out because the 500 character limit, it's really short. And as you know, speaking, it would be longer and it's hard to be concise often, you know, in writing. So I think it would be great to get that expanded because if you look at the platform for the county, you can write a lot. So anyways, that's one thing. And then the other thing is God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye three. Go ahead. Okay. I cannot speak unless I'm following Jessica Giannola. That's normally the process, Debbie. Actually, I was just thinking, you know, maybe Nicole and Dr. Posey and I and Jessica can be in chambers the next time. And then you all can zoom in for us. How about that? Actually, I just wanted to do a quick shout out about the point in time homeless count and survey that happened last week. I got to participate in that for the first time. And it was one of the most eye-opening, the most impactful, the most well-run process. I think I've been part of or even thought, you know, maybe going into it, I had different expectations. But I did want to give a shout out to the group that put that together. I'm sure it was probably Health and Human Services and Scott Kennelly's team, whatever the program managers are. Our fabulous, fabulous job. The training was amazing. We had online tools, apps on our phone, and we could then walk around. I was assigned to Comanche Creek, which was on purpose. And what I learned there, everybody, was vastly different than what you have in your mind based on hearing people talk or watching social media or driving around the neighborhood, because it's definitely not that way inside. And there were a lot of very, there were a lot of, citizens there, a lot of residents that absolutely 100% will be candidates for the shelter, the pallet program. In fact, I was basically selling that to a lot of the people. And so to Nicole's point about the outreach, however, the social worker community is going to go through that, it's very, very important that they're matching up with those people. The one gal that I'm going to write about, I'm going to send you guys information about was Mary, and she was not a real name. She's 62. She's out there. I saw her sweeping the sides of her tent, very well kept, together. It was right on that brand new boundary with that fencing where everybody assumes the worst. And she's there. She's 62. She's well, she's well fed. She's not well fed, but she's got, she doesn't have a lot of stuff. She's not looking for a job. She's got social security. She's not a drunk. She's not an addict. She just needs to be hand carried over there to the, to the pallet homes. Anyway, it's just, I'm thinking about her in my mind. So I digress. So I wanted to thank, James LaDawn from Chicopee, L-E-D-O-N-N-E. He was our chaperone during the day. Wonderful guy, wonderful part of the community. So I wanted to thank him. And also a shout out to Dopeca, Council Member Tandon. She was out there with us. And it was great to see her there as a citizen, you know, getting a firsthand look at actually what's going on in that camp. So again, I look forward to this going forward and participating with the program. And thank you very much for your time. Thank you. And Ruth Sarnoff. Let's see. Actually, I don't see her right now. I was under Dorothy, Ruth. Oh, I know. I do not see her on here right now. But we do have Davey. So go ahead, Davey. And you can speak on any item that's not on the agenda. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I want to applaud everybody. I'm, I'm, I'm, I very much appreciate. The thoughtfulness that's been shared in the past three shares, especially, and throughout the meeting as well. I'm very thankful and I agree. And, and I applaud the idea of resources being related, being relative within the pallet shelters. I think it was a wonderful idea. And I hope, I hope that, I hope the accuracy is, is, you know, is, is brought to the people. It's, I found myself challenged at times trying to navigate different, different resources, as well as technology in my life, as a matter of fact. You know, that's, that's, that's a subject that I find interesting as well within these Zoom platforms, you know, within these video call platforms. I consider that, you know, there are many options. I consider that within, within audio technology trainings that I've had in my younger days, that although higher frequencies, although more soprano voices are often, well, they are scientifically known as more harmonious. They do not travel through microphone filters quite like bass does. So, so I do respect that, that I hope to hear everybody's voice clearly, you know, it's, and I hope that the technology can be, well, I mean, I know this technology can be sorted out. I, I would go on, there's remote management at times. And, you know, so, however, like, I'm not sure on how ever, how everybody in the community would feel comfortable about such a thing. Of course, right? Like, however, you know, I do know that there's technology resources. As a matter of fact, well, I mean, I don't want to suggest anybody in the neighborhood. I was thinking along the lines of like Chico, state audio technology programs. However, you know, I just want to say is that I truly, these things are very easily sorted out for communities. I do work on this and, and, you know, audio technology is really not that, it's really not that hard these days. As a matter of fact, I mean, that's one of the reasons I came back to Chico. It was because of, you know, audio technology. So thank you. Thank you all so very much. I appreciate you. Okay. And then Ruth, go ahead. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . there is no way that water is going to be available. And I personally think that to put pipes under the ground for water that is not going to be there because everything is frozen and there's no coming back from what's going on in the East Coast and along most of America. And to put piping in there for water that is not going to be available is really a crazy thing to be doing. Now, the thing that is most bothersome about it is that I think they've already actually started it under there. I don't know on what basis or what act was done that made it that way, but it ought to stop because there is no water going to go trickling through there. And every single bit of cement, asphalt, everything that's warming this planet and causing havoc everywhere. There's blizzards buffeting the East Coast. Right in your newspaper, 1-30-22, you can't get any closer than that. It's, you know, think about it. There's nothing wrong with leaving the shelters where they are because people will step in. People have been stepping in in Chico forever, picking up the slack when organized, and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and that exists on the East Coast and all the way into New England and all the way into Canada and Alaska. All right. Thank you, Ruth. That's that. Ruth was our last speaker. Okay. All right. We'll move on to public hearings. Item 4. Item 4.1, redistricting of city council districts in the city of Chico. Public hearing number one, Mr. Ewing. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Honorable Mayor Coolidge, and members of the council. Pursuant to Elections Code Section 21601 and Chico Municipal Code Section 1.30.250, the city council shall adjust the boundaries of any or all districts following each decennial federal census. The city of Chico redistricting process must be completed by April 17, 2022. It's also required that the city council hold at least four public hearings before adopting a final map at which the public is invited to provide input regarding the composition of the council districts. At least one public hearing must be held before draft maps are drawn. At least two must be held after draft maps are drawn. And at least one must be held on a Saturday, Sunday, or after 6 p.m. on a Wednesday, pursuant to Elections Code Section 21601. The full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen. Okay, don't seem to be able to share the screen. All right, we'll work on that. Are we able to share his screen, Madam Clerk? Or if they have the slides, I can, they can just adjust them while I, you know, speak and let them know. You should be able to share now, Claudio. Okay. Got it. There we go. All right. Slideshow. All right. Everyone's able to see the slideshow? Yes. Yeah, I believe so, yes. All right. So, all right. So here's a picture of the current district boundaries. As we mentioned, this is the current map that is going to be changing. The first assignment I did was to go through and see if a redistricting is, needs to be mandated. So we actually can't see the, you have to click on that slide to show it to us. The second slide, we can only see the first slide. Oh, shoot. It's not, yeah, it's not adjusting. Use slideshow. Try this again. There we go. That. Yep, we got it. Okay. Yeah, that's the map. Great. All right. So, as I mentioned, this is the current map as, you know, was used in the 2020 election. Okay. And the first assignment was to figure out, is a district being mandated based on the 10% or will a new map have to be drawn? The answer is yes. So above is the table, the current population, the mean, target mean population is 14,738. The largest, the district, or the largest district is 1,751 people above the median. The largest negative deviation is negative 1,175, creating an overall range and deviation of 19.85%, nearly double of the current allowable deviation. So the deviation, as I mentioned, 19.85, the redistricting will be mandatory in order to correct the deviation issue as a result of the 2020 census. Districts one and three may not be mandated. The district must lose population due to being over the recommended high deviation of 5%. In fact, district one is even over 10% at the moment. Districts four, five, and seven must gain population due to being under the recommended low deviation of 5%. Districts two and six are well within the median population percentage. So no changes are legally required, but can be made in order to adjust the other lines. Okay. Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . Bye Bye . and submit their own district map for consideration. There will be two different formats that residents can use. So tentative schedule tonight, public hearing as well as the map to launch it is now available on the website. Public map submission deadline is February 14th, 2022 at 5 p.m.. Publishing of the draft maps to the public will be on February 22nd, 2022, public hearing number two, March the first 2022 public hearing three, March 15th, 2022. And then the final public hearing for April 5th, 2022 with the submission of the final map to the county on April 15th and implementation of the new districts for the November 2022 election. Public participation process. So we will need your help to make this change and draw the new districts. The city has made available a downloadable map tool where residents can draw their own preferred districts or just their preferred community of interest to submit their map to the city. So they can either do a proposal of seven districts or they can shade in a certain area, such as the area around Chico State, to show that this is an area they feel should be kept. So we can get the district plan and the map together. For more tech savvy users, you can use a free GIS software from the website, Dave's Redistricting dot org, which will allow you to create a district plan and either publish online or share the link with the city and demographer. The city, along with the demographer, will incorporated the submitted resident maps into the final map of the city. One of our primary goals when drawing city council district is to draw lines that respect, may reflect, and reflect the city's plan. So we can use the map to show the city's plan So for more information and instruction on how to use the mapping tools available is available on the city's website redistricting. And then if you have any questions, email at redistricting, email at Chico, see a dot gov and as I mentioned, all public submissions must be in by February 14th, 2022. All right. Do we have any questions? Any questions or any comments? All right. Questions from council? I have a question, Andrew. Go ahead. Like, can you tell me, as you say, this has to be done and turned in. Was April 14th the deadline or is that the deadline based upon us starting today? Or what's the drop dead date that we need to get? I'm going to get that over to the clerk. Is that April 17th? April 17th. Okay. So we're on a tight timeframe about that. Shoot. I had one other question. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot what it was. I lost it. I'll come back. I'll let somebody else go if they have any. Oh, I know. Communities of interest. Obviously, you're not from the area. What have you done and what are you planning on doing to familiarize yourself with the communities? Of interest? Obviously, you're not from the area. What have you done and what are you planning on doing to familiarize yourself with the communities of interest? And are you aware of them or are you completely relying on public input for that? So I have been doing a little bit of research on the city of Chico, some of the neighborhoods, as well as will be relying a lot on residents and even the city council on what they consider a community. But I have been doing some research on the city of Chico as well and getting to learn about the different areas when I was up there. In fact, the next morning, I took a drive around different areas of the city to kind of familiarize myself as well. And found it's a very, well, it's got over 100,000 people. It's got a small town feel, but definitely has some very different parts to it that, you know, it's clear that certain areas belong together, while some probably should not be. Okay, great. Thank you. Appreciate that. You're welcome. All right. Any other questions? Okay. Going once, going twice. All right. Well, thank you very much. We appreciate your time. Thank you. All right. So at this point, we'll open the hearing to the public to receive input. And Madam Clerk, can you just for the public define what we need to do here through the public hearing? Well, we just, we need to be able to open the hearing. We're opening it up for participation by our citizens. And right now we have two hands up. I would encourage anyone who is currently zooming in that if you would like to speak on the redistricting process to please, and hands are starting to raise. So we will have some. And then again, our second public hearing will be held March 1st. And like Claudio said, the deadline for submitting citizen maps is the 14th of February. Okay. And that those can either be dropped off in my office and or emailed or using the online mapping tool. So we now have four hands up to speak during this public hearing. And I will go ahead, Nicole Nova, go ahead. And before Nicole starts, actually, if we could, so do we have a timeline? Some of our public hearings have time limits. Is that the case on these as we move forward? No. Not on this particular one, because we're wanting to encourage every participant. Absolutely. Okay. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Becky. Sorry, I don't know why. It's the same action. Is it still bad? It is. Yeah, it's almost robotic in that sense. So why don't we come back to you in a minute? Okay. So the next speaker is Ruth Sarnoff. And Ruth, this is on districting. Go ahead, Ruth. Okay. It occurs to me that this is very related to how the structuring of the housing is in relationship to the districting. You know, I've been in the building for a long time, and I've Because I think there needs to be something in the public realm, like, for instance, maybe call upon the Enterprise Record. They get a lot of advertising from you guys. So maybe they will just have a main article that describes what was described just recently about the option of people developing their own plans for how that might relate to the housing that is already there and how it might be used, perhaps, to do things like growing food socially, having a place to cook and places to roast things. In my opinion, we are deep into climate change, and I see no moving back from it. And I think we better think ahead with having. Excuse me. I know, but. I know, but you're taking my time. So stop the clock. I'll listen to you. No, you're trying to time me out. Madam, if you could just pause for a second, I'd appreciate that. So, Ruth, we will give you some extra time. We can reset the clock for you so you can finish here. But we really do need to keep the comments on the particular topic. And we're happy to have you. Discuss any individual item that you like and comment on it. Madam Clerk, if you can reset her clock for a minute 30, where I started to, if we can do that. If not, just give her two minutes. But Ruth, we just need the comments focused on the actual topic that we're hearing. So you're welcome to speak at, you know, from the floor on any item. And we welcome that. But on each of these individual topics, we need you to speak to them. So this is in. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .! . . . . . . I'm sorry, but I think that it needs to be shared in a different way. This is even hard for the people that are doing it and have a real motivation to just tear their hair up. They don't even know about anything like, you know, fictitious names or how funding gets in or any of that stuff. And so, you know, I know about Citizens United. Okay. I know that the U.S. Supreme Court decided that corporations were people. And it was around the voting issue at that time that it did so much damage to the right to vote. But getting back to this, let's just say that if all the information that's here about what needs to be done, and redistricting was opened up, that people could submit other plans and start talking about that in the interim period. And the interim period could start tomorrow. And people could look at the minutes for this meeting and get some information if it gets up immediately after this meeting. It took four days for it to get up the last time. And in the meantime, there was a lot that happened, like press conferences and everybody was getting their words in. But a lot of people were freezing to death up here. And there were a lot of things going on. And I think we need to have it open. It's just not right that the public not have it. And I would request that you ask the Enterprise Record to print some. Prop page kind of thing or some special thing. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So, Nicole, go ahead. And unmute yourself. It's still garbled. That's. I'm trying to call in. So I'll try to call. Okay. Awesome. Thank you. So we'll move to Julie Threat. Go ahead, Julie. Okay. Hello, you guys. So, this is the third time I've sat through. I'm going to be on public hearing number one on redistricting. And so three consultants, three different tools, systems, processes. And I guess a lot of things are going through my mind because number one, Claudio, I am. You know, I appreciate you very much coming into this one and I'm just giving you forewarning. It's going to be interesting. But is there a way that because we've given all of our public input, our communities of interest multiple times and multiple occasions, both at the campus and at the public level, that we can get the public input? Is there a way that we can consolidate and give that information to you for your tool? And I haven't looked at your tool yet to see if it's to see how it works, but that's just one thought is, again, trying to collect that the more efficient way. But number two, at the end of the day, both processes, and we all know this, had come down to an 11th hour map getting thrown in the process and pretty much bypassing all the public input and the public comments. And there's one going tomorrow night at the school board meeting. And so I'm going to go ahead and throw out a map to the board level. So I guess I'm just throwing out a plea to the public and to interested parties and to members of this council, to the consultant, to all the city staff. If there's any way we can avoid throwing out a map at the 11th hour after we spend months and months and weeks and weeks going through all the data, all the maps, bring all the analysis as citizens, only to have it wiped away. That'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Thank you, Julie. I'm going to go to Eileen Robinson. If you can unmute yourself, Eileen. Okay. Did that work? Yes, go ahead. Okay, thank you. First time on trying to use it to communicate. Council, one of the things that I would suggest strongly is that as your process begins, make sure that the fact that you're going to have to set a sequence for your election, to follow the, I think it's 4 and 3 in your cycles, so that that can be a part of the consideration. That was one of the things that seems to be a surprise to the school district because they hadn't done this before, was not realizing that part of the process is setting the sequence of when the districts will hold their elections. So that's an important thing to consider. Just urging you to make sure that that's part of the discussions early on as your districts begin to be formed with the help of the demographer and public input. Thank you. Thank you, Eileen. Go back to Nicole and see if you're there, Nicole. Okay. I'm going to go ahead. Nicole, are you there? Okay. So I'm going to go on to Davey. And Davey, this is about the districting. So go ahead. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate you all. And I'm thinking along the lines when it comes to districting, I recall the beautification of Chico. And I think along the lines, I really applaud Ruth, Dorothy Ruth, if I may say, because I recall the parks and the parks. And the parks. And the parks. The cooking areas and the parks. And I found this beautiful within the districts. I found this beautiful within the areas of Chico. I do recall these things. And I recall these things, they brought beauty to Chico. They brought the beautification from the ideals of, from the origins of Chico, from what I recall, from the lessons I recall. I also want to admit that I have many flaws, so please forgive my simple ways. In my thoughts, in my thoughts, I regard there's changing times and aspects like that. I really love the idea of. I really love the idea of. Of cooking stations around about. However, if, if, if, if not that I really liked the idea of like art from schools. I remember lessons that I learned from the five boroughs back east, you know, I'm born here in Chico. However, I remember lessons from the five boroughs in the areas that there was ways that bringing the arts into neighborhoods would generate patrons, patrons into the community and bring bring, you know, money into the community. Honestly, it's from Greenwich Village into Bedstripe, Brooklyn, Brooklyn and round about the five boroughs. It's been a technique that they've had now. Now, of course, like I don't I don't want to bring contrast in the way I really love Chico. You know, I've been around about I really love it here. I do. And I'm not trying to like, you know, I regard there's different contrast of different neighborhoods. However, I'm just saying that I believe I believe that perhaps the youth, perhaps the schools could bring their arts forward. I remember when I went to Chapman School. You know, in the area that I went in. You know, I went to Chapman School. You know, we would paint. We would paint on big billboards and we had them around a little Chico Creek. So I think that's a lovely idea to bring beauty into our area and perhaps fiscal respects as well as as well as I would really like to see them about environmentalism as well. I would like to see them about ecology and and to hopefully benefit everybody, you know, for ideals, you know, for the good ideals of bringing goodness around about so people can reflect in kindness. And and, you know, so there so that so that we can have the beauty. You know the beautification as well as as well as you know, find some peace with one another within the struggles we find in our communities. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate you. Thank you, Davey. I'm going to try again for Nicole. Go ahead, Nicole, if you're there. Okay, I do not see her yet. Amy M. Go ahead and unmute yourself. Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry that was an accident I didn't sign up to speak. Okay. All right. So I will mute you, and then let me check. I believe this might be Nicole. Nicole is this. Are you on with your phone. Okay. So, Amy M. You still have your hand up. So if you if you could put your hand down if you're not going to speak on this item. Thank you. And then you see Nicole Nova on. Yes. Yep. Can you hear me now. I can't. Lord. So basically on the maps. Of course, as before, I would hope we would strive for fairness and non consideration of incumbency and all those other delightful things that go along with the process. I am a little disturbed that there's only a two week turnaround for trying to produce maps for folks that typically do like to submit their ideas. So, I would actually echo what Miss Ruth, I believe that was her name said about, you know, trying to produce materials quickly. The other thing is, I have a question about what is the impact to the elections that were set this November that were for the districts to four and six and excuse me because I did have to step out when the man was speaking for a brief time if he covered that. But I'm interested is to do we do a whole reset what ends up happening that parts very confusing. And I think a lot of people share that question. And then I just this this whole thing is so tight that I am concerned that we're going to run into a lot of chaos and people being upset and so anything even between. These time periods that can be maybe done to help throw up maps as you get them versus waiting for the next one like as fast as anybody's producing them and wants to weigh in for comment. Great. Or if you can't do it on that official site can there be like an unofficial one where the community can help each other weigh in and voting it up voting it down can they use that. I think there was like a discussions or ideas area or I know there is on engaged Chico. Is there the ability for them to be elected. Maybe and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and seems to do the very best job of including communities of interest, taking into account diversity concerns and all of those things. So these are some of the thoughts that early on went through my head that we might have to get a little more innovative in sharing them. And maybe you guys can do a special press conference even to describe the elements of the various maps when they start to be submitted. So then the news agencies and the newspaper could like cover what's behind each one of those a little more timely than if they're behind the eight ball on it, because I don't even know how we can fairly hit the mark with due diligence on all these, if we don't explore some other ways to go about this. Thanks. And sorry about all the technical issues. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Thank you, Nicole. Bryce Goldstein, go ahead. Hey there. I'm super looking forward to this process. And I hope that we're going to do a much better job of doing it. So thank you so much for joining us. And I hope that we're going to do a much better job than the city council districting of two years ago. I hope we're going to not focus on incumbency. And we'll instead base this process on making sure that everybody in our community has a fair voice and a fair vote. I am looking forward to checking out this online public input tool. I agree, I was a little, a little bit shocked by the only two week window for public input. I think it's going to be hard to get the word out. As well as let people have enough time to submit maps. And I hope that this is going to be another great occurrence of many of us in the public agreeing on things because I already agree with some speakers I just heard who I maybe don't always agree with about the public input process. I think it'll be great if we have a like a channel for discussing and seeing public submissions, and a little more time to do it. So anyway, good luck looking forward to this. Good night. Thank you, Bryce. That is we do not have any other speakers. Alright, so at this point, we'll close the public hearing on this. Do we have any further questions from Council? I have a question. Go ahead Council Member Brown. Claudio, just kind of pointing to some of the comments made by some speakers. How are we intending to get to the public input? I think we're going to have to get this information out so as many folks as possible know that they have the ability to participate in crafting the maps for the next 10 years. So we have a tool that's on the website now. And then we'll be working with the city itself to get the word out to residents. I know that usually it's the city that on the website that advertises it in their newsletters and so on. In some other jurisdictions I worked in, Council members too have taken an active effort in notifying the community. So those are some efforts that can be done to get the word out to people to submit their map. At the same time, you know, while there's that deadline, obviously, if something comes in just after it, I mean, I'll take it and get it prepped as well if it's, you know, meets the legal standards. Also because of the Fair Maps Act, they have to be published six days before the hearing. Since February is a little bit shorter, there's a little bit less of a timeframe. So that's what caused a little bit of the time crunch. Thanks for clarifying that. Staff, could you speak to some of the ways that the city intends to get the word out so that folks are aware that the tool exists? Yes, I would like to address that, Council Member Brown. So thank you for the question. It's great. I, hearing what the citizens were asking for right now, not only did I talk to the press today, and I will prepare and I will get back to you. But I also want to say that we're going to have a press release tomorrow, and we'll have a press release that goes out to hit additional media outlets tomorrow. I have, I'm looking at my other screen in my office that shows that I have 2,471 users of Engage Chico, and I can send a blast to them and get to that. I mean, I can just send that out and send the press release. I can send the links to the mapping tools that are uploaded. If you go to the city's website. Under what's new, there's the second item in is the redistricting, the public hearing link. That link will take you to mapping tools, to the schedule. We will do everything that we can to bolster the citizen input and getting the word out. And so, I think that the Engage Chico component can be used to notify people. In addition, I believe on that schedule, and Claudio, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but, I think that the map that are provided by the citizens would be uploaded and provided to the public on February 22nd. And I can actually put those into Engage through a meeting agenda. And so, just like how people participate and provide input on agenda items, by uploading those maps and working through that system, they would be able to vote up or down, and provide input. It would be one single item, or I could set each map to be an individual one. It just depends on the number of maps that we have. So, I will work on that to try to come up with a solution in terms of allowing people to vote up or down and include that in the Engage Chico component. But again, that doesn't get uploaded until February 22nd. Thank you, Eva. Thank you, Claudio. That's a thorough response. You're welcome. All right. Do we have any other questions from any other council members? All right. Seeing none, Claudio, I have a question for you, too. And Madam Clerk, maybe you can answer this as well. So, in terms of the timeline, I know we had a couple of questions about that. How is that dictated? And if you can, maybe we could have you share that page of your screen again, just so the public can see the timeline once more. Sure. Hold on. Let me get that file back up. And I know with a lot of the other municipalities that there's been issues on that, you know, the timeline obviously is important. And, you know, last-minute maps obviously discourage that kind of thing. But, you know, I just want to make sure that so it is maybe you can just speak to the map, how it's dictated, how these deadlines, how each of these, you know, dates are come up with, so the public can understand that. Sure. So, basically, we have, you know, there's a two-week period beginning today to February 14th that we're taking public map submissions. And is that mandated by state law? Yeah. It is mandated by state law to have a public participation process. So this is the process that we have chosen to go ahead with. Publish with the idea that there's this space in between is to allow us to get the maps that have been turned in as well as draft maps that I will prepare. Publish them and ready for February 22nd. That means all relevant data that's required by the census and by redistricting guidelines is, you know, set and ready to go. And in addition, you have to post even maps that are noncompliant. Now, they'll be detailed as noncompliant, say they're outside of the deviation, aren't contiguous. But this is to allow for the opportunity if a city council member or a member of the public say, hey, we like that map, but we just need to kind of change some of these portions up so it's compliant. It's there and available for you to use. And it allows for maximum transparency. Public hearing, too, will be March 1st. That's when we present on the maps. Go over the data. Yeah. Go over why, you know, decisions were made and how to draw it. The people who submit it are, you know, able to speak during that public hearing as to why they drew the map the way they did and make their case to the city council why their map should be the one chosen. And we repeat that again with public hearing number three, in which at that point the council can begin to whittle down the maps. And they can decide what you know which ones they want to keep. Which ones are elevate and which ones that are not going to be moved on. And then at public hearing four is where you can make that decision on April 5th, make a decision on like the final one or two maps that you'll vote on at the next meeting. Okay. Yeah, I think that really helps just a little more definition of the timeline and what's going to be involved so people understand. All right. Thank you. I appreciate. Yeah. Sure. I had one quick one more quick question for Claudio. Just because a couple of people asked on it, Claudio, is there any reason we would need to readdress the sequencing, since we were odd numbers up in what is it 2020 and then even numbers and 2022 or whatever that is. Well, we need to readdress that or is that kind of already set now that that has been addressed. No, sequencing was taken care of at districting. So now that we're redistricting that sequence will continue. Okay. Thank you. And just to reiterate for the public's knowledge, the map that we have now is not eligible. So everything that we see coming back will look maybe drastically, maybe not drastically, but will be different than what that map is. Correct. So like with my draft, you know, draft maps. I'll do the full draft. I'll do the full draft. But the first one will be what we call right sizing where basically you take the one you know the ones that need the shrink, shrink them ones that need to grow, grow them and then presented as a right sizing, and then there'll be a couple of other graphs that will probably make a little more substantial changes based on community input that comes in or a even based on the graph maps that come in, or communities of interest that are submitted. Okay, great. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. And then, Mayor, which I would just like to just reiterate for the public and for who's listening and we'll make sure that this is stressed, is that we have things to Claudio and his firm. We have two ways of creating those maps, you can use a paper map, and he's provided a link to a map that you can just print off and draw your lines using a dark pen, you can bring them by come by and see me, bring them to my office, or you can scan them and send them to me. In addition, if you're working with the online mapping tool that will take care of that process. I know that the during the district in the creation of the districts, the biggest complaint that we got from citizens is that are the maps were hard to create online. And so I'm really grateful that we have two options, and a lot of, you know, that opportunity was expanded so that we can ensure everyone had a voice. Okay. And I'm done. No, thank you very much. All right. So we will move on to the regular agenda. Yes, moving on. Do you think we could take a quick break. Yeah, I was going to try to push through this one if, but if you want to take a break prior we can. That's fine. We can go through this one after that would be great. Okay, yeah, no problem. So item 5.1 consideration of an ordinance introductory reading resolution relating to the! The! The! It is a lot of pieces and a lot of components, but the goal is to reduce organic waste by 75% and then also food recovery both by 20% by the year 2025. So the legislation became effective on January 1, 2022. However, they're allowing us to, it took a while for them to kind of come up with how we're going to meet these goals. CalRecycle is who I'm referring to. One of the components is that we have a mandatory ordinance to help compel and encourage people to follow the regulations and to do the organic recycling and methane reductions that we're trying to reach in this goal of this bill. They wanted the ordinance to be passed by January 1 of this month, last month, I guess. This is the first. But they're allowing us to have the ordinance be passed by April 1, 2022. So what you see before. You is actually an ordinance that amends our municipal code to do two things. One is it adds the additional definitions that are pertinent just to organic recycling, such as commercial generator, tier one, tier two, all those specific terms that are pertinent to SB 1383. And then it also adds a new chapter to our Title VIII code that specifically talks about the many enforcement actions. And we're going to talk about that in a little bit. And the many provisions and regulations that 1383 requires the city to do, as well as the residents and commercial businesses and food generators. So what it is required that we have this ordinance. We really do not have a choice. What the ordinance does do is it allows an option, though. It allows us to provide options for people to recycle, recycling, and have trash as well as organic recycling. And then also, but it allows them to still self-haul. So if they want to. To compost on their own or have other means of taking care of their materials, they can still do that. So it gives those two options. But there are some self-haul requirements that they have to get approval by us and do some reporting requirements. But it does still provide that option that they have that ability to self-haul. So what we also we are trying really hard to work with the waste haulers. Our big concern is how do we collect both green waste? And food waste without introducing a fourth truck or a fourth container with space constraints are going to be a big problems, particularly with the homeowners. As well as the downtown businesses. They're having a hard time even having containers for the trash and the recyclables that they have. So we're trying to look both waste haulers are looking at trying to do a commingled system where we would collect both organic landscape waste. And then food waste together. But that takes a facility that can handle a commingled product. We have a facility for that. Unfortunately, that can handle food waste that's source separated. And we have a facility that can handle green waste source separated. But there isn't a facility locally that can do a commingled product. The nearest facility is down outside of Marysville, Austin Road. It's about 60 miles one way. So we need more time just like other communities. Butte County also is in the same situation. Norville is also same situation. So there was a recent legislation. And it was primarily related to carbon. Theören and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . full full<|it|> full<|te|> full cycle gives us an opportunity to show how we are going to meet the requirements in the timeline, in a timely manner. So it's called a notice and intent to comply. And so what we can show is that there have been COVID impacts, what trucks are hard to get, containers are hard to get, of course, labor shortages and other supply issues. I think we certainly fit that bill here in Butte County as well. So like I was mentioning, Butte County, as well as Oroville, is pursuing a notice and intent to comply. And I'd like to recommend that we also do that and give us more time without getting civil penalties from power cycle to try to get voluntary compliance. That's our intent, always is to get voluntary compliance and to really come up with a program that's going to work for us here, especially in this kind of rural county. It's easier for some of the big, larger urban areas to comply. But it's a little harder when we don't have the facilities nearby to do what we need to do. So before you, you have the ordinance for the first introductory reading. And then there's also a resolution that's required to authorize staff, within the city manager in this case, to submit a notice and intent to comply with the SB 1383 regulations. That's pretty much what I have. If you have more details or questions, I'd be happy to answer those. All right. Do we have any questions from council? Yes. Council Member Brown, go ahead. Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Chairman, for the presentation. I know that in the fiscal impacts portion of the report, that that was hard to determine. But obviously, the public will likely be interested in understanding how this might affect that realm. Is there any opportunity for estimating the impact of a mandate financially on the city? It's kind of hard because we don't really know where we're taking the material. Like I said, for instance, the road facility I mentioned, I know that their tipping fee is $91 a ton. Our landfill is $42 a ton. So that's a pretty good, almost over a double increase in disposal costs. And then when you add if we have to take it down, you know, 60 miles one way, you know, so those those we just don't know until we where we're going to be taking materials and how we're going to collect it. If we can get by with the same with organics recycling container that we have for the landscape and use it for food waste, that doesn't mean more trucks, it doesn't mean more containers. But again, it's kind of it's just until we really hone down how we're going to meet these requirements, it's really hard to determine. But we do know it's, it's likely going to go up. Gotcha. All right. Thank you. Thank you for that. This was not isn't going to necessarily relate to the ongoing costs of running the program. But is there any funding via grants for at least launching these programs? I know that as it relates to climate change and resistance, you can see there's a lot of statewide dollars that are available for specific programs. But I'm curious if that's been explored. And if anything applies to this particular implementation. Yeah, they're in fact, I just, they just recently put out a non competitive is kind of based on a per capita basis of funding available. It was a short timeline, they announced it at the first of January, it was due today. But we were I was able to put in an application to we were entitled to about $148,000. I had a $148,000 grant, which is a $148,000 grant. So we were able to put in an application to do some money for outreach for sure. But I think it's more important for us to come up with how what we're going to do because we can't really put out outreach if we don't know how we're going to collect it. So I'm working with the county they also submitted and we're trying to come up with what we call a trans load facility at the landfill that will allow the haulers to with commingled loads to put them in bigger, larger transport trucks, which reduce the cost for transportation. So I thought it was important that we help in that process with either permitting, or, you know, equipment or whatever may be needed so that we could at least have a local trans load facility that would help reduce those costs. Great. I mean, I appreciate your mentioning of public education, which I'm totally hearing can't can't happen until we figure out what we're educating the public about. But I'm pleased to hear that that's part of the conversation and the broader implementation. That was my other question. So thanks for your presentation. All right, do we have any further questions? from council? All right, seeing none. Thank you, Mr. Thurmond. So this point, we'll move on to speakers from the floor. Do we have anyone with their hands up at this point? No, we do not at this time. All right. entertain a motion from council. Alex, so move to approve an ordinance of the city council. The city of Chico amending Title eight health and sanitation of the Chico Municipal Code relating to mandatory solid waste recycling and organic waste disposal reduction and the associated resolution with this item.

Perry, 7-0. Aye. All right. Moving on to Item 5.3, Chico Commercial Candidates Policy, Storefront Retailer Delivery and Non-Storefront Delivery Only. And we will go to Mr. Ewing. Thank you for this report. Thank you, Mayor, Honorable Mayor, members of the Council. At your January 4, 2022 meeting, you directed me to analyze the existing commercial cannabis policy and make recommendations regarding the operation of retail storefront deliveries and non-storefront delivery and bring back an item for discussion. That item is before you now. Pursuant to that direction, I would like to ask the Council to consider the following. In the previous section, I reviewed the Chico Municipal Code resolutions and legislative history regarding the commercial cannabis business. The storefront delivery in Section 5.42.050 of the Municipal Code provides that the delivery of cannabis products for sale is already incidental to and part of the allowed operations of a storefront retailer. Chico Municipal Code Section 5.42.050. Defines a retailer as a retail storefront or storefront retailer as a storefront retailer of a commercial cannabis business facility where cannabis, cannabis products or devices for the use of cannabis or cannabis products are offered either individually or in combination for retail sale to customers at a fixed location, including an establishment that also offers delivery of cannabis and cannabis products as part of a retail sale. Thank you. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . requirements set forth in sections 5.4 2.3 0 and 5.4 2.3 1 5 based on the foregoing I recommend that the City Council use your legislative power to direct staff to solicit applications for the operation of non storefront delivery only commercial cannabis businesses that concludes my report that's a clarifying question mr. mayor yeah absolutely go ahead so mr. Ewing originally we approved three retail storefronts with delivery that was it that's how it currently stands correct correct any change to that would allow for further delivery services without the retail storefront correctly thank you all right further questions from Council I have some comments but I'll wait till after public comment okay anyone else all right Madam clerk how many uh speakers do we have let's see um we have two at this point all right okay and our first speaker is we start off go ahead Ruth okay um I would like to draw attention to um the way in which things are funded and and it's remained the same it's been the same and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and is a United States Environmental Protection Agency who basically has been the promoter of real estate once the sidewalks and all the lights and everything was in there to direct people and to solicit business for subdivisions before the people come in. That's the basic way it works. A mayor, a past mayor kind of learned that and frankly interrupted me and he sounded like a tobacco auctioneer. I'm from Tennessee. I'm from that state that's the Klan state. That's the place where a lot of problems arise. So I want to get back to the, to the, to the, Superfund Redevelopment Program. You go to epa.gov EPA, United States Environmental Protection Agency. Where, reuse where you live. There are regions now. There's EPA Region 1, which is a whole group, a full group of regions, states. There's region two, there's region four, there's region five, there's region six. And they're all here for people should be able to look at it. Pre-funding of business is not anything new in this state. And in this city, and in this county, and in Sacramento, or any place. Everybody knows the rules of the game. And it's time the public learned the rules. That's time. And I just would note that in the future, and Ruth, I do love to talk about this, but I'm going to talk about it in a little bit. But I'm going to love to hear you speak. We really need to have you stay on the topic. And this one in particular, the storefront retail delivery of commercial canes. So in the future, if you could just stay on the topic, we'd appreciate that. I know you have particular items that you'd like to talk about and that's fine, but we need to do each item individually and have the public comment on each item specifically. So, all right, moving on to our next speaker, Madam Cliff. Hello. Charles Burton, go ahead and unmute yourself. Good evening, City Council. Thank you guys for bringing this topic back up. I appreciate it as somebody who was attempting to turn in a delivery application. I'm also somebody that turned in an application for the storefront and delivery, and we're in the process of still waiting. We had our interview two weeks ago now, and we're still waiting to hear, but our fallback plan was always if we did not get one of the licenses, we would have to go back and do it again. So, was to open our delivery service, and we would hope to still have that as our fallback, as we are heavily invested in the community with getting our individual application together and paying rent for the last two years as this has came together. So, I would just like to support bringing back open the application process and not limiting the numbers, maybe limiting the amount of time that you accept them, such as the 45 days like you did with the other one, limiting it to 10%, and we're still waiting to see what happens. So, I would just like to support bringing days was very hard for us. I also turned in an application for a distribution. We literally had to work night and day in order to get that. And it was over the Christmas and holiday seasons, as you know. So we had people all over the world putting that together. So I'd hope that we could do 45 days again, if you open up the application process. And I just wanted to say that I support this and I look forward to it opening back up. Thank you guys very much for bringing it back up on the agenda. Okay, thank you. We do. Okay, hold on one second. Davey, go ahead. Davey, you can go ahead. Okay. Oh, I apologize. I apologize. I was just fixing my volume. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate you. I applaud this as well. I applaud this as well. This is, I see this as an ideal for natural resources. For many reasons. I'm thankful for the option within our ecology as well. I feel this is a helpful resource in many, many ways. I do. I applaud this in so many ways. And one brief thing I'd like to say is that in time, I hope that perhaps options like beverages, like say teas or mild teas, or perhaps like little cakes or something like that with the ingredients, with the natural ingredients. And like, and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and I applaud this. Thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you, Davey. Our next speaker is Julie three. Go ahead, Julie. I wasn't going to say anything on this, but I totally agree. We just need to move forward, do the delivery. If I Google on here that cannabis delivery it's happening, it's everywhere. Let's just license it and move forward with this. Thank you. Thank you. And I believe that is it. Mayor Coolidge. All right. Thank you. Okay. So further discussion from council. Oh, you know what, before I forget, I just wanted to make mention that Jessica McKenzie did send you all a letter late, late this afternoon, speaking in favor of adding additional non-storefront deliveries. Okay. Further discussion. It was my, my recollection that this was, was presented to city attorney Ewing for a, an analysis of whether or not it was necessary to change the the ordinance, the existing ordinance to allow something of this nature. Is that still, is, am I correct? Is my memory correct on that? That it was more of a, let's see, what is possible versus what might happen. And I'm praising that as best I can. That's accurate. Council member Bennett. And that was the, that was the dive of the analysis that I did and, and concluded that no amendment to the ordinance was required. Okay. Okay, great. Thank you. You're welcome. So, Mayor, may I go ahead? Please, Ms. Farr. I didn't hear you. I didn't hear this in the rest of Mr. Bennett's question, but Mr. Bennett, is your question that we have basically given a report on what we can or cannot do, but, and this may be a question for the city clerk. Yes, we've been giving the, given the report, but the item doesn't allow us to take action on it at this time. That's a question, not a statement. That, that was what I was asking. Yes. I think, I think, I remember you, I think you made a comment about, well, I'll take a look at it or we can explore it. And a few other comments perhaps if I, and I know my memory is correct. So, yeah, I just want to clarify. Where we are in this process. That's all. So is this more of an item that's been reported out and now we know we could allow for more of this if we just decided to have the discussion or can we have the discussion now to allow for more of this? Maybe, and I'll serve as a full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full cannabis businesses, that would be the action. That's the recommendation. So the prophylactic measure was to make sure that it was permitted under the ordinance. That exercise has been done and now the council absolutely can take action. Okay. So having said that, a little bit of a narrative on my part. This came back up. We've gone through the cannabis thing for like two years and gotten to the point, which I thought was a fairly decent compromise. We wanted to walk before we ran, which I actually think was then chief and now council member of Brian's comments, to allow for retail up to three, let the retail establishments do delivery, which would disallow outside people from coming into Chico and doing it. Not that there's a lot we can do about it. So then a discussion came up about distribution and manufacturing. There was quite a lot of discussion about distribution and manufacturing. There was quite a lot of discussion from the council and applicants about, oh, is distribution delivery or is it this? And there were different things, which turned into a discussion on delivery, which I honestly believe was an accident. People didn't really understand the difference. So here we are and what we're doing is the city and Mr. Ewing, correct me if I'm wrong, the city has taken applications for three retail storefronts that will all be allowed to deliver. Other deliveries, not available. So then my opinion becomes this. If we vote yes on this item, we are saying we need more routes to cannabis in Chico. There are not enough places to get it with the three retail sites that have all the delivery they want. Having not tested this, not having the store open, absolutely no idea. We're saying, yep, let's bring more in for God knows what reason. I understand has a very, very strong capitalist, the argument that, well, let's open it up to everybody and it will take care of itself and we won't end up with 100 deliveries. Places will end up with three or four or five or six or 10 or probably not very many, given what's going on with taxation with the cannabis industry. However, we do the exact same thing with liquor stores. We don't allow them all over the place for very good reason. We don't allow the free enterprise system just to be a place for people to go. We don't allow them all over the place for very good reason. We don't allow them all over the place for very good reason. We don't allow the free enterprise to be completely clean and regulation free for good reason. I don't think now before we've even tried to see what happens with the three retail establishments that can do delivery. I don't see flooding the market with more delivery businesses is in any way a good idea, unless we want to be able to walk away from this meeting and be like, hey, I made it possible to get drugs even easier on the streets of Chico. I'd like to make some comments. All right, go ahead, Councilman O'Brien. You know, kind of despite the moral arguments that often get made in this space, I think this conversation needs to go far beyond whether cannabis is good or bad. Where we are is exploring the best method for regulating a legal industry and getting as much benefit from it with as little harm as possible. So here's the deal. Creating monopolies of businesses is never a good idea. You're certainly benefiting those who get one of the free delivery opportunities by allowing them to control the market in Chico, including product pricing and availability, but you're not benefiting the majority of Chico with that model. If you are true believers in the market, then you know that only a certain number, to Mr. Morgan's point, delivery operations will survive, given supply and demand, allowing three businesses to own that model in addition to controlling the the entire storefront retail market in Chico is the definition of monopolizing the market. And in doing that, you are disregarding the little guy. That means those folks who adopt a delivery retail model that are local, that will hire locally, that want to get their fair shot at the market without funding the cost for a brick and mortar facility in the midst of an already excruciatingly expensive and tedious process. If we want to prioritize local ownership and operation of businesses, we need to reduce barriers to entry. And that is a resounding opinion of the majority of the Cannabis Citizens Advisory Committee from all across the aisle. Allowing more delivery licenses than the three opportunities reserved for the storefront retailers is one simple way of doing that. And what's more, there is no guarantee that those storefront retailers that are awarded licenses by Chico even want to implement delivery as part of their business model. That is a decision that requires consideration and cost. And not every retailer desires to have it. That is a component of their business. That's just the reality. Contrary to belief of some people on this dais, more delivery operations does not mean more cannabis on the street. It means more local options for consumers. It means they get a variety of access to business and the products that they want to buy and the business models that they want to support. It also means better economic outcomes for Chico, more jobs and fairer pricing due to the overall healthy competition created within the market. I've advocated for no cap on delivery licenses because of all the reasons I just listed. And I'm not going to go into too much detail on that. Because I listen to input from the public and from the advisory committee. Deliveries are inconspicuous. They are not public facing like liquor stores to point to that example. And in the ways that and they create a point of entry for local entrepreneurs to start a strongly regulated, strongly and heavily regulated at the state level and at the local level business in Chico and to benefit us economically as a result. So I would ask that all of you use your good judgment and good business sense to move us forward by allowing some. If not, no cap non storefront retail licenses to be awarded in Chico. All right. Anyone else? Yeah, I do have a couple of comments by me. Sure. Go ahead. I could not agree more with Council Member Morgan. I made the statement that we need to figure out this retail first. Meaning we need to walk before you run. I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. There's all kinds of pitfalls. I have dealt with alcohol licenses for many, many years. There's a lot of depth to that. We don't even understand the depth to this issue yet. I think we need to slow down. I think we need to figure out what makes these retail storefronts work well. What doesn't before we jump into a whole new arena. Not understanding what those impacts are. So I'm going to vote no on this. All right. Do we have further comments or questions? Just have a quick question for Ms. Brown. You mentioned if it was not unlimited amounts of licenses, what, in your opinion, would be a minimum number or a reasonable number of licenses to allow? If somebody was to consider this. Thank you, Ms. Reynolds. I appreciate the question. I would say if I were to throw out a recommendation, 10 would be in the realm. But that is completely negotiable by this body. And I'm willing to have a conversation about it. My recommendation would be 10. I don't even know if we would need 10 non-storefront retail. But I would start there and move forward. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I do have a quick question. Council Member. Council Member Channing, go ahead. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, go ahead. Okay. You know, I mean, I understand that we are talking about retailer delivery services, which might not be present in Chico. Maybe somebody might be coming from Reading to deliver it. So how do we enforce that? And how do we collect their revenue? Because we would not. How do we keep track of those sales? That how much revenue or how much sales came into Chico through the delivery? Is do we have? Do we have a process to track that? That I'm not aware of. I would really like to know that. Council Member Tandon, is your question about out of the area deliveries and tracking that? Yes. To Chico. Okay. Sorry. Just want clarity. I don't have the answer, but. Because I know that if we have the storefront, it will be easier to track the sales. Okay. They made the X amount of sales in the storefront. They made X amount of sales to the delivery because they'll have to track their inventory. But if we have. Non retail storefront, just the delivery services. Is there a process to track those sales to get the revenue from that? Mr. Or maybe you could start that answer. I know it's complicated. Yeah, it's my understanding that it would be just like the rest of the other cannabis uses. They would be permitted by the city and then those permits would then track each of those entities that are in the storefront. They're being allowed by our municipality to enable them to make those deliveries and so it would go in line and coincide with everything else where there's that 5% community benefit and that's my understanding of how it would go and it would be traced through that permit process . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Other thing that I'd like Council Member Brown said that 10 would be a reasonable number to allow. And I think it would be good to see that the three storefronts that we finalize in the process, if we have those three people want to do the deliveries or not too, because we do not know who those people will be and what model they want to adopt. And I think that's something that we can work it out. So I think it'll be good to wait till we at least know what their model would be and then maybe have this discussion at that point. That's something I would be open to. All right. Any other questions at this time. I have some of no one else though. Right. Mr. Ewing, this is a general question. And I think we're at the center of this issue, too. And you're obviously our legal expert here. So, you know, if we were allowed five people to do, you know, delivery, my apologies, on top of the three, how do we go about limiting anyone from outside the area from delivering? I mean, what mechanism is there for, you know, obviously that would have to be something where law enforcement's involved, to stop deliveries from outside the area. Can we legally do that? I mean, we saw deliveries from outside the areas if we can. What does that look like? You know. Yeah, that's a there's certainly a law enforcement component to the answer. I'm not sure about how you would police that, to use the term loosely. I don't know. You know, if it's a non-permitted use or if it's an unlawful use. I don't know if Chief Madden and his team would be aware of it until it was brought to their attention and how much. Again, we're in the area of speculation at this point. But how many of those deliveries would have already occurred by the time the unlawful use is brought to the attention of public safety or law enforcement? So I don't know. Well, and to further complicate that, I mean, we, you know, we're all in this community. We see the dozens and dozens. We see the dozens of billboards around town and there's advertisements and there's online stuff as well. You know, we have a lot of companies coming in. Would we stop them? You know, would we have to create something that says that those businesses wouldn't be able to advertise in those particular ways? You know, obviously, if they can't do delivery legally in Chico, it would be kind of odd for them to have a billboard in the center of Chico saying they deliver to Chico. So, I mean, you know, there's far reaching ramifications here to both the advertising community as well. I'm just curious what would happen. The law used to state that if you didn't have regulations permitting delivery in your city, you couldn't outlaw outside delivery. And when we permitted three retail establishments with delivery, that should prohibit outsiders from coming and doing it here. Oh, I realize that's the law change. Yeah. And I realize that it should. But whether or not it would. Yeah. And whether or not. Oh, yeah. No, it's not going to make any difference. Yeah. And whether or not, you know, what other cities are doing along these lines to meet this particular challenge. You know, I don't have a problem with the limited delivery aspect. You know, I mean, we're requiring three businesses to get storefronts so they can also have delivery. To me, that seems like they're making a pretty big investment. And then someone who's just having delivery doesn't have the storefront cost. To me, that seems a little unequal and unfair. You know, I realize that the storefront has benefits, too. You know, Council Member Brown, I agree with some of your aspects. But, you know, I don't think that this is, you know, invisible in the community. I see it every day on my street. Perhaps it's my neighborhood. But I see it everywhere. Every single day. I see deliveries being made. And I don't necessarily love them because they're being made on street corners in front of children. And, you know, people walking their dogs. And, you know, directly across the street from my house in front of my children. So, you know, I do have some aspects about it which, you know, don't make me crazy about it. But, you know, if there's no enforcement, what does it really matter? And I'm just wondering, Mr. Ewing, if there's, you know, if that's something we need to explore more. Because right now we're open to everybody. You know, I don't mind limiting it. But is there even a way to recover the dollars? Is there any way to recover the dollars? Is there any way to recover the dollars? Are we simply trusting their accounting? Or do we have some way to actually regulate it? I don't have the ready answers to those questions. I will share with you, Mayor Kuliglian, and the council, that many communities throughout California, they approach the unlawful deliveries and sales and so forth, of cannabis products actually through the land use process, not necessarily through law enforcement. So it's the land use enforcement process or the unlawful use of the land. That's the process that's most typical throughout California cities, not police, not the police. All right. Mayor Kuliglian, if I could just speak to some of the points you just made. Sure. No, I'd be happy to have you do that. They were perfectly reasonable points to make. And two, two points. I think, to your point, that deliveries are currently taking place in Chico and are visible in your neighborhood and likely other neighborhoods. Right? Those are the out of the area deliveries, people coming from out of the area to deliver to Chico. Those are the businesses that are not accountable to our people and to our community and to our scrutiny. And I think that that is a big reason why keeping as much of this business local as possible is critical. Because those are the folks that are going to have to look us in the face every single day in terms of how they're conducting their business and whether they're doing that in a way that provides benefit and reduces harm. I just want to add. One of the things, Mr. Ewing, that was mentioned in the cannabis citizen's advisory committee, a retailer over in Sacramento had mentioned that there's some sort of, I don't know if tax is the appropriate word, but essentially an out of the area. It works as a tax for businesses coming out of the area that they have to actually pay in order to do business in Chico. And I do see that as some potential avenue for people to pay for their services. a discouraging out of the area delivery by creating another, you know, barrier for a barrier for out of the area deliveries. I don't know if that's something that you could explore or that you've heard of or that you've studied, but I think that could be an option to put on the table. All right. And Council Member Brown, if I can ask you a question. So, and maybe we can just talk this through a little bit. So, you know, obviously people coming from outside the area delivering Chico is a problem. And I think we all recognize that it's a problem. It's a problem because, you know, first off, we're not getting any revenue from it and, and they don't adhere to our standards. And I would agree with you completely on that issue. And I think we do, but what's to stop them from doing that. I mean, if we're exploring that through land use and, you know, I, I just don't see where the regulatory power comes from us to, to squash those. I mean, they, they certainly, you know, they certainly will have, you know, profit, even if we have 10 local businesses, they'd still have profit. And they might even have less because they won't be adhering to our regulations and rules. Yeah. I mean, there's a couple of things that I would, I would say to that number one is hopefully creating some local competition would discourage folks from coming out of the area right now. They don't have any competition. So it's a very viable market for Chico for out of the area deliveries all the way to SAC, and beyond coming into Chico. So that's just one element or one response to your question. Gosh, there was another point I wanted to make, and it's feeling a little bit lost on me. Oh, the, the enforcement piece. It's a, it's a, it's a conundrum. And for a lot of communities, it's a conundrum, but one thing that has been shared and that I see logic in is that if you have businesses operating locally, they have a vested interest in keeping the businesses who are operating illegally. Accountable. And so I think that there is some level of awareness and research and reporting associated with businesses coming from out of the area by the businesses who have actual benefit of those areas of those, of those other businesses, not being able to operate in Chico. And so I think that that creates a level of a reporting structure that makes it possible. I think you can see online if you, if you know where to search, which businesses are coming from out of the area and which even state that they have some local, you know, some, some feet in Chico locally. And I think that that, that there are the, our local businesses would be paying attention to that and hopefully cooperating with law enforcement or with the city through our administrative or land use processes. Good. Yeah. And I'd agree with you to a certain extent. I just think that needs a little more information before we, you know, head into something along these lines, because I'm very particular about that. I've worked with a bunch of local and local and local and local and local individuals and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and local and back with that information so that we can make an informed decision. I'd be willing to second that motion. I'd consider it a motion. All right. And then I consider a second. Do we have a motion and a second? Do we have a comment? All right. Madam Clerk? Council Member Bennett? I believe that we need to allow the three businesses to be chosen, open, and operate and see what happens. So I am going to vote no. It's too early. Premature. Council Member Brown? Aye. And thanks for the negotiation. Council Member Morgan? As always, I follow Council Member Bennett's lead. No. Council Member O'Brien? No. Council Member Tandon? I would say no at this time because I would like to see the three stores open up first and then go from there. Yes. So no at this point. Okay. Thank you. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Sure. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. It fails three to four. I would like to make another motion. Sure. That. This conversation be brought back after approval of the three licenses for retail storefront dispensaries are approved. Did you have a time frame to that? I think it depends on when they're approved, but I would say within a month after approval, final approval. So I have a question for the clerk. So normally you can't bring an item back if you're on the floor. The full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems to be allowed and full removal seems that is on the agenda to come back. Mr. Yang, what's your thought? I mean, I think she'd be fine to bring back what she's looking at because it's not relative to... You're potentially taking action on the item that you have before you and then once you do that to a point Council Member Morgan made earlier, once you do that or I believe you've actually taken action to accept applications and so forth and so that process is happening. And so regarding the discussion regarding out-of-city delivery services, that stops once these permits issue per our code. So our Munich code. Once the permits issue out-of-city delivery is no longer permitted in the city of Chico. Now back to the question. I think it invoked an AP&P, which is... Reconsideration of an item. AP&P 1010. Thank you, President. You're welcome. It's reconsideration of an item and that I believe applies to the circumstances we have here. Okay. Okay. So she wouldn't be able to bring forward that for reconsideration of delivery after with the time period. Based on AP&P. AP&P. Okay. However, Ms. Tandon or Mr. Morgan or Mr. Bennett or Mr. O'Brien could if they want to bring that back and we could have that discussion after the stores were open and it seems like or got their permits in a month or two, we should assess whether that's something that they intend to do and we can have that come right back. We can have that conversation if one of those guys would like to bring it back. That is a great point. If we decided that we have not flooded the streets with enough cannabis, we could have this, I could change my mind and be like, let's get more delivered. Okay. All right. Council Member Brown, did you have anything further? Can't have anything further. Yeah, I know, right? Okay. All right. So with that, we will move on to no items posted after the agenda, reports and communications, and any other items that we can discuss. So following reports and communication items were provided for the council's information. No action can be taken under this section unless the council agrees to include it in a subsequent agenda. City Manager to report, Mr. O'Brien. Yes. Good evening, Honorable Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the council. Just wanted to highlight a few quick things. I'll be quick with this, but had the opportunity to enjoy the groundbreaking for Park Avenue, which is a new Jamboree project on the former Jesus Center site. It's going to offer affordable apartments, 59 units total for families, for seniors, for those with special needs. It's an incredible project that it just had a great celebration today. I want to commend Vice Mayor Reynolds. She spoke on behalf of the city there and did a great job. And just it was a fantastic celebration of seeing some affordable units be brought in by a very reputable company in Jamboree. So we're happy to welcome them to Chico. Another item that I didn't want it to go by quietly. It seemed like it did to a large degree, and that's the broadband enterprise. So many cities throughout the nation, not just in the state of California, but particularly in rural areas, are clamoring for lower prices on Internet connectivity and for more access to Internet connectivity. This city council made a decision tonight to introduce the ordinance to enable that to happen. I want to compliment you because many communities have been trying to do this, have been desirous of doing this, but they don't have the expertise and staff to accomplish it. I want to commend. Director Dowell for his leadership in this and also manager Marquis and also Barbara and Catherine in the finance part. This is an incredible team that's really seeing this through. Josh is now going to take the lead on that and by approving the B3 index that helped in that. And so I want to just thank you and commend you as a council, because oftentimes you don't get commended for a lot of the great work you're doing. Also, I want to highlight 150th anniversary for our city. I will tell you that city staff. All of our city staffs rather than join engaging with members of the community on that we will have an update for Council at your next meeting on that item. The shelter site is continuing to move forward over on Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway. We are in due consideration of the operator of the site that will be coming back out. We have completed an RFP for a few of the services that will be on site. Those will likely be rewarded here this week or in the next. That's for showers. That's for meals and laundry services. So that's. All right. wrapping up now as well. I also want to make a note of the Hope Street Coalition item. As you very well know, the council authorized Hope Street Coalition to put together a homeless solutions package to bring back. It was anticipated that would come back at your next council meeting. It's going to be delayed. And I want to make sure that you are aware of that and the public's aware of that because with the circumstances surrounding the settlement agreement, it has to be viewed through a lens now that's different from what our conditions existed before in Chico. So I know that Paul Webster with Hope Street Coalition is taking a look at that and looking at where we can achieve success under the current circumstances that we're in. And then finally, I know I heard from earlier the medical letter question. I know the mayor did sign that letter. It did go out to Senator Nielsen and Assemblymember Gallagher. I will tell you that we've already heard a response back from Assemblyman Gallagher's office. He's actually working on legislation right now to potentially already, and it's just been amazing turnaround, to potentially start addressing some of those issues. So I'm excited to meet with them. I believe that meeting's this week. It's maybe even tomorrow on my calendar to start talking through that. He's seeking further feedback. So just know that's going full-fledged ahead. And it's a lot going on right now. I just wanted to share a few of those items with you and give you those quick updates as it relates to the letter going out. It seemed like that was one of those questions subsequent to it. It was sent to the league so that they could just get it out there. So I'm excited to see what happens. I'm excited to see what happens with this and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this looks and see how this verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be a majority vote the council is needed in order for the item to be agendized council members may also submit the request in writing do we have any items any councilman requests all right seeing no move on item 6.3 which is the sunshine of the draft mou which is just for information only and then 6.4 is the monthly financial reports budget monitoring reports and those are informationally as well um so we will go into closed session but before we do that do we have any public comments on closed sessions um we do but before we do uh go to that speaker i'd like to just um let you know that i went into engage chico and i doubled the character numbers from 500 to a thousand um i will tell you that in the past we received hundreds and hundreds of uh comments and that wasn't an issue so that was never addressed so since it's been brought to our attention and we want to make sure that our citizens have more opportunity to address us i've doubled the um the characters and so i'm hoping that we will get more input via the engaged chico component and then our speaker for closed session is uh actually i have i might have three um but i'm gonna ask for rob berry to go ahead and unmute himself rob go ahead all right out of all of the criticisms that could be made regarding the warrant case and there are many the most egregious is the abandonment of both the spirit and the letter of the laws governing open and transparent meetings you have broken the bond of the public trust the policy of a council that honors and respects the public's right to know what their government is up to would conduct themselves according to the principle that any business that can be conducted in public shall be conducted in public this council has taken the opposite approach upon the flimsiest justifications anything that you would rather discuss in secret entitles you to complete secrecy not only is this settlement a disaster waiting to happen but you did it entirely on your own without the slightest effort at public disclosure or scrutiny along the way we have learned that neither this council nor your own police chief had an opportunity to review the actual document before it was signed the public was last to know what you had done too late to have any meaningful input you did that to add insult to injury tonight you have placed warren on the agenda and the public has been able to see the public's reaction to the public's actions and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve and serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve serve How can voters remain loyal when you so openly abuse their public trust? This is not, it is not what you say you believe that matters. It is what you do. I am so disappointed in you. I did not expect this. I'm not sure that anyone did. Thank you. Thank you, Rob. Our next speaker is Ruth Sharnoff, and this is on closed session matters. Go ahead, Ruth. Ruth, are you there? Can you? I'm there. Yes. Okay. I would like to bring to the attention of the public about the effort of the union people to be able to come in and be part of the negotiation in closed session for, I guess, at least for some people, eight years, six years, whatever. The city manager has been, uh, the spokesperson. He decides, uh, what happens there. They came into the city council in numbers. They spoke. Uh, I don't know how many people actually stay up late enough at night to have seen it, but, um, uh, the agenda, um, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and to say on that item. And I would certainly like in the future, if not tonight, that we cover item three, which is now called business from the floor, where you can speak on whatever you want to speak on. And I feel very strongly about that. So I would like to request that you go back and offer me and anybody else that's waiting there for that, because that was never called to sign in, because that's another violation. Of the Brown Act. And so I don't know, that's, I guess what I have to say. Thank you, Ruth. Madam Clerk, can we just for the record, say that business from the floor was actually held? Did Ruth speak from business from the floor? Actually, business from the floor was held at the beginning of the meeting. And we had one, two, three, four, five speakers and Ruth Sarnoff was our fifth vice president. And we have a fourth speaker. Thank you. Uh-huh. Our next speaker is Davey, and this is regarding closed session matters. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I'd like to say that I value public communication, caring public communication. I also value caring private communication for our ideals. I do. And I try to, I hope to be focused on solutions. I like the idea of our public communication and the correlation. I like the idea of perhaps applause options so that the accountability for what the people might like to share. I don't believe so much in trying to be critical of other human beings, because I believe in trying to be supportive of one another, therefore to build community ideals with one another. So I consider aspects of my education where skepticism was a, you know, is an ideal in philosophy and through sociology. You know, the best way of communication oftentimes to define education. So I like the ideas of signals of applause, like, you know, oftentimes in Zoom meetings, like as reactions, like the emojis or whatnot. However, the reactions options for applause to applaud the ideals that we see fitting or perhaps a question mark to, so it's not offensive, yet rather a kind way of suggesting skepticism of our views of skepticism and views of, of our views. So I think that's a really good example of how we can, you know, how we can be more inclusive of our community so that we can, you know, perhaps have this accountable as well. I appreciate you all so very much. Thank you for listening. Thank you, Davey. Sasha, go ahead and unmute yourself. Wait until the timer starts. There you go. Sasha? Hello, everyone. I just want to say that I don't always agree with the first speaker that we had on the comments on the on this, on this number. But I think Mr. Berry hit hit it on the nail on the head on every single point. And succinctly so, decidedly so. It's very disconcerting that we are continuing on with the kind of ongoing virtual reality for City Council as well. I'm very extremely disillusioned with what's going on. And for the sake of brevity and taxpayer dollars, I'm going to say that's enough. And Rob Berry pretty much covered the whole thing. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. We do not have any other speakers. All right. Thank you very much. And we will adjourn into closed session. Okay. And we'll see you next time.
