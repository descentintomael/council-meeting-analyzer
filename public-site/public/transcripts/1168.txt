No final action was taken. All right. Thank you very much. We will move on to presentation item 1.6 from Public Works Director Brendan Audubon. From race communications, we will have Mr. Jim Miller presenting for race communications. Welcome, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Good evening, Mr. Mayor and City Council members. Thank you for having us here. My name is Jim Miller. I am the VP of business development for race communications. With me tonight, I also have our VP of construction and outside plant, Dominic Puccini. We are excited to be here tonight. We are bringing a great product to your city. I want to take a few moments of your time to tell you about our company. . .! Race communications, we are a licensed select in California. What that means is we are a licensed phone company regulated through the California Public Utility Commission as well as the FCC on the federal side. What that means to you as a city and as the residents of the city is we are bringing a product that is a quality product different than an ISP. We have to build the standards that are very similar to the AT&Ts and the Verizon's of the world. The data is very important. We are building a pure fiber optic network. Race has been a select since the early 2000s. We started in 1995 as an IT company out of the bay area and then evolved in 2001 into a select offering fiber services in the Los Angeles region. Since then we have expanded our footprint using our fiber ring around the state and with the belief that no matter where you look, you will find the best make sure that if you live in the state you should have access to quality internet outside the metro areas of LA and San Francisco and Sacramento regions. In 2023 we were excited that we were one of the first companies early on to bring a one gig service to a home. That is one gig symmetrical speed to 1,000 megabits up and down. In 2023 we were the first company in the state to bring 10 gigs to a That is what we will talk about today because we are bringing that here to your city. I briefly want to touch on our products. As a phone company we offer phone services. It is a landline phone based in the home and offers the 911 capabilities just like the traditional landlines. The reason that is important in emergency situations landline phones are what people count on when the cellular towers don't work. your phone in the city especially when AT&T is looking to get rid of the copper plant you will still have that capability in homes to have the 911 capabilities and it is only $10 a month. We also offer broadband services ranging from $35 a month with our basic service up to $120 a month and the 120 does give them 10 gig symmetrical speeds. As you see we offer the television system and the radio and that is the construction. Race is fully funded to build this system. We started our initial talks with the city last year and in the beginning of Q1 this year we started with what is called our POP that is our point of presence and that is basically the brains of the network that we started expanding off of. That construction started in mid to late Q1 and then in May we actually got into our construction of the AT&T network. plant. The map you are seeing here is our initial footprint. That map will expand and shrink as we build due to construction restraints but this is what we are looking at initially to serve. Like I said it kicked off in 23 and 24 we had the construction start beginning just last month with just a small crew. But within the next 30 days you will We are working in the city and that is a combination of because we are a utility company we follow the utility pass that exists today. If things are underground in neighborhoods we do underground work if they are overhead we do overhead type of work. The project is due to be completed in 2026. It is a 24 month project. We feel confident in the timelines. We just finished the city of Lancaster down in Southern California. The construction is closer to you guys. You have a city is wrapping up in 22 months. We are starting the whole Maryville corridor as well. One of the big things we do different than other people during the construction phase is we want to communicate. We know there will be questions and we know construction is sometimes not the prettiest part of the product. Everyone wants faster internet and better quality phones and better quality period. To get there we have to construct. This is a brand new fiber network. We are not using any infrastructure that is in the ground today. Everything that is going in is brand new. Doing so we want to make sure we communicate with your residents. That is our most important concern is to take the load off of you guys. We don' t want residents coming to the city and asking what is happening. We want to make sure they are pre-informed what is happening and know if they have a concern or complaint they can come to us to get it resolved without putting a burden on you. How we do that is using direct mailers that go out to the consumer. They let them know we will be working in their area. We call it zones. It dictates on the underground we will have to have all the underground Utility has a different paint color they have to use. We explain what that is and why there is paint on the sidewalk and the road and how it is temporary and removed once the project is complete. We go into talking about the construction phase in that letter. 72 hours before our crews hit the streets we go out and door hang all the houses to make sure they know their block will be worked on in the next few days. a lot of people that are working on the streets and they are able to direct them in the right direction to get their answers. They will not know sales type of questions but they will know where to send people or if they have a concern or complaint they will know where to send them. All of our race employees and contractors will have race gear on the contractors will run signs on the working on the streets and they are Construction sometimes isn't pretty. We are going to be touching every single street as we build this project out and we know people might have concerns. When those concerns come up we want to make sure they are addressed properly and recorded properly. We have come up with multiple ways they can reach out and call us the traditional way and email us and text us through our chat program or fill out the form online with their concern. Once those concerns come into race just like what we would do with a customer that is live we create a ticket and in our system we live in the ticket world. That ticket tracks every concern they have and assigns it to the correct department or the local project manager that will be in the system. We will have someone locally here. That way when it gets addressed and if the resident still has a concern and brings it to the city we can share with you this is the information we have done today to make sure we are all on the same page. I did say we will have a local project manager. I also want to add to the fact that not only is race bringing this product to your city but we are also looking to hire local people. In Yuba city we created a project center down there. We opened up a warehouse and hired local sales people and local workers in that region to do the installations. Up here we have also purchased a warehouse and are looking to do the exact same thing. This region will feed our northern California where the Yuba city feeds east and west. Like I said I wanted to make this short and sweet tonight. I wanted to introduce our company and If you have any questions for us. questions from council? I have a quick one. You said in 24 months does it come online in a graduated basis? Absolutely. We are looking at if plans go correctly the first consumers will be turned on December into q1 period and the last ones in the 24 are straight line but the way permits flow in sometimes that straight line gets crooked. We are based off of permits from you guys but we also have permits from the other utilities for the pole attachments and so forth. thank you very much. Any other questions? I think we are good. You guys are too easy. Thank you so much I appreciate you having us here tonight. Absolutely. Item 1.7 is also presentation on chico fiber utility status update and that' s from deputy director of information systems. There he is. Come on down. Welcome. good evening. good evening. Mayor and members of council my name is josh marquis. I' m here to give you an update on the city's broadband program. One of the things you will notice that we've branded ourselves north valley fiber. Last time I was in front of you we were calling ourselves chico fiber utility but we completed a naming and branding exercise and landed on north valley fiber so you'll see that at the top of all the slides. It's going to be a quick presentation but if you have any questions or comments feel free to interrupt. I wanted to kind of restate our goals and objectives. The first is to improve the affordability of options for the citizens. Enabling competitive options. Pursuing a 50 year infrastructure and addressing digital access and equity gaps. Some key details of our network being that we're an open access model. The city will own and operate the network but will seek ISPs that will be offered from a marketplace. We're going to focus on primarily an underground construction model. We're going to focus on the infrastructure and the And then we'll be looking to do an active Ethernet design. We've chosen a pilot area. The area in purple on your screen is the Chapman elementary school district boundary. And we've also added the areas in red and yellow. And you'll, we've kind of been referring that overall as our pilot location. That location might kind of grow and shrink with funding or you know if other districts are going to be able to build that. So we're going to focus. You've seen this, most of this slide before so I won't read all of it but I'll kind of hit on some of the key points. In January of 2022 we adopted the broadband master plan interim report and that's kind of what started this initiative. In July of 2022 Butte County and the city signed an MOU to collaborate on broadband and collaborate on some of the grant applications. We received nearly $500,000 of the CPUC's LADA grant in September of 2022. And then we completed our first high level design of that network with field validation in January of 2023. And some newer developments since I saw you last. Like I said we completed our naming and branding exercise where we chose North Valley Fiber. In April of 2023 we adopted the broadband master plan interim report. So we collaborated with Butte County and the city and LAFCO to come to an understanding about broadband. That's important because it allows us to operate in and around the Chico area. Especially a lot of the grants aren't necessarily bound by jurisdictional boundaries. And for example the federal funding account monies that we applied for, it's really a region. And so we felt that it was beneficial to apply for those grants and not have to worry about whether an address was five feet inside or outside the city's jurisdictional boundary. In May of 2023 we completed our low level design with BRE networks. July of 2023 we completed our style guide with a local company MC2. We floated a RFP in August of 2023 for construction. And then we completed our design with a local company, We applied for the federal funding account, FFA, which is from the CPUC for a total of $12.8 million. We're actually waiting to hear about that award. We still believe we're highly likely to get it. The CPUC says that it's due in June. We're only halfway through, so there's still a little bit of time there. And then in February of this year we completed the strategic plan. And then in February of this year we completed the strategic plan. So to go over kind of our current funding, $4.8 million of ARPA was allocated by Council. We got nearly half a million of LADA We got nearly half a million of LADA from the CPUC was awarded. And then of course the $12.8 million hasn't actually been awarded yet, but we're very hopeful and we hope to hear very, very soon. Future funding opportunities that we'll be exploring, the California Advanced Services Fund, known as CASF, will be funded by the We're exploring if that's going to fit in our pilot area or the city in general. We're also exploring the California Loan Loss Reserve, which is currently open. And then we're anticipating the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment, the BEAD grant, should be available in December of 2024. And we're evaluating whether or not that's a good fit for our program. Some upcoming items on our timeline. The city will be proposing a proposal to the City of some municipal code changes related to the design build process. And we anticipate that being applicable to our program. And we will hopefully be publishing a request for qualifications and a scope of work to that end, maybe sometime in August or September. And then we hope to select a design build partner in the fall of 2024. Also in the fall, we hope to finalize a co-location partner with the City of California. the BEAD grant partnership with Golden State Net, which is the California Middle Mile partner. And then like I said, we're going to be looking forward to the BEAD grant becoming available in December of this year and hoping to start construction in the spring of 2025 and then begin operations. And that's all I have. Questions? If there's any questions. Questions, questions. Mr. Winslet. building and what North Valley Fiber is proposing. I don't want to speak for them, but they're a traditional telecom. And they're coming to the Chico area and they will build out to most or all of the homes. One of the key differences is that the city is going to build out to all of the addresses in the city and won't be focusing on revenue. And won't have to focus on revenue, hopefully. We're going to be looking to tap a lot of grant opportunities and that will allow us to build in all areas equally and not be choosing construction models based on what area we are operating in. They're similar solutions, but different in key ways. The open access model is something that, you know, we're not So they could operate on our network, we could operate on their network. There's a lot of little nuance to that. Okay. So if they're establishing in the avenues and provide a lot of addresses there, would it be a direct competitor or you're saying there could be complementary services? I think in the long term they would be a competitor to the city, but in the short and medium term, I don't think so. I think it would be a lot of benefit to not having just as we experience right now, one or two people to choose from. And if a provider doesn't build in your neighborhood, you don't have another option. Thank you. Sure. Mr. Brown. Would there be an effort to not date up the same street twice? Yes, and one of our endeavors is putting conduit in like the roads that Engineering Public Works is building. We're encouraging conduit being put in those roads so that we can avoid digging up the road. And in the future, as the city owns more and more assets, those assets could then be leased out to other vendors. Unfortunately, right now, we don't have many of those assets, but that's something we're building towards. All right. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. We'll move on from here to the consent agenda. All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and therefore can be enacted in one motion. Do we have any counsel disqualification? No. All right. Speakers? We have one. Carl Orry. We are on consent. We're taking public comment on consent agenda items. That's on the consent. Which is what you put on your card. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. All right. All right. I come from before you on bended knee with three suggestions to strengthen your tax proposal. Two years ago, it narrowly passed. Now it's on a ballot with another county tax proposal. I'm sorry. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. For me, that's a small detail. turnout of a presidential year, which would renew voters' trust rather than a special election in 2040. A clear and honest ballot language proposing only a general purpose tax would defend you from a plausible challenge. Oversight would only be advisory, could be enacted anytime, not just tonight, and disbanded if not useful. Nearly all other municipal proposals include such a mechanism. A sunset is now required of you, but it's a bit of a misnomer. It should be seen as a renewal, since surely it would take more than a dozen years to repair infrastructure and improve services. Ballot language. I quote Juanita Sommer, that the proposal is, in danger, because it promises specific uses. This is the actual ballot language, not a ballot argument, but the actual text on the ballot. To continue supporting vital city services, including maintaining, repairing streets, storm drains, sidewalks, fixing potholes, addressing homelessness, protecting 911, emergency response times, preserving the number of on-duty residents.

Council cannot take any action at this meeting on any item made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have two. All right. Three minutes each. And I'll call both the names. And if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle. Julie. Three. Followed by Mrs. Wright. Good evening, Council. Yeah, I'd like to talk about Mr. Orris. I also wanted the public to know that the 1% sales tax that the county is putting on the ballot for November will put Chico at 9.25%. I pulled all this tax rates for the cities and the counties, and we'll be up there with Los Angeles County, so it's pretty absurd. We tried to get them to go to half a percent, but they're getting pretty greedy. I am here to advocate for the vaccine injured. I do this every time, me being one of them. I went to a hospital. I have a whole hospital homicide event in Houston, so if anybody's interested in what's going on at the hospitals with the medical murder, let me know. What you can do about it, I'd like to ask again that you consider signing the Americans for Health Freedom.org pledge. There's now 187 elected officials. So, U.S. officials, or those of you that are rerunning for office here in November, can sign this. There's 106 candidates, Surgeon General from Florida, one state political party, one state congressional district, 17 county political committees, and 17 state congress. physicians organizations publicly stating the covet shots must be pulled off the market and pledging not to take donations from big pharma and their 17 000 physicians standing behind us you may have seen that kansas has sued pfizer over misrepresentations and adverse events of the coven 19 vaccine that happened this week idaho is following them in the three other states we're encouraging butte county to sue pfizer for these misrepresentations and fraud la school district also got a big blow to their mandate for coven when the ninth circuit overturned their mandate and said hey it's not a vaccine it's a gene therapy you've all received a copy of this criminal report of vaccine injuries and deaths on monday june 17th a former butte county deputy sheriff david e martin sent you this big long laundry list of all of the problems the penal code issues that we've had all the crimes that have been committed so again i think after you read this big long document that you're all sent an email you will consider signing americans for health freedom.org thank you thank you um mrs wright okay and we appreciate no applause or booing or commentary during speakers please thank you hey council i haven't been here for a while but i'm on my i was really right to work so october 1st of 2020 i stood in front of this council and i did a rally with james gallagher and i told you all that the lockdowns were tyrannical mary college is it a problem for you to look at me is it a problem yeah please just make your statements i had a rally i told you that the masks don't work i told you that the vaccines will not work that is tyrannical to lock down our kids and who was right i was right chico lost children to suicide chico has lost people to vaccine poison it's not even a vaccine i'm just a registered nurse i came in here and i told you all felt she lied y'all complied people died how much money did this city waste on those stupid plastic things that i told you this city council made me stand in the hallway to give my speech to address you is it a problem for you to pay attention to the fact that you weren't paying attention when i came in here before is why we're here mr coolidge came to a chico republican women federated meeting in march of 2021 where he never wore a mask except for when he was taking a picture to be for the public because he knew that mass didn't work sean morgan knew that mass didn't work to pika tandon knew that mass didn't work came to the meeting and he said you know what the mass didn't work because he knew that mass didn't work but not one of you stood up for the children in this community like my daughter who goes to school in this city and she got kicked out because she had more backbone than any of you she told her principal that jesus tells her not to lie and a mask is a lie that happened in september of 2021 not one person stood up it is time for rectification you need to put on the agenda that there is no trust in danette york the health official you seen fauci got up and said you know what mrs wright was right the whole time it is time to rectify maybe think about getting some healing for these people who are vaccine injured do your job and fire danette york thank you for your courage that is it all right all right we will move on to public hearings item 4.1 is a hearing on the appeal of hay sewer billing do we have any ex parte communication anyone all right none сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл сл! The property is a separate separate property. Initially staff believe the concern was related to the fact it was one building one property with two separate water meters serving the property and the fact there are two separate bills because the manner in which we assess sewer monthly bills is based on the water meter because of our consumption and water usage. In discussion with Mr. Hayes prior to the meeting he elaborated and saying his concern was related to the edu calculation. The sewer bills are premised on water usage but also the type of use for the property which essentially is mostly related to the strength of the sewer discharge and what it takes to treat that waste. Staff has gone through and provided calculations and found some errors but have corrected those. We believe based on the current assessment that the current sewer bill is proper and correct for the property. That concludes my report. I' m available for any questions. Mr. Hayes is here so I believe he has the ability to get up and speak to his concerns. Mr. Hayes is here so I believe Mr. Hayes is here so I believe Staff report we allot 15 minutes discussion or questions additional 10 then we open the hearing which I' m about to do. We have the appellant who is Mr. Hayes he has 15 minutes to speak additional speakers 30 minutes and then a rebuttal of three minutes. Seeing no questions we will go ahead and move to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes. First I would like to thank the Council for your time and attention and service to your community. We are very fortunate to have each of you. Also congratulations on your salary increase but it wasn' t enough. Regarding the matter before the Council it' s important to know that each of the staff kindly and promptly assisted me whenever my and with whatever they were able to do. They were really awesome, and they're a credit to your administration. I have read staff's report. Staff says they cannot support consolidating two existing water meters into one sewer bill, but that's exactly the way it's always been done. If you look at the item that I gave you, it's a Cal Water Bill. It's four pages. It's three pages of data on it. It's dated. This would be, it's the February bill, so it's the January water bill for 2022. If you look at that, you'll see we are billed for two meters, and we get one sewer charge, which is what staff's saying can't be done. Same thing's happening with UT. For example, Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary that our volume is calculated as an edu and that edu count staff stated as 4.15 so using their Edu count let's do the math the wastewater discharge Formula would be as follows. Please look at the top of that data sheet 11 by 17 textual sheet that I gave you 4.15 edu times nine point three nine hundred cubic feet is equal to one edu by your code Times seven hundred and forty eight gallons is twenty nine thousand one hundred and forty eight gallons now the problem with that is that Cal waters metered water usage For that same exact month both meters combined with no deduction for landscape irrigation is only eleven thousand nine hundred and sixty eight gallons so you know Any person gifted with a little common sense can tell out if Cal water puts eleven thousand nine hundred and sixty eight gallons into one end of the pipe that you till you till 360 can't get get 29,148 gallons to come out the other end. It's just impossible. And to arrive at such a calculation by using a formula that continually triggers more to come out than what is actually put in is just nonsense. Now, imagine everyone's frustration, mine and staff. There was not one staff member that could explain to me how that EDU count ever came to be 4.15. Nobody. I pulled every call water bill we had since 2021, and I went through every one of them calculating, and I found one bill, which was, you have that copy of it. It is CalWaters. It is a size bill for, let's see here, for January 22 water usage at 3,900 cubic feet. If you take and you do the math on the 3,900 cubic feet, you come out with a 4.15 EDU. They took one month, not the whole winter average, but one month. And ever since that first bill, we've been billed at 4.15 forever. Right up through the last bill we got from UTIL 360. Now, in the city's EDU, when they took over, I gotta ask the question, why wasn't Wendy's EDU count when the UTIL 360 took over? Why didn't they take the 2223 winter average, and update their data? These people haven't updated their data since day one, and they're using old data clear back to CalWater. Now, it just doesn't make any sense to me. I want you to take a look. If you look on the first sheet that I gave you, it's got all the graphs on it. If you look down on the lower, the second column, lower right, you'll see that it's a data. It says city buildings and facilities and EDU counts. This building, Fred Davis building next door, one EDU. City Park Plaza, one mile and five mile, one EDU each. Butte County Superior Court, one EDU. Now, I'm not gonna go through each one of these, but how in the heck, how in the heck, can a small business of 5,000 square feet and two bathrooms get billed for 4.15 EDU, when all these other buildings are getting billed for one? And that, all that information comes right off your GIS sewer and storm grain map. Now, I'm gonna ask one other thing, lastly. I'm gonna ask this council to continue this hearing. Not make a decision tonight. There's a whole bunch of data that I'm not even going into, but you have it, and I've noted it in the textual information that I've given you. I'd like you to read it, put it on for another hearing, and then tell me what you think. Because as far as I'm concerned, it's a mess. And it has nothing to do with staff. They were great, they were awesome. Gave me every bit of help I needed. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. All right, thank you very much. Additional speakers? We have none. All right. Rebuttal period, if you so wish to rebut no one else. I have to grant you a three minute rebuttal period if you want it, because usually when we do a hearing, we'll have people come up and speak, obviously, and eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually they're not in the commercial billings and the rates that you guys use. Yeah, if we are going to do this, we'll need you to come back to the podium and do it. With that, we'll close the public hearing, move on to council discussion, motion run and vote. Council? I have a question for Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, if you would re-approach. Thank you. It's an impressive amount of work you put into this, sir. So this is a business... I'm a dog with a bone. I can tell. I can tell. So this is a business, not a residence. It is a business, yes. It's all offices. Okay. There are actually four bathrooms in that whole facility, two of which we have. The doors are always locked because they're not ADA compliant. And if I'm reading this correctly, you're saying your sewer bill in 2022 was $133,000. $133,000 a month average. Well, average. Yeah, the averages are all there. The biggest bill we've ever got, and that was when Util 360 took over, it jumped from 93.50 to 142.23. Back when you folks sent out the notices to the whole public of Chico, that Util was going to take over, Cal Water, no longer provided the sewer bills. There was a notation on that. You'll see that on the very top right of the sheet. It said that your sewer bills are not going to change. They're not going up. Well, ours went up from $43.50 to $43.50. Or, excuse me, from $45 and some cents to $93.50. And I guess Cal Water didn't get the memo. Just look at the memo. Just look at the average, the computation on 2022. It says 131, and it should be more like 70. It doesn't matter for right now, but it helps tell your story better. Yeah, well, I've just tried to make it as simple for you folks as possible. And the best way to do it is to give you data. It's a hell of a lot to digest. Believe me. It is. I've got over 60 hours and stuff together. Mr. Hayes, let's have you sit down again, and if we have an additional question, we'll call you back up. I also, I forgot to tell you, I will make myself available at any time to meet with council or staff in between now and the next hearing. I'd be happy to. Mr. Van Overbeek. I have a question, Mr. Autobani. So, and maybe you're not the right person, but you know, we changed the billing system, and we have a new formula for computing the rates, and so they're going to be glitches, right? I mean, that's just part of life, and so we'll sort through them. And this just strikes me as maybe one of those glitches, but you're saying you think it's appropriate. Yeah, we've worked with several departments, operations and maintenance, engineering and finance. We've gone through the calculations, verified the formulas, and as staff, we are confident that the bill is accurate. But I believe that you're right that the bill is accurate based on your formula, but to Mr. Hayes' point, why is it, why is he getting charged for four EDUs and you know, the fairgrounds is one? I don't know offhand the difference or have confirmation of those numbers, but for Mr. Hayes' property, our staff, staff verify that the EDU count is accurate for the property and the use of that property? I'm not arguing that, I'm just saying maybe there's something wrong with the formula, and that wouldn't surprise me given this is a new way of billing. Our engineering staff went through the formula by hand and verified that as well. So again, part of it is the fact that, was it last year, we adopted new sewer rates, and that could potentially have the effect of an increase from the prior bills and the transition from Cal Water to Util 360. Mr. Hayes, we'll have you take a seat. So at this point we'll discuss it, and then if we have additional questions, we'll call you back forward. Council Member Winslow. I appreciate this being made as simple as possible. It's unfortunately not. I remember when we approved the sewer rate increase and looking at all the EDUs and thinking some of these seem off to me. There were some things I noticed and I talked to Mr. Guthardt, who's a citizen about it, I believe, and kind of got the explanation. It's like more treatment's required, so that's why that number's there. So one of the issues I'm hearing is that you think that for a massage business specifically, we say 4.15 is the EDU, and that that might not be appropriate to the amount of treatment that's required, and that would be like a bigger change that would affect all massage businesses in town and not just be applied to this one specific rate increase. Another thing that I heard was that your bill is based on just one month of winter water usage. It's set that way to exclude irrigation and not the whole span of the months. Do you know what he's referring to there, Stradeboni? I'm not sure the code in our standard application is your winter three month average, so January, February, March. There's no way to separate how much water is going to irrigation versus use in the house. That's why the winter average is used, because obviously typically in the wintertime, you turn your irrigation off due to the weather, and so that's why the winter average is used for that. But yeah, to your knowledge it is. It is the average of those months. Correct. I'm not sure how we would even because that's the standard application across the entire city, so I'm not sure how we would even obtain one month's only in terms of how that gets applied to the rate. Other council member questions? I have one if no one else does. I have a couple. GSI data actually shows what the EDU is for individual properties. GIS, rather. I'm not aware of that. What we do have is in the updated sewer rates was the EDU calculations for types of uses, and so that's what gets applied through the adopted rates. No, I guess my question isn't necessarily with that. It's, you know, knowing that City's Park Plaza is one EDU. Yeah, I'm not aware of that being on GIS. Yeah, I'm just not sure how accurate that would be or if that... Yeah, could I do that? I don't believe they are all listed. It might be a default as one. We'll have to double check. The EDU assignment was just based on national wide averages for that particular customer class when we implemented the rates, but I don't think the EDU assignments for each commercial business are listed on GIS, but we'll double check. Yeah, I'd have a hard time believing that Lowe's and Home Depot are one. So, yeah. Anyway, Mr. Sorensen, what's your take on this? Well, I think as we've covered, there's been a lot of changes, not only in the underlying rate calculation, but also a change to a volumetric formula, so that's why he, Mr. Hayes, has some bills where volume probably wasn't part of the equation where now it is. And again, I know for a fact that engineering, O&M, finance have invested a great deal of time to review the bills and the calculations and believe that they are correct according to the current rates Separate from that is the question, is the EDU count appropriate for this particular building? You know, we have to use the ones that were passed by you all. Entertain a motion. I I have great respect for everybody involved in the process, but there's something that doesn't feel right about this to me, and I'd like to continue it. And since I'm the one, we've already spent too much time on this matter, but I would like to sit down with engineering, public works, and whoever else, and understand, really understand this, because there's something that doesn't compute with me on this. You should have joined us in all those finance meetings about it. I learned way too much more than I should have. I move that we send the item to Internal Affairs. Oh, you're a mean person. You're on the Internal Affairs Committee. You want to deal with it. You can't deal with it by yourself. Yeah, that's fine. Can we send, Madam Clerk, can we send a hearing? Mr. City Attorney, can we send a hearing too? I don't know who's best to answer that question. Mr. Mayor, you wouldn't send the hearing for decision to the Internal Affairs, but I would assume you can provide send it to Internal Affairs for additional clarification, and then come back with additional information that would be presented to the full City Council. But it won't come back as necessarily another hearing? Right. Well, it would be part of the continued hearing. Oh. Yeah. It would still come back to the Council after Internal Affairs makes a recommendation, which would save nobody any time, and I'm much more content that Mr. Van Overbeek sit down with Mr. Hayes if you want to do that. And we'll just table it to another meeting if that's what you'd like to do. My only challenge with that is I think we'll encourage Mr. Van Overbeek to do that with everybody that has any challenge with the City, and pretty soon the rest of us will not be necessary. Mr. Van Overbeek, do you have energy for that? Actually, I think about that's a great idea. Sean liked it. He is. I think I'd second Sean's motion to take it to Internal Affairs. That was a motion, yeah. Yes, sir. Oh, did he go over a second? I'll third it. Okay. All right. Well, then we'll call the question. Madam Clerk. Okay, just a moment. So it's to continue the hearing and to allow time for IAC to take up this matter and come back with recommendations? Absolutely. So are you closing the public comment? Okay. All right. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member Winslow? No. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-1 with one absence. All right. Can I have a point of clarification? Madam Clerk, so when this goes to IAC, will in fact they have any public hearing? It won't be a public hearing. A public hearing could... IAC doesn't have the authority to hold a public hearing. So it's just a discussion on understanding what this is. Okay. That was my impression. Okay. Perfect. All right. With that, we'll move on to our regular agenda. Item 5.1, Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization Council Presentation and Direction and a report from Community Development Director, Mr. Brent V. Welcome. All right. Good evening, Mayor and Council. Thank you, Reverend V., Director. So again, it's my pleasure to introduce Tara Matthews tonight. She's a principal with a consulting firm, RSG. We asked her to come here because RSG has extensive experience advising, administrating, administering rent stabilization programs and policies throughout California. Her presentation is going to be comprehensive, which means it might be a little longer than usual because of the complexity of this issue as well as the level of community interest. Staff's recommendation is that Council consider the information provided in the presentation, ask questions, consider public testimony, and then provide direction to staff. So I'm going to hand it over to Tara. And again, thanks for coming up. Appreciate you being here. Welcome. Good evening, Mayor and Council members. Thank you for the introduction. I'll kind of give a little brief overview of myself as well. So I work with a firm, RSG. We consult for municipalities throughout the state of California. One of the areas we consult in is rent stabilization matters for both mobile home parks and public housing. We also have jurisdictions that have city-wide rent stabilization. And in that capacity we help jurisdictions evaluate whether or not a program would be beneficial to their community if it's decided that they would like to move forward. We also have experience with program setup and assisting with administration of such programs. Okay. I've never been told that I have a quiet voice. So I will project even louder. Can you hear me okay at that level? Okay. So the topic of rent stabilization, as you are likely aware, is a rather robust conversation. Today I'm going to give an overview of what rent stabilization means as it relates to mobile home parks. We'll walk through some of the key provisions that we typically see in ordinances. We'll highlight some of the city's roles in administering a rent stabilization program, if that's what the city decides to do. And then we'll talk about some of the pros and cons with such programs. You'll hear me kind of reiterating through the presentation. I'll kind of mention it now as well. As we discuss this topic, it's really important to make sure that the city is thinking about maintaining both the interests of protecting residents that live in these mobile home parks as well as protecting the rights of the mobile home park owners. owners that own the parks. We will get started on what is rent stabilization. At a high level, rent stabilization puts a limit on how much a space within a park can increase on an annual basis. Typically that is limited by a state. And the state has to be able to allow rent stabilization to be at least once a year. And it should be noted that if a jurisdiction adopts a program with rent stabilization and a limit is put in place, the fifth amendment under the state constitution requires that the ordinance also provide a fair return on investment to the owner. So there's other type of rent adjustments that are required. And these are typically seen within these ordinances as well that allow for that process to occur. So we'll talk specifically about petitions later on in the presentation but we have that highlighted here as well that there are other provisions that would permit rent adjustments that could be higher than that rent limit established in an ordinance. These are typically adopted by a city council or by a ballot initiative. So we'll talk about that later on in the presentation. But before we jump down into the weeds of rent stabilization ordinance let's kind of just look at it from a state law level. So currently in the civil code which was codified in 1978 is the mobile home residency law. So the mobile home residency law exists currently right now and it really governs and sets forth landlords and residents landlord tenant relationships within mobile home parks. And HCD at the state level, the Department of Housing and Community Development they enforce and ensure compliance. So if there's issues or violations of the mobile home residency law it's HCD at the state that handles that. The law establishes procedures for noticing and disclosures to residents. It covers leases, long term leases. It covers the use of It covers evictions and also includes what are allowable fees or utility charges that can be put in place within a mobile home park. It also covers a lot of other things but these are kind of the topics that overlap with rent stabilization or tenant protection matters. One of the things that also includes is it defines exemptions from local rent stabilization programs. So not every mobile home park space within a park would have a would be covered by a local rent stabilization program. So again any new spaces constructed or first leased after January 1st of 1990 are exempt. Any long term leases, those are leases that are more than 12 months are currently exempt from local rent stabilization programs. That is set to a sunset. There was legislation passed that after January of 2025 that that exemption will no longer apply. And then it also exempts any non primary residences. So those would not be covered under a local rent stabilization program. The mobile home residency law does allow for a local jurisdiction to impose local rent regulations for a mobile home park. So it's not a law that would be So it doesn't preclude a local jurisdiction from establishing a program. So why do some jurisdictions adopt rent stabilization programs for mobile home parks? I think the kind of foundation of this is that mobile home parks are very unique form of ownership. So you have a mobile home owner, the resident that lives at the park, and then you have the park owner who owns the underlying land or the space that is being rented of which that home is placed on. It's mobile home owners, the residents that live there make investments, they purchase a home, they make improvements to those homes over time. And if those space rents increase to a point where they can no longer continue to make the payment or mortgage on their home, then they are not eligible to move their home. It's really challenging to just pick up a mobile home and move it to another space. What we often see in jurisdictions is there's not a lot of vacant spaces, number one. Two, the cost to move a mobile home is $25,000 and up. And then sometimes due to the age of those mobile homes, moving it could potentially damage the home. So it's a little bit different than you would think about maybe like renting a home in an apartment or something like that. And then I think another consideration that a lot of jurisdictions consider is mobile homes are kind of what we would call lowercase affordable housing, right? So it's not subsidized affordable housing in the respect to I'm sure what your jurisdiction does of trying to meet your arena requirements and your regional housing numbers, but it's just another form of affordable housing. And so just trying to improve that, and then also to protect that investment and to protect those units to keep them available within your community. Can you speak enough please? Yes. And so then again you'll see me highlight here noting that moving forward the program is trying to balance both the owners and the residents' interests because again there's a very unique ownership relationship here. Okay. So we'll talk a little bit about what rent stabilization does and what it does not do. So what it does, it puts a limit on the increase of the amount that an owner can increase that space every year. It allows park owners to increase rents potentially above that via what we'll call the fair return on investment process, and we'll talk more about these petitions in a little bit, or to seek reimbursement for capital improvement expenses. And in some cases it also allows residents to file what are called tenant petitions or resident petitions to request a decrease or no increase in rent if there's issues with the maintenance of the property or something like that. What it does not do, it does not prevent owners from increasing rents. It does not limit those rent increases based on a resident's ability to pay. It does not cover rents associated with renting the mobile home itself, so it only applies to the space rent underlying those mobile homes. It does not typically provide additional eviction protections above what is covered in mobile home residency law, that usually is standardized there, and it doesn't really address property management. So if there's any property management issues or issues with management of the park, again, those issues go to HCD. So that was just a kind of brief overview of what rent stabilization programs are as it relates to mobile home parks. So now I'll be moving into the key ordinance provisions that we typically see in ordinances that are adopted throughout the state of California. So let's talk about the key ordinance So first and foremost, which is kind of the premise of a rent stabilization ordinance for mobile home parks, is the establishment of the rent limit. So what is that limit going to be that an owner can increase on an annual basis? The rents. They are typically based on inflation, so that's the consumer price index. In a small number of jurisdictions, they do tie it to the social security cost of living adjustment. We typically see that in a few cases in some jurisdictions that have a lot of senior mobile home parks. Jurisdictions also may apply what we'll call a cap or a floor or a maximum or minimum amount. So it could, a rent limit could be, and we'll look at some examples of rent limits in other jurisdictions on the next slide, but it could be rent can be increased by 75% of the CPI, not to exceed 6% and not to be lower than 2%. So you can put some of those maximums or minimums around a rent limit. And most jurisdictions don't require a petition or an application for that annual rent increase. Sometimes it's just published on the city website so everybody knows what that percentage that is allowed for that year to be. Some jurisdictions mail out annual letters and there's kind of a few different ways that that information is disseminated across that population. And again, once this rent limit is established, there has to be a process within the ordinance that still allows an owner the right to a fair return on their investment. So this slide just shows what some sample rent limits are, kind of pulled throughout the state of California. It's a wide variety. There's definitely, with this topic in general, there's not a one-size-fits-all approach. Each jurisdiction evaluates it and tailors it to their community. As you can see, we'll just kind of point out Escondido. So Escondido, the rent increase on an annual basis is restricted to 90% of the consumer price index with a maximum of 8%. So again, it has a ceiling on if it's without a limit. So if that 80, or excuse me, that 90% of the CPI is greater than 8%, then it only can be 8%. Now, opposite to that is Riverside. They're 80% of the consumer price index and they have no maximum. So this really varies widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Another topic is vacancy control. So unlike rent stabilization as it relates to rental housing units, which does not include mobile home parks, Coastal Hawkins doesn't apply to mobile home parks. So vacancy control can be applied to mobile home spaces, but not to the rental market. So what does vacancy control mean? So basically when a unit is vacated and it turns over, the park owner within the ordinance either says, you can increase that rent to whatever you would like. So you could take it back up to market. So that's the kind of concept of vacancy decontrol. There's no limit or provisions that dictate what that new rent can be. Vacancy control is the option, but it's the opposite. So there's language within the ordinance that says, upon turnover and somebody moving in, it can only be increased by a certain percentage. And it'll detail that within the ordinance. Residents' perspective typically on that is the downside of vacancy decontrol is that it makes it a little bit more difficult to sell their mobile homes. There is an argument that you would hear from the other side, that vacancy control kind of transfers some of the value from the park owner to the mobile home owners because of its rent-stabilized rents, right? So the values of the homes go up because the values of the spaces are lower. And so park owners typically will advocate for vacancy decontrol. Sorry to interrupt you. Yes. But typically our presentations usually don't exceed 15. And you're at about 12 and a half. And I know you have about 10 slides left. I know. Okay. Sorry. I can go really fast. There's a ton of content, so. Okay. Okay. Sure. We haven't been able to hear you. Yeah. Yeah. Can you make it louder so we can all hear? It's as loud as it goes. And it's directed towards us. I mean, you can follow along the best you can, but we haven't had that issue before. Folks, if we could keep the comments. If you could keep the comments until your time, then you speak, please. We will do what we can to increase the volume. Go ahead. Okay. So I will try to get through this quicker and kind of point out the high points here. So that's the concept of vacancy control and decontrol. And again, this next slide basically is just examples of how that is done in various jurisdictions throughout the state. So there's typically four types of petitions that we commonly see. The first one is a CPI, rent increase petition. Some jurisdictions choose this, So the owner has to request a rent increase option over doing a full rental registry, which we have later on in the slide. This is initiated by the owner to request that annual rent increase amount. It's a way for the jurisdiction to track what those space rents are. It's permanent, happens once a year. It's typically low cost, less than $1,500. The fair return rent increase petition, again, that's filed by an owner. That's a request that is greater than Again, that's a permanent rent increase, happens once a year. The cost to process that is typically $20,000 to $40,000. It's a quite labor-intensive process. There is capital improvement rent increase petitions. That's if there is significant repairs that are beyond normal maintenance and repairs, or if there is a significant upgrade, like we added a pool into a park, that they could get a temporary increase for those improvements. The cost to process those is typically $10,000 to $15,000. Then there is a tenant petition, which could be initiated by the tenants. Again, that's a request for a decrease in rents due to a reduction in services or a property owner's failure to comply with regulations. That can either be permanent or temporary. Those come in as needed and are typically around $5,000 to process. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Petitions, that process, once it's established, which has to be established at least for those fair return petitions, there is a decision about who is the approving entity and how the petitions will be approved. There is a wide variety of options. Some jurisdictions kind of start with a more hands-off approach and say park owner, residents, come together, try to come to an agreement. If you can't, we'll have a hearing, or there's a mediator in place to try to come to resolution. If that can't happen, a hearing is put in place. Some jurisdictions have a city approve it, so either a city manager or a director level will determine that rent increase amount. We typically don't advise on that one just for keeping kind of neutrality and keeping the city out of the decision-making process. And the most common one we see are hearings. And so the petition would go to a hearing for either a rent review board or commission or a hearing officer or arbitrator to make a determination on. So what is the difference between boards versus hearing officers? So, you know, the board is typically comprised of residents and owners and maybe some members at large. It has balanced representation from community members. The key note here is to ensure that that board is properly trained and has really good legal advice because some of these, the subject matter is just very complex and evaluating petitions is not an easy thing. It's a little bit lower cost. It kind of runs like your planning commission would. We also see hearing officers and arbitrators. That's the more common way that we see it administered throughout the state. And that's a neutral third party. It's typically a retired, or former judge or attorney with some legal background and they're contracted on an as needed basis. Currently throughout the state, they are in a little bit of short supply. Some of my clients are having difficulties trying to get hearing officers hired to conduct this type of work. There's the concept of a rental registry. I would say about 45% of jurisdictions with mobile home park rent savings have rental registry. A rental registry basically is a process to collect information on the space rents within a mobile home park and it allows the city to verify information and ensure compliance with the program. These can be a little costly to create and maintain. And a consideration would be is it necessary for the 16 parks that are here in Chico. Associated with the rental registry, the rental registry is a program The rental registry are fees. So there could be a fee established to help administer the program. That's usually tied to the rental registry. Those program costs can be borne by the park owners, the residents, the city or a combination thereof. This is typically charged on an annual basis. And you might see a separate fee for a petition that's outside of that annual registry fee. On this slide. Here's some examples of annual fees throughout the state of California. Wide variety. It goes from zero all the way up to $61 for just a program administration registry fee. Sometimes it's 100% paid by the residents. Sometimes it's 100% paid by the owners. Sometimes there's a split between the two parties. So it's a split between the two parties. It should be noted that this topic, as I kind of mentioned at the beginning, is controversial, highly litigious. Right now the state of California is trying to address this matter at the state level and has introduced multiple bills. Many of them have been stalled due to litigation. So just something to keep a mind of on those bills that are kind of out there pending to see what those outcomes are, about even establishing a statewide rent limit for mobile home spaces. And then the second piece there is just, again, a reminder that there has to be a fair and reasonable return. So again, it's that fair return on investment. A lot of jurisdictions get sued in their ordinances over this particular topic. However, most of those lawsuits have been upheld by those on the city side. And, you know, there haven't been, you know, there haven't been any lawsuits. So I don't think that's a major effect, at least to the long-term ordinance staying in place. But I mention it because it could be costly. So you said that most have been upheld in court, but here it says all have. Like not a single city's rent stabilization has been found to be out of compliance with the law. Correct. So what does it mean for a city to adopt a rent stabilization program? So here's just a map of your jurisdiction. There are 16 parks with a little over 1,700 spaces. And so if the city moved forward for protecting those 16 mobile home parks, one would be to prepare program guidelines. That's adopting an ordinance, usually policies and procedures, and then engaging with legal counsel as needed to ensure compliance with state laws. There's creating program content. So again, websites, pushing it out to the community, explaining it to everybody, which hand in hand goes with that community education and outreach piece. You can choose whether or not you want to put a registry in place. There is staff that is needed for public inquiries to fill those inquiries from residents and owners to publish those annual rent limits. And then there is just a number of other things So that's just the managing the entire petition process and approval process. So program startup typically takes 10 to 18 months to complete. So if a jurisdiction, if you all decided you wanted to move forward with one, it does take a little bit of time. It requires staff, legal, consultant time to create an ordinance, to create all the content, to establish a registry. And those costs are typically between $100,000 to $150,000. And then staffing and the city budget over time, a lot of that depends on what is included in the ordinance. We typically see up to two FTEs that are needed, a city attorney or an attorney to handle any issues. So that's the one that we see. for any litigation or compliance matters. There's consultants. Typically we see two, again, using kind of the hearing officer model. And then consultants to run the math and do the due process check on those petitions. Budgets range widely throughout the state. But I do have to say that jurisdictions with newly adopted ordinances or recently amended ordinances are closer to that Santa Rosa amount. Some of these other ones that are listed here are rather old and have been in place for a while. So it could range anywhere in between that amount that you see on the screen. And then, this is my last slide. Oh, one more after this one. So the pros and cons of a mobile home. So the pros and cons of a mobile home rent stabilization ordinance. So the pros is it allows the city to closely monitor the conditions and rents that are being charged in mobile home parks. It clarifies the rent increase process and kind of addresses what's currently a void in state law for this issue. It helps maintain the value of the homes for the residents. It can protect residents from steep rent increases. And it provides a process for a neutral party in determining the rent increase. And it's also a process that allows for allowable rent increases over that limit. The cons that you'll often hear is that it requires significant technical expertise. I have a client right now that they went through a petition process and the applicant didn't like the outcome and is now suing the city for how that was handled. So you just want to make sure you have staff on hand and legal counsel and consultants on hand that understand how these processes work. For me personally, I don't see that as a crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. For me personally, I don't see that as crime. are capped, then they may reduce overall investment into the conditions of the park. And last, if the city is interested in moving towards evaluating and adopting a mobile home rent stabilization ordinance, we would recommend the following three steps. One is to start with some research on better understanding the mobile home community and market trends in Chico, taking a look at market data, housing affordability overall, and the resident demographics and incomes. Second would be community engagement, so identifying major priorities, having outreach with both residents and owners of the parks and outreach to gather that feedback and input. We see success. And lastly, policy development, so establishing a program based on data, priorities, and staffing capacity. And then you would be at that point, oh, I'm ready with an ordinance and to implement a program. And that concludes my presentation, and I'm available for any questions. All right, questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? What those rent increases can be but I've heard it from different attorneys explained different ways So I'm not an attorney so I will not Air commissioners you mentioned fair return or investment. Is it a range that defines that? What is a fair return on an investment? Yeah, so if only it was that clear tip there is a It's most often you see it defined by looking at operating income and expenses in a park and the change in that Overtime and there's been right. Is it like 5% is it a range defined like how much there's no range? It's a mathematical formula a complicated one Right Miss I am I believe you had I just wanted to respond to a councilmember Bennett's question regarding the semantics of the tiling of the ordinance In my opinion, there's really no difference. I think sometimes one comes off a little bit harsher than the other I think jurisdictions have adopted the title based on that perception, but legally I don't believe there really is a real distinction I have a question for staff Anybody wants to take this? so what I have heard is that almost all the parks in Chico or on septic and and that those septics are timing out and failing and so there's going to be a wave of Sewer connections for these parks is you you looking at me Eric like you want to answer it? And and Does anybody have any? Where I'm going with this is what I'm concerned is if we we put in place a rent Restrict the rents that owners can collect how they gonna hook up to the sewers to the sewer system Which is something that's going to be mandated You want to take that one? Mr. City manager? Well, I'll punt it over to Brendan because we are actually working on a potential grant opportunity with State Water Resources Control Board to assist with putting mobile home parks on sewer But that's a very long range proposition, but you're exactly right For example the park that started this conversation is on some configuration of septic on-site Yeah, and I can only imagine how expensive that would be to correct that, you know Installing a new collection system and tying into the sewer would be well well well into six figures Don't know if you want to add anything Brendan. No, it's I would just add that Ultimately environmental health butte county environmental health is the deciding factor as septic systems fail not Allowing new septic systems going and essentially forcing the hookup at that point of failure to city manager Sorensen's point we've Had some opportunity to find some grant programs We're still Considering those options. There's a lot of nuance and challenges associated with that obviously as you get on the private property and you're dealing with hooking up to maybe older units that might have other challenges and then it becomes a ripple effect so those are all factors that we've Considered and will continue to analyze All right, mr. Winslow Hopefully if there's some big expenses that you could perfectly well anticipate landlords have been saving up for the occasion But mr. Lamb you your firm and you yourself have worked on these rents to the addition ordinances in other areas. Is that correct? That's correct Yeah Do you agree with that? It would cost a hundred to a hundred dollars? $150,000 to draft an ordinance I mean if because there's other model ordinances we could take obviously making our own decisions on some of these factors that were outlined in the slides well, I think the the cost that The consultants were referring to I think it's it's not just legal I think it's staff time and working with staff and city attorneys to prepare I think that the ordinance itself is not in my opinion difficult and take that much time I think what you saw in this presentation though is there are Dozens of points and issues that I think are need to be decided locally Regarding what is the best course if the city wanted to pursue that option? so there's a lot of variables within these ordinances that Attorneys are not really the ones that are making those decisions Right. Yeah there there was a research in a community engagement piece to that which which I feel like since we've had these meetings for a Seven eight months now on this that that we've done a lot of community engagement. We've heard from a lot of people on it. They had in there a housing affordability analysis and I don't know that we need to do that. The rent's too damn high. I think that's why we're here. We could draft an ordinance with less money if we were to bypass or maybe abbreviate some of those other elements. Sorry, may I clarify what you're speaking about? You're absolutely right. To prepare an ordinance is not $100,000 to $150,000. That number is to prepare the ordinance, create all the content. If you go back to the city rolls and to the rollout, you have to create all the various petition forms and there's just a lot of behind the scenes work that has to get done before you can roll out a program or drafting policies and procedures and things like that. I just wanted to clarify what that was. It wasn't just for the ordinance. Thank you. Further questions? How many speakers? We have 12. Three minutes, but you don't have to use it all. I'm going to call the first two names and I would ask that you please line up in the middle aisle and I'll try to speak as loud as I can. When you come up to the podium, if you could please get closer to the microphone and at least a little bit above it, that would be great. Our first two speakers are Frank Prince, followed by Ann DeBow. Good evening and thank you for your time. My name is Frank Prince and I represent the management and owners of Springfield Manor Mobile Home Park, a 91 space senior community at 2050 Springfield Drive. It's a well cared for and maintained community with the current owners purchased in 1992 with a goal of providing a well run and maintained community for its residents while providing for reasonable income for its owners. Yearly space rent increases have met the increased yearly operating expenses while always recognizing that these increases should be within the ability of the residents to pay. Over the past 18 years, the average annual space rent increases have been 3.3%. We also provide each resident of our community with a $25 monthly rent credit to reward timely rent payments and home and yard payments. Rent control implemented in the mobile home park industry has proven to reduce maintenance standards and increase deferred maintenance and the ultimate deterioration of the community. Capital improvements are eliminated in property values of not only the community but of the homes in that community declined due to the community deterioration. Rent control ultimately creates a decline in community harmony as resident factions form. Rent control creates a reduction in affordable housing as mobile home parks become less viable as investments. No new parks are built and owners of existing communities look for other uses for the land or subdivide and sell. Rent control increases government costs necessary to administer. Many jurisdictions have spent crippling amounts of money on legally defending their ordinance and sometimes losing. Mobile home park owners and residents do not benefit from rent control. Increased costs and reduced services to benefit a small local minority is not a recipe for either the government or the taxpayer. We urge a no vote to further discussion of rent control. Thank you. Thank you. Ann DeBow followed by Dave Donnan. Hello City Council. Since November of 2023, numerous supporters of the SRSO presented requests to the City Council. Pleasant Valley Mobile Estates, Chico Creek Estates, Springfield Manor, Casa De Flores, and even a homeowner living in an Arizona mobile home park. Passing an SRSO will protect affordable, unsubsidized housing for the vulnerable homeowners that live in Chico Mobile Home Parks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For hosting this forum.

This is not my numbers. These come off the realtor multiple listing service. When you sell a home, what the space rents are, I would just like the council to continue on to investigate this further because you've gotten letters from park owners that say they've only gone up a certain amount. And I do commend Springfield for following that guideline, but the majority do not. Thank you. Alan Stevenson, followed by Celeste Macklin. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, members of the council. My name is Alan Stevenson. I work with the Boveda community, which owns Mountain View MHC, Chico Trailer Haven, and Chico Home Park. So first, at the risk of introducing a little bit of levity to a very serious topic, I'd like to introduce a quote from Winston Churchill, which is, democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those others that have been tried from time to time. And the reason I bring that up is maybe there's an analogy to this current discussion in terms of perhaps utilizing market supply and demand economic forces to determine the whole picture. And I think that's a good point. Because having a taxable home space rent is the worst way of doing it, except all others that have been tried from time to time. So that being said, I'm going to focus my brief comments on the negative impacts to communities and residents. What inevitably happens with rent control is substantial and long-term reduction in spending on maintenance, amenities, and capital improvements. The result is lower quality parks, poor roads, and limited levels of maintenance and management. There are multiple reasons for this. The obvious one is reduced return on investment, but also many people don't realize that many operating expenses are not tied to indices like the consumer price index. For example, in our parks in California, we've seen very substantial increases to items like salary expenses, insurance expenses over the last few years, which have far, far exceeded CPI. It is mentioned there are mechanisms and various rent control ordinances to adjust for this. However, the reality is these mechanisms rarely work well. They often come with substantial risk and cost to the owners, with the default result being that the owners limit the spending in the first place. I was recently in Lancaster, California, which is in L.A. County. It has about the exact same median home price as Chico, and it has mobile home rent control. I drove every single park in that city. And you saw the expected poor roads, limited levels of maintenance to landscaping, common areas and amenities, and a lack of newer homes. Another one of the important valuable reasons to live in a mobile home park is the benefit of community. When a park is well maintained and has quality management focused on promoting cleanliness, safety, and community, there's a substantial and ongoing quality of life benefit to all the residents. With rent control, there becomes multiple classes of residents. With the parks... And the parks, based on those wanting to pay a little bit more for better quality amenities and those who do not want to. Finally, both of the communities will likely never sell any of our parks in the city of Chico, and we look forward to being good managers and good neighbors for many decades to come. Thank you. Thank you. Celeste Macklin, followed by Kathy Blatch. Hello. I just want to please, please... Don't disappoint. Seniors that are struggling with financial anxiety and financial burdens, insecurity, that are living in mobile homes that they own but can't do anything with, that can't, we can't move it, we can't, you know, without having loads and loads of money to do it. So please, please... Please consider this. Please consider the people that are living in these mobile homes. Their situations. Their, uh... Their health. They have plenty of bills, even on a substantial income. They've got other bills, like health, the food. Just, you know, don't even think about travel. Anyway, please... Again, please consider this. Thank you. Kathy Blatch, followed by Al Johnson. Thanks to the Council and Mayor. Thank you so much for having us here and for the presentation. Sorry, can you hear me now? We appreciate you taking the time and having the presentation and kind of doing a deeper dive. The SRSO provides not just protection for space rent increases. But as we've learned, it's about vacancy rates and everything else. So it's kind of a full package. The other thing is, we as homeowners, we're more than happy to pay an administrative fee, monthly or annually, whatever you decide to maintain the program. Arcata was so successful. I don't know if you saw them on the news last week. They just reduced their administrative fees from $10 to $5 per space. Because they had so much money in their fund. I'm going to jump to something else real quick here. There's $110. SRSO is in California. My understanding, and I will validate this, is there's only been nine lawsuits filed. None of them have been approved. Not one. So we talk about litigation and everybody's afraid to get involved in this. Because they think they're going to be sued. But a lot of these lawsuits are filed. And the park owners just pull back. Because once they have to open up their books and show what they're doing and their fair return of increase and all that. It just blows up. Also, as far as arbitrators, the McGregor School of Law is in Sacramento. They have retired judges that specialize in SRSOs. We also have the, I think it's the Chico and Brethren Council on the law up here on Eaton Road. They would probably be more than happy to help out too. I don't have time here. And I just want to say that I hope you'll perceive that. I hope you'll see that we've received either doing more review or just kind of look through this and not make a quick decision. Based on all the information you're getting that's coming from some very professional people and some legislators. And then just what we have to talk about. So, thank you. Thank you. Al Johnson followed by Andy Carey. I'm Al Johnson. 82 year old. Senior. I live in Pleasant Valley mobile home park. But my mobile home is no longer mobile. It's over 20 years old. Butte County, Glynn County, Tehama County, Chatham County. Nobody will allow us to move that mobile into their county. They have ordinances just like we have here. So, I'm in an island now. I can't do anything. I am in that island. I'm at the park owner's mercy now. My rent went from when I first moved there from 300, it up to 635. That's 31% of my income. I'm Social Security and a little retirement. I'm going to explain what I feel about my life. I have an eight foot tape measure. It's got 96 numbers on it. I'm at 82 now. I got 14 to go. In 14 years my income is going to be 29, 23. At the rate that we're having our rent there now at 10% a year my rent is going to be 2,300 plus dollars. I don't see this working out for me. I think I'll be living over here with the rest of the folks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Andy Carey, followed by Kathleen McBain. Hello, good evening. I'm Andy Carey, president of Monolith Properties. Our team manages three mobile parks in the city of Chico, representing nearly 600 spaces, which sounds like it's just shy of half the spaces in the city, close to 2,000 resident homeowners. We also operate dozens more parks up and down the valley. We're a small business and exclusively represent mom-and-pop park owners. One of our clients even built his park here in Chico with his own hands decades ago. I'd hoped to see him tonight, but I don't see him in the audience. I'm a past president of our industry association, WMA, and have managed over 100 parks in my career. I've seen the unintentional but devastating effects of mobile home park rent control in the Bay Area, and I'm here to share our plea and warning to those who are in the area. and I'm here to share our plea and warning to those who may have less experience with these ordinances than I do. To be clear, our parks in the city of Chico have for years been fair and moderate with rent increases. One of our parks even went five years without a rent increase, despite inflating operating costs. We gave discounts to campfire refugees. During COVID, we kept rents down and even skipped rent increases despite rapidly increasing costs. And we have offered private rent subsidies funded by our money alone, not a dime of public funding. The consequences of rent control in parks are dire, and often not what a council intends. Privately funded rent subsidies would be immediately eliminated. Small businesses, moms and pops, become financially stressed and forced out of the business. Opportunities to expand spaces and provide even more low-cost housing supply are wiped out. Just yesterday, I was working with a group on plans to expand the number of spaces for homeowners here in Chico, and if rent control is passed, those plans would be scrapped. Just yesterday, I was working with a group on plans to expand the number of spaces for homeowners here in Chico, and if rent control is passed, those plans would be scrapped. Rent control sends the message to housing suppliers that the city is hostile to their investments, and those suppliers look elsewhere, worsening the supply problem. When space rents are artificially constrained, the cost of the home simply skyrockets, making housing even more unaffordable. In Concord, for example, we see rent-controlled homes which cost $150,000 to replace, forcing would-be homebuyers to pay $350,000, completely unaffordable, for the tip of the coin. And perhaps worst of all, is rent control pushes out the moms and pops who own and operate these parks for decades, and welcoming corporate landlords with giant legal teams who litigate their way to higher rents and even park closures. I have seen elsewhere that what is often missing is simply better communication between park owners and homeowners. In El Dorado County, we held stakeholder meetings to answer questions and share concerns. The meetings were so valuable. the park owners were able to clear up misunderstandings and rumors about rules and laws. I was very involved with the board' s efforts there and I encourage the council to consider such an option here. that' s time thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary about money if there were a way instead of spending all that money to make other people's rent controlled, what if we set up some kind of community organization to help people that are facing homelessness by not being able to maintain their mobile home themselves? Or that their rent over the years has exceeded their income? The last thing that any of us in this room and anyone I know in Chico, the last thing we would want is a population of elderly homeless. That would not be acceptable. In the meantime, it feels good to have... A good relationship with the private owners. And I do support that. Thank you. Thank you. Sala Landano, followed by Eric Chisler. Thank you, Mayor, Council Members. I'm here today on behalf of WMA and Chico housing providers to strongly urge this Council to back away from the discussion on rent control. Thank you. For me personally, the state has already destroyed housing affordability in coastal California and is now attempting to make its way to Chico. It's unfortunate that this issue's even being discussed here which sends negative signals to our current housing providers as well as anyone looking to invest here. Aside from all the serious unintended consequences of rent control, this policy does the opposite of what it claims to do. Instead of keeping costs down, rent control leads to artificially inflated property values. The housing prices created by rent control don't have to be paid by those already living there. For me personally, I don't see that as a crime. so it falls on newcomers. That means a single working mother with two kids can't find a place to live because rent control has driven in property values over her budget. The difference in move-in costs between two units that are exactly the same, other than the fact that one is in a rent control area and one is not, is usually in the tens of thousands of dollars. At a recent rent control hearing in Petaluma, one operator showed an average difference of $75,000 between units sold in his park, which are under long-term leases and so exempt from rent control, and average units sold in a park just across the street, which has been subject to rent control for many years. It's not the $20 rent increase that's keeping working families out of this community. It's the $75,000 extra to finance the unit that those working families can't afford. The city of Chico is fortunate. It has serious and committed park operators who care and are proud of their communities. As you just heard, one of them is right here with us in Chico today and used to be the former mayor of Chico. He's the former president of our association. I urge you to listen to these housing providers who are the ones who have firsthand experience of the rising costs of doing business in California. They have, through their letters and spoken words, explained to you how much their costs have risen in the past few years and the effort that they make to keep rent increases low and manageable for their residents, including the vast majority of these parks providing rental assistance programs for the residents who qualify. Residents who qualify and need the assistance to explore those options is for asking the council. For more information about what's available on your desk Council Member Winslow at our last hearing when he said that we don't want this kind of investment. Serious and caring property owners providing quality rental housing in Chico is what we need more of, not less. So I urge you to speak with One United Voice, reject rent control, and send a message to your housing providers that you do value and want their continued investments in Chico. Thank you. Thank you. Eric Chisler, followed by Bryce Goldstein. Good evening, Council. You know, for the last several hundred years until about 60 or 70 years ago, our elderly came and lived with us in our houses. And we were able to take care of the people who were under our charge, the people who gave us birth, the people who gave us wisdom, the people who set up the world that was benefiting us. In these times, that's not as common, not as possible in dual-income households, not as possible when people have to move. They're far away from their families in order to get the jobs that they want to take care of their own families. And that leaves the care in our hands for those elderly residents who are living on fixed incomes. And I guess all I want to say is, if that's our charge, what more moral charge is there than to take care of our elders and our children? So I urge you to take whatever action is in your hands. And I think it's necessary to make sure that they're put first. And if that means putting in rent stabilization, I think that that is the way that we need to go. And if truly there are so many good landlords out there who are at 3%, they've got nothing to worry about. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Bryce Goldstein. Good evening, City Council. Thank you for having us here. Thank you. My name is Bryce Goldstein, and I strongly support rent stabilization for mobile home parks. You've heard from so many residents at this meeting and at other council meetings who are under extreme stress from being rent gouged over and over again. And you've heard unsubstantiated statements from a few investors who are looking to maximize their profit. You've also heard from at least one park owner who has been a good park owner and has stuck to only the rent increases necessary to maintain the facilities and apparently still break even or even make a profit. But I'm confused why that park owner would argue against rent stabilization that would keep the playing field level by preventing other park owners from rent gouging. So why would we need to allow much higher than 3.5% or whatever is actually necessary per year? I'm also skeptical of the statement that, rent stabilization would reduce the amount of affordable housing. New parks can still be built, although we have an issue with not enough land for them in general. But I don't see rent stabilization as being the factor that would prevent a new park from being created. There was a mention of reduction of maintenance when rent stabilization is implemented. I would like to see an example of where that's true and also evidence of why we should cave to that threat. I would like to see an example of where that threat of reduced maintenance when we know that maintenance costs are not increasing at 10% per year, which is generally what is being asked of residents to increase their pay 10% per year. So please vote to support the people of Chico and not expanded profits for investors who've bought these parks. And please consider moving forward with rent stabilization to protect our elderly citizens, our low-income residents, and all residents of mobile home parks in Chico. Thank you. Thank you. She's our last speaker. All right. Thank you, everybody. All right. Comments from council members? I'll let you lead on. Not me. Go ahead, Mr. Brown. This is a question I suspect I know the answer, but for our city attorney, Mr. Lamb, is it possible to have a rent stabilization plan or policy or procedure for a single mobile park in the community? I believe that would be susceptible to legal challenge by that particular mobile home park based on the fact that we're treating others differently than that particular one. That would be my concern. Thank you. City manager, I have a quick question for you. I cannot remember the last time a mobile home park was built in Chico. But your memory is much better than mine. Can you? I would have to guess Springfield. Okay. But I don't recall what year that was. Probably 80s? I think it was. 1990. Okay. 90s. Thank you. All right. Mr. Winslow. Yeah, we've actually had the opposite. In more recent years, there's been a few smaller mobile home parks that have been redeveloped for apartments. And that's why you don't see mobile home parks in a lot of larger cities because the land values are higher so people invest more in them and build up. But there was a mention by one of the park owners of they wouldn't be expanding to find new spaces. We would have the first expansion in a long time and they wouldn't happen. But as we learned in this presentation, the state law precludes us from regulating rents on places built after 1990. So it would seem like that would be an even better investment if ownership and deeper exploitation of the existing mobile homes is limited by a rent regulation ordinance. The one other thing that I hear a lot about the threat of litigation and even the claim we heard that cities have lost it, but the exact opposite is what was said in the presentation. So to use like a baseball analogy, it's like we won 9-0, but it was a highly competitive game. And I don't think that justifies us not doing it. Like we understand the reason why we're here is that there is rent gouging that's going on and it's not all the parks. But those parks who aren't, are not threatened by a limitation on rent gouging. But there still is going to be the outstanding question of what kind of rent increases we have. There's a couple other questions on there too. Vacancy control and what sort of partition process we do, what sort of administrative funding we use to not draw out of the general fund in order to have a rent stabilization program. And I think that those are decisions that we should make at a future meeting and I hope that our city attorney will be able to pull together some, those and any other questions that we would need to decide upon in order to get to the point where we can do that. I think that that would give some affirmative direction for drafting an ordinance. And if anybody has nothing else to say, I'd make a motion that we... I have a quick question though. Okay, yeah, go ahead. Since this ordinance that we're talking about, rent stabilization, it kind of goes hand in hand with housing, providing housing to low-income senior citizens. Is there any kind of funding or grants that we have that we could use to draft this ordinance? Not that I'm aware of. I was just checking in that, if we can look into that, if we can find money somewhere else besides the general fund, if we need to do this. All right. Mr. Van Overbeek. You know, this is just a classic case of what happens when you constrict the supply of housing. So, Ms. Goldstein, who I respect very much, and Mr. Winslow, who's my friend, who I also respect, speak in favor of rent control, but the reason the prices are so high is because we don't have enough supply and these parks are full. And we haven't, the city managers, we haven't built a park here since 1980. We have vast tracts of vacant land, but you and your amigos have shut it down for development, so we have no place to put new parks. And consequently, the price goes through the roof. If we enact rent control, I'm convinced that it will be a disaster as it has been everywhere else. All right. Anyone? No, I have a couple things to say on that. I totally agree with you. Rent control does not really help in the long run. But the world that we are living in right now, California, as such, has rent control. And I think that's a big part of it. Rent control on apartments, that didn't stop people from building them or renting them. And they're not going, they're not looking like they are not well-maintained, is the word I'm looking for. And I know that during the COVID, we did have rent freezes, that there are no rent, no increase in the rents for the apartments, any class except single-family houses. People still rented, people still stayed there. I knew there were a lot of programs, to help people who were behind on rents and stuff. But unfortunately, we are dealing with a population that is senior and they have a unique situation that they own the properties, they own their homes, but not the land. So it seems like they should have a little bit more security than a tenant who can walk into an apartment and leave it in a devastated situation, for a landlord to fix. And a tenant, I'm just saying in general what I have observed, that we have rent protection for apartment, that tenants who would live in an apartment, but there is no protection for the homeowners who are in a mobile home park. So for that reason, I would like to see we move forward and get something drafted and help. And I would support maybe something similar on the lines with the CPI and a percentage. And if it works out, maybe a little maintenance fee per month, because I know that could help the property owners, the mobile homeowners to maintain it. And I'm not sure what that number would be. And that's something we will need to find out as we go forward. So I'll make a motion that maybe we could move forward. Okay. Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? implementation of your firm with this? we can draft the ordinance just to clarify the cost that was presented in the presentation I think one aspect of the ordinance which is the implementation documents all the forms that staff would be using the training of staff that kind of stuff is we can draft the ordinance but the forms that relate to these types of procedures those are additional costs that I think council should be aware of that is not part of just the ordinance. we can figure that out at a later date but moving forward with your motion we would be brought back what we need to make decisions on in order to have a fully fledged ordinance draft. I want to point one more thing out I' m sorry I missed out. council member chan let' s have a second. second we' re in understanding with that. we have a motion and a second further comment? I want to say the biggest drawback for the mobile park owners would be that there would be rent increase most likely every year because that would be the biggest drawback if this goes through because most of the times that mobile park owners would want to make that increase because they would not have an opportunity to make a bigger bump at some point down the line. so. that is the biggest disadvantage this ordinance will bring to the mobile park owners. all right we have a motion and a second. madam clerk when you' re ready. okay council member bennett? no. council member morgan? no. council member tandon? yes. council member van overbeck? no. council member winslow? yes. mayor coolidge? no. it fails to four with one absence. all right. thank you. yes. may I speak? absolutely. do you have another motion? no I do not. I have a suggestion and before taking a closer look at rent control or rent stabilization my request is to exhaust communication with the legacy owners and I would ask that the owner of the pleasant valley estates community initiate conversations with the owner and there' s a letter in here from andrew j. fels and he repeatedly talks about communication he would be open to communication he would be open to a discussion about a fair rent increase or some type of stabilization. I would like to make sure that the residents of pleasant valley estates do have some protection I am committed to that but I would rather exhaust our communication I would rather exhaust a manner of finding compromise and dialogue to reach an agreement prior to taking another action such as rent control. That is my request and I don' t know if you' re prepared to say anything tonight but that' s what I' m asking and suggesting. all right. I' m sorry public comment is closed right now thank you. anything further? motion to die? does anybody who voted no have anything to say about what would get you to go further or is this it? better motion available or just checking before we move on? all right. so with that we will take short recess. thank you. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .! we were the first to receive the pro housing designation program council provided direction to return to council with a resolution to initiate the application process at that time we shared we were knee deep in numerous code amendments those were the residential readiness code amendments you heard at the last meeting we promise to come back after that again for your background knowledge jurisdictions that receive the designation receive incentives in the form of points or other preferences in the scoring of applications for competitive housing as well as infrastructure funding programs offered by the state. To help us as staff gather additional information regarding the application process we reached out to three jurisdictions that recently applied for the program including ukiah santa rosa and reading I will say it was very helpful and will be beneficial to us in our process there are lots to learn wrapping up once the pro housing application is complete staff will send a copy to council and the application will be submitted to hcd which will begin the formal review process I expect there will be back and forth with hcd based on my last interactions with them on our housing element we promise to keep council updated regarding any key issues so tonight we recommend the council adopt a resolution presentation. questions? this seems like a great program however my experience with the state programs is always a gotcha so what is it? again I was a little apprehensive of proving to the state that we are pro housing because I think we are pro housing. But I think it is also an opportunity at this point I think hcd is trying to give communities that are doing the right thing an opportunity to receive some benefit from doing the right thing. If we can get some extra points whether it is for housing grant or just as importantly infrastructure grants it is worth the exercise and the staff that we spoke to at the different jurisdictions said there is a little bit of pain but it is also therapeutic and cathartic to share and research all the things you are doing as a community. At the last meeting I said we shared the whole chico nut why were we doing that? I think we do do things and it is time for us to share that with the state and hopefully receive some benefits. I don' t think there is a gotcha on this one. thank you. further questions? none. none. second. council member tannum I will give that to you. slightly quicker. council member bennett. yes. council member morgan. yes. council member tandon. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. mayor coolidge. yes. mayor cullidge. yes. item 5.3 resolution to approve the fiscal year 2024-25 final budget. resolutions that council requested on the meeting of June 4. those are now incorporated in the budget. at this point in time seeking approval of the resolution approving the budget for fiscal year 2024-25. do we have any speakers? none. all right. second. council member go ahead. I do see that we have fire victim trust funds. I would like to request for next six months $110,000 to keep the chico library open an additional day. right now the library is closed on monday, wednesday, sunday, monday and wednesdays. and summer vacations are going on. I do understand the county has a one person sale tax measure but that is still kind of dicey once it passes. but it's just a one time request to get the library opened for an additional day. is that a friendly amendment? yes. it's an amendment to the budget. my question is there's a motion and a second. are you asking for a friendly amendment? I would say if I can make a secondary motion. yeah. okay. or I can make an how would it work? could you tell me that? if you asked for the friendly amendment but then it would need to be accepted because you do have a motion and a second on the floor they would need to accept your friendly amendment. if they do that. I will be Madam clerk I also have a friendly amendment. . I feel like we should deal with the first one. is it friendly or not. let's deal with the first one. I deny your friendly amendment has cost to my. I don't know. it may not be friendly. it may not. I voted. same thing as a secondary. let him finish. sorry. go ahead. I voted against the revenue guarantee for the airport since then I have talked to a number of people at the university senior people at the university and business people in town and have been convinced that I was wrong in that. the amendment I want to make is to go back to the mayor's original proposal which is to have a $500,000 revenue guarantee and $300,000 allowance for bringing the terminal up to TSA standards and of course that only would happen if we actually got an airline to show up to the airport. I don't think that would be I would like to see the mayor's request to have the $500,000 for the revenue guarantee but the update of the terminal was immediate. it was what? it was now. you want to spend that money now. that' s when you made the original motion. it' s not update to the terminal per se it' s an addition of a portable. if they did. it' s only necessary if we have air. we might do some of the groundwork but the bulk of it we wouldn' t do unless we had an airline that was committed. you' re asking to earmark $800,000 to the airport if we get an airline. correct. I' m convinced it will have a huge amount. we already have $250,000. plus the $300,000. yes but for the fund. for the capital project for the dsa port. it was $300,000. that' s a friendly amendment? yes. I reject that one too because the process is bad. . no. I would like to all right. we could enter. you can' t fish for motions. don' t fish for motions. I can make one. yes you can. I can substitute motion. that would be that we accept the budget as it' s written with the exception that we increase the revenue guarantee for the airline revenue guarantee for $250,000 buy an additional $250,000. and provide $300,000 for the facility upgrades only if we sign an airline. second. from the fire victims trust. from the fire victims trust. all right. motion and a second. you can make a second. third substitute motion. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Okay. And approve the budget. Wait a minute. I think we've got three motions. We've got Mr. Morgan's motion, which is approve the budget. We have mine, which is to approve the budget with the additional funds for the airport. And I think what Councilperson Tandon meant to say was she'd like to approve the budget with $110,000 to the library in addition. And she added in your item as well. And you added in the airport as well. Okay. I'll second that. So you have the original motion. You have the, yes. Last first and I second it. Okay. So we have a motion from Councilmember Tandon. Do I have a second on this motion, which is to adopt the resolution approving the budget as amended to add $110,000 for one additional day for the Butte County Library. And the additional funds that were asked for the airport items. Is there a second? Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Okay. Thank you. All right. Councilmember Bennett. Yes. Councilmember Morgan. No. Councilmember Tandon. Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck. Yes. Councilmember Winslow. No. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. It carries 4-2. 1 absence. All right. And we will move on to item 5.4. Consideration of Councilmember Morgan's request ad hoc committee to discuss development. Councilmember Morgan. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I believe my letter to the clerk is clear enough. Since I sent that letter, Mr. Van Overbeck has, for lack of a better term, kind of taken over this idea. So I will defer this to him. I have not taken over the idea. You handed me the football and suggested that I run with it. So. But I think Mr. Morgan did a great job in outlining the what we need to do here, which is to create a committee of the smart growth people, the city, some council people, LAFCO, maybe some city, some people from the county, to. To. Talk about your words were growth and future development. And so I've reached out to those people. I've talked to Councilman Winslow and some of the people from smart growth. We've had conversations. Some of the development community. And so and the things we've talked about are what's the charter? What do we call it? And who should be on it? And so what I would request is that the council authorize. I think. I think. I think. I think. I think. Okay. Sorry. I got ahead of myself here. This is very exciting topic. Very exciting topic. Okay. So with that we will ask for public comment. We have one speaker. Austin baron. All right. Three minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. recall a certain group called Smart Growth Associates that was seemingly against growth in Chico, talking about, you know, we can't do Valley's Edge, we shouldn't be doing homeownership housing here in Chico. So I just wanted to reiterate that if we're going to make a committee on this, I think that we should have people that are recognizing the population growth ahead of us, recognizing that we need homeownership housing, and recognizing that we do need rental housing as well. But growth-minded, not the people that are sitting here saying we shouldn't be building anything. And that concludes my comments. All right. Thank you very much. Further comments from anyone? Mr. Winslow? Mr. Winslow, you. I'll start. I think that it's a good suggestion. A lot has changed since we passed the general plan, since the campfire law has changed, since the referendum in March, a lot has changed. And something that I think there's kind of a unique opportunity out of this is that we've had this proposal for a large-scale development. And like a lot of times in Chico's past, there's been big pushback against it. But this time, the people leading that pushback have been very explicitly pro-housing in Chico and looking for ways to build more and encourage or accommodate the population growth that we're having throughout the city. And so this is a good opportunity for people on different sides of a couple issues that have come up together. For me personally, eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually eventually of this committee which people seem to like the idea of committee for growth and community development so the word growth is the first word and so that' s my motion. I just have a quick question on that. Is there a time limit you are suggesting to bring it back maybe three months six months or? Oh no I would like to bring it back next month. Okay I was just curious because it was not. Yeah this isn' t that hard and the first conversations I have with Mr. Winslow have been very constructive and cooperative so I' m hopeful that we can get an agreement on what the mission is who the players are and again to Mr. Barron' s comment we are trying to find ways to accommodate population growth in this city that' s the mission. So Madam Clerk how clearly do we need to define? Well I know it' s being structured as an ad hoc and you can meet when you need to there won' t be agendas or minutes and that way you can get your work product done and back to the council. I don' t know if City Attorney Lamb has any suggestions as to any parameters of this committee. Typically the mayor appoints and. Okay. I' m happy to appoint two but is it proper to appoint two I guess is what I' m asking. You can go up to three and as you' ll recall Vice Mayor Reynolds had asked also I know she can' t be here tonight but had expressed a desire to also be on it. You can have up to three council members on an ad hoc. Can we just have two? You can you. Okay let' s just do two then. I' m comfortable with that if you guys are. So I don' t this is just like a technicality question because we' re talking about coming back with a more defined proposal for a committee but it' s sort of like we' re forming an ad hoc committee with two of us and then are then just going to further develop it and add other committee members. I think what you would do is develop your thoughts for the construct of the committee and its members and bring it back for council ratification. Yes so no committee now but we' ll be we are sent forward to come up with a proposal for committee. But we need council approval before we actually form a committee. That' s the right way to do it. And recall also we only have one meeting in July. Yeah so can we say that? Yeah I' d like to have it on the agenda for that second meeting. I think that' s the 16th. I' m just curious that it also said it will it' s a city staff time so is there do we need to worry about how much staff time? Not if it' s approved by council. I would like to have well one or two of the senior staff I want to talk to some of the city manager about who you think we should have. Oh I would gladly volunteer Mr. Veague. But between now and the next meeting when we have a proposal for the committee I don' t know if we need more than an hour of Mr. Veague' s time. Maybe we should an hour and 15 minutes so we can pre-publish that. He' s not allowed to arrange the presentation though. Well we need some guidance from Mr. Veague so it isn' t just and that' s a big job. I' ll second that. Okay. All right. Thank you. So who made the motion? Mr. Van Overbeck. Okay. And that was to authorize Tom excuse me Councilmember Van Overbeck and Winslow to come back with the plan. And that will come back at the meeting in July. Correct. Okay. Councilmember Bennett. Yes. Councilmember Morgan. Yes. Councilmember Tandon. Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck. Yes. Councilmember Winslow. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry six zero with one two. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. Mary Crawford. that will be available. Any questions? Going once and Going twice. All right. Adjourned. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Thank you.
