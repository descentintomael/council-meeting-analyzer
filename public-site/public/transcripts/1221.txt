 Hello! Hello Mr. Friskel Tater. How are you doing? I'm good. When is it? When I can see? Right here. You could stay at home and watch it online. No. That's awkward. No. I don't think that makes sense. I mean, but I... That's not very subtle. It's okay. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We're all trying to figure out what bubbly water to get. What bubbly? If only she can get through security in time. Right. Here she comes. Miss America. All right. I just saw Katie come in, so I think we'll try to get us going here. Sorry for being on a couple minutes late. We're a little earlier than usual, and everybody's getting here as quick as they can. So, Madam Clerk, would you mind calling roll for us? Okay. Council Member Goldstein? Present. Council Member Hawley? Is present. She's on her way up here. Okay. Council Member O'Brien? Here. Council Member Van Overbeck? Here. Council Member Winslow? Here. Vice Mayor Bennett? Here. Mayor Reynolds? Here. Carries seven... No, it doesn't carry yet. Yeah, it doesn't carry yet. But everyone's here. We got you. All right. Speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the council on matters listed on the strategic planning agenda, please fill out a speaker card. We have a few in the back of the room. We are going to take those first, I believe. Correct? So go ahead and fill that out now if you would like to address the council regarding just strategic planning at this point. Once completed, turn your cards into the city clerk. And once the first speaker begins speaking, we will not be taking any other speakers, and they will be taken in the order received. Do we have any speakers? We do. All right. So... So far, unless someone's filling the cards, we're not going to be taking any other speakers. We're going to start out right now. We have five. So I'll call the first two speakers, and if you can come up to the podium. And make sure you get close to the mic. Elizabeth Devereaux, followed by Bob Cromer. And you might have to just, like, lean around the board. I apologize. Good afternoon. So in terms of the budget, we're... There's a group that has formed called the Council on the Strategic Planning Agenda. It's called the Park Avenue Working Group. And our focus is on developing what appears to be developing, you know, even though we haven't done anything for it. And a lot of the development that wanted to be built in the last 30 years has been hampered by the coding. I wanted to show you something that when I was on the General Plan Task Force in 94, it sounds a long time ago, and it is 30 years ago. That we... A group of artists and architects gave input to the General Plan. And we did a plan for the Ring Transportation Corridor, which went down Park Avenue Esplanade and then looped over to Mangrove and circled back to... Well, actually, they took it over by Costco and then East Park Avenue. And along that would be a special treatment that is... Would be mixed-use housing. In other words, SmartGro. And it had transit along it as well. And I wanted to show you the photograph as I'm speaking. It's drawings that Dave Schleicher did, who was an architect who no longer is with us. He's a... He was a wonderful architect. And then some of the other places in the United States, Celebration Florida, and also Santa Barbara. And they have transit, little electric buses. Yes. And wide sidewalks, pedestrian-friendly with tree canopies. And then commercial on the bottom, mixed-use on the top, and could be affordable or luxury. Could be diverse. So that's what we have in this poster that I'm gonna show. I don't know if you need to see it up or down. I don't know how you wanna see it. You tell me. On this? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And our Park Avenue Working Group feels that... That's 30 years ago, that we had a vision for what could happen on Park Avenue. And we see there's a lot of revitalization efforts going towards downtown. And there's... Dan Gonzales has Barber Yard. This is all happening. And there are five people on the group who own property. And... on park avenue and are actually very interested in making it easier for them to develop the land that' s on there. This is what we wanted to focus on for your strategic planning and the budget. Ways to maybe simplify the code for development of the sort that we' re talking about. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. We' ll get to your picture back in just a minute. Our next speaker is jake milley. Council, city leadership, thank you. report from the local 2734 political action committee. I presented a report to each one of the council members. I'd like to read a quick part of it. The top priority of any local government is to provide for the safety and protection of the citizens of the community. An adequately staffed fire department increases public safety and community resiliency. Unfortunately, the Chico fire department has lacked adequate staffing for over a decade. Once a force of 22 firefighters on duty per day, the Chico fire department's staffing slashed to 14 firefighters per day in 2016. Staffing levels have been slow to improve since. This drastic cut to the fire department has come with great consequences. The Chico community has been directly affected by large fires, delayed 911 response times, and lack of resiliency. It is time for the Chico community to prioritize public safety and adequately staff the fire department. Every day, the Chico firefighters strive to provide the highest level of service to the Chico community in a caring and professional manner. Our firefighters are some of the best in the country, and I truly believe that, but we cannot do it alone. It is time for the city leadership to prioritize public safety, resiliency, and safety. We are committed to ensuring that adequately staffed by the fire department. Engine one is the first major step in improving the Chico fire department's depth and capabilities. The lives of our community members truly depend on your decision. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Mike Healy followed by Marty Dunlap. Good afternoon. I'm Mike Healy. I'm here with Jake Milley. I would like to provide additional context. I'm speaking again today to bring attention to our fire department's current staffing levels and substantial need for increasing our staffing and returning engine one to service in our downtown district. I spoke a few months ago and at that time I touched on the daily risk to our community when concurrent incidents or multiple incidents that require a fire department response occur at the same time. These concurrent calls are happening more frequently as the size of our community and subsequent requests for service increase. This was also addressed in the first strategic planning meeting on March 19 where you, the city council, acknowledged that public safety should be the top priority for local government and specifically that the fire department should be staffed with sufficient capacity to respond to emergencies within the community. At that time an incident was referenced in which all Chico fire units were committed to a structure fire and a medical emergency for CPR in progress was received by dispatch but there were no available units to respond. Another example occurred on April 25th with the fire at Pleasant Valley High School. I was on duty that day as the engineer on engine two. Prior to the fire at Pleasant Valley at around noon we responded to a working structure fire on Spruce Street blocks away from station two. We responded quickly and had the fire extinguished quickly but with any working structure fire or call that requires substantial commitment a fire department would be able to respond to department and requested that the fire provide the fire department resources. We initiated what is called a callback where we request off duty personnel to come in, staff an apparatus and provide depth for our department. Then later on in that day units responded to a rescue in Upper Park that required an additional callback. The fire at Pleasant Valley then occurred and even with callback personnel, staffing and additional apparatus were unable to fill the first alarm dispatch with enough resources because a second rescue in Upper Park was occurring simultaneously. Initially only two Chico Fire resources were available to respond to the fire at Pleasant Valley High School. Multiple resources from Butte County were requested including ones from Paradise, Oroville and as far away as Gridley with substantial travel time to this incident. With all Chico Fire resources committed to the Pleasant Valley fire we were We also had a callback from the City of As I stated previously this is not an isolated occurrence but something we encounter frequently and we are asked to serve an ever growing population with lower staffing than any of our comparable cities including Reddy, Yuba City, West Sacramento and Roseville to name a few. Your Chico Firefighters greatly appreciate your recognition of this issue and stated prioritization of public safety for our community. We strongly encourage your consideration of fire department staffing to appropriately respond to the needs of our community. Thank you. Thank you and our final speaker is Marty Dunlap. Thank you. I need my four seconds back. Just kidding. Good afternoon. Forthcoming to the City Council will be the recommendations from the ad hoc group regarding growth for Chico. The regional fire department is regional housing needs allocation are not mandates but it is information provided to each municipality by data from the state based on our income levels here as well as our growth projections. So the housing element and looking at the arena numbers shows that we are going to probably need about going forward in the future about a third of the housing needs allocated to affordable housing, about a third standard single family detached housing and a third middle missing housing. But you will hear more about that from this ad hoc group. What I'm here today to ask the council is to consider allocating monies that come from measure H and or the cannabis taxing money to go towards subsidizing two thirds of our housing needs because we need supplements. There's a lot of money that we need to be able to use to support the and I have a couple of examples of how that can be used. One would be to lower the cost of infill property so that developers can get that at a lower cost and the city has identified about 4,500 different properties within the housing element. Another way that this money could be used is as matching funds for different affordable housing money that is coming available to municipalities. And the last thing that I would like The last way is to hire consultants to work on street design and other projects like Elizabeth Devereaux was mentioning earlier. Thank you. she' s our last speaker. all right. With that and then we will bring up our engineer for the day. Mr. Jeff will take us away and get us through here. Thank you. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . E E E E E E! E E E E E E E which we will look at again but ultimately we came down to these as our three focused strategic goals for this upcoming near-term one year zero to one years we came up with referenced earlier safe community number two is long-term viability and the third was protect and enhance primary community assets which we're talking about bidwell park downtown and csu chico but you'll recall that if you continue to look at the handout that's also in front of you we didn't just look at the near-term goals you recall we walked through a process and basically took a funnel and threw things into the top and worked down to the bottom and we looked at long-term mid-term and then near term and the conversation that we had was that we can't get to the long term unless obviously we go through the mid-term and ultimately go through the short term and so our focus was turned to what's most important which i'm very grateful for that conversation that we had we're going to get to the end of the video and i'll see you in a moment the next step in that today, which is the objectives. And you'll see those again in the handout, and I'll put them up in the slides here. But I want to really quickly kind of talk about, again, maybe for those who are here for the first time, for those who I know have had a lot going on between March 19th and today, the process that we went through in talking about what this looks like. So I was invited in to do this strategic plan. I met with each of you council members. We had great conversation. I was really grateful and appreciative of the time you gave me because it helped to inform and shape the direction of where we headed in our last meeting. And that last meeting helps to shape the direction of where we're headed in this meeting. So in addition to looking at kind of this lens through which decisions are made, and I don't know about you, but every now and again, I need to take a pause and take an inventory of my life and say, what's the most important? I need to set priorities for those most important aspects. And that's what we've done here, as we'll continue to do today. The second piece, and we'll talk through this as well, is this is really setting the foundation for future years. This is something that, as it's been mentioned by Mayor Reynolds, that you'll look again at hopefully come January of next year. So fast forward, it's not even, what, seven months until we get to that. And you'll look back and say, kind of rear view mirror and say, what did we accomplish? Do we need to reevaluate anything? Do we need to kind of recalibrate allocations or whatever decisions are made at that time? And I think that's a really important piece. And I think that's a really important piece. You can look back and look forward through that in this current fiscal year, but it also allows you to come forward and talk through what the next fiscal year looks like. And hopefully sets a precedent for where you're headed, not just this year, but next year and in the years to come. And the beauty of this is if you do come back in January of next year, as has been discussed, there will be continuity amongst those of you on the dais, which is great. You'll have a year under your belt. You'll have a year of reference point to say, we worked on this together. How are we doing with it? You can look back and say, we accomplished what we wanted to, or at least are we on the right path to get there, knowing that we're not going to accomplish everything, as I said in our last time, and I'll say again this time. So the expectations are very similar as far as ground rules today. Everyone participates. Everyone's voice matters. Leave preconceived notions and assumptions by the wayside. We may need to add certain discussion items to what we'll call the parking lot. And my goal here today, I said last time, we're not going to accomplish everything. Today, I'm going to say, we will attempt to accomplish everything else that we didn't get to last time. This is your workshop, and then of course, collaboration and cooperation are key. Okay. So that's our process. That's where we've been. That's what we're hoping for today. We're going to add a public comment. That's the recap really quickly. You'll also recall this, and we're going to look at this again because we have done a lot of this already. Having a strategic plan is a great way to check priorities and progress. Remember to always plan the work. And work the plan. Everything cannot be a high priority and an immediate need. I think I use this every time I do a strategic plan because it's such a great reminder of what this process entails. Having goals is always a great thing to strive for, but taking into account the resources and funding available make priorities real and attainable. And that's what we're out to accomplish today. So a couple more things we came up with, and I shouldn't say we because I had nothing to do with this, you came up with, our winning aspiration for the city council, is an improved quality of civic life for all of Chico's citizens. Very simple, very succinct, and it covers so much ground. And then we talked about what's the why. To work on behalf of the citizens of Chico to co-create a safe, beautiful, joyful future that will allow current and future generations to thrive. And then of course we already talked about this with our strategic initiatives. So before we get going, I always find it appropriate, and this is a little bit of a different setup, given that you're all in front of me lined up. But I'd love if there's just any thoughts or comments from the council members as far as the process, even expectations for today. And any thoughts that you've had between our last time together and today. And then if not, we'll jump into it. If so, I want to make sure that I provide that opportunity to share those ideas. I'd just say I'm appreciative. I appreciate you coming and taking the time and doing this. And I look forward to what we do come out of today. I'm super proud of the strategic initiatives that we came up with. But I think maybe next time if we do this again, we look at setting in a different aspect other than up here on the dais. Maybe we even take it to that next step and have it be a little bit more relational and at tables and intermixing. But other than that, thank you for what you're doing to guide us through. And I look forward to the rest of the day. Thank you. Good. Good. All right. Well, let's do it. And I apologize for this noise. I'm not sure where it's coming from. But hopefully it's not bugging you out there because I'm OK with it. All right, so here's what we came up with. Our first strategic initiative, safe community. And you'll probably recall this. You've seen this now multiple times. When I came back with the council a couple of weeks ago, I shared this with you. And I wanted to make sure that you had it in front of you. And you'll notice that in this first goal, we'll call it, there are seven different objectives. OK? So vision zero, infrastructure, staffing department capacity, potholes, engine one. We've heard about that already. Police, fire, supportive policy, resiliency, wildland management, flood management, urban forest management, Bidwell Park, traffic safety, and multifaceted approach to homelessness. If I can add one small little piece to this, my 16-year-old son just got his driver's license on Monday. So a safe community is all the more important. And I think that's really important for a 16-year-old. I trust him, and I trust most people. But I've also been involved in a car accident in the last month. So this is, I think, timely in some ways for that discussion. So safe community is there. We then had long-term viability, economic strategic plan, continued sound financial policy, steady investment in streets and roads, land use reform or smart growth, follows general plan, infrastructure, accessibility, support of the university, explore housing policy, and then we go down. We go code changes and supply of developmental land. Again, I hope that this looks familiar, because these were the ideas that you all came up with, right? And then the last one, we had protect and enhance primary community assets. And I know that she's not with us today, but this idea, this overarching third goal was Jen McCarthy's. And she said, what if you worded it this way? And the 10 that came with this, attract workforce, diverse array of businesses, work to make downtown more attractive and appealing, Bidwell Park, roads, pools, neighborhoods, restoration of parks and greenways, visual enrichment, large art projects, support the university in their endeavors and look at new opportunities, affordability, transportation, and strategic partnerships. Now, I know that you can read those all yourself. And I could have just put them in front of you and said, let's talk about it. But I hope that as you hear them out loud, you're noticing that there are seemingly some potential interpreted redundancies there. You probably heard similar things in similar ways. And if we said, oh, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. And we said, OK, we're going to be very strategic. We're going to be very succinct. We're going to be very specific. And even using the same word in three different ways is also redundant. I get that. And at the same time, the emphasis is important, because what we have here is good, but it's not succinct. And it's not specific. It's overarching. And it's kind of a catch all. But what we want to do is take it from 10 and 8 and 7 down to three or four, because that becomes more manageable. It becomes more reasonable. And it's much easier when you're looking through your glasses to say, do these three or four things actually, are they accomplished in that goal that we're out to accomplish? So I mentioned this last time. We'll come back to all of these. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. I don't know who wants to eat elephants, especially if they're dipped in coffee. The cookie looks good. But that's the idea, right? One bite at a time. And so we come back. We come back to this lens. And what's going to help us with that is smart goals. And this is like the age all. I know, Dale, we didn't talk about this. I know you don't like SWOT analysis, but I hope a smart goal is OK. Because it's OK. All right, good. This is Dale approved. We're doing smart goals. Yeah. And that's even interesting, too, when you think about it. We are out to work smarter, not harder. And I don't know about you, but when I try and say that old adage, I oftentimes default to work harder, not smarter. And I wonder if there's something in the human psyche that's wired into us that we just naturally initially work harder and not smarter. And that's why we have to work to be smarter, not harder. And so we want to do that. We want to work smarter, not harder on this. We want to look at these. And you've probably seen these before, those in the audience. You've probably seen these before. This is not new. I wish it was original to me. There's probably some revenue or some residual that could be paid out. But smart goals are very simple. They're specific. They're measurable. They're attainable. They're relevant. And they're time bound. What we don't have an opportunity to do today, and I'm not out to have us do this, is come up with specific dates that we want things accomplished by, because that's more granular. And we can do that later. But what we want to do is more of a macro zoom out to say, is this something that is time bound? So if we wanted to add x, is that something that we would be able to do by a certain date? So asking those really intentional questions. Is it relevant? Does it matter in this conversation? And sometimes you might say, that's a great idea, but it's not relevant. And so therefore, it doesn't fit into at least this conversation right now. Is it attainable? If we wanted to do something that just seemed absolutely breathtakingly amazing, but completely unrealistic, then we probably wouldn't want to include that in the process either. Is it measurable? And really, when I look at that, the question here, how will you know you've achieved it? But it goes back to the question we talked in last time, is how do you know you'll have won? How were you successful? And if it's this ethereal idea that says, oh, no, we were good. We're good. We didn't have the data. We didn't have the backup. We weren't able to measure it, but we know we were successful, then sometimes that's not good enough. So we want to make sure that we're measurable. And then is it specific? So again, these ideas that are really kind of in general, they don't always help the conversation. So what I want to do now then is I want us to look at this first one, safe communication. And I want to open it up now for conversation amongst the seven of you. And I want us to kind of, just like we did last time, work through a funnel. Look at these 10, starting at vision zero, or I'm sorry, seven, down to multifaceted approach to homelessness. And we know the overarching idea is safe community. But using this framework here of SMART goals, we want to ask, are these that? Does that make sense? But before we even get there, I want us to look more specifically at it and say, where is there redundancy? Can we fold things into each other? And I don't want to put words because you're going to see this and understand this in different ways than I might. But I want you to think through, do these fit as standalones? Is it too much? Is it not enough? Is it not specific enough? So we'll start there. And what my goal would be for this is to whittle this down from seven, and maybe we even get the A, Bs or A, Cs. Maybe we can get the A, Bs, Cs, Ds out of there, because that is specific. Maybe it's put in parentheses. But I want us to think about, what are the top three or four specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timely objectives that you know, you can confidently say that in the next zero to one years, this will make Chico the desired goal number one of safety? Does that make sense? Jeff, what is vision zero? That was one that we had. That was one that I had brought up. And I will just point out that I think that could very likely be combined with infrastructure and traffic safety, because it's a multifaceted approach to traffic safety and achieving a goal of zero deaths on our streets. I knew there was going to be another answer, but I was going to offer a second. But that practice right there, in a lot of ways, is what we're out to do right now, is to take and say, we have these seven, we have a B. So obviously, to me, three and four obviously go together, because staffing and police and fire, I mean, that's basically, so three and four, however we reword them, are one. So are one and six. Yeah. Yes, that's what Bryce was saying. Yeah, one, two, and six even. Council Member Goldstein, sorry. We're casual right now. Sorry. All right. Thank you. So that takes out one, two, six, three, four, and then five and seven. Anything else that can be combined? Or maybe . Well, when we are combining three and four, I just want to ensure we do have a multi-department approach to that. Not that it's necessarily bad to name specific departments, but we said potholes as A under three for a reason, and that has a direct correlation with public works. So I just don't want to lose that element when we're combining those two. Absolutely. And you'll look at this, too, that vision zero, what did we say, one, two, and six, vision zero, traffic safety, those really do go hand in hand. At the same time, potholes are not just a single department. One thing that podem effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Clarification, so are we trying to come away from this by essentially just coming out with a list that's maybe just four goals or are you saying that we'll keep all of these in here for future reference? My goal is that we come away with three to four specific objectives that make that goal number one more reasonable, more optimal, so to say. Okay. Yeah, good question. So if we have seven things to work under, under safe community, we're never going to get there, but if we have three, we can probably stay on task. That's right. Yeah. And I think even as we talked earlier and you said last time, if everything's a priority, then nothing's a priority, right? So we want to do everything, but we all realize that we can't do it. We need to do the most important things that help us support that goal statement. So number seven, anytime anybody talks about homelessness, there's always a question. You know, we talk about all this meanly-mouth stuff that goes around because nobody wants to confront the reality of it. So as it relates to safety, if we're going to make the community safer, the homeless people need to be off the street. Now, whether that's in a shelter or in jail or in rehab, but they can't be camped in our public spaces. And so the way we're going to make this place safe and the parks safe so your kids can ride their bikes is to get the homeless people off the street. Period. They can't camp. So we haven't combined that in anything. So you're saying that's a standalone. I don't know if it's a standalone or not, but certainly it's a product of policy and a supportive policy. And that's how I would look at that myself. And it's by far the most important issue for people in Chico. When you ring doorbells and you talk to people, that's number one, two, and three. And you will recall, too, that in our conversation in March, I can't remember who it was exactly that said it, but the statement was, we hope that in whether it's two or four years, that the hot-button topic of homelessness is not the most talked-about topic in Chico. So, again, you'll start to see that if that's our goal for two years out, our midterm, our long-term, then we realize that it's really important to deal with our short-term support. Anything else that you can see? Let's combine. I mean, this does get us down to four, if we do it that way. But does that water down anything? I think it's kind of what the topic is made. We want to make sure there's a multi-proper approach to this, correct? Can resiliency be tied in with the Vision Zero and infrastructure? Because if we're properly taking care of our infrastructure, are we not taking care of the wild land, the flood, and the urban management in Bidwell Park? I mean, it's a question. I don't know. It might be. And I think we, I agree, Mayor. We have to have resiliency included. However we do that has got to be a huge, significant part of our priorities. It's resiliency. It's all those things and more that are listed right there. My preference would probably be to have transportation and resiliency essentially be separate, unless we're going to really define those underneath picking them out as objectives. And we say resilient infrastructure includes, transportation safety, and all these other things. But it sounds like a lot of things to include in one objective. That's good. I think infrastructure is, I mean, it applies to all these. Because even with police and fire, we're talking about infrastructure needs as well. And so it doesn't need to be like its own thing. It's more like infrastructure plus staffing for this transportation, traffic safety elements, resiliency that comes with like our flood control systems and the wild land management, fire prevention and stuff. And then, yeah. Those two, I think, cover the entire project. So, I think, that's the infrastructure. So, now we're saying that we have one, two, and five combined, potentially. We all like buckets, right? We all like things that are clearly compartmentalized. And so, some may not like that. It may not have the operate. But in this case, it's really good and I think important that that be part of what we're doing. So, it's very specific and focused. Yeah. Help Jason. Well, to me, the infrastructure and resiliency are different buckets. And in one sense, I think, that's the infrastructure. I think, you know, when we talk about resiliency, wild land management relates to fire, flood management. These are things that are risks. But so are traffic accidents, right? But I'm in trouble articulating why they're different. But I think infrastructure and resiliency, my brain jumps to a different set of things when I hear those two words. Is it because the words themselves or what's underneath the words? Yeah. Because when you think about it, infrastructure might be a little bit more complex. And I'm just throwing some ideas out here. That might be a little bit more measurable, right? We can increase sewer or roads or fill potholes. Resiliency is maybe a little bit more nebulous because it can cover so many things. So, it might even be that maybe resiliency is not the right word for us to use. We all know what we're talking about there. But is it just an issue of the terminology, perhaps? The way that I'm seeing it is when I talk about traffic or transportation safety and infrastructure, tying into that, it's more, I guess, like, how do I say this? Like manmade within our control. Like we're designing the streets. And then resiliency is being resilient to the impacts of things like fire and flood that might be beyond the control of our city. All right. So, good conversation, but we're still not exactly clear on what we need to end up with our three. Well, I'm seeing the four things, essentially. The transportation safety. Transportation or traffic safety. The second one we did, homelessness and resiliency. Open to other opinions. You said seven and five, then, is your thought? Sorry? Combine seven and five. Are we getting more or less complex? No, I wasn't. Sorry, I didn't mean to combine those. Oh, not combine, but seven and five. No, I'm seeing that we're at least in agreement on boiling this down into four things. Okay. And I might have heard boiling it down into three if I'm not sure. Three or four. Okay. I mean, my shot that I have is that we have police and fire, which is like an infrastructure and staffing matter. We have transportation safety, which is partly crosses over with staffing like traffic enforcement division. But we're talking about infrastructure, but our manmade, our human environment. And then we have like natural resource environment where we're talking about fire and flood risk primarily. But this also is urban forest management at Bidwell Park. And those three things. To me, make sense. So then what you're, so let me go back. So you're talking about public safety, police and fire. Yeah, I mean, public safety is a nebulous term itself. But when you mean police and fire, which is staffing and infrastructure, right? But if you had this as kind of the objective under that, so making sure that staff properly and all different things that come with that. And then you have the manmade, people made infrastructure. And then you have more of the resiliency component. The natural aspect. We have those three would be kind of the objectives. That's what you're saying? Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. So including that police, fire, staffing component is supportive policy. I want to make sure I include that. Because we can staff the departments all we want. But if we don't support them in policy, they can't do their jobs. Sure. Yeah, if I, Jeff, if I can just reinforce something that I think Addison said. I think separating, thinking about infrastructure as manmade, you know, sewers, roads, etc. And resiliency is dealing with natural threats is a good way to think about it. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah. I think it clarifies really well. Thanks for that. So, so you're arguing for Council Member Winslow putting the homelessness item in with other items here? Or how do you see that? Honestly, homelessness is like all over the place. And I think separating is specifically a safety issue. It doesn't really accord with me when it's like it's equally within like, I'm talking about preserving our assets. It's like not having people camping in the waterways, right? You know, long-term viability. I think, I mean, we know that that undermines like the appeal of the city and the university and all that. So I see that as a thread going through all these. And I don't know that I see, and especially when we're talking about like what are we doing the next year? Probably not everything that we want to do when it comes to that. And so it makes sense to not like isolate that as if we have an action plan when our action plan is even more nebulous than anything else we're talking about. Yeah, good. And Council Member O'Brien, if you talk about supporting policy, would it make sense to fold in as we look at the this large homelessness issue and the policies surrounding that as being part of what we're talking about in the public safety aspects? I think it gets back to what Council Member Van Overbeek said. That's how I would include that. Do you agree with this? I always agree with mine. So I think that this is... I'm sorry. I was just going to say to be sensitive though to what Council Member Hawley said though. I'm not sure if public safety is the proper... So if we're combining three and four, actually what we're talking about is staffing and department capacity. Under staffing and department capacity is police and fire and then there's public works and whatever. Because if we just call it public safety and police and fire, then we're not talking about the potholes and the public works or whatever other department needs staffing. But I think the staffing and department capacity and making sure we as a council... going into budget season understand what each department needs or what they're requesting or what they're asking for. If we don't understand that then under that staffing and capacity is those different items. That's how it's in my head and addresses the concern of forgetting. And it may be next year it could be a completely different department. It could be we could lose Barbara. God no. You can't go anywhere. And then we have a crisis in finance. And finance could be on top of police and fire. Because if we're not going to get it right. fiscally sound and responsible and have somebody amazing like her then now all of a sudden we got a new fire for lack of A better word to put out Yeah, I would say you just vocalized what was going on in my brain so I Just know I Just want to make sure that we do I mean this is all under safe community But I just want to emphasize that we should make sure when we're speaking of all of the items under this that we are focusing on The safety aspect, but yeah, never mind Just because if we well why I brought that up was we might be labeling the transportation safety as just infrastructure Which to me seems a little more vague, but I think once we get into the details of it We'll get back into what makes that safety oriented But that that exercise along to get us from where we were which none of these are wrong But it's bad. These are all fantastic right? But we just got a lot more specific and there's ways that you measure this and even putting names That situation saying we don't want to lose That's a very specific Objective to make sure and not just Barbara, but the many partners I believe the excellent staff that's carrying the city and doing what it needs to be done. we want all of that retention and we want traction. So we want business to stay and new business to come. We want all those things. We want current roads to be in good shape and we want new roads to make sure that they're strong and stable for the future. So it's yes and, or it's both and, it's all or nothing. So again, I've been working on my hand writing and I hope that it's a little bit better this time because I didn't sleep last night because I knew the mic was going to make fun of me during this conversation. We'll give it a C plus. All right, hey, that's better. Didn't I get an F last time? I did. So, all right. So we're going to go snap in the parking capacity here and I'll write this up again and I'll give you part two to document. Okay. So any other final thoughts on this one? Do we land in a good spot? Is there any disagreement or do we feel this is a good way forward? I think it gives lots of- Sorry, we were having a side conversation hoping that you could pass that message to- We've raised communications in PG&E and Cal Water about the current- Anyways, sorry, that was a side conversation. So if I could just sum up where I think we're at. I mean, so it says there like staffing department and we're talking primarily police and fire for the safety aspects. We heard like policy is also an aspect of that and then infrastructure and I feel like we're talking primarily about transportation infrastructure for the safety aspect of it because natural resiliency also covers our flood control systems. Our wild land management, fire prevention and all that. And that I do feel like it's adequately covered in that. Yeah, and I see opportunities where these will overlap each other. Absolutely. So the other aspect that we look at too oftentimes and we did this, but a lot of the conversation we did get, they did come out earlier, was we did look at the strengths and we, I think, could go around very easily and look at what are the strengths this is? What is it that we do well? What attracts people to the city of Cedar? We also acknowledge there's some weaknesses. We didn't specifically do that, but those items have all been talked about. And so one of the other exercises that you can do is tie back to these three that we're going to look at just in our safety community and say because of our strengths, we are going to do this. In light of our weaknesses, we will respond like this, right? Where are opportunities? We will do this to respond. And what threats are we responding to? And if you go down and you look at the all of these are discussed in the last 15 minutes, you address all of those aspects without doing a full analysis. And you got the same results. So I guess kudos to you. Any final thoughts on this one? And I will make sure it's typed up and communicate properly and share it with you for this first one. We good? Good. Great. Let's move on to number two then. And we're now looking at long-term viability. And you'll recall that we spent a lot of time even on this kind of overarching description of this goal. And we landed here. And again, I don't know how veto power works in the city council, but you all have veto power if you don't like these words or titles that we're using. So I don't know if I can get permission for that veto power, but I just did. Sorry, Debbie. So Mark said that, so I did. So let's do the same exercise here. Long-term viability. You can see this in front of you. Economic strategic plan, continue to sound policy, steady investments in streets and roads, which Council Member Goldstein, to your point, we'll see a lot of overlap here. But they might mean a little bit different too, right? So you're prioritizing that. What does it mean on that side for a safe community? But it also means what does long-term viability look like? I think Council Member Winslow, you mentioned that you are really, you're following the general plan. I think it was your comment from last time, correct? Infrastructure accessibility. We support the CECGCO, explore housing policy, and of course code changes and C5 . So why don't we go through the same process and look at these. Let's start with where are there redundancies? And you might now want to consider where are there redundancies that go back to our first goal of safe community? And if there are, and there are, is that okay? Or do you want to make sure that it's isolated? I think the word that was used, the thread that kind of cuts through all of them, maybe that's okay in this case. But let's look at this and say where do you start with redundancies? And then is there ways to condense this into three or four? The obvious ones I see are one and two can be combined, as well as three and six, and four and eight. And when you bring up redundancies from the previous goal, what I'm seeing is infrastructure and . Okay. And then I see that there's a lot of study investment in streets and roads. And I do think it is worth keeping in goal two just because having major funding for infrastructure and major road development doesn't mean that it's viable long term. That's just the way I see it. So yeah, I disagree. I think one and two mean very different things. An economic strategic plan is how do we attract industry jobs? Number two is really budgetary. You know, how do we manage the annual budget process in a sound way? And they're very different things. I had one which was, so four and five. So Councilmember Winslow and I are on the co-chairs of the ad hoc growth and community development committee. And one of the things that I think is important is that, and we're just wrapping it up, and one of the things that we found and that we agree on is that the general plan, and by that I mean specifically the 2030 General Plan, capital G, capital P, is a very good blueprint for our growth. And we don't think it needs, I mean, these things have to evolve as a natural process, but it is fundamentally an excellent document. And that conflicts with number four, which is land use reform smart growth. because the smart, the principles of, that's a smart growth people espouse are incorporated in the general plan already. And so I would argue that we take out four and leave five. But that general and the plan be capitalized and it refers specifically to our 2030 General Plan. Do you think it's fair to combine four, five, and eight? Yeah, that's what I had. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, and I find that land use reform is kind of the key there because we should already be following the general plan, and that land use and housing reform four and eight are, you know, potentially the same thing. This is super minor and small, but under 8B, that seems like it should be developable land, not developmental. I don't know what developmental. Proof that my handwriting is bad. Yeah. Developable. Developable land. I assume. I assume. We all have kind of assumed it, but I just wanted to. Redevelopable. Gotcha. Or it's really smart land, one of the two. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe it's both. So four, five, and eight then. Four, five, and eight combined. Council Member Ben-O-Beck, I want to give a chance for Council Member Hawley. The distinction there, you said one and two combined, but then there was some further explanation as far as why those might be different. Yeah, that makes sense to me. I won't die on any hill. I don't mind effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively that will could change every year because we might be hitting a different goal of a different target that we're trying to bring of a new business or new you know whatever it is so continuing a sound financial policy because we have money to pay our bills yes correct yeah some of these I mean the sound financial policy steady investment these are like holding the course and not really requiring us to change things well I think an economic strategic plan does imply that there's an element of innovation that we're looking at like drawing that kind of thing which does require potentially changing things or making investments that we're not currently making are we good with combining trade sets investment streets roads infrastructure assessment yeah it does make a different I don't think it needs to be there because it's mandated by the state you know we have to do that do it that way anyway and that's the way we should do it so I don't think we need to say it necessarily my guess is that that's summarizing a conversation that I can't fully remember like access in the community to destinations via our infrastructure that's more what I remember talking about and I would say it's really steady investment in infrastructure and all that goes along with it yeah yeah so then we can get rid of six yep because your accessibility if I'm sorry your accessibility if I'm not mistaken actually is I think what you were in your ground zero that safe and accessible walkable workable drivable and bikeable chico so that's the yeah yeah so Jeff number seven is oh sorry yeah number seven is almost the same as number three under twenty five strategic initiatives protect and enhance primary community assets we have bidwell park downtown CSU maybe maybe this is a good place to repeat that right but I would also add and low yeah yeah! wait are we are we we we we are we are we we are we are we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we So I think that needs either a different title under long-term viability. It's support of whatever. Would that not be part of our economic strategic plan is supporting elements like Chico State, like Sierra Nevada, just name these key components, Enloe, all those, right? Isn't that part of that? So we would include then seven at all with number one. Agreed. Perfect. And then that takes that one off and gets us down. But, Madam Mayor, the university's budget, I believe, is in the range of $300 million. The hospital is in that same category. And Sierra Nevada, those are the big, in the city, of course. Those are the principal institutions. That was my point, is us calling out and just using CSU doesn't give justice to the other drivers. And I want to credit. So maybe it's a word that we encompass, top sales tax or top employers or whatever. But every business that's running a business out there and working a bazillion hours a week, they think they're important and are important to our community. Well, any economic strategic plan that involves the city of Chico would include those elements. Yeah. You'd be an idiot not to have those included. So I think maybe we wordsmith that a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. And as we said at the beginning, you tell them what to do. Right? I'm working on the project until it's done. Yeah. And so we go back and wordsmith things and make sure it's right because we want it to be done right. Right? So I love saying this all the time. Good, fast, and cheap. You can't have all three. Right? So sometimes you only get one. Yeah. So, yeah. All right. So we've got economic. Economic strategic plan as a standalone. I'm sorry. We're including those seven. It's kind of part and parcel with that in addition to all of our businesses. All right. So the keeping is the sustain as the attract for long-term viability. We then have two as a standalone. Continued sound financial policy. We have three. City of West Montresor roads, which really is three and six. Correct? Because we just did away with six. Right? Mm-hmm. Six. Investments in that. And then we have, what did we talk through? Five. So four, five, and eight were combined into one. Correct? Yes. So we have one and seven. We have three and six, which is becoming one. Then we have four, five, eight. And then we have. That's the economic strategic plan. It's in support of CSU and low, et cetera, institutions. Correct. So we have two. Is it two standalone? Yes. Yeah, we have two standalone. Yeah, sorry. So then we have one, two, three, four. But actually we don't because seven and. This one's off. That's up in number one. Yeah. So we have one and seven. We have three. We have four, five, and eight. And we have two. Yeah, so now you're down to, yeah. Yeah. So there's four. If you want a suggestion to fold them in, I think that sound financial policy implies that we have consistent investment in our strategic plan. So we're not going to go down the streets and roads that they're not getting worse and worse and worse. That's, yeah, just like maintaining staffing levels. That's just an assumption of what we should be doing. If we're not doing that, we're failing in our financial policy. And I think this can be combined in a way. I think in some ways it's good to just make sure that these are highlighted by having something that important as our infrastructure, as its own objective. Yeah, I think that steady investment in infrastructure is a key piece. At the same time, always continuing our sound. Sound financial policy. Sound financial policy of investment in infrastructure. I think it's a standalone. We have to have sound financial policy in every aspect. Every aspect of how we do business. Because unfortunately, we learn the hard way of what happens to investment in our streets and infrastructure when we had no money and all of a sudden we're making choices of. Absolutely. Yeah. You know, hard choices. So, it doesn't necessarily tie. Yeah. And again, Councilor Wiesel, I'll use this thread that goes through. So, that's the important component. And every single one of those impacts the other one. Right? There's 11. So, one goes up, a number goes up. And one goes down, there's potential that goes down. Right? So, these are not isolated goals or objectives. They're all supporting the whole. which is why we spent so much time getting to the why and what is the true aspiration. Because that really frames this, and in order to accomplish that, we have to have all of these different aspects in place to get that. And even if it's not explicitly stated, it doesn't mean that it's not of vast importance, right? We may miss obviousness or an idea or something like that, but that doesn't mean we're ignoring it. It's just something that we fold into and acknowledge or have a conversation in place to include. So I will work on this again and communicate that. Any final thoughts on long-term dialogue? Feel like we're in the right direction with this one? Okay. Okay. We're looking, swimmingly ahead. Nice work here. And then the last one, this one's a little more, numbers are obviously larger. Protect and enhance primary community assets. Again, we can read through these, but attract more. Workforce, anniversary businesses. Works make downtown more attractive. Goodwill Park, neighborhoods, restoration parks, greenways. Visual enrichment, large-scale projects. Support CSU Chico in their endeavors, looking for opportunities, affordability, transportation, and strategic partnerships. And probably just as I say those words, you hear a lot of connections there, right? So let's start the same process, the redundancies, and then we'll start folding it into three or four. I think generally it's gonna revolve around downtown, the university, and then parks and greenways. And strategic partnerships and attracting the workforce. I think working to make downtown, I think it's a good idea. And I think it's a good idea to prioritize in two, seven. I think you said that right. Okay. Yeah. I am curious if number one is already covered in goal two. With both economic strategic planning, continued financial policy. I feel like attracting a workforce and diverse array of businesses is so clearly tied up in that. But there could be a conversation I'm not remembering from our last meeting that made that a specific part of goal three. Yeah, I think I would probably agree with that and I think it can also still be reflected in all of our Objectives under goal three like making downtown attractive and appealing and such So move number one to be 1a of gold to Just eliminate it But it part of that I like the verbiage on it and I like you know that I do to Put putting out the importance of it But move it up to part that being part of the economic strategic plan because if you've done it correctly you're gonna attract a Workforce and diverse right business sure yeah, I'll keep that wording around So that's gone not gone, but it's moved And does can art the visual enrichment large art projects Can that be tied in With downtown I mean it's yeah only downtown that would be throughout the community But I think when it comes to we're focusing on things if like if we're going to take a little pot of money We're gonna say we want to enrich visually the city. I think we're probably doing downtown It makes sense to prioritize that I think so two six and seven Potentially I would also combine three and five essentially, that's parks and greenways Absolutely Yeah, when when you're done I have one Yeah, I'm seeing The probably four and nine probably four eight and nine could be combined into something involving planning you know with neighborhoods and affordability and transportation those seem like falling more under like the planning division domain of planning for connected neighborhoods and planning for you know things like historic preservation and Corridor studies things like that And maybe You just do neighborhoods for the preparation or something else that better And then does strategic partnerships does number ten I don't remember who brought that up and why it was there But does that again go back to? The economic strategic plan, but was that partnerships with what I don't know that's a question So or maybe we just drop it. I don't it doesn't I don't know that it fits Would it be fair to say though that this whole goal? that can enhance primary community assets is in and of itself a strategic partnership Correct in all of those aspects of the city I think I think it's fair and that we work with the university obviously work with the DCBA and PBID all the time and then with the park we have like our volunteers out there and stuff that are really key to our Community and I think that's a key to everything that we do I Just don't see how it fits with anything else and I can't remember why it's a standalone so to me drop it Yeah, I think it's blended with all the others and It's with threaded within so Jeff number one strikes me as a result of doing a good job of protecting our community assets not a goal in itself so I mean We're not gonna start with a department of attractiveness and go on and Attract workers and businesses they're gonna come here because they can afford a place to live They love them in it the parks and they love the downtown and and it's it's just you get the Chico vibe, right and and Attracting businesses and workers is a result of doing those things in my mind I think you should take it out. Yeah, we moved that up to under the economic strategic plan Yes, under long-term viability And in gold to before this we were talking about businesses and and low and supporting those and I know we we put that under an objective there, but I was wondering if we're trying to incorporate that with things like Here in number seven support CSU Chico Yeah, did we want to bring in any of the things related to Enloe, etc into this goal So we're trying to incorporate some of the things related to Enloe, etc into this goal No opinion just wondering Seeing none, it's not I Mean so you're saying we should apply the same logic That we did earlier in goal two for long-term viability to number seven of course And then we're going to be looking at goal three rather than like naming our one I don't know that that's how I would describe it. I just thought I had heard and when when we were discussing goal two That I might have heard an idea of putting some of that emphasis into goal three on Protecting enhancing our primary community assets and that those community assets might include things like major hospitals businesses things like that alongside CSU Chico but if we've covered all that and goal two already with the Economic strategic plan then don't need to worry about it When I try to imagine like what's going to be the policy implications of these things I think that it's mostly already covered what we're gonna do to support and low and these other businesses are these things we've already talked about We take out number seven it's already covered under two Yeah wordsmith and reward I mean we all love Chico State again, I'm not I think we were trying to identify the Primary community assets. That's what I remember going through Chico State Downtown Bidwell Park. I remember us very specifically talking about Those elements and you know I I think it's tough to keep it to three because we have a lot of community assets and I don't want to exclude some in favor of others But if we're trying to distill this down into something that is very Tangible I look at parks and rec Neighborhoods Chico State or downtown and key businesses. That's how I look at this Agree with that so would seven be renamed something like support Major tax revenue I'm not coming up with the right word. I just think there's an honest way to idea, but not the right word I tax contributors, but had to because we lost we are going to lose some, you know, but I just large economic into some of their anchor institutions I said hospitals hospitals universities that really it's like the town would be different without them And it's single institutions as opposed to downtown which is like a lot of different property owners and businesses I kind of thought the primary community asset was sort of a synonym for that anchor institution Yeah I think So I have parks and rec Neighborhoods, I think neighborhoods are key to this community. We cannot forget our neighborhoods Chico State Downtown and key businesses and I think that encompasses what you guys were just talking about I think that's five but it's very specific It's very full of business and it's very specific It's very compartmentalized and there will be crossover. But at the same time you can't help So parks and rec neighborhoods University downtown Chico key businesses I Mean those five out those gems as we come through those are the things that are absolutely worth protecting And enhancing because those build towards a long-term city and part and parcel of those two, you have to have a safe community for all because that's the thread that fits into these other goals as well. So we good with that? I like that list. Alright. So that's just a really simple exercise but we got down to much more specificity which I think is super helpful for us. So now we won't do this today for the purpose of time but as you kind of go into these next conversations that take place, as you're sitting down and looking at this next budget for this fiscal year and I'll write this up, I'll get you updates and we'll actually do track changes in case there's things I'm excited to or whatever make adjustments as necessary. We want this document to be something that doesn't stand alone just as a zero to one. This is the employee work that we're making out. It sets the foundation so we can build it into years two and three and eventually years four. We then have, as I said at the beginning, we have the continuity amongst the council members as you go into this next budget cycle and you're doing this in January, you reflect back on it. We have something that's concrete and specific. It's not nebulous. And you say, did we do this? You'll recall I think last time I put this up here, don't treat a strategic plan as prophecy. If 2020 taught us anything, we know that's the case, right? So the last time we had a global pandemic was what, 1919. So 101 years later, we see this take place. And we all had plans and I remember, I had all sorts of plans and I still remember the day in my life March 16th. I think we were together March 19th. It was March 16th when I went home for the next year and a half. And if anybody would have told me that was going to take place, I would have said no way. It would have altered all of our lives. And so as we think about these plans that we have, there are so many things that we have that we can't do. So many factors that play into ultimately dollars that revenue comes in, revenue goes out, staffing, all the different things we already talked through. And so it's really important that yes, we know what we're aiming for, but we are very intentional to, within reason, hold things loosely. Knowing that things could change at any given time, at any given moment. I think in some ways, we even talked about that last time. So just as a gentle reminder, I'm sure this is a statement of the purpose of your plan. Did we do that during this time? I think so. From my vantage point, from my perspective, I think that even if you weren't in the room, obviously there's a lot of individuals in the same sheet, but they were not here last time or this time. But it's available to all to then look at and say, do I understand the purpose of this vacation plan? I would certainly hope so. It's very specific. I think it's very measurable, potentially. It's very attainable. I don't think there's a lofty goal by any means. Right? We're not shooting for the stars. We're doing things that matter to this community, that matter to people. And the only reason the community exists is because the people can make the community. We want to protect them. We want to have an opportunity to stay. Not just stay. Currently those who are here. We want to attract more people. I think you said, Council Member Bamberg, last time, you wanted your grandchild's little ride-their-mind to be part of it. And that seems like a very simple thing, and yet that's a crucial, important element to the safety of our community. Are we doing that? And I think it's very clear that we're doing those things towards that end. Make sure your plans and timeframes aren't really crowd-pleasers. I don't know about you, but I hear crowd-pleasers. I heard, hey, we're here to serve the city we love. You all said that last time. You used words like joyful, beautiful, beauty, place that people want to be. You're not trying to please crowds. You're trying to make a difference. So I think that, check. And you encourage a culture of feedback. I love this process. For those who are here, the numbers are smaller obviously now. But that you give opportunity. I know you have to. But I still, I appreciate that you give opportunity for the public to make a comment on this. That they can come and they have those three minutes. That's a, I think that's an amazing aspect of the Blue Network process. And they get to do that in population. And thoughtful assent. They're not always going to agree. And in fact, as is testimony, I'm sure if you look at the past transfers of previous meetings, you're all of Germany. Not all of you all agree all the time. And that's the case, right? There's something very healthy about organizational dissent that takes place. Especially when there's discussions that occur to make sure that we understand. And we modeled that really well even here. It wasn't, hey, you're wrong. It was, I disagree. Here's why. And an opportunity to then speak back and say, hey, that works. I'm good with that. But it wasn't just shut down. And I appreciate that. I appreciate that about this process. And then the most important component here, I think, is for you to think about this plan as part of daily life. Now I know that probably you more than many, maybe not most, but many, are thinking about the city and the future. I wouldn't say definitely not more than the city staff because they're living and breathing that every day. But the citizens, they like to live here. That's why they're here. It's the vine that you talk about. There's something special about this place. I was at a birthday party on Saturday. The parents of a colleague of mine, they went to Chico State. Their son went to Chico State. When they bought their house, they found a house on the same street and they bought the house. And they told their son specifically, when he got done with his university degree, they said, don't ever leave. I think that's a little selfish because they wanted to have somebody in town to come visit. They were in college 30 years prior to their son. So there's something, it's that common thread that stays. So for us, as we go forward from here and make these vital decisions that impact every single citizen in this city, this is the opportunity to say this is part of our daily life. Because we know it's bigger than just us. It's for those, depending on what sign you read, on what direction you come into the city. It's either 105, 110, 110, I'm not sure how many hundred thousand people, but they're all impacted by these decisions. So I applaud you for the work that you do because I think this is really having a good support. So I think the collegiality. The collegiality you're seeing here among us is a reflection of the culture of the town. I really do. And, you know, we have our sort of lunatic fringe bomb rock throwers, haters, right, angry hater people on the fringes. But we just have a few of them. And you go down to the Bay Area and that seems like it's 10% of the population. So I think it's a reflection of the town. The way we treat each other. Well, I know that it's noticeable what a big difference it makes the way that you interact. And so it makes actually, not that it really matters, but it does make my experience working with you all of a margin. That's how great that is. So we're at a couple minutes here at the end. I asked yesterday, I know Debbie and Angie said, we get done early. Are there any council members going to be mad at me? And they said absolutely not. So that was my aim. But here's what I'm going to do next. I'm going to put together a document with updated language. I'll learn some of the sub-takes that we talked through. Give you the updates. And then while this is important head work, the real work takes place with now what we're doing with it, right. So that burden of responsibility rested and squirrelly on your shoulders. Now that we've done what we've done, now that we know what we know, now that we've said what we've said, how does it impact everyday life? So I'll get that to you. I'll probably send it through. I'm sorry. I'll pass that on to the council and then continue to work until we have a final document. I think you said you were going to put it on the wall and that was going to be what you were going to look to. And that's the lens that you're going to see this next year through. To say does it fit within this? And if it doesn't, it doesn't mean you should just shut it down. It means you have a discussion and say it doesn't. So explain why it's important for us to consider that. That's both internal to the conversation but also external to the discussion. I was going to say. You gave us a hell of a lot of responsibility a few minutes ago with your comments. I accept that. And I think we can do a really good job of fulfilling those obligations and those commitments that we make sitting here. So thank you very much. This was very, very good. Very informative. Very successful. I agree. Very, very successful. I can second your motion on the don't ever. I brought my daughter to come to work day the other day who's living in Oklahoma right now. And she told me the day before she was leaving that they're coming back. So after not having my granddaughter for two years, she's coming back. And my foreign exchange student who I hosted from the Czech Republic for a year is also coming back to visit from the Czech Republic because he loved Chico and had such great experience here. So it's a common thread. So. Good. Good. Good. Well, I think our work here is done for now. Unless there's other thoughts. I will bid us adieu. And I don't know that I'm the one that gathers this week. But certainly my work is done. I think we're excused until we need to come back in at 5 and do roll call again for closed session. Well, actually what I thought we could do is if you wanted to go ahead and recess to closed session, you can grab food. We have a long lengthy. Closed session? Yeah. So if you do it now, it's on the annotated? We don't need to do roll call again because we're all here and we've got a strategic plan. So, okay. Then I will. Do we have any speakers for closed session? Because it's early. I don't believe we have any for closed session. But if you could read the items that we're going to go in and talk about. So I will recess into closed session and dinner. And on closed session, we're going to discuss public employees evaluations for the city attorney, city clerk, and city manager. Conference with labor negotiator regarding CPSA, Local 39, and Chico Fire Management employees. Existing litigation, Believe in Chico versus the City of Chico. And existing is Warren v. Chico. And do we have any council disqualifications? No? Okay. I believe we do have one on Believe in Chico. Council Member VanVleet. Van over back. Because of where I live? Correct. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So one disqualification. And we will then adjourn to closed session and dinner. Come back in at 6. Yep. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. There's less not on the agenda. Should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the chambers. Once completed. Turn in your cards to the city clerk and speakers are taken in the order the cards are received. Once the first speaker begins, no additional cards will be taken. Persons demonstrating boisterous, rude, engaging in otherwise disruptive behavior will be called to order by myself or the city clerk. If such conduct continues, the mayor or the city clerk may call a recess requesting removal of such persons from the council chambers and or adjourn the meeting or take other appropriate actions, which we haven't had to do yet and for a long time. So we're on a roll. Okay. And now we'll move to invocation. Is Mr. Alan harris here? Yes. welcome. thank you. Let's pray. Thank you, god, for this country where we have the ability to have local government. And we pray your hand will be upon this meeting and have peace in this room and good things for our city would be accomplished tonight. And just keep doing it. Working it. work together in Jesus name amen um pledge of allegiance where are we please rise salute salute close session announcement Mr. lamb. thank you Madam Mayor earlier this evening the city council recessed in closed session all members were present with the exception of council member van overby who recused himself from item 2.3 believe in chico for items 2.1 the city council provided input direction no final action on that item provided no final action was taken.

I'm so thankful that the last council, some of you were on it, put forward the Holocaust Remembrance Day resolution in January 2024. I'm here to highlight that May is Jewish American Heritage Month. I'm here to highlight that May is Jewish American Heritage Month. May is Jewish American Heritage Month. May is Jewish American Heritage Month. A time to celebrate more than 370 years of Jewish American contributions. Contributions that have shaped every corner of our nation, from science and medicine to the arts, the military, and the Supreme Court. Jewish Americans have been loyal citizens, advocates for justice, and champions of freedom since the first group arrived, fleeing persecution in 1654. However, it's also important to address the reality facing the Jewish community today. Anti-Semitism is surging globally, and right here, even in the United States, we're seeing a lot of people who are not Jewish. Even locally, in the United States, anti-Semitic incidents have risen by nearly 300% in the past year alone, peaking just last month. Nearly 60% of American Jews have changed their behavior out of fear, and 90% say anti-Semitism has gotten worse since the October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks. One-third have been personally targeted online, in person, in schools, on our streets. This is not just a statistic. It's a warning. Misinformation about the war between Israel and Hamas is fueling a dangerous environment, where anti-Israel protests sometimes cross the line into anti-Semitism, justifying terror, erasing Jewish suffering, and rationalizing violence as resistance. This is not activism. It is complicity, and it must be called out for what it is. Jewish American Heritage Month is not just about celebration. It's about education, vigilance, and standing up for the values that make our nation strong, freedom, justice, and respect for all. Our city must be clear there's no place for hate here, and we must be clear that our nation is not just about the effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively I' frankly ashamed and disappointed in the city' s approach to addressing the safety of our citizens. I want to thank representative Katie holly and Bryce goldstein for taking a firm stance on the further militarization of our police department. When I see the city' s long and tired approach of continuing to throw more and more money at the police despite it being ineffective for decades and it is not a good thing for the city. I now. It feels like as a community we' re slamming our head into a brick wall over and over again it makes me think a lot of council members are disconnected from what would provide true safety to the citizens in chico. When I think of safety I don' t think of 71 patrol rifles, sniper rifles, armored vehicles, drones, 23 single-shot launchers or 47,000 rounds of different lethal munitions. I think of providing housing and shelter for those in need! The consensus was unanimous among the citizens present. It was to provide more shelter and housing. Yet shortly after that meeting, we continued to terrorize the homeless population with violent sweeps, two of which I'm aware of, after the meeting. With just the increase in the police budget this year, which was $600,000, we could have built two new shelters. Many of the council members want to enforce what they call illegal camping and throw the most vulnerable among us in jail for the crime of not having a place to live. Not only is this morally reprehensible, it is fiscally irresponsible. The cost to house a prisoner in California for a year is about $132,000 annually, according to CalMatters. And we have to pick up those costs with our tax dollars. Also, private prisons can continue to profit off of modern-day slavery. This council needs to do a better job of ensuring the safety of all citizens, not just those of us who are financially well off. And the last thing I'd like to say is I would really appreciate if many of us could do the same. I would really appreciate if many of the council members would condemn the ongoing genocide in Palestine funded by our tax dollars. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Andrew Merkel. This mic goes sideways. Good evening, members of the City Council, esteemed guests, and fellow citizens of Chico. I stand before you to address critical issues surrounding the impact of both fentanyl and methamphetamine in our communities. These substances are just not a public health crisis. They are tearing the very fabric of our neighborhoods, harming our families, and perpetuating cycles of addiction that are all too common. Let's face the hard truth. Governor Gavin Newsom and his administration have allowed these crises to escalate by promoting subsidized housing and issues the lack of proper oversight. We've seen an influx of dangerous drugs and criminals and elements in our street. Methamphetamine is now available for as little as $100,000. $120 an ounce wholesale and fentanyl sold by a few dollars a pill pose a dual threat that we must confront head on. Consider the example of an individual who represents the harsh reality of a lifetime of methamphetamine use. The man who sits on the bench directly in front of the old boba shop. I've spoken with the shop owner, and while it's important to recognize the shop serves a particular clientele, the consequences of addiction are evident here. The individual has essentially made a mistake. He made that bench his home. It's disturbing to see him engage in behavior that impacts not only his life, but also the experience of others in the community. He defecates under the nearby tree, and it seems to maintain a steady supply of meth every day, which speaks to the persistent challenge we face in addressing substance abuse. The situation is emblematic of the broader cycles of addiction that compromise the well-being of our community. Families often find themselves trapped in a lifestyle defined by drug use. They are often forced to take a break from their work. podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem policies enabling drug use and exacerbate our challenge. We need to push back against these trends, reclaiming our city from the grip of drugs. I propose we take immediate action by such putting up signs on Highway 99 and 32, encouraging citizens to report drug dealers. Encouraging them, offering rewards for actionable information can empower our community to take a stand against the criminal activities threatening our safety. Together, we can fight back against fentanyl, methamphetamines, let's create a community where families are safe, individuals can recover, and everyone has a chance to thrive. It's our responsibility and that Chico is a place free from the shadow of addiction. Make Alcatraz great again. Thank you very much. He was our last speaker. All right, 4.1, hearing on a resolution declaring weeds, rubbish, refuge, and drug use as a way to protect our community. We have a motion to approve the resolution to allow for the use of weed and debris to be a public nuisance. Ordering abatement and removal, setting a deadline for abatement, and providing assessment of the cost of the abatement. Ms. Charlene Durkin. You've pretty much said it all for me. Good evening, Mayor, Council Members. As you recall, on April 15th, the Council adopted a resolution declaring weeds, rubbish, and refuge to be a public nuisance which must be abated. This is part of our annual weed abatement program, and it's conducted in accordance with California Government Code, designed to reduce fire hazards. After the April meeting and notice regarding tonight's hearing was mailed to the owners of the parcels that are listed on your staff report, tonight we recommend adopting the resolution before you, which overrules any objections to the previously adopted resolution, establishes June 1st, 2025 as the last day for voluntary abatement, directs staff to ensure the abatement of any items that are not voluntarily removed, maintain an accounting of the costs that are associated with this effort, and provide counsel with a report, and provide support of the costs to be recovered from property owners at the July 8th City Council meeting. I can answer any questions you might have. All right. Any questions of staff? Council Member Winslow? I'd like to check in because we do this like every year. About what was the voluntary compliance rate in the last year, last couple years? We only had one property last year, so I'd say like 99%. Cool. Usually have pretty high compliance on it. Thanks. Thank you very much. All right. We will open the public hearing. Do we have any speakers? We do. We have one, Bill Monroe. Okay. Bill, I barely recognized you. Yeah, I know. Nothing like having open-heart surgery to make you lose weight and cut your beard. So, yes, and I'm kind of sneaking this in here a little bit because it is related to rubbish and trash. And by the way, I saw the goat. I saw the goats out on Lindo Channel. It was wonderful to see them. They did a very efficient job, and I hope that that continues. But a source of a lot of rubbish that people complain about, of course, is homeless encampments. The way to get rid of and reduce homeless encampments and the concomitant trash is to provide them with tiny homes. And I hope that you all will move the council. I hope that you will move the council or the city staff forward to get the tiny homes project that I know Charles is working on and chap and all of them. It's a really good project, 60 homes. No reason why it can't be done. Thank you. He's our only speaker. All right. Interesting crossover with bringing up the tiny homes in this. If you look at the list of the properties year on year. We have a lot of properties that have been cut their weeds or have rubbish piled up. It's mostly empty lots owned by LLCs and trusts that we every year send a letter to in order to get them to cut their weeds. But they do it themselves almost all the time. So that's good, at least. I'd move to approve the resolution. All right. We'll close the public hearing. Second. I have just one question on this. You probably have these dates down to a science, I'm sure, and I'm not second-guessing your amazing work. But. With the date being so late, most of us in here have animals and foxtails are the vein of our existence. Is there a way to move this forward or earlier at all so it would be cleared before they actually turn into that or is it a fine line? Sure. I totally get where you're at. If they mow too early, they're going to have to mow again. So the reason we kind of usually stick around June 1st is it's not going to grow back. If people cut in the beginning of May or in April. It's going to we're going to get some, you know, just enough rain that they will grow up again and they're going to have to do it twice because they have to be under six inches. So. And how do you guys determine these properties? Is somebody actually driving around? These are vacant lots. So it's just all vacant lots? Yes. Correct. These are all just vacant lots. We've had this list running. It reduces every year with development. Like when I first started, we had over 500 lots and now we're down to just a little over 300. So. And if there's a home in a neighborhood, let's say that's letting things overgrow. Do we? Are we proactive? Are we actively searching those or is that called in by complaint from neighbors? Call it in. Let us know an address. So properties that are occupied, it's just a regular code complaint. Okay. It's a regular code violation. We deal with them all the time. There's not a time of year associated with that. I'm asking because somebody emailed me and asked. So I just wanted to get on the record because one person had the question. I'm sure somebody else does too. So any kind of overgrown yards or growing into sidewalks, that's something we do on a regular basis. On regular code enforcement. They can call that in all year round. Anytime. Call it in. Email us. Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you're doing an excellent job. Thank you. Okay. All right. We have a motion and a second. Thank you. Okay. Council Member Goldstein. Aye. Council Member Hawley. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. And Supervisor Durkin is doing a fantastic job. So thank you. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Carry 7-0. And some of these staff members we only get to see up here once a year. So we have to, you know, give them kudos when we only get to see them once in a great while. Charlene, we see you a little bit more often. All right. 4.2. Hearing on resolution amending the city's fee schedule. Are there any ex parte communications? No. All right. Heather Childs. Come on down. Good evening, Mayor Reynolds, Vice Mayor Bennett, council members. Before you tonight is our annual request to amend the city's fee schedule. It's according to our budget policy and our municipal code. The fees are adjusted annually by certain inflation increases. Those are outlined in our report. The inflator column on the exhibits, those correspond to the index that is used for that particular fee. Exhibit A lists any new fees or changes to existing fees that were requested by departments. Exhibit B lists any new fees or changes to existing fees that were requested by departments. The memos in exhibits A1 through A5 explain those requests. Exhibit B lists the requests that require a public hearing. Changes were discussed and presented to the finance committee on April 16th, and the committee recommended forwarding it to city council for approval. And if they are approved tonight, the fees will go into effect on Monday, June or July 7th. All right. Do we have any questions for Ms. Childs before we let her go? Council Member Ben Overbeck? Yeah. So I'm the chairman of the finance committee, and this was presented at our April meeting, along with a lot of other fees. And I am concerned about 50.010, which relates to the transportation fee for impact fee for housing, small houses and apartments. This increase is 24 over 24 percent and would add $3,000 to the price of a single family house. That's just for this year and just the transportation piece. And $2,500 to the price of an apartment. Mr. Winslow and myself have been on this ad hoc growth committee for the last eight months trying to figure out how to make housing less expensive here. I'm not saying it's incorrect. I'm just saying I want to. I want to take another look at it carefully with a focus on this particular issue. I respect the work that Ms. Martin and her staff have done, and I know they're using HCI index, which is very volatile. But I would like to refer this back to finance so we can take another close look at it and get back to the city before July 7th. Okay. So let's. I think that's kind of a motion. Yeah. We will take public input. Well, I would push that into a question of. So we did receive a couple letters from some development industry folks suggesting that because we're undertaking a full nexus study. So like reevaluating like what projects we need to be funded with these fees. And they suggested that we postpone it. I'm curious what would the impact be of postponing these fee increases and thoughts on that. I thought that was kind of a you thing. Brendan, I'm just looking at you. Looking at you. I'll take the hint. So like anything, costs go up every year. That's why we have inflationary indexes. The HCI index is based on transportation related projects, which comes from Caltrans. Whereas the CCI is a building industry construction cost index increase. That's based on building materials for vertical type of structure. So not really related. And so it's based on actual bidding of projects. And so as that figure shows. Costs are going up. So if we don't collect that, we're in theory, I guess, under collecting for the costs that we collect the revenues for that fee program to go towards the projects that are intended to mitigate the impacts of development for. So obviously it's a capital decision. But that would be kind of the parameters or impacts. So these indexes are by their nature backward looking, right? I mean, they look at the last year and say, here's what happened. They can't. They don't predict the future. So what? What happened last year was that the price of oil was in the high 80s. There was a spike in the price of oil. Most most road projects are pavement or asphalt. And now oil is down in the 50s. So that's one of the things I want to look at was that spike in the price of oil. Did that cause that big jump in that index? Because it's not they're not it's not consistent with other indexes. The other indexes are a couple of percent, three, four percent. Yeah, again, it's specific to roadway projects and prior years. Then it would have had that same lag. And so I believe in some prior years there was no index increase when there was increases in the CCI. So it seems to kind of go both ways where sometimes it's higher than the CCI. Sometimes it's lower than the CCI. Okay. So is there any other questions for staff before we take public hearing? Go ahead. No, I was just going to say I received the same correspondence from building officials as well to to be clear. I'll wait for public comment to comment on Tom's. I think what's going to be a motion. All right. Let's open the public hearing. How many speakers do we have? We have two. Okay. All right. Katie Toma followed by Bill Webb. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. fee would go from $138,000 to $170,000. These fee increases could very well disincentivize new projects or even budding entrepreneurs from opening a business. For residential building, the transportation fee alone would increase by nearly $3,000, as Mr. Van Overbeck said. The storm drain fee would go from $3,000 to $6,000 per developed acre. Of course, these fees will be passed along to the homebuyer. The National Association of Home Builders reported on March 3rd that in Chico, for every $1,000 increase in costs, 101 households are priced out of the market. Based on the proposed increase, that would price out nearly 300 households in Chico out of the market.

I don' t have a whole lot to add. What' s in my letter to council is basically our organization we' re not opposed to a fee but 25 percent is outrageous for a one year time period. I talked to several road excavating contractors underground contractors today concrete contractors and nobody has seen a 25 percent spike in their material and labor. On top of that when we' re going through the last update seven years ago with brendan and his staff probably the most contentious item at least from my perspective was the use of the hci the highway cost index compared to the cci which is a construction cost index that's what we're index that's published in the engineering news record out of san francisco. The enr or the engineering news index is widely used across the state of california. In my research I did not find one jurisdiction that used the hci index to inflate their fees. Maybe it' s more accurate but I just question why nobody else is using it. 25 percent I think we' re asking for is to send it back to finance maybe the bigger ask would be to postpone increases for a year or two until the update is completed. Let this be the kickoff party for the new nexus update I don' t know. But coming out of council member winslow and council member van overbeck's housing committee there' s a couple key findings and recommendations that we' ve got to find a way to make housing more affordable. More affordable to build more affordable to produce easier to produce. It seems like we' re always pushing back on the engineering department the planning department the building department because all that' s coming at us are increased fees increased regulations some of that comes from the state so it' s not their part they' re just doing what they' re been asked to do but we' e got to find a way to make building housing easier. And by adding excessive fees is the wrong direction. there' s any questions for me but I' d appreciate if we could get this back to finance. thank you that' s it. all right we' ll close the public hearing. who wants to? I have a question for miss martin. okay. do you know what the if we delayed implementing these fees what would the impact be to the city? I think it would be do you have any sense of that? that' s hard to say. what I was going to suggest is if these fees specifically do go back to finance that the rest of them be approved as is just because we do have a 60-day waiting period before we can implement a majority of them so that will delay increases for the beginning of the fiscal year that are planned. as far as individual fees their impacts that really depends on when people are going to be paying those fees. is that something you could get back to us on at some point? well I just don' t know who is going to be coming into the planning department or the engineering department to be paying for fees. I' ll talk to you about it tomorrow what my ask is to make it more straight. thank you. so what I' m hearing you say if we move forward with everything else are you talking everything in the 50? I' 010 all the way to 50. my objection is the transportation impact fee which is the $3,000 per house and the $2,500 per apartment approximately and that' s in 50.0.0 but that we go ahead and approve everything else. that' s the big one. yeah. and I' m going to say the storm drainage fees are separate from that. m going to say it' s 50 through it' s all of those. well we could add the storm drain fee into that too but on a per house basis that' s not a huge impact but going from something like $11,000 to $14,000 that' s a huge impact. agreed. the storm drainage fees is per acre so it depends on how many houses were built on that acre but I have a question for you. I also notice I have made a copy of that one too because the last finance committee meeting which I' m on I was questioning some of these increases I was concerned about them you made a suggestion that maybe we should hold off for a while which wasn' t very well received but I' m glad you' re bringing this back because I think we need to look at it again and at least understand it. I' and I' m glad you understand and be fully responsible for our decisions knowing that maybe these increases are correct and we might be going forward with them anyhow but I' m not comfortable and I have to be comfortable. Madam Mayor are you ready for a? hold on I have two on this side that want to talk. I do concur with that your sentiments vice mayor. This is a affordable housing all the time and this is something that does require a deeper dive. I want to thank what I think ben overbeck will propose in a moment particularly since he' s not sending it to internal affairs so thank you for that as well tom but it really does need a deeper dive we need to understand it I want to be comfortable with it too not that we don' t trust our staff has nothing to do with that but this is a significant increase to our housing. We talk about affordable housing all the time like I mentioned and this does require a more analytical approach than I' m comfortable with voting on at this moment. council member winslow. I agree with council member O'brien I' m not on the finance committee so I don' t have any qualms there sending it if you want to take a deeper look I want to remind us we have the strategic planning and long-term viability like investing in our infrastructure maintaining our infrastructure part of that whether these fees are excessive or not if you want to look into that and see if there' s a justification for them not being but I have no appetite to undercharge when the actual charges for maintaining appropriate storm drainage system requires that we charge that but it is a substantial increase if you don' t feel like it was appropriately assessed in finance committee I' ll support sending it back there those fees. I want to apologize to the finance staff who did an excellent job of presenting the fees there are a lot of them and it gets to the point where I sure if I got bias I apologize for needing to take a second look at it but we need to do that. I would like to make a motion that we approve 4.2 but that we send 50.010 that relate to the stormwater sewer fees and the transportation impact fee back to finance and debbie can we get this on the next meeting agenda for finance? finance. thank you. sorry tom did you say the storm water fees are included? that would be 50.020 in addition to 50.010? correct. I think do we have to let it go through 50.060 just to cover everything because the sewer fees go all the way to if you look at it. I don' t have it in front of me. I heard him say storm drainage fee and the so I don' t know if we want to bunch in sewer and stormwater together. I agree with that. as long as you' re clear on the motion what we' re talking about I don' t want to exclude and move forward on something that' s not covered. thank you. thank you. m hearing storm drain and transportation. right. that was my. no sewer. no 50.060. in a way saying yes to sewer. okay. and was there a second?

Those include linda channel lower bedwell park and chico creek. The reason we did not opt to add these areas was due to the lack of specificity and guidance from the state for three critical requirements. The first are the building codes and defensible space requirements in high and very high hazard areas. That would include materials and construction, defensible space, proving and monitoring of! And addressing subdivision map requirements. And wui or wild land urban interface code that is in the process of being developed and should come out in July. Second, the issue of the unknown implications that may affect homeowner insurance rates and availability as evidenced in recent years in other areas in the state and the county where insurance was dropped.! We will also consider the!!!! providing guidance on the! We have identified as moderate high and very high hazard areas once the state clarifies and provides more detailed guidance. This concludes my report and I am happy to answer any questions you may have. thank you. I just had one quick question. How will this be revisited yearly or will it be revisited once we get further clarification from the state? I don' t know. There is a lot of unanswered questions from the state and up and down the state of California jurisdictions have expressed concerns that there aren' t detailed or specific guidance for local agencies to follow. I don' t know how often they will be doing this. It' s been several years if not decades since the last one. Thank you. Are you going to develop a separate chart of what you feel should be listed and not listed? I wasn' t sure if that' s what you said. We just finished the map today that indicate all the very high areas within that incorporates not just the state maps but our cwp and cwp analysis as well as our vegetation management plan. It takes anything that would have been orange for example in this map is actually now read based on our analysis from those two documents that we' ve adopted as a city. That will be an official city of chico document that you' re preparing which will expand upon what the state is doing which seems they didn' t follow through with some of the areas that you' The city has a map that probably should be on the map doesn' it? I don' t know what their methodology was but it certainly was an oversight in my opinion that they did not assess some of those higher risk areas within the city. Thank you. You' re welcome. how many speakers do we have? no more councilmembers. we don' t have any. you can be a student. speaker if you would like. We don' t have a card for anyone. Is that too? Just quickly bill. I' m just a little confused by this it seems like there' s no context to the map. That' s just the outline of the city of chicago. I would think there should be a context about in the county and the red s the map that is presented presumably on both sides of bigwell park goes north and south from there but it' s in the county so we don' t get to see it. I think it should be a map that includes shaded differently or something but it gives it some context. there is a separate county map. the county has their own and we can tie them together however but we' re deemed with answering for the state of chicago. responsibility areas a year or two ago and this was the next phase of it was the locals. thank you. we have no speakers? none. if there' s no more council discussion I' ll move to approve. second. second. we' ve moved to approve in a second. okay. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively I carry 7-0. All right while you're there 5.2 consideration emergency ordinance and introduction of an ordinance regarding the outdoor warming Appliances with an open flame and barbecues take her away. This makes it very easy. I don't have to sit down stand up Good evening again tonight. I am bringing forward two complimentary open burn ordinances the first one is an emergency ordinance that will wait the first reading and Then the second ordinance is that will be the first reading for the permanent ordinance That will replace the emergency ordinance if passed As I stated in the staff report these ordinances will allow the city to immediately enact the necessary amendments to the Chico Municipal Code allowing for reasonable regulations to mitigate significant fire risk before the start of the fire season which we are quickly approaching As noted over the last decade city officials council members and the public at large have increasingly expressed concerns regarding our community's vulnerability due to extreme wildfire behavior These fears have merit as California particularly here in Duke County. We have experienced some of the most destructive and deadliest wildfires in US history Therefore to better protect our community and putting forward the following changes to the Municipal Code The first is adding two chapters to title 9 9.35 and 9.36 Chapter 935 will regulate outdoor warming appliances on private properties or in a park as allowed under CMC Section 12 18 point 2 3 0 Chapter 9.3 6 will regulate outdoor barbecues on Private properties and will prohibit their use on public property or in the public right-of-way Without a city permit in accordance with the California Fire Code section 105 The next the last revision will affect section 16 are 42 42 42 42.070 pertaining the prohibition of regulation of fires and flames Specifically the underlying sections in your staff report in chapter 16 are 42 0 0 7 or 0 7 0 are the changes that are shown in red This concludes my report and I'm happy to answer any questions the council may have Councilor Kite? Thank you. Thank you. There is a couple concerns I had with this one just to make sure I understand correctly with the outdoor warming appliances it says it regulates them on private property in a park but it does it only allows them there so it in effect bans the use of any outdoor warming appliance weird term in the public right-of-way like in a street or an alley or something like that. That is accurate. So because those are used to keep warm at nighttime is when it' cold that' s also when parks are closed. That' That' So for people who don' t have an indoor place to go I imagine not the effect of it would be if you' re not allowed to be in a park because they' re closed so there is nowhere for them to use a warming appliance and the effect is that people do that in places that are not visible to people which in my mind puts them at higher risk of starting a fire that' s out of control while the safest place to be would be on pavement in the public right-of-way. Theoretically yes but we also can' t adequately enforce the rules of the law. We can't enforce where they are and there are areas that are paved that would potentially be adjacent to or close by high risk areas and very high areas and we' re looking at the conditions that can cause wildfires which would be a fire that' s escaped from its location so we would have a difficult time trying to carve out areas in the public space right-of-ways and so forth. Right. Yeah I understand how that would be complicated. I mean the time that people really need these is during the winter when we' re less susceptible to fires and I imagine sometimes there would be some flexibility obviously it' s based on reports and all. My concern is that people will be hiding more to use these which just leads to worse outcomes overall. That was one concern I had. The other one is less of a logistical problem of like can we effectively enforce this ordinance but the outdoor barbecues the way I read this says that we would be banning people barbecuing in the So we would be banning people barbecuing hot dogs on the sidewalk like for fourth of July without a permit from the city. Which I' m not a fan of doing that. Again given that like on in the public right-of-way and pavement the regulations are also in here to not be using a barbecue on a combustible surface. Those things really do promote safety but saying that people can' t barbecue in front of their house on like your neighborhood street and your cul-de-sac just doesn' t really seem like the kind of regulation we should be getting into. And I was going to consider a compromise. compromise where we leave that part out of it. I have lived in places myself where apartments townhouses we didn' t have places to barbecue during the summer. It' s hot so you don' t want to cook inside and you save on the energy bill by cooking outside and not having a place to do it. Sometimes a private property may be a more dangerous location again than the pavement which is public right-of-way that we' d be saying you can' t do it and that' s a concern of mine. member brown-ilbrick. I' d have a barbecue on the driveway. if you have a driveway. yes. I take your point. Chief I believe you told me correct me if I have this number right in 2024 there were 274 fires that were the fire department responded to that were started by transients by homeless people. I' d have to look at my numbers right now. I only provided this year's because it' s relative to this emergency ordinance. we have had at the end of April 24th. thank you. my esteemed colleague gave me those. they were 2024 was 24 confirmed 274 confirmed six suspected by unhoused or homeless. right. so we got very lucky that there was no fire department that was involved in the fire department. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively The question I have is, sorry for the long-winded preamble, how are we going to enforce this? I mean, we really need to be on this stuff. I think just like everything else, we have to get the reports that somebody's barbecuing or using an illegal warming appliance in a prohibited area. So we have the same issues like in the park, for example. We're not necessarily looking for it every day throughout the day. So it would be self-reporting or reporting by neighbors or by passerbys or whatever, and then we would have to send out code enforcement to do that. Given the risk to the city, it would seem to me that we'd want to think about how we could be more proactive about this. It requires additional resources to do that in all candor. Thank you. But first things first, we need to have a functioning ordinance. That's number one. So on that, I have spoken to members of the fire department and people talk about, people report fires in the park. My understanding is that we have people go out there and they put the fire out because it's already not really legal to have a fire out there. So what would be the difference with this ordinance? It would have some misdemeanor aspects to it as well. And it would give us more authority. And it would be more effective to actually cite people for failing to adhere to city code. So some years ago, the city council made all the park code violations and misdemeanors, which includes just being in the park after late is my understanding. You could be arrested just for that. Of course, we have anti-camping and analogous ordinances suspended as part of the settlement agreement. I don't know whether, is this going to change that? It kind of feels like we're just going to wait and see. But I don't know that I understand how this is going to substantially change the practice of enforcement whatsoever. Yeah, that is the concern of mine. Quick question. Is it all kinds of barbecues? No, it's just, well, it is in the public right away, it would be all barbecues. But as for a private resident, you could potentially have a warming pit that meet those requirements. And theoretically. If you met those requirements, you could put your hot dogs on top of the screen. Okay. Can you apply for a permit to grill on your street, have a block party? Yes, absolutely. That's one of the provisions in there is we would allow for permitting. But we do that currently with private businesses. Quite frequently, they have events and we go out and we inspect it and make sure that they have the proper setup. And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively No You don't have any speakers we have two speakers we are we are through with the discussion. I will make a motion To approve second Okay, so do I need to read this? Esteemed madam clerk. Are we okay not having to do that now so percent to the Charter you made the motion to introduce the Emergency ordinance and you got a second who is the second? Second let me get that in there. I'm gonna make a substitute motion, but if you're so Before you act on that I need to read in because it's an emergency because it's in our charter I have to actually read the entire ordinance into the record not the title, but the whole ordinance So if you're gonna make a substitute motion, would you like to do that? Well now I'm not wanting will my substitute motion require you to read it twice and it could it could it could well It doesn't need to be an emergency perhaps if it's a substitute But that substitute motion would be to approve the ordinance but not to not to require permits for barbecues on public right-of-way I'll second the subsequent motion Okay, so could it I'll ask the city attorney could Could I could we? read the end? ordinance and then have a Friendly amendment to amend one section of it Yes I would recommend we just read the whole ordinance and then in the event that that subsequent motion passes you can make an adjustment to Your reading to that just that section that's affected. Okay, so I will read it in its entirety as stated So it's an emergency ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending title 9 public peace safety and morals by adding section effectively outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors outdoors city's jurisdictional limits, all local police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations. Whereas under Article 2, Section 201, and Article 6, Section 612 of the Chico City Charter, the City Council may declare and adopt an ordinance and an emergency measure necessary for preserving the public peace, welfare, health, or safety at the same meeting if passed by four affirmative votes. Whereas wildfires are a frequent disaster in California causing harm and loss to life and property. Whereas wildland urban interface, WUI, fires have devastated numerous areas in the North State over the last decade, including the Tubbs, 2017, Carr, 2018, Camp Fire, 2018, Dixie, 2021, and Park, 2024. Fires, some of which entered densely populated areas and became urban conflagrations, a fire that prominently spreads rapidly from structure to structure. Whereas the city has experienced unprecedented population growth and development, much of which has been in WUI areas and created vulnerability due to extreme wildfire behavior that spreads more rapidly, is more destructive and deadly. Whereas a substantial portion of the City of Chico has been designated by CAL FIRE to be in the high and very high fire risk severity zones based on factors such as fuel loading, amount of dry vegetation, slope fire, weather patterns, and other relevant factors that contribute to fire hazard. Whereas the City of Chico has several WUI areas, including along the eastern sections of the City, Lindo Channel, Sycamore Creek, Little and Big Chico Creeks, and upper and lower parks that act as gateways for fire encroaching into developed areas or pushing up into the foothills, affecting other vulnerable communities. Whereas vegetative fires, not in the WUI areas, as well as structure fires, that have been in the high and very high fire risk severity zones, are more likely to occur in the high and very high fire risk area. podem podem podem! podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem! podem podem podem podem effectively effectively effectively effectively Whereas winter rains promote new vegetation growth in public parks and property, which subsequently dries out and becomes highly flammable during the dry season. Whereas the new vegetation growth rapidly dries out and becomes extremely flammable and constitutes a significant fire risk. Whereas open burns on public property and public right-of-ways or in locations where conditions can cause the spread constitute an immediate threat to public peace, welfare, health, and safety. And this emergency ordinance is necessary to preserve and mitigate risk to the public peace, welfare, health, and safety. Whereas the City of Chico has experienced numerous fires linked to individuals using outdoor warming appliances and barbecues, which often occur in areas that are difficult for emergency responders to access and to limit the city's ability to effectively respond. And whereas it is necessary to enact this emergency ordinance before the fire conditions become dangerous, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, the City of Chico has also been working with the City of Chico to address the need for emergency fire safety. in order to prevent the spread of the virus, the City of Chico has also been working with the City of Chico to address the need for emergency fire safety. in order to provide adequate notice to the public and more effective regulations to mitigate the aforementioned extreme fire risk. Now, therefore, be it ordained by the City by the Council of the City of Chico, Section 1. The City Council and of the City of Chico hereby determines and finds that the facts set forth in the above recitals are true and correct and incorporated herein as substantive findings that this emergency ordinance adopted pursuant to the authority set forth under the Chico City Charter.

Section 8, the city clerk shall certify to the passage and adoption of this emergency ordinance and shall cause the same to be published or posted in the manner required by law. So the foregoing ordinance, I will now take the vote on that. Or, John, how did you want to handle that? I'm going to take the vote on that. I'm going to take the vote on that. I'm going to take the vote on that. I'm going to take the vote on that. I think effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively would not require a permit for barbecuing on public roadway. I don' t know if we need specific verbiage. I don' t see it in here. we would need some specific language revising the section you have issue with. I think what you' re concerned with is 9.36.020 allowable locations. It currently prohibits barbecues on all public property and rights of way. How do you want to limit that? I think we would just cross it out. I don' t see. I don' t know if there would be cascading consequences. Things can be held in isolation. In the same way it' s allowed on private property and parks it have to go through with the recorded limitations on not being on a combustible surface. Okay. So section 9.350.20 is allowable locations. Use of outdoor warming appliances shall be limited to private property or in a city park as allowed under section 12.18.230. The use of barbecues on public property or in public right of way is prohibited without a permit in accordance with California fire section. It' s just a fire code that says you can offer permits and just cross that section out about prohibiting it in public right of way. So we would keep the use of barbecues on public property is prohibited? I think the fact they had to specify public right of way makes me think there' e a distinction between the use of barbecues on public property on public property is not There is a difference. Sometimes the city won' t own property and feed. They may have an easement or license. I think the rights of way is meant to catch that. I suppose the use of outdoor barbecues shall be limited to use on private property in public right of way or in a park as allowed under section 12.18.230. This is really legislating on the go. can I ask the chief to weigh in and tell me if we made an adjustment to this functionally how would or would not change the ordinance that we' re trying to accomplish here? I' my only concern would be the right of way does that also include parks or open spaces? publicly owned lots? places of that nature? if it were strictly confined public use in roads, cul-de-sacs. I think maybe law enforcement may have some issues if there are thoroughfares going through and you' re having a barbecue in the middle of it. how do we parse that? I think that' s the challenge we' re going to run into. you can obtain a permit. 100% yes. the reality is nobody' s going to get a permit and I don' t think the police department will come down on it. particularly if they' re offered a beer. that was a joke. there' s a new position. seriously. that' s the disturbing part I mentioned. of course they' re going to be discerning. our role as legislators is to be discerning when we pass the laws and not give the authority to crack down on any neighborhood barbecue. it could be national night out and people all over the city with barbecues outside. how about hot dogs to share? I' m not going to support this substitute motion. the chief wrote an ordinance that' s going to keep our community safe and I' m not going to alter that. I agree. I' m going to go ahead. there' s a substitute motion and it is to enact the ordinance except for the requirement of a permit. and on section 9.36.020 be amended. it' s prohibited without a permit. and. I think it' s just strike in public right away. and strike in the public right away. a clever rephrasing could be we direct the city attorney to figure out how to implement this I think the other thing I have is from hearing what the chief said there are certain areas right of way areas that would still present a risk. it' s figuring out how do you craft it language in a way that is very specific to the areas you' re talking about while not exempting those other areas that present that risk. I think that' s the difficult part. as we heard in extensive details there are limitations in this ordinance on for example putting a barbecue on a combustible service whether it' s private property or not. we have a very very very very very very very very very very very the question is do we have the votes anyway to hash this out and could we just have this resolved over recess if we' re going to do that? can we have a vote? we need to have a vote we have a motion and a second. I want to make sure I understand what that substitute motion is and if not I' m going to go back to my motion we' re going to vote on that. the way I read the substitute motion was to amend to go with the whole ordinance except for the amendment of section 9.36.020 allow the locations and strike the use of barbecues on public property or in a public right of way prohibited without a permit. do you understand? is that okay? okay so that would be the substitute motion that we will take a vote on first. okay so council member goldstein? aye. council member mcgill? aye. council member holly? because of the feedback from mr. lamb and mr. stanstridge, no. council member o'brien? no. council member van overbeck? no. council member winslow? yes. vice mayor bennett? no. mayor reynolds? no because our barbecues in the park are on public property and I just don' t see how we get past that. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Carry 6-1. All right. I'm going to take a quick break and let Debbie get a drink of water. Thank you. We'll be back shortly. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Item 5.3. Internal Affairs Committee Street Lighting Report. Council Member O'Brien. So this came to Internal Affairs if I remember right because of a motion by Council Member Hawley. Is that correct? And we had an excellent report by Director Auduboni. Learn more about the street lighting than I ever knew. But I think the intent and I agree with Council Member Hawley was to look at that comprehensively because lighting is extremely important for a number of different reasons but certainly public safety is one of them and so I strongly support that. So we looked at this particular issue, had the report from Director Auduboni and like a lot of things we have a good plan, a really good plan like a lot of our infrastructure improvement plans. However we have annexed a lot of area we have updated a lot of existing lighting in other words we have more need than existing funding. However I believe that developing a neighborhood based street light program would be important. That was one of your recommendations at least at looking at some different funding sources. So I think that's a good plan. And to accomplish that I'm going to throw a little monkey wrench in this. I think we need to hear from our neighborhoods what areas are lacking in lighting. Something I believe in is hearing from our constituents. In another little monkey wrench I'm not going to ask that staff makes that effort. I'm going to ask that we do that. As Council Members. We have seven districts and seven representatives. That is every neighborhood in this city. So I propose we reach out to our constituents and help identify those neighbors that require better lighting as they start and then look at additional funding sources grant funding whatever to help us meet that particular goal. But I think we need to understand the need beyond what we understand today. any questions for council member O'Brien? what do you picture it looking like when the council members lead the effort? Because I'm wondering if maybe there' s a way we can have a central source that information goes towards. Like maybe a form that could be something that staff quickly creates that we can help share to our constituents. Or are you picturing more like us having town halls about it? I think we can do anything we so choose. But I think having some mechanism within the city staff that we can get out to members of the council. So we can have a community that we can share with our constituents. So we can have a community that we can share with our constituents. Certainly us getting out there and also having those conversations. I know I have driven around my neighbors. I'm sure you guys have as well. And have identified areas that likely would need some additional lighting. But I also think it' s important to hear from the neighborhoods as well. Because they may think differently than we do. I think it' s important to have that perspective. Any other questions before we go to speakers? I just had a question. The mechanism of other than maybe ringing doorbells in neighborhoods that have. My district has fairly new neighborhoods. So they have pretty good street lighting. But in the areas with older neighborhoods, avenues for example. How do you maybe just ring doorbells and ask people? I don' t think we need to ring doorbells, Tom. If you want you certainly can ring doorbells. You' re coming up on a reelection bid here shortly. So you' ll be doing that. But I think we need to do that. Before that time I think we can come up with something with staff. This is 2025 where we can get electronic communication out to our districts. And hear from them and open it up. And then have that conversation. I think it can be done in a number of different ways. But I think that' s the easiest way probably to start that. All right. How many speakers do we have? We don' t have any. Nobody cares about their street lights? Wow. I think we' re just having a lot of faith in us and figuring it out. On page 12 of the staff report there is this very beautiful street light density map. Which is if you' re looking for a hint of where to go, ring doorbells or something. You can check there and you can see where there really is a total absence of them. Noted in this conversation that sometimes people don' t like street lights. Or we' ve had some experiences of putting in LED bulbs that are a bit brighter. And then some people are upset that we improved the street lighting in front of their house. So it is good to check with people. During this internal affairs meeting I had a couple of recommendations for places to put street lights. Based on my own assessment of where is lacking in my neighborhood. And I like the idea of having kind of a systematic way of putting forward recommendations like this. District infrastructure, little niche needs that we' re aware of. But otherwise it is a consistent process of being aware of those needs in your neighborhood and bringing it forward. And it seems like we do have an ongoing process. And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively county of lincoln as I said and you have said and others have said that lighting is a public safety issue hearing from the police and the fire department in those particular areas where maybe that is lacking right now I think it' s also an important component. I want to give kudos to council member o'brien because I think having some sort of mechanism where neighborhoods are able to equitably communicate some of these street lighting service gaps is important and I wasn' t really sure how we could do that until you mentioned some methodology of staff being able to facilitate online a forum where neighbors can communicate that and then we as council members can also assist. I' m already thinking of putting flyers all over csu chico campus and all over downtown just to get as much information as possible. feedback as possible from my constituents but I' m curious about the different funding mechanisms I know there was a suggestion to maybe allocate some measure age funds. Again installation is between 15 and $20,000 if we' re not using a pg and e poll which I think in a lot of instances we won' t be able to use a pg and e poll. Even if we start with a really small pool of money maybe $100,000 to start, I t know. What is our path forward getting that either from measure age dollars or from another funding mechanism? I think what you said Mr. O'Brien was community program I' m looking at the wording again. what director adeboni called it was a? neighborhood based street light program. neighborhood based street light program thank you. that' s to help identify our needs certainly the funding part is always a tricky piece of this but it' s like a lot of our infrastructure. We have a lot of excellent long-term planning. Sometimes there' s a need to look at short-term needs particularly where it' s required in our community and looking at other funding sources to expedite that. okay. But despite funding mechanism step one is identifying those areas? that is my recommendation yes. okay. So no need to get too far ahead? not at this point. got it. thank you. are you ready for a motion? I will welcome a motion. okay. I' d like to make a motion that we approve council person o'brien' s concept of having the each city council person being responsible for identifying the areas in need of additional street lighting in their districts and report back to council in 90 days. sure. I would make a friendly amendment and a second to add some sort of collective forum where this community information is based even if it' s extremely basic. I was going to recommend that maybe I work with staff and find out the easiest way for us to set up something potentially online we can push out through mayors minute we can push out through different things but have a uniform approach to it and individually we can each do creatively whether we want to do a town hall whether you want to knock on doors whether you want to whatever you want to do but I think having a universal place where everybody can send in due and their comments that' s across the board. we need a clearinghouse. I don' t know exactly what that is right now but I can work with staff and get that done and we can do a quick report out by e-mail. sounds like friendly amendment is approved. then that' s a second. thank you. thank you. Council member Goldstein? aye. Council member Hawley? yes. Council member O'Brien? yes. Council member Van over beck? yes. Council member Winslow? yes. Vice mayor Bennett? yes. mayor Reynolds? aye. carry 7-0. 5.4 update on jackson Pollack art. did I skip one? I am? Okay, perfect. Sorry, I'm on two different pages here. Update on Jackson-Pollock Art. Ms. Presson. Thank you, Mayor and Council. As you'll recall, prior to our outgoing council members leaving last fall, we had a request from former Mayor Coolidge to honor Jackson-Pollock in some sort of fashion, referred a project to the Arts Commission to come up with some ideas to honor him, to create something but with zero funding. So we spent considerable time at the commission level looking for ways. Since you approved, we're gracious enough to approve the utility wrap, the box wraps. We thought perhaps we could put one of the wraps and ask the city council if you would be willing to at least allow me to find some funds to fund the wrap. However, since that point, we then worked, with the city attorney's office, checking on copyright laws and those kinds of things and being able to get permission to do someone else's artwork. One of the other ideas was to host, get someone to donate a building and let elementary children go and paint in his style on the wall. And that would be something that would be, we didn't have the bandwidth to do, plus the liability and all of those, so we had to go through all of those things. So I'm asking you at this point, and I wanted to bring you back a report. I think it was a great idea. There is one bench that has been made and is in his honor here in the City of Chico. And if we could take this off our to-do list, with your permission. So, the request was sent out with zero funding, like the utility box wrap program, where there's zero funding. And then we find that we just can't get it done, because things cost money. And we're a city, the city that loves art, we just can't spare a dime for it, apparently. Well, our utility box, you're going to be very, very surprised about that. It's really, it's, we're so excited. The business community is so excited about it. And we have sponsors. In this particular case, it was to create something in honor of an artist, yet with no funding. Yeah, the no funding part, I can see how that became a snag. Yeah. And so the utility box program, right, we have sponsors, the sponsors then choosing the artwork, right? So if we want to be directed about the kind of, or supportive of a certain kind of vision for what we want to see in Chico, we have to put some money behind it. And I don't know that this is exactly like the thing, you know, I think for our boy Andy, I'd like to see us do something and not just drop it. Yeah, it is a budgeting issue. And we have some art funds, right? We do this, we have, well, there's currently a grant program that's open for applications, right? But that's a very, very specialized program that is for nonprofits. And in the city and they can get up to $5,000. And then we're very, it's very, very specific as to what, who can apply and what they can use the money for. So I don't know how, unless someone wanted to incorporate something to dedicate to him, I don't see how it would come through that grant process. So the city clerk is a wonderful artist and an enthusiastic promoter of the arts. and civic art. And so if she has come to the determination that this isn't, the juice isn't worth the squeeze, we can't get there. I think we should take her at her word and have a vote and get on with it. And thank you, Debbie, for taking this on. Thank you. You know, I think that there's some exciting things you're gonna hear about from the arts commission about other kinds of projects that they're working very, very hard on with, you know, obviously we don't have any funding, but they're going to be asking us to do a lot of work. And I'll just continue for that. I think that this is one where I think it is great to honor him. He lived here a short amount of time in his childhood years. And, but it isn't something that we felt was feasible or we had the bandwidth to do and to do it right. All right. So do you need a motion then to remove that? I just. Yes. If I could get a motion that way. If I could get a motion. If I see Andrew, I can tell. No, I'm just kidding. I'll let Andrew know. Okay. I will. I make a motion to drop this and remove it from any further consideration. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Goldstein? Aye. Council Member Hawley? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? No. Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Carrie Six-One? And all that to be said, there is no stopping anything from being honored at him at a future date. This is just something that is off of your calendar for now. And if we find a way and somebody wants to fund it, if somebody has a heart for something, we would love to hear how we could honor Mr. Pollack. Maybe even a spot on the sidewalk for it or something. As long as it's not a barbecue. The people can see shit. Or a lemonade stand. Sorry. 5.0. Council Member Winslow requests airport overlay zone. Council Member Winslow? Oh, thanks. Thanks. So I brought this up. The reason I brought this up at the moment that I did is because we had a proposal to it for a project. Which, you know, to the untrained, the I untrained in planning and compatibility with airport land use compatibility plans. You would have said, why would you say no to an apartment? Of course. across the street from another apartment complex the reality is we were constrained by these other plans I got a sense there are other people on the council that had an interest in looking for opportunities to promote housing in some ways that are currently precluded by this bucani airport land use compatibility plan which is done something over 20 years ago. I suspect over 20 years ago the attitude towards the need for housing and the utilization of the land within our city was a little different than it is now. We also had this process where sites were able to apply land owners could apply on behalf of a site they have that they could get this infill exemption. While this plan what it says and what our policy says as well if you are in this B2 overlay covers a wide swath of the city all the way down to east avenue you can get around to the limitation of density which says you can have fewer than one units per acre. Because of those areas that took advantage of that we have sites being built out at over 20 units an acre in there more than 20 times what is allowed by policy which you can there is a little bit of incongruency there. Of course as we discussed over this meeting which we need to rehash there is a lot of value in having these airport overlay districts but I have excessive elements of it. I have learned from discussions with planning staff more about limitations previous attempts to revisit this sort of thing. I heard something tentatively that staff for the butte canny land use airport commission was not super friendly to the idea when it was brought up before. I think it might be a value for us to put in our two cents as a important to consider some of those limitations on housing within there. I will certainly take any questions and encourage somebody and I will ask Mr. Veague to weigh in on his experience with this issue. Mr. Veague and then I will take questions. as planners we all support infill and density. We also I think we shared with the council prior to being compatible with the plan. I share that all projects will be plans that move forward in the city that were in the overlays that even didn' t have an issue related to density had to be referred so there was an extra burdensome involved effort. It was something that was important for us to come into compatibility with the plan. We have done that through the general plan and zoning code. Not to just acquiesce but to acknowledge something we' re not all experts on and these a building or what happens on one property should be consistent for all the properties around it. It' s about watching an area potentially build out all throughout the airport. We also shared with you our concerns about the me too if you let one it will be the me to me to me to which then self-fulfilling of the concern of safety areas for planes to ditch. I' m going to go to the next question. we have fought tooth and nail. We have in fact at some point the council did do some overrules and we even shared we supported a small overrule not at the chico airport but the ranchero because it didn' t make sense. It' s bad practice. We get letters from the airport land use commission and the county and letters from caltrans and department of aeronautics. If we snub them it comes back and we have problems with the! We have argued with them during post camp fire on a different means to reach for the infill list that addison mentioned council member winslow mentioned a different way of quantifying what the median density was and they supported that interpretation which got us some higher density. We as planners have always been poking around the edges and trying to get the project. part of what you' re sharing. I don' t think they' s an airport land use commission it' s a branch of the county it' s plans for all the airports in butte county they hire consultants that are experts in this area of ensuring noise issues safety and long-term compatibility of the airport which is something we also brought to the council the importance of our airport and its longevity and hoping to bring commercial air achieving those goals so you' ve got some little conflict there. I guess a long answer to say I don' t think they' re going to be interested looking to their experts they do update the plan every once in a while five to ten years cycles those are times where we try to get more and bring up the topic again. That' s a clear opportunity for a re-opener but we can always invite them for a discussion. We could invite back the individual that came and shared their thoughts with the council I thought that person probably knew more about this topic than anybody in the room. That could happen at the council' s direction. I think you touched upon it I' ll ask a quick question if we were to snub our nose as you said at these designations would that potentially impact commercial flight service in Chico? I believe so and it would also impact future development they' d have to go there to get a there are things they still have to do. So yes. Thank you. A quick clarifying question Brendan you mentioned we could re-open this conversation when what was it you said could trigger that? When they update the plan. Which plan is that? It' s the airport land use compatibility plan. Thank you. Do you know if there' s a near term schedule do they consider that they open it up themselves or is there a schedule for amending the plan? I could check. I feel like we shared that they did it in 2000 was the original kind of the new plan that we' re kind of under where we weren' t consistent for 10, 12, 13 years. And then there was an update around that time period and then there was one here about three or four years ago. So I feel like in my life cycle I' ve been aware of three. Okay. Councilmember VanEpperbeke. It seems councilmember Winslow we need a more specific plan. I would like to ask you about the I' m not sure other than opening because after the experience with the guy that came here a few meetings ago it' s clear there' s a lot of state and federal regulation that deals with this stuff and I' m sensitive to the issue Councilmember O'Brien raised about doing anything to upset the possibility of getting commercial air service here. I think effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively the city of california and the city of california and they say it' s closed for anybody else reopening that now may have some value I was told maybe for one site maybe most of them made it in there the other would be allowing for redevelopment in some of the sites where currently I assume you can' t build if you had an apartment building that had fallen apart and you wanted to rebuild it to be higher density I think you' re going to run into issues even though that may be in an area completely surrounded by urban development that we' ve already given away to densities like over literally over 100 times what the code allows. what are you asking us to approve? because we don' t want to snub our nose that' s not a good idea we learned that we would have staff send a request which I think planning capable of managing to the bukenny airport land use commission to reconsider some of these elements consider updating the plan and responding to the needs that we have support more infill development within the city of chico. would a simple motion as something as to direct staff to at least find out when the next update is and report that back if they say it' s next year we can prepare and get ready for what we would like to see in that update or if they say it' s five years then maybe we have some specific asks so maybe sending staff to go find out what the time frame is when that update is going to be done then that could determine what the decide in which direction we' re going to go. do we have any speakers on this item before we no okay so then somebody can make a motion. what you were saying was really good I don' t know if you want to make that a motion. sure I' ll make that a motion direct staff to contact aluck and find out when the next update is and then bring back a suggestion to us and we can make a determination at that point how we want to move forward. okay. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member winslow. yes. vice mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. aye. carries 7-0. all right. council member winslow requests west avenue' s safety improvements. yes. council member winslow. thank you. this is a fun one. actually let me hear that. the reason why I bring this up is because too many kids have been getting hit by cars on west sacramento. that' s actually the least fun thing that could happen. there' s been even just in recent times and actually just in the last couple of weeks in fact the day after council member holly and I spoke with our engineering director I believe two people were hit by a car in that west sac and esplanade intersection. in general it' s a very high density area. not just in terms of housing but also in terms of the uses. especially during this drop off and pick up time at chico high. the amount of people that go from the west abs the densest neighborhoods in our city to chico state. it' s very high. I think there' s tremendous potential in putting in some good active transportation infrastructure in this area. so see the potential we' ve talked before about the concept of quick build infrastructure using sort of more cheaper temporary materials to create the effect of like a protected bike lane that later can be used for transportation and that would be a great opportunity to put in a permanent fashion. it gives you the opportunity to fine tune designs based on experience but also allows you to deliver some of these safety improvements more quickly. I think that not just is this my neighborhood council member holly also lives there but I don' t think there' s a better place in the city that we could select based on the amount of people who live in such close proximity to their destinations. where currently a lot of people do drive and reasonably enough you like look at drop off pick up time on west sacramento and tell me you let your kids bike down that road. drive down that street. There are serious repercussions for not having that kind of infrastructure. Part of it is it' s designated a bicycle route but there' s just nothing there to protect you from people who pull off. It' s not just an active danger where people actually are injured and we' ve heard stories of people being hit by cars on the area but it' s also a deterrent to people to using other kinds of transportation and that forces people to drive more frequently where you end up with worse congestion issues worse parking issues. So there were there' s two streets that I wanted to propose I like the idea of considering more broadly what we can do in general on our streets but I think these are just the most effective short term solutions we could put in west sacramento from esplanade to columbus avenue basically to highway 32 where it' s no longer our jurisdiction or infrastructure. And then from warner street to first avenue to chico state campus. And did some analysis assessment of like right of way widths and all and I determined this is all fair and square s not feasible of course there can be complications at intersections where you have driveways but it' s pretty feasible as basically a striping project with the exception of parking from hobart street to esplanade on west sacramento on one side that there' s not enough right of way to keep that parking and have the protected cycle path. And that is basically it I would like us to just give some direction to go forward with the concept to become a real plan where we put in some protected bike lanes so people can get around more safely. thank you. Again I would like to those comments. any questions for council member winslow? council member vannoverbeck? well I want to bring to everybody' s attention a letter endorsing the idea from president perez from csu. And also can I ask a question of public works director auduboni? absolutely. have you had a chance to look at this? And do you have a position on it? discussion on this and had some discussions. Definitely that is a high used corridor both west sacramento and obviously warner street. Specifically on west sacramento that is thoroughfare to chico high school and that east-west connection that ultimately connects to esplanade as well. There' s different ways of doing it. I think removing parking would have to be on the residential side. There is only parking on the residential side on the north side of west sacramento which could prove to be challenging and impactful to the residents. There' s potential opportunities maybe of doing it on the chico high side that might require partnership with chico unified. One thing I will say is recently we were awarded grant funds through the safe streets for all grant program in which we will be developing a safe routes to chico high school. We will be school master plan. We will be analyzing all of the school zones and areas around. Not to duplicate efforts but that would likely be one of those areas of emphasis or analysis given we' re doing the esplanade portion of chico high school right now. There' s a couple of different ways to get there. Some more challenging others and some more costly than others. To council other thing is simply striping you can do that relatively cheap as opposed to having to widen sidewalks and stuff like that on the opposite side of the road. don' t you hate dealing with guys like us that tell you it' s only striping? I had that conversation with you once. This seems like a no brainer to me because we' ve got college students and high school students that use west sacramento and that seems like an obvious place but a dedicated bike lane. any other questions? thank you mayor. I do agree we need to have safe back routes particularly for our kids and college students. That' s very important. I want to make sure we have a cogent plan though and it sounds like there' e a bit of a nebulous with this so I think this needs to be refined now. We need to look at all the different aspects to include the parking issues if that' s a good thing. I think we need to make sure we have a functioning plan. That' s really important moving forward. that' s really good. I did draft up a six or seven page plan looking at more details of this which I share with chico state and chico unified school district. I thought it would be a little much to send that to you all and put it on an agenda so I narrowed it down to more of a concept. But yes, very point well taken. I have a quick question. Have you talked to chico unified school district? that' s a great question. school building and opening up the campus which they have secured? yes, I didn' t even mention that in this. The concept I was looking at improvements in the west avenues. I reached out to jaclyn from facilities there and talked about that. She said they had' d not had a formal opportunity to create a formal position on this. She said generally it seems like a good idea to get people to be able to bike to school for west sac and warner as far as the proposal which you find in the report of a path crossing there. That is in our bicycle plan. It' s been in our active transportation plan. It' s been in our plans for a long time to have a path crossing there. But it does conflict with their policy. I don' t have any direction on that right now because that' s their property and we would need to collaborate with them. Maybe someday we' ll figure out a way to do that. I don' t see that happening right now and I' d rather focus on the things we can do in a short timeframe. Thank you. All right. Thank you. One clarifying question I think for Brendan on a bonnie. Just wondering what the process of this ideally would look like with providing this direction if we do so then would engineering come back to us with more information at some point on things like the costs and what the specific design would look like or would you just kind of run with that with our direction? Yeah. I think I would envision it as looking at it first, analyzing it, what our options are, evaluating the feasibility of those options and then if, for example, we did go with like a quick build type of concept that did require removal of parking that would have to go through internal affairs. So there would be subsequent actions. Again we are in the process of getting into contract with the consultant to develop that safe house to school master plan and so we might look at an efficient way of doing it as just maybe tearing off that contract and having that focused effort so we can get kind of more specific details and that might maybe be an opportunity to bring it back to the council as a whole and receive further direction. And what' s the timeframe on the safe house to school master plan? I don' t have that off the top of my head but I would imagine this calendar year will be pretty far along on that. So again we' re in the process of getting into contract right now so by the time we get up and running it will probably be summertime and then develop those plans through the rest of the year. Okay and that would just be the master plan and then from there the infrastructure projects would still have to, we' d have to flesh them out, figure out funding, things like that. Yeah and one of the benefits of having those plans is then a lot of these grant programs you need that master plan to identify these issues that then help you compete well for funding for the actual developing that would be beneficial for future funding opportunities maybe to leverage for other safe streets for all grant programs. Great information thanks. I' ll just note here on our upcoming like annual street repair projects we have currently 2032 is when west sacramento would be completely redone so this would be a temporary for six years if we can do it within the next year. All right how many speakers do we have? We have eight. We have three minutes. Okay I' m going to call the first two names if you can line up in the middle aisle. Maddie Hinkley followed by Jessie Horgan. Hi how's it going? My name is Maddie I live on citrus avenue between first and second street so I' m here to speak in support of the proposal which it sounds like you' re all supportive as well which is great to upgrade the infrastructure on west ave or in the west ave. So I drive bike and walk these streets every day I bike to work at chico state and I take my dog for very long walks twice a day through the neighborhood so I know firsthand how unsafe these streets feel not just for cyclists but for everyone. First street in sacramento ave feel incredibly dangerous drivers treat these streets as high speed throughways especially getting off the interstate at first it's 35 and they just keep plowing 35 the whole way. So with little concern for residents turning in or out. We're going to talk about the traffic safety measures. Turning from my street on to first or sac feels really scary because of how fast traffic moves so in addition to this I sort of want to urge the city to reduce the speed limit. It's 35 on first ave doesn't need to be that fast. On sacramento it's 30 but 25 when students are present. I don't think this is good enough I think it should be reduced to 25 the whole way at all times. According to the triple a foundation for traffic safety a pedestrian hit by a car traveling at 35 miles per hour is twice as likely to be killed as one hit at 25 miles per hour so lowering speeds saves lives. Sacramento ave is particularly dangerous it currently has no buffer between cars and pedestrians no curb strip no bike lane no shoulder hundreds of students and neighbors use it every day including me multiple times and it's and it's frankly a really unpleasant place to walk or bike. I understand concerns about losing street parking. If we can't get people to use the street parking effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Finally, you might have put this one aside, but I do want to express support for reopening that Citrus Avenue connection across Chico High's campus if that's possible. Without this connection, pedestrians and cyclists are forced to detour and go down Sacramento when they might not otherwise have to. And so this again is unsafe and uninviting. Reopening that pathway would restore a route and relieve pressure on Sacramento Avenue. So I think this proposal is a chance to prioritize people, including me and our neighbors and our kids, over speed and parking. So thank you. Thank you. Jessie Horgan, followed by Cynthia Par... I'm going to always massacre that. I apologize. Go ahead, Jessie. Good evening. Once again, I'm Jessie Horgan. I am the parking services manager for Chico State, and I'm also the recently appointed chair of the alternative transportation department. I'm a member of the alternative transportation committee. I have a letter that we have from the president of the university that I brought on behalf of the president's office and the alternative transportation committee, and I wanted to speak in support of this project. There is a study I'd like to cite from 2019 conducted by the University of Colorado and the University of New Mexico. For 13 years, they tracked cities and bike lanes and streets that had bike lanes. The streets that have bike lanes are safer for everyone, not just pedestrians, not just bicyclists, safer for the cars. They found that an average of 40% was the drop in injuries and fatalities on streets that put in protected bike infrastructure. The California Office of Traffic Safety puts out information on bicycle injuries and other accidents. The City of Chico had a dip in 2020. Of course, there was a lot of people staying home, working remotely, going to class remotely. But every year since then, we've been going up in the number of injuries and the number of deaths. So, it is a concern. I would like to see that number drop for students, for members of the community, including myself, who bicycle commutes as well. So, the alternative transportation committee is a little more focused on the issue. But effectively, effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively that of raising a rider. May is bike month. Geographically, Chico has long been bicycle friendly. At times, the city, in partnership with community-based organizations, has amplified what Chico's geography and climate naturally provides by promoting this mode of transportation. Leadership of Chico Velo and KZFR continue to keep May as bike month front and center with education, outreach, and bike positive events. And raising a rider extends beyond marketing and special events. And this is where the city partnership is crucial. I appreciate the thoughtful response to recent engagement by Chico citizens in these chambers surrounding bicycle safety. We'll hear more. My goal right now is to help frame why this is impactful and scalable. Having been raised a bicycle rider in Chico, I was invited, encouraged by this community, and bicycling has remained my first mode of transportation every day for approximately 47 years. I first commuted to kindergarten at Citrus School on bike through Orchard Pathways and local streets. Leaving Chico for Davis, I bicycled year-round, even for commuting to work in Sacramento, Woodland, San Luis Obispo, and Berkeley. I rode buses, too. These communities made riding easy with bike infrastructure like bike lockers, free passes with carefully located bus routes, and bike infrastructure, which supported the safety of all residents. My ridership by bus and bicycle is now being transferred to our next generation. Our three kids are learning ridership. Next month, in fact, my son and I will travel to New York City riding not a bike, a train. Since returning to Chico three years ago, I'll admit that Chico feels different to me as a bicyclist. Residents often react in horror to my mention of myself and my young children out bicycling for transportation. Chico's fantastic pathways are problematic. The class four infrastructure that we celebrated in Chico is a great example of how the city has been supported and welcomed in the 80s and on which my roommate bike commuted daily 12 miles from Upper Chapman Town to Corrette by the Chico Airport. Now there are apps to track how one's cycling offsets CO2 output, but if reducing pollutants isn't your thing, bicycling isn't just good for the planet. Its frugality also afforded me to save and purchase my first home in Chico as a 23-year-old graduate student. So, council and city staff, please do all you can to reestablish and maintain Chico as one of the best communities in the world.

But in the month of May, I observed 25 instances of a car parked on West Sacramento in a bike lane, and I had to go around it to just continue on my path. So thank you. Thank you. Mark Kessler, followed by Faith Muir. Hi there. My name is Mark Kessler. I'm a teacher at Chico High School. I'm speaking on my behalf. I'm not as a representative of the school or the school district. First, I want to thank Mr. Odubani for visiting my three environmental science classes to talk about this issue and walk the streets. I really appreciate that. And thank you, Mr. Overbeak and Mr. Winslow for replying to my email about this in September. The first time I contacted the city about this was 13 years ago when my son was going to school at Chico High. I ride to school every day. I've ridden this route over 2,000 times. It's dangerous. I really appreciate the attention you're giving to it. I would like to say that bike lane and striping is super important, but we need traffic calming as well. Four three-way stops at those intersections. We need a way for people to slow the cars down. And speed limit. I've noticed people don't follow speed limits very well in this town. So probably some sort of bulbing or traffic calming would be good. good. You know, Chico has been recognized as a bicycle-friendly city, earning a gold-level designation by the League of American Bicyclists and the America's Best Bike Town by Bicycle Magazine. However, recent data and incidents indicate that we must do more to protect our cyclists. In 2022, Chico reported 38 bicyclist injuries and fatalities, ranking ninth most out of 61 similar-sized cities in California. Between 2006 and 2018, approximately 19% of our 3,000 traumatic accidents involved bicycles. And we have a higher bicycle death rate of 4 per 100,000 than larger metropolitan areas like San Francisco. Recent accidents, juvenile bicyclists were struck by a school bus near Sacramento Avenue and Cedar Street in October 2024. In May 2024, a student was struck by a car and suffered a broken leg, and in September 2024, a student was hit by a car and escalated in West Sacramento and had to be light-flighted to Davis. So, I encourage that we... It's funny, the word fast-tracking, because Chico has been there for 120 years, and has never had a bike path. So I really appreciate the effort to do this, and it couldn't move fast enough. One last thing, I had this idea when we were talking about Jackson Pollock. You know how we put, we striped the lane and then we painted green? What if we painted it with Jackson Pollock art? Just an idea. Thank you. Faith, you're followed by Olivia Council. Good evening, City Council. My other classmate hasn't spoken yet, so I'll have to change this slightly. But, I am a current student at Chico High. I am in a sophomore class, and though I do not ride my bike, I know personally the dangers of riding bikes in Chico. I ride my bikes with my family, though not to school, but often enough where it becomes a problem at times. Too many students on bikes have been hit in the past school year alone. I may not have known these students, but I'm not sure if they've been hit in the past school year alone. But it still had a lasting effect on me and my fellow classmates. It definitely caused more pain to some of the teachers that I have classes with, and it was very hard for them to deal with, too. I wish this to change because it affects more than just people involved. I may not have known these people, but they still meant a lot because they were students at my school, a school I attend, and where I wish to be safe when I'm walking or biking to school and from it. I wish to see a change in the safety around both high schools, including PV. I also am aware of one that happened over next to PV. And I wish for this to change because it means the safety for all students at Chico High and both PV. Thank you. Olivia Council, followed by Mimi Eckhart. Good evening, State Council. As a Chico High student, I would like to address an issue. September 11, 2024, 17 year old Ron Billions was struck by a vehicle driven by a Chico State student. My classmate suffered a brain injury and an initial coma. I believe safe bike and walking paths will positively impact Chico civilians, students, and many more. Thank you. Thank you. Mimi Eckhart, followed by Rob Berry. Okay, Rob Berry. Well, as usual, I'm here to offer a contrarian opinion. I'm not here to really talk for or against bike path. This happens to be in my neighborhood, too. My bike has had flat tires for probably the last 10 years. As I understand this idea, the idea is Hobart or Asari Warner to Esplanade make a bike lane and it would eliminate approximately 58 parking places. And my point here is that there's this concept called externalities. You can't make a plan that benefits some people and then externalize the cost of that plan on the other people. Those 58 parking places are there for a reason. They're part of the legacy of that neighborhood and those cars that are currently using those parking places are not going to just magically disappear. Now, I happen to live on Hobart. Hobart Street has been the site of a large number of ADU developments. Some of them for ADUs on a single family lot. And many of those have no on, you know, they have only off-street parking. And so that road is now basically oftentimes unusable. It's difficult sometimes for me to get in my driveway because it's a narrow street and there's parking on both sides. And so whether or not you this project goes forward or not is not really so much my concern. My concern is that we have regular order for analyzing projects. Title VII and CEQA kind of give us the framework of that. And we can't argue on the one hand that we have a general plan or we have a planning process that's adequate and then on the other hand bypass that process because we have a favored project. The problem as has been mentioned by our professionals here is that every project has trade-offs. And the regular order of the planning process designed to evaluate the pros and cons of every project and try to come up with a compromise that does the best job of satisfying everyone's needs. I don't ride a bicycle. I have needs too. And so the point is if you want to pursue this project, do it through regular order. And I'd just like to point out the irony. On the one hand, we're talking about eliminating 58 on-street parking spaces. On the other hand, the person that's proposing it is also advocating to eliminate on-site parking requirements so we can have more housing. If you're going to eliminate on-site parking and you're going to eliminate street parking, where are people supposed to park? And I think it's this hostility towards cars that I think we ought to take a look at. So thanks. He's our last speaker. All right. That's our last speaker. I will entertain a motion or further conversation. Question? Council Member Hawley? Yeah, just for further conversation, I was going to say the really great thing about quick build projects like that are that they're reversible. So if parking is closed off of both the north and south sides of West Sacramento Ave, that can be reversed in a couple years if the grant opportunity Mr. Ottoboni is talking about, we get funding for that and we want to change it in slight ways. In addition to the parking issues, I do think it is worth considering that a few of the Chico High parking lots are generally underutilized. And as someone who also lives extremely close to Chico High School, I don't really want to say where I live, but Rob Berry, you're my neighbor. I do notice that although parking can be a hassle, often points during a football game or a big performance at Chico High School, 95% of the time it is generally underutilized. So we all have our different anecdotes and parking situations are different on everyone's street, but I don't think it's something that should be preventing us from moving forward, especially with a quick build project that's cheap, reversible, and at least, re trying something. Council Member Goldstein. I support this initiative. I find, I believe that safe infrastructure for biking to school is incredibly important and I'm glad that most of us are supportive of it. Also, if we're applying the concept of externalities here, I'll point out that unsafe bike infrastructure doesn't just make people who would bike to school disappear. They will drive cars and park those cars. parking lot and they will never get driven around in traffic unless they die from getting hit by a car, in which case I guess they do disappear. Anyway, we want to prevent that. I super support this. Council Member Van Overbeck. I support it too. I want to clarify something Mr. Berry said. Council Member Winslow and myself are not proposing that we eliminate parking in smaller residential developments, but that is something that we need to do. E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E the city and the city of california and we' re looking at public works engineering to come back with a plan kids are getting hurt getting hit by cars and getting hurt. It' s on a fairly regular basis here and I think there' s some urgency in doing something quickly. I concur with that but we need to have a plan that' really what is necessary to have all the information that that is a good decision and that allows us to make a sound decision quick or not. I will support your motion. part of my motion was to ask public works engineering to come back with a plan. absolutely. I propose to give definition to that looking for a quick build design to install protected bike lanes in calm traffic on west sacramento and warner. is that a motion and a second motion? who was the second? I seconded. thank you. councilmember o'brien. all right. councilmember goldstein. aye. councilmember holly. yes. councilmember o'brien. yes. councilmember van overbeck. yes. councilmember winslow. yes. vice mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. aye. carries 7-0. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively board will be sending you the list in just a few minutes and obviously as part of the public education process will be advertising exactly where these will be and they will have the required legal signage and all those things.
