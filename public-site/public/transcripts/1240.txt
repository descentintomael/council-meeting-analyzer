We have one. One. All right. Three minutes. Sam Barber? Hello. So I'm basically just here again to ask the Republicans on the council in particular to just reconsider having a conversation about making the city a sanctuary city. The lack of action and concern really concerns me and makes me feel unsafe. There's a lot of illegal and constitutional things ICE has been doing. I witnessed them take a pregnant woman's husband from her with no due process. They took him to bakersfield and they slammed him against a fence and I have not heard back from the woman and I don't know what's happened to that man and all and there's cases and and and and and and and and and and and and the U-Haul. So I'm just wondering why in particular the conservatives who would usually espouse rhetoric such as big government bad would not attempt to do anything or take any form of action whatsoever. A fifth of the population here is of Hispanic and Latino descent and it just doesn't make any sense. We all rely on their services they're some of the most important people in our community and they're valuable their human lives and we should be treating this more seriously. Again it's a constitutional crisis we're in. There is a lot of There is a fascist regime currently in office right now and some of you all are just not taking it seriously whatsoever. Some of you are trying to silence people when they're speaking up about ICE and it just doesn't really make any sense to me. Some of you have used words like regime when you're referring to the previous councils who were democratic but you do not use that same kind of rhetoric when there are people being kidnapped off of our own streets. So it just doesn't make any sense. And then the other piece I wanted to say as well is I think you owe the Palestinian community in Chico an apology and it is frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and frankly and not easy to condemn as a genocide. thank you. thank you. hearing the information from maintenance district A 55 report by brendan on a body but I see we do not have it. you have to substitute today deputy director. good evening mayor and council item 4.1 establishes maintenance district A 55 for the autumn leaf estates subdivision. it' s a 68 lot subdivision located at north and henshaw avenues. this district creates a funding mechanism for ongoing maintenance for subdivision specific improvements such as storm water facilities and landscaping. the district is also working on this district does two things when forming. it fulfills the condition of approval for the sub division and also ensures long-term maintenance for the sub division through annual assessments. staff recommends approval of the adoption of the resolution to create the maintenance district A 55. that concludes my report and I' m available for any questions. any questions for mr. gianco? no. we will open the public hearing. how many speakers do we have? ten. we will close the public hearing. I will entertain a motion. moved to approve. second. second that. give it to the vice mayor that' s perfectly fine. council member goldstein. yes. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member winslow. yes. vice mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. aye. motion carries 7-0. all right. 5.1 enhancements to the alternate campsite. mr. eric gufstason. or still for another week. director of public works and operation and maintenance director. and he' s still smiling. for now. thank you mayor reynolds vice mayor and council members appreciate the opportunity to speak with you tonight. again this is a carryover from the october 7 meeting regarding improvements to the alternate site that we can make. after the 7th meeting was determined to remain or keep the alt site as it is. existing site at the existing location at eaton and cohasset. quick overview we' re going to go over the rules code of conduct and what opportunities exist in the code of conduct. some enhancement options of the existing site livability reset and then we' re going to land on a staff recommendation with a few points. so again this is the existing site at eaton and cohasset that' s been here since 2022. that was reviewed at the october 7th meeting. this is where it is to stay for now. we kind of summarize the motion from the 7th meeting there was a motion and i believe a friendly amendment. it really kind of encapsulated answers that i believe council was looking for. what rules exist now and how can we improve those or beef them up if you will. what can we improve. some enhancements as far as cooking facilities and maybe some livability components and then a reset to stay within the assigned area. two areas which are 20 feet by 20 feet. so what rules exist now and i think it' s important to know that for a long time there were no rules. plaintiff' s counsel argued against the city' s ability to enforce any rules through early 2023. so again from the get-go it' s extremely difficult to manage the site. we had unfettered access a lot of unauthorized people that were there causing the issues so those were really spilled out into the adjoining community and caused those impacts to the residential and commercial properties that are close to the existing site. now we' re able to layer in a code of conduct which we started last summer june of 2025 to set reasonable rules and also outline kind of a violation section in due process for those that continue to violate the rules and how we will ultimately depart them. again the code of conduct is pretty basic. there' s a lot of more detail because it' behind these key points or bullet points but these are just kind of the summary bullets of the code of conduct. no unauthorized persons no violence no unauthorized vehicles a campsite size limit no dogs off leash cooking uninstalled or designated barbecue grills only. respect for others and quiet hours respect for the community failure to return to the campsite if you abandon your site and don' t return for some time you lose the site no illegal activities and then a violation to follow the code of conduct with that due process for ultimately if somebody continues to violate or have issues they will be departed. there' s four opportunities for corrective behavior. three written warnings and this is not just our partners at the jesus center staff that are out there doing work. it' s not just here' s a written warning it' s a long warning. s a long process very detailed it' s a discussion on let' s talk about this here' s what went wrong here' s what we need to be corrected and that' s what those case management individuals are doing. it' s a long process not just a quick piece of paper it' s engaged and they absolutely understand what they are getting. there' s three of those and the fourth if there' s a continued violation the fourth lands in ultimately departure from the site. these are the proposed updates to the code of conduct that we' d like to layer in that I think will bring some improvement. no structures of any kind may be added to the assigned space so this will hopefully reduce or mitigate the scenarios we see there of one campsite has two stories worth of scaffolding that' s a complete hazard that' s full of stuff. things like that we' re going to try to prohibit and keep people at their 20 by 20 site. prohibited items generators gas cans full or empty electrical cords and propane tanks of any size. this will be somewhat of some of the things that we will be! and some selective enforcement but at least it will give us a tool for the bad offenders that we can assist and get them to remove those items. there' s some pretty significant fire hazards there from time to time and adding that in the code of conduct will help us manage that. we' ve gotten some feedback from occupants at the site they want to know if there' s some potential to put maybe some animal fencing to allow their pets off leash with inside their respective 20 by 20 spots which we think would be a good idea and something we could do or allow but we' d want to have some approval process to allow that to happen. this is kind of the big one enforcing currently there' s 18 occupants those that are authorized to be there and out of those 18 we' ve updated the individual assessment for six and they' ve updated that assessment for genesis so they have the opportunity to go to genesis or the pallet shelter versus living at the alt site and that' s been done primarily because they' ve reduced their number of animals they' ve gone to the! ve gone from four dogs or three dogs down to two. Unfortunately at this time those six individuals have not gone to genesis so they' re remaining at the alternate site. We want to depart those individuals or give them opportunity to go to genesis based on their individual assessment update if they continue to choose not to we want to depart them from the alternate site because they can' t continue to stay there. It' s not a long-term solution for anybody especially if your individual assessment has been updated to genesis which is a much better living situation and get the care and services you need. That would bring the number from 18 down to 12 and that' s the objective is to really start to reduce the occupancy and the number of people there and get them into services and get them into other alternatives and a better living situation versus staying at the alt site. Once it' s down to 12 that will continue to we can really get our hands around it and we can manage it that much better with a reduced number of occupants there. We also want to push hard on the 20 by 20 space violations we' ve been pretty relaxed this summer on that. We' re talking to people and engaging our case managers are working pretty hard to do that. There has been a lot of improvements but as we all know there' s a lot more improvements to make. Moving forward we really want to have that accountability component with the spacing violations that continue and really get them down to a manageable site. There' s a property storage process that we' have to do that. We will destroy property that poses a health and safety risk especially for our staff but if we don' t want to get rid of anybody' s individual belongings we will store them at 995 first street for 90 days and allow them time to pick them up. There' s a process to do that and we want to respect their personal belongings as well. With these new rules and the code of conduct we feel that it will help enhance and clean the existing site and make it a more manageable however with new rules it requires enforcement. As we all know more on-site presence would help. That leaves us with three options for an added staffing component and expanding jesus center operations staff, armed guard, ag security staff which is our security contractor we have an on-call contract with them that we could utilize to post a security guard on-site or city staff. to highlight the options two and three, ag they' re primarily security they' re a deterrent they' re effective at what they do but they' re not going to provide any case management or engagement with these individuals and so it' s going to be difficult for them to go campsite to campsite and try to enforce the code of conduct it' s not within their scope they' re a security and security we have a security guard that' s basically a deterrent. City staff is another option we have our outreach and engagement staff person but that particular person is busy with enforcement in our clean up operations. Then of course in public works our other classifications are maintenance aides, maintenance workers, senior maintenance workers it' s not appropriate to have a maintenance worker senior maintenance worker classification staff on alternate site. That leaves us with the jesus center is probably the best option. Their case management and of course operations staff are already doing this work twice a week they' re there on site twice a week they' re well trained to handle these types of situations and of course they' re familiar with all occupants. Our recommendation if there' s an objective to enhance staffing would be to utilize our partner the jesus center who is already on site performing a lot of these duties and knows all of the occupants that are there. Comes at a cost. In a perfect world we would staff two jesus center operations staff five days per week basically in a swing shift which would be 2.30 p.m. To 11 p.m. Then we would staff ag security from 11 p.m. To 7 a.m. In a graveyard shift. We feel that that' s the best timing component of when there' s people that are unauthorized to be at the site try to enter the site even if re not in the site. We feel that' s the best part or the best coverage that would try to prevent some of the things that are happening there. Again it comes at a cost and this is five days a week this isn' t seven days a week. We were even sensitive to cost putting this out there but for the jesus center staff that' s two staff members it' d be $9500 a month or $114,000 a year. To staff it with the five days a week graveyard shift with ag security would be about $7200 a month or $86,400 a year. So right about $200,000 a year. Again we' re sensitive with added costs. We don' t have any budget identified to increase staffing there. We' re mid budget and of course we always have financial constraints so we want to maybe suggest some alternatives. I think this could be done incrementally. Maybe we staff jesus center staff there two, three maybe four days a week. If there' s an intent to have a security guard there as well at certain times we could staff them one or two days a week. I think there' s a long variation between the two. I think we' going to have to see if we can really run that to see what would be best versus just five days a week. Of course staff' s recommendation would be to implement the added rules to the code of conduct and increase jesus center staff incrementally. You' ll see that again in this slide and then again in the final recommendation slide. This slide covers the second two mentions in the motion from the October 7 meeting is enhancement of the existing site, livability and potential reset. We hear this often let' s throw some tough sheds out there or some tents which would give some uniformity. Agree but we' ve got to confirm what the objective would be to do that. Just an aesthetics objective totally understandable but even in a shelter crisis declaration if we do that there' s certain building code that would be in place to standards that come into place that we have to abide by. If we were to put a tough shed out there it would need a pedestrian door which automatically puts the roof height requirement at eight feet. We need a secondary egress door in the back so we' d have to establish some sort of emergency escape hatch. It would have to have electricity for a heating element, smoke detector and a light which is of course any time we bring the electrical utility it would be cost prohibited and the timing right now it takes a local utility to get service to a location would likely be two years. It really just becomes cost prohibitive and we have to do those items are facing pretty significant liability we installed all of those items when we built genesis and each palace shelter has all of those items that are required. Similar I hear a lot about put some uniform tents out there but I think we' d be in a similar scenario a little bit of a gray area but I' m also hesitant and sensitive to our staffing bandwidth and what it might look like if we had tents once we purchase something and put it out there we own it so to speak and I don' t have the staffing bandwidth in our facilities maintenance division to field calls like the zipper in the door doesn' t work or it broke or the tent has a hole in it now those types of things would really weight us down. There' s been a we had some discussions with north state shelter team about a pallet pad meaning a handful of pallets pushed together fastened together with sheets of plywood over the top to raise a tent off the ground that' s absolutely doable currently the sites are raised off the ground four inches with a gravel interior and four by four boards on the outside to maintain the gravel but a pallet pad cost effective we could install it on top of that and easily make that happen if that' s the council' s direction. We currently have I know there' s some discussion on cooking ability there we currently have two provided city provided park style barbecues we could certainly add more we could put another one or another two to make four total if that was council' s direction. We really think implementing the rules and enforcement will enhance the livability with the six individuals whose individual assessments have been updated to genesis and that will help with the reset option once those six individuals have moved on hopefully to genesis that will open up six open spots where we could easily say to the existing occupants we' re going to move you to this spot which is clean and fresh and we' re going to help you clean your existing spot that would give us an opportunity to reset the site once we' re able to genesis and hopefully move those updated assessed individuals to genesis or if they continue to not want to go to part them from the site. That lands us on staff recommendations for improvements. I really think we should implement the added rules in the code of conduct we should force the occupants those six whose assessments have been updated to genesis or face departure from the alt site. We should increase the genesis center staff incrementally and monitor it for several months. I believe we have the budget capacity currently to absorb some small incremental increases by the genesis center staff. Of course the short-term improvements enforce the 20 by 20 space confinement and the pallet pads would definitely be something we could do. Then return to council in several months for a review two to three months from now to see how we' re doing. That would also help with the cost assessment to if we' re increasing we could work with the executive director of the genesis center to see what that looks like as far as is it two days a week maybe three or a short amount of hours what' s the sweet spot of timing and days and then see how we do with costs and come back in two or three months and report our progress and see if we have enough capacity depending if it' s a able to get to the end of the summer and fiscal year or if we' d ultimately need to request added resources to come back with a budget supplemental and find the dollars to match the supplemental required. That concludes my presentation. Those are the staff recommendations at this point and I can answer any questions. questions? vice mayor bennett. let me move this closer. Aged security. With date the last our last meeting we decided to keep the alternate site where it is. We have a small community center across the street that has had three years worth of unfortunate events. We have a neighborhood that has problems and we have a school right there too. I' m thinking with the ag security enhancement being there more often would they also patrol the area outside of the alternate site one or is it just solely alternate site one? My suggestion would be depending on what you respond they could patrol the neighborhood as well and the shopping center and provide some degree of security there which doesn' t exist as far as I know. correct. We do have them on a once patrol but they are not if they could easily patrol several areas and I think it would be likely an incremental cost for us to do that. Absolutely if that' s the direction of council we could definitely have ag or security contractor enhance their patrols to include some of the surrounding areas and report back to us. I think as long as it' s just adding small increments it would be an incremental cost we could likely absorb. thank you. council member van overbeek. thanks for the presentation. A couple of questions when you said no structures you meant to exclude tents I presume. correct. tents are okay. no added structures outside the living apparatus. right. a tent is okay but okay. the second was at the last meeting I think it was the last meeting you said there were 10 people approved to go to genesis of the 17. the six you' re referring to is that in addition or is it six out of the 18 now total? yes. sorry council member van overbeek I don' t remember exactly I may have misspoken currently there' s 18 out of that 18 there' s six whose assessment has been updated. got it thank you. council member wenzel. thanks I think you guys understand the assignment well and the updates to the code of conduct I think it addresses all the things I saw that were immediate flags to me as far as fire hazard and I think it' s good to have the clarification on the structures the electrical cords you said selective enforcement but I assume anything allowed on a plane would be allowed out here like a charger box but these big generators I think they' ve caused fires before in our community I think that' s the most substantial improvement I see out of this. when we get down to the management security we' re looking at the cost of the management security out there it becomes like should we force six people to move to the pallet shelter where they' re managed there when we' re paying for upgraded enhancements here it feels like we then we squander more of our resources there. what' s the current status of the ag security they do a patrol at a certain time just in the morning or evening? it' s in the we were doing several patrols in the morning and reduce the number of patrols late at night morning and afternoon we reduced it down to one as a cost-saving measure once we were able to remove the unauthorized folks because the impacts by those that are occupants of the alternate site are minimal if not at all of course there' s some spillover there' s continual encampments inside sycamore diversion channel up the bike path that' s the rinse and repeat scenario where we' re enforcing offering those people shelter whether they take it or not is another story and then some of them come right back. that' s not to say those folks are not causing problems to the local areas in many cases they are it' s not the occupants in the alternate site. I think that' s worthwhile for us to emphasize that is the people around the site that are causing more issues and I' m curious mayor reynolds you have more interface with the business owners but what I heard is it' s that those morning before they open up that there' l be some problems with the local have somebody there doing something and that' s what I heard expressed in terms of how it impacts their life force and so having somebody patrol immediately before they open feels like that would have an outsized influence in terms of their experience here and it wouldn' t require us to be funding too many more patrols at least. The other thing so this is brought up in north state shelter team and their recommendation out there one was that you just put a lock on the gate at night and give the something that would spare us some of the impacts that happen overnight and not feel like we need to pay for as much security overnight? we locked the vehicular access gate which was a tremendous improvement. The pedestrian gate I would be reluctant to lock that and keep people locked inside. I understand the intent of course and it would be really hard to manage the key scenario they would be lost handed out duplicated pretty consistently. I would be concerned of the risk and liability with locking people in it. I think people being stuck in there that does if they can' t find their key that' s not very safe. I' m curious what other people have to say but thanks. council member goldstein is next. thanks eric. My first question is regarding the capacity of the site can you remind me what the total capacity is if it was full? we could easily fit 50 occupants there. Potentially more than 50 people. the capacity of the site if we expanded it to the west. right now we only have 18. I guess I' m wondering if we were to get those six people to go to genesis that' s great. We also have a lot more unhoused people around the community and we' ve been talking about that at the ad hoc committee is how do we get people to go to the services available. I' m wondering what barriers there might be to having more of the people say camped in the channel going and being accepted to a site like this. I think what' s missing those individuals would be missing at the alternate site is services and case management that happens at the torres shelter in genesis. And then what' s the end game right now due to the settlement agreement we' re not able to put a term on those that stay there we' re not able to force them even at genesis we' re not able to force them to seek services which is very difficult. I would be reluctant to do that just because of the impacts to the surrounding areas no requirement to have a term there and really no requirement to seek services. The alt site currently is folks that aren' t eligible for shelter for a number of reasons and so that' s why they' re there and we' d like to keep that as the conduit for folks to go there. We still are doing enforcement and clean up operations but have been forced to go there circumstances and we may come across a person or two that is not eligible for shelter and we need to be able to put them at the alt site. That may be a reluctancy to fill up the alt site with those that are still out there I' m not sure they would go quite honestly the folks that we continue to deal with now are very service resistant they do not want to go into shelter it' s unfortunate because it would really improve their living situation it' s frustrating. thank you for that clarification that' s unfortunate. Ideally as we improve the site hopefully maybe at a later point we can have a conversation about how we could serve people and meet them where they' re at better at this site because it' s unfortunate if we have a site where people can safely stay and then there are people outside of it causing trouble. That' s why we' re here. Let' s see if we have any other questions. real quickly council member goldstein I could add too that I think the better option too is to really focus on the transitional folks that are ready to transition out of genesis or tourist shelter into a more permanent housing situation. The consent agenda approved a grant application in partnership with the jesus center to provide some more of those types of beds. I think that would be the better route is to focus on those that are making and they' re there. There' s people that still live at the genesis that have jobs now they' s people that have moved out that particular part is working. To focus on transitioning those that are ready out of genesis and to free up genesis beds would be my preferred option versus adding more people to the old site. If that helps kind of talk to the need that you' re referencing because it' s there absolutely. it seems like there' s a wide variety of needs here but I won' t get into all of that. We can go back to the committee at some point. I also wanted to ask because last time I had brought up cooking facilities. I know the two barbecues. Have we heard from the residents there that that' s an issue and I' m especially concerned about fire safety. We' re talking about not allowing propane tanks which makes sense but I' m just wondering has that been an issue? Are people bringing in propane grills things like that? there' s some in a wide spectrum. There' s some it' s interesting where people find this stuff but we' ve seen smokers and all kinds of things at the old site. But some propane outlets that are not and the fire safety apparatus where lines are linked together and going through another person' s campsite and really just poses a pretty significant fire danger and hazard. That' s what we' re looking to mitigate. We have gotten feedback from occupants there that mixed they enjoy the provided barbecues but also of course there' s issues. Somebody is using it all the time and I' m getting my turn that type of thing that comes up. But for the most part they' ve been pretty trouble free. that' s good to know. I think my last question on livability was we mentioned the raising up tents with pallets is that due to potential for flooding and rainwater collection in the area? correct. The sites the designated sites are already higher or elevated if you will by four inches. They' re four by four timber 20 by 20 and they' Is there any difficulty with gravel inside which is designed to percolate water that comes in? The idea of building those sites was to keep them above the water situation and what water does fall on the site will percolate out. But listening to feedback with north state shelter team they' ve always advocated for those pallet pads if you will. I' m willing to try it if it works and improves the site absolutely. okay. I think those are all my questions thank you. council member o'brien. thank you mayor. Thanks again assistant I mean director gufstenson. I let that slip. As I mentioned last time we really gave you an impossible task and I think you really rose to the occasion with these improvements I really support your recommendations I' m going to hear from obviously the public before I make any motion but I may have a little edit to that but generally I really support the recommendations and I think s what you recommend I think it will make a difference and really why I asked for this conversation is to make sure we' re taking care of the neighborhood the businesses and that site none of it was safe you have done a much better job with very limited resources from us and I want to thank you for all the work you' ve done like I said and really an impossible situation so thank you. thank you. thank you. how many speakers do we have? three. three minutes each. lind overholzer with robyn mccollum. first of all I want to say thank you to all of you for continuing to discuss this issue with something I want to say two weeks ago with I only had one minute can' can't say much in one minute. So I'm going to go ahead and address that first. Although I do have another recommendation that I think would improve the safety around the alternative site. Many of you and a lot of the speakers, I understand it's staying where it is and I get it. None of the other sites on the list were appropriate either. But the reasons given, the main reason given was if you move it, you just transfer the problems from existing site to another one. And actually, really, I mean there's good reasons not to choose the other ones, but that really wasn't one of them. Just the sheer fact of moving it would have helped a lot. This site did not turn into what I call an attractive nuisance, is the legal term, overnight. It took a long time to turn into what it turned into. So just the fact of moving it would have helped. None of the other sites were in a B1 overflake zone. The B1 overflake zone is not supposed to allow residences, people living in the federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal federal the other sites, none of them possibly were across the street from a shopping center that had businesses open at night. And most of the other sites were not so secluded with all this parking on the side to just attract problems with no street lights. Anyway, I understand it has to stay where it is and I understand why. But I just wanted to say that. I did not hear tonight, I mean, and it hasn't, the car camping has really gone down which has been great. Coincidence or otherwise, I don't know. But what needs to be done is an official enforcement and it needs to be done soon and it needs to be done every time people start to come back. Some of you are right. The biggest, as you know what happened to me several times, the biggest problems I think are coming from the people who are not authorized to live there. It's from around there. So I think you need to do an official complete enforcement a quarter mile around the perimeter of that camp. There are some people. Ms. Joseph and Ms.! Ms. Joseph and Ms. Joseph and Ms. Joseph and Ms. Joseph and Ms. Joseph and Ms. Joseph and Ms. Joseph and Ms. Joseph and Ms. Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and Ms Joseph and surrounding areas around the camp the less problems that are going to happen I think increasing safety for everybody around there. I think you can save the money on security guard and just do a really good enforcement and just keep doing it thank you. robin mccullough. good evening council members it' s a big problem. We' re not going to be able to make the citizens of the city safe until we address the whole problem. Right now all our attention is focused on a single camp with 18 people in it and there are hundreds I' m not sure how many I don' t know how accurate the point in time count is but that has to be done. I think it' address it. We have to do it by providing programs, by providing safe space for the unhoused or they can get services and by building trust with them. Councillor o'brien you gave a sterling introduction to Helen harberts at the ad hoc committee. She is the one who brought the truth about building trust and how you do that and what the results are. She has the experience to back it up. This is where we' re going to have to work because just putting people at eaton and cohasset is not going to solve the problem. We' re ignoring the largest part of the problem which is the people outside of the camp. So mayor Reynolds if you could make that a point of order. I think that is a great a great recording available to the other councilors. Excuse me for assuming that you haven' t all heard that. But I think it' s very important to hear it. And if you would I would like to be able to listen to it again myself. Thank you very much. thank you very much. thank you. m very pleased with what Mr. Gustafson just said because that really I think encapsulates a lot of the things I would like to see happen at the camp. I' m with north state shelter team I' m also a semi-retired psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. I have to take councilor overbeek to task a little bit because you said the camp was full of 290s registered there are two. There are two people there. One of them committed a crime in 1996 has not committed a crime since then and he was about 18 or 19 when that happened and has not further been arrested or had any difficulty. One of the things that' s happened too is that you all want the trash to be taken care of. The two big trash dumpsters are gone. Now they have one there were the two really huge ones people could throw their couches in there was a door that' s gone all we' ve got is the little apartment size one we don' t have the big one. Johnny on the spot has not cleaned the toilets because they do not have the new code or the key. There was quite a little while when the toilets were not being cleaned or emptied. One of the things I worry about is that the EMS does not have the new code what if the chico PD does not have the new code. They need to be able to get in they can' t get in necessarily by the small gate you can' t get a gurney through the small gate I can almost guarantee it they' re bigger than they used to be. I don' t know what will happen to someone who is having a medical crisis. Also we don' t have gun battles out there we had one shooting out there Mr. O'Brien there' s not gun battles going on. I feel safer there than I do downtown with all the students who are drunk and disorderly frankly. I would like you to consider mayor reynolds I appreciate the ad hoc committee meeting I learned so much about the different services but one thing is where these people are going to go they' re going to go right where the other people are or they' re going to come back here to the plaza. None of what we' re doing outside of unfortunately making more alternatives to the!!!! We are going to have more desperate people on the street and we' re going to have more crime. J.C. is doing an incredible job there and they' re building trust with people there and I see differences I see people sitting down and talking and thinking about what services they might avail themselves of. They haven' t been there that long and it' s going to take a while. ! ! ! ! and it is really really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is really important and it is interested to pursue especially during the times of day where we' ve seen the most issues because of unapproved people coming in and out of that site. Definitely support that initiative and I would also be interested to pursue those raised pallet beds as well if it sounds like we will pallet beds and we will see more benefits from that low cost solution. councilmember hannover. I think what we' ve learned from the experience of the genesis shelter and the alternative site is when these situations are managed they turn out reasonably well and we' ve seen it at the alternative site as you guys have ratcheted up the management it' s improved dramatically. I think we' that public works came back with are what we ought to run with. councilmember o'brien. I concur with that but my recommendation will be to actually staff heavy at first for a month or two to see where we' re at and then scale back down I think we want to do this right. I think we' re going to have to get that site right and get that neighborhood right and get those businesses right and I think you do that by management and management requires staff we' going to start heavy I don' t mind the pallet that' s anything that improves the site for those remaining I' m perfectly fine with that but I think the staffing should be heavy initially and we can reevaluate in a month or two and re on the back end I don' t think that' s the way to do that. councilmember o'brien point of clarification are you what I' m hearing is that you would like to pursue not only jesus center staffing but also that ag security staff as well. I would thank you councilmember hall I really liked the vice mayor' s recommendation of expanding security as opposed to just the site but looking at the neighboring I think that makes a lot of sense and I would support that as well. councilmember wrenslow. I' m in agreement with these things the idea of starting strong and ratcheting it down could work really well I like to imagine an idea where we actually don' t have to incur all those costs that were listed and we can create a decent enough situation that we can sort of selectively like down staff costs in there when' s the next time we could do an enforcement in the surrounding areas some of the surrounding areas at least? our next enforcement is included for this next month. it includes some of those areas around there? no because the settlement agreement doesn' t allow us to start another enforcement until we' ve completed the one we' re in the middle of. we' re talking like 20 days out or something? s about right. five more now and then if I going to be a 17 day process. if that corresponds to the time that we have some stepped up kind of surveillance out there then maybe we could create a situation where we don' t just end up in the same place again like in previous enforcement that' s maybe optimistic but I think I' m supporting everything else I' m hearing here. thank you. does anybody want to make a motion to approve staff recommendation? I will make a motion to support the staff recommendations of increasing the jesus center staff and as I said I would like to see that at least initially seven days a week. let' s do that for two months. let' s increase the security to include the vice mayor' s recommendation of expanding the security route to include neighboring businesses and neighboring residences. and then with an option to obviously scale everything back down at the end of that two month period based upon the status of everything we have been discussing. second. can I just make a friendly amendment? I don' t want to make a Mr. Gustafson in your original presentation you said come back in several months. I would rather it be a few months. So like three. I think if you could come back and report back in two to three months. three months. if we can't report back at the first of the year that would be great. absolutely. we may have to come back a little sooner. can we make it to two months? I think two months would be just about right. like two months from the time of everything being reset and started. yes. thank you. thank you. can I throw on one other personal request opinion can we consider increasing the dumpster capacity again I think you really avoid so much mess by allowing people to throw things away and we save a little bit of money I' sure having a smaller dumpster but I don' t know it' s worth it. and the other issue we didn' t bring up was about assuring that access to unlock the gate is that every vendor who needs it or ambulances that' s solved somehow. they have it. thanks. can I just ask for clarification the motion is no can we repeat that we get a report in two or three months and we see if we' re going to reduce it after that? so two months from the time of implementation whenever we get everything in place let' last two months and bring that back and make an assessment after that. thanks for that clarification. do we have a second? yes. council member van overbeck I believe seconded that. okay. council member goldstein? yes. council member holly? yes. mayor reynolds? aye. motion carries 7-0. I' m going to take a quick five-minute break I' m not feeling 100% and I' m just need something warm for my throat so we' ll be right back. all right are we ready to bring it in? all right. item number 5.2 consideration of introduction of ordinances for the chico municipal code and mr. chionkoyan. thank you mayor our senior civil engineer david keen has led this effort for the department and is going to be presented to the council this evening. great thank you. good evening council vice mayor bennett mayor reynolds my name is david keen with the public works department and I' m a senior civil engineer and tonight we will be discussing chico municipal code engineering updates. so here' s what we' ll go through we talked about this a few months ago we' ll go to the background we' ll summarize the updates talk about the environmental review make the findings and then the next steps. so to recap the previous updates were in 2018 so it' s been seven years these are long overdue and they are critical to updating our municipal code related to regulatory changes council directives process enhancements and the infrastructure and long-term sustainability of city infrastructure. here' s the key slide so in august we brought forth these amendments to you and they' re complete state and this item was referred to the internal affairs committee to look at the potential cost impacts of the amendments we took this item to the internal affairs committee where they recommended with the chico builders association recommendation to look at the rainfall intensity calculations pavement design standards streetlight height and concrete structural requirements as well as the traffic impact analysis requirements. so this is a list of the amendments that we will be looking at and we will be looking at those with the internal affairs committee but then at the september 16th meeting council voted to proceed with all the proposed amendments except for those four items i just mentioned so that' s why i' m here tonight. so here' s a summary of all the titles that we' ll be updating vehicles and traffic streets and sidewalks buildings and construction building standards design criteria and improvement standards. so there' s no change for those top four title 10 14 16 and 16 r from the august 19th presentation. so we will continue to look at for title 18 r this is where those four items live that the chico builders association had concerns with so we removed as i talked about items related to rainfall intensity minimum pavement structural sections the street light standards as a whole and then the traffic impact analysis threshold requirement. we went over this last time but to make it clear these amendments are exempt from sequa because they do not propose any construction demolition or any other activity and of course we would do future sequa for anything if it does move forward. and to adopt these amendments we do need to make findings so these amendments are consistent with the general plan and these amendments are consistent with the other applicable regulations within the muni code. and so with that tonight is an introductory reading of pretty much the same thing from august 19th without those four items so we' re hoping to take any direction otherwise we will be back on november 4th for a final reading and adoption of these amendments. that' s my presentation. all right questions. council member mcconnell. and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and I'll do it nobody Hates me Yeah, or either one move to approve the ordinance the City Council of City Chico many title 10 vehicles and traffic of the Chico Municipal Code Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico many title 14 streets and sidewalks of Chico Municipal Code Ordinance of the City Council of City Chico many title 16 building construction of the Chico municipal code and the two resolutions Second all right, we got a motion a second is there any room for discussion before we move to a vote Oh sure. Okay. Great. I I would love to go right on ahead and also Internal Affairs Committee feedback Because perhaps I'm missing something but I I would really love to go back to the August 19th edition of 18 our point 05 o B 1 B the storm drainage intensity of rainfall item that was changed based on the internal affairs recommendation and Council vote I just Worry that if we are not utilizing the stormwater master plan Why even make these master plans to begin with it seems to be a really strong resource for for measuring rainfall intensity So I'd like to open it up for a little bit more discussion and maybe staff input for So mayor a point of order so I think that the motion is to approve the code of changes with the exception of those four items And we did not make any changes to those that we're not adopting anything different than what was originally proposed So we still have the opportunity to decide that we don't want to anticipate Anticipatable storm then that will come back. We're not now. Yeah so much. Okay So those are ready we'll get to talk about stormwater Riveting stormwater here pretty soon. Yeah All right. We have a motion as I can second Councilmember Goldstein yes Councilmember Holly yes Councilmember O'Brien yes Councilmember van overbeck. Yes Councilmember Winslow. Yes Vice mayor Bennett yes mayor Reynolds. Yes motion carries 7-0 All right item 5.3 Considerations of the 917 Finance Committee a council member that over So the Finance Committee met on September 17 We had three items on the agenda one was the Butte County tax sharing agreement and thanks to the impassioned and informed advocacy of the city manager To keep in place the current agreement. He convinced us that that was wise and we agreed to stay with what we have 3-0 the second is Has to do with CalPERS right now the unfunded pension liability is a hundred and eighty million dollars and I propose that we have a conversation about what we can do To try to mitigate that and the reality is there's not a lot but we might be able to do some things and this isn't the point to discuss that but I would like to have a conversation because It's one of those things that looms large. Although we don't deal with on an on a Council meet Council meeting by Council meeting basis And then the third was the impact fee formula the committee recommends that the council adopt changes so that when the the formula that supports the Whatever the impact fee level is goes down that the impact fee goes down so the only thing it requires any action I believe is the This discussion of the of the CalPERS What do we do? How do we mitigate the un-pension unfunded pension liability? Okay Councilmember Hawley, did you have some dad? Yeah, you all don't mind the reason I opposed is not because I love Unfunded liability. I just felt that finance staff had made it clear. They already do implement Keeping that in mind into everyday practice and I don't know that anything would come of that discussion rather than cutting staff or and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and that discussion or you want to make that at the end of the meeting? I think we should agenda and do it later. I also have my feelings on privatizing services and things like just because there' s an unfunded liability doesn' t mean the contracting costs don' t go down over time either but we can have a conversation. I don' t think we' re at that point as far as order but I' ll throw in my opinion too. I mean we' re essentially increasing our unfunded liability for using staff time on it. When I read the agenda report it sounded like pretty much our only hope to decrease unfunded liability would be to cut staff positions which is something I don' t want to do unless it' s incredibly necessary. I' m not excited about that concept. Do we have any speakers? None. Well then I don' t have to tell them they have to talk about all of them at once. So my annotated note says we need a motion for each one or can we do a motion for all three? My recommendation says need a motion. Mayor if it' s the same recommendation for all three then you can do it all in one. But it sounds like there' e some variability here. Yeah. I would recommend taking each one. Okay. So on 5.3a the tax assessment sharing agreement is I need a motion. Move to approve as information. Second. Okay. Councilmember Goldstein. Yes. Councilmember Hawley. Yes. Councilmember O'Brien. Yes. Councilmember van overbeck. Yes. Councilmember Winslow. No. Vice mayor bennett. Yes. Mayor reynolds. Aye. Motion carries 6-1. Okay. 5-0. 5.3b cal pers presentation. Motion? I would like to make a motion that we have a conversation about our options for trying to decrease the unfunded pension liability going forward. I' ll second that. If I may comment. Sure. I think we could have discussion. I think we could have discussion on it at some point so I won' t die on the hill but I don' t believe this is a good use of our time right now when staff already considers this. I would add this is a $180 million liability to the city. s not a waste of time. It' s something that we very much need to look at. We' re also directing staff review of it. We' re going to have a conversation which could end with staff review but I don' t think we' re asking for staff time. I also don' t think it' s horrible for the public to fully understand it too. Whenever we have a discussion, we' m sure we have these conversations and the public gets to see the presentation about how the unfunded liability works. I don' t think that' s a complete waste of time. You' re changing my mind. I always like a good opportunity to nerd out about finance. I' m not sure the public is going to show up for that but we can wedge it between some items on homelessness. When they can' t sleep at 3 o' cluck in the morning they can rewatch it. We have a motion and a second. Okay. Member Goldstein? Yes. Council Member Holli? No. Council Member O' bryan? Yes. I' Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Motion carries 6-1. Okay. And C, discussion of development impact fees. I' ll make a motion. I' ll make a motion that Council adopt the change formalizing the development impact fee decrease when the index decreases. Second. We' e saying that the development impact fee is going to be reduced. Do you find it? No. Okay. and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' and it' this really was an example of really good governance. I know it' s maybe shocking to our friends in the audience but really we identified an overarching objective which is to eliminate the bad actors in the massage therapy industry and we discovered along the way that the ordinance as previously written would have unintended consequences for legitimate practitioners. That is not what we wanted to do. Council certainly heard those concerns and supervisor Durkan at internal affairs and elsewhere addressed those concerns in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner. We now have an ordinance that met both of our objectives and I want to say well done to charlene and all of our professionals who participated in that process. The heavy lifting has been done in my opinion there may be some cleanup that will have to do along the way but the heavy lifting has been done and I want to say well done to all who participated. thank you. thank you. anybody have questions for council member o'brien? I have a question. Did we pass the ordinance all except for this one part that need to be updated or we can have an ordinance coming back at a future? that' s what I thought I was just making sure. I was also going to ask what the next steps on it are we aren' t passing anything tonight on it are we? we are just directing staff to bring it forth with the changes. if our policy on committees and the ability of committees to have staff do things that are different we would be adopting the ordinance tonight but that' got to be at the next meeting is what I heard. how many speakers do we have? none. do we have a motion? move to approve. second. motion by vice mayor bennett. second. council member goldstein. can I just comment first? I imagine that we will have more input from the public next time on this that it will be kind of its own individual agenda item. so for now yes. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes but I will tell you it' s a good sign that no one got up to speak this time. I think that speaks volumes. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member winslow. yes. mayor bennett. yes. mayor reynolds. yes. I' m super bummed this has taken us a year to get here but I' m glad that we' re finally here and moving on. 5.5 administrative services department reorganization and update to appendix b3. thank you mayor reynolds, vice mayor bennett and members of council I appreciate your time this evening in consideration of this item. since january of 2025 when human resources and risk management became part of the administrative services department. I along with my management team have been reviewing the functions within the department and where there' s some improvements might be needed. when we added our new hr and risk management deputy director we were able to assess where some additional support is needed in that area as well. tonight before you is a request to reclassify three positions within the department. one is with our risk management function. if you are not aware of what risk management does. it is a department that controls and controls insurance compliance in a number of areas that is with very high potential for liability within the city. this includes confirming insurance compliance by vendors, various claims from the public such as injury claims, property claims, damage claims and negligence claims. they oversee the safety training and injury prevention for personnel as well as other various risk and liability functions within the city. prior to 2015. we had a dedicated manager to oversee this function but since then that' s been under the hr umbrella without a designated manager. this is a function that needs somebody who can process things timely, can have good follow up and problem solving attention as well as the ability to work independently. and with that we' re requesting a change of one of the human resources technicians to an administrative specialist over the risk function to take on some more of those responsibilities and alleviate some of the risk. we are also working with the department to take on some of the duties that are currently being taken on by the deputy director and myself as well. next in our administrative team within the administrative services department we currently have a management analyst, three administrative assistants and an office assistant. we currently do not have that mid-level administrative specialist position in the department which adds an extra burden to our management analyst. we have a new assistant who is a senior administrative specialist who has to take on the more complex tasks that is not able to allocate to the admin assistants or below. it also doesn' t provide a good career ladder for promotion within our team. it' s pretty flat. recently we' ve been assigning out of class projects to one of our admin assistants who is now transferring to another department. this newly vacant position was really the impetus to bring this to you tonight. since we' re now going to be recruiting for this position we are really looking forward to working with we are requesting to upgrade that to an administrative specialist in the confidential unit who would be a support person for all the divisions of the team and that be able to alleviate some of the extra burden on the management analyst as well as provide a really good spread across the department. then finally we have an office assistant that is in the hr and risk department division that is spending most of his time out of class right now supporting the processing of employee leaves as well as claims supporting for our risk management function. this permanent change to an admin assistant will align his title with the duties he' s performing currently and will allow for a more robust support team overall. in summary the administrative services department is very flat as far as admin support within our team. we are the admin services department so we support the whole team. whole city so we' d like to have a robust function there. these new classifications will form a well rounded team to better align with the needs we have. there will be no current budgetary impacts now we have some savings from other leaves and that sort of thing and the future impacts will be minimal when these positions and that will only be incurred when these get to the top steps of their classifications. with that I' ll take any questions. thank you. and it and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and council member o'brien? yes. council member van overbeck? yes. council member winslow? yes. vice mayor bennett? yes. mayor reynolds? yes. motion carries 7-0. 5.6 council member winslow bike and scooter sharing program. thank you. I appreciate you all approving a discussion on this. I think this is about the city having regulations that would allow the approval of some kind of shared mobility service. That's like rental bikes or scooters. As another council member said to me in the bathroom earlier, we have seen good programs and programs that are less good if you traveled and visited places. There's a lot of technological advancements that solve a lot of the problems that people are aware of with these. And I think it's worth looking at. I think the state passed a bill in 2020, ab1286 that requires that local governments adopt some regulations to approve these. So if we do not adopt our own set of regulations for these, we in effect prohibit any proposals. They specifically name operation parking and maintenance as well as minimum insurance liability that the operator has to have. So we have to cover those at a minimum. But I looked through a number of other examples which I included in the report. We saw that we can have different requests of a particular service standards and such. We have the opportunity to set bars at various levels for different aspects of the program. I think it's worth getting feedback from staff on. But I kind of drew up some of the things that I think we could set as the principles that we would approve such a program under, which are providing an affordable service to the public, having strict guidance for parking devices so they are not the city is not obstructing sidewalks and streets. The equipment is maintained in good condition as a rule. That operations as safe as we can make it and the city is identified against liabilities most of those I pulled from the city of chula vista which I mentioned later in the report. We have this was spurred by one particular proposal although I want to be clear that us adopting regulations does not specifically allow one provider to do something it allows anybody to come in and request that they be able to provide some kind of services. I think s a great idea to have a local entrepreneur who is trying to bring a service here be a franchise of an islandic company that is I attached his proposal he sent to me and he' s also here I assume will speak and happy to answer any questions. when I wander around I' ve seen this in other cities and it can be a really useful thing. I watched the action news segment on it and the thing that struck me was that all the video that was being put out because the video was people riding these things on sidewalks and none of them wore helmets. If somebody falls off a scooter and hits their head because their knuckleheads don' t wear a helmet but I don' t want the city to get sued for that so I want to make sure that we have indemnification for that and there also needs to be enforcement from pd to make sure that we keep people off the sidewalks with those things. I think that' s great feedback I will say that I didn' t watch the segment but where I shot the interview was in the chico state bike path just to be sure that' s a legal bike path and I do see a ton of people riding the scooters more than in previous years. we keep them on the bike paths I think that' s fine. I think that partly I see this as an opportunity we' re getting electric scooters anyway of course if we offer a rental if we allow a rental service to be offered then more people are going to use them but I think this gives us an opportunity to standardize the expectation of the vehicle service because right now they' re operating often in a gray area. Riding on the sidewalks in downtown is not a gray area that' s illegal. Helmets are allowed or prohibited you must wear a helmet according to the California vehicle code. 15 miles an hour is also a speed limit by the California vehicle code which nobody enforces that and these ones that come off the market don' t have the same speed caps on them. I think having a standardized rental service would allow us board can hold over if they' violating those with their own private scooters. I agree I think enforcement is going to be an important aspect of it. they can set the speed limit of the scooter so that' self-enforcing. some newer technology geofencing is what it' called where you have a map if you go out of an area like you go on to the university campus now the speed cap can be lowered or can have you come to a stop or at minimum will say something really annoying they have to listen to while they' re like get off the sidewalk. one of the things I want to make sure we' re mindful of is what this council usually does with something like this we say let' s try it out and we say let' s try for six months or a year and my concern is we' ve got a young entrepreneur here who' s going to put a bunch of his life savings on the line and we figure out how to mitigate the risk to him while we' re doing this. because we may decide it' s not working. yes. I think it' his proposal is a pilot program which is relatively small. specifically for that to make sure it actually works so you' re not in with a thousand scooters and find it' s not making money or there' s some other issues that require that compel us to not want to continue it. council member bostein. thanks. I wanted to echo what tom was saying about the potential issues but also the opportunity for better enforcement and understand that in the education about micro mobility in general I ride my bike a lot and I have been seeing an increase in something specific which is people going the wrong way in bike lanes and it' especially scary if they' re on an electric device that is going a lot faster than me the opposite way and there' s cars next to me. That shows me there' s an opportunity to educate people who maybe this is their first time owning a bike and riding it in a city and it' s an e-bike or something to that effect. If we' re getting people into borrowing an e-scooter or e-bike we can have the in-app tutorial like I' ve used in sacramento where it can be annoying the first time you sign up it makes you click through all the things but it will tell you you' re only allowed to park it here you' re only allowed to ride it here and the geo fencing for preventing riding on sidewalks or making sure you' re only going a certain speed in a certain area can be really helpful. I' m glad we' re considering this. I also appreciate the opportunity to about this. I believe we considered something similar a few years ago at council and glad this is coming back even though I' m a little skeptical I think we need to put a policy in place so we can regulate the potential for this. councilmember o'brien. thank you mayor. One I' ve got to be honest I do not like the name joyride that makes me envision grand theft auto or s a good name. m not sure what it is. I want to make sure we do this right and make sure we do it right on the front end so let' s make sure we work out all the bugs on the front end before this gets going because we want to ensure that this is going to be successful. I think that' important. We did do something years ago councilmember goldstein much before technology of gps and such it was called the yellow bike program. Who in here remembers the yellow bike program? It lasted almost a I think it was about a week about one week I think because the bikes were stolen and repainted and what have you it did not work out but it was well meaning people had the right intentions to allow bikes to be used and taken what have you I know the technology certainly is going to change much of that but I want to make sure in all seriousness we do it right on the front end so let' s do it right. I' m in agreement let' s give this a shot but let' s make sure we do it right. worth asking before going to I would like to ask a public comment if engineering has any comments. I know you read some of the proposal and he engaged you guys before and I think that' s how he ended up reaching out to me as somebody said talk to council. thank you. This idea has been presented to lots of different agencies and practice over the years the technology has improved. For all the discussion that' s been brought up at the dais absolutely those things have to be discussed and planned in advance to establish a permit process. If staff is directed to look into this establishing this permit process those things would need to be discussed collaboration with the police department was going to be essential. Things have advanced since it was introduced several years ago. I did look at the proposal including your request council member Winslow and it has addressed some of the previous concerns but there are still some remaining issues of storage. We have a lot of And again enforcement is probably the biggest one there will be things that need to be codified in the city' s code. There' s an opportunity if staff is directed to look into this all the things you have discussed at the dais those are essential things to prepare for the framework. how many speakers do we have? we have two. three minutes each. jessie horgan. good evening. I am the chair of the alternative transportation committee at chico state. In that job I deal with a lot of discussion about micro mobility and how we could improve the safety and the safety of the transportation system. I will start with the safety and availability of zero emission transport around campus. You' re going to hear a lot of safety concerns in and around scooters. I really appreciate how the proposal addressed these head on. As is mentioned before the technology has come a long way in the past ten years. Limiting speeds, locking up the wheels stopping mobility if it is not possible. I think the city is GPS so the scooters can be located and moved. I wanted to add some things to the discussion here in your consideration. One is chico the city is currently has a gold designation for being a bicycle friendly community. The league of American bicyclists released this proposal in the last year and two years ago. The university is just an honorable mention although we hope to improve our standing. One way to improve our standing is to bring in a bicycle or scooter share program. The second is the university has a gold standard for sustainability. We just completed our most recent assessment. We barely made the gold standard and we want to improve on that. One of the ways that we can improve is to bring a bicycle or scooter share program on to campus. It is a thing that we are actively discussing and looking at. There is an opportunity to harmonize with the city does with what the university does. I am looking into designated areas for parking, subsidies for students who especially low income students who don't want to bring a car and pay for parking and et cetera. How they can get around and do their shopping and do their errands without a car. think about that. Also how we can make chico a more viable option as a university and as a community for perhaps low income people who are trying to get a degree and find a place with cheaper housing costs but transportation is an issue. I want to add those to the discussion and harmonize what we are doing. and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and find and our communities character and safety front and center. At its heart, roaming is about local mobility with local values. We want to provide a reliable, eco-friendly and affordable transportation option for students, residents and visitors. One that reduces parking headaches, supports Chico's climate action goals and give people a new convenient way to explore our city. Now I know that when people hear scooter share a few concerns come to mind like safety or clutter those are valid and I want to address them head on. Roam system uses smart technology and best practices, geofencing to control where scooters can be parked or ridden, built in speed limits for safety and full insurance coverage that protects both the rider and the city. Our team will handle daily fleet checks and maintenance and we're even partnering with tools like SafeRides D-Y reflex test to prevent unsafe riding. On the clutter side, we'll be adding a unique! We've been working with the state and local organizations to build a program that grows responsibly and reflects Chico's values. We've already started conversations with Chico State and student leaders and the excitement has been incredible. Students see this as an opportunity to connect campus and community sustainably and affordably. With your approval, we're ready to launch a small, carefully managed pilot program one that gives Chico the benefit of micro mobility while showing how local oversight and accountability make all the difference. Thank you for your time and consideration and the commitment to innovative and sustainable transportation. thank you. further discussion or consider a motion? so the motion what we' re approving here is to send it to staff to come back with is that right? councilman winslow? I wanted to outline some goals as far as what are they looking at and doing it which we kind of trust they already have a lot of the right ideas in mind. I also included requests that they explore some partnerships with chico state which thankfully they sent somebody out which I appreciate and explore butte county card and some other agencies that might support it. so I would like to make a motion to refer this to staff to come back with an implementation plan. I will second that. can we just keep to the really wonderful name you have rome and kind of discard the joyride sir? perfect. I like rome. thank you. councilmember goldstein? yes. councilmember holly? yes. councilmember o'brien? yes. councilmember van overbeck? yes. councilmember britt? councilmember winslow? yes. vice mayor bennett? yes. mayor reynolds? yes. I didn' t speak earlier but I want to make sure the information is brought back to us on liability because we just dealt with a trip and fall with a sidewalk on the plaza or not the plaza on a street down here and so I can only imagine somebody going head over toe over one of these. I saw them down on long beach when I was down there last week and they were everywhere and people were having a blast on them. I think it' s fun and great and exciting but I want to look out for liability. we have nothing after the agenda reports and communications. the following reports and communications have been provided for the council' s information. no action can be taken under this section of the council unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. city manager' s report? can I make a report for you? I just wanted to report that in case you didn' t know we are in the running for the next two weeks. we have a cultural district designation for being a culture district by the state of California. we applied in conjunction with chico state and we are a finalist among 20 they will choose up to 10 and we had the California arts commission here yesterday four of them and we toured around downtown and we toured chico state and we had a community meeting at monca afterwards and it went really good. I' m very hopeful for it that we might get that cultural district designation for our community and I just thought it' s fun. we should know mid December. December 12th is what they said is when the meeting is and then they will vote. hopefully we' ll get some good news on that. not that it means a lot and it' s only $5,000 but overall I think it' s good for marketing and tourism and all the good things all the good feels for the community. financial report. council member requests. pursuant to APMP 1010 council members we verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be a majority vote would be needed in order for staff to agendize. do we have any council member requests? no. all right. we will adjourn to a closed session meeting on Tuesday the 4th at 5 or 530 followed by the regular council meeting at 6 o'clock in the council chambers at 421 main street. thank you.
