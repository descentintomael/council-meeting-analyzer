Try to keep this item brief as there were  no public comments with  the exception of one that your commission  received regarding  postponing this item due to item  4.2. So I'll get right into it.  The project is for  80 senior affordable housing  units. The item  was reviewed by the  architectural review and historic  preservation board in October  and they're recommending the  approval of this project to  your commission.  And the project is in the  Oak Valley subdivision  master plan area that was  approved by the city council back in  2005. The project  site is an 11.26  acre site with a  4.74 acre  portion  dedicated to the project itself, which  you can see here on  the screen with the aerial  and the project site  zoning designation of R2.  The reason this is before your commission  for a plan development permit approval  is because the SD2  overlay requires a plan  development permit approval for  any projects  within the Oak Valley area with  this particular zone.  The proposals to  construct 79 senior affordable  residential units dispersed in  fourplex building modules.  With one managers unit in one of those  20 buildings. There's also a clubhouse and  outdoor amenities, parking, landscaping  improvements. This is the actual site  plan showing the access from  Humboldt Road as well as another access  on Yosemite drive. This is a rendering of  what the view would be. There are low profile  buildings with dormer gable roofs. And this is a  which is consistent with the overlay zones.  Again, this is part of the Oak Valley subdivision and master plan approved by the city council back in 2005.  It's consistent with all code requirements.  There was a neighborhood meeting that was held via Zoom on November 18th,  and no members of the public showed.  Pursuant to CEQA, this project falls within the scope of the final EIR for the Oak Valley subdivision.  And pursuant to Section 15162 of the Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act,  no subsequent environmental review is necessary.  Planning staff recommends that the Planning Commission consider the project staff report,  direct any questions to staff, provide comments,  hold a public hearing regarding the proposed project,  and adopt the required findings contained in the agenda report,  and approve the plan development permit subject to the recommended conditions,  and determine the project is within the scope of the final EIR prepared for the Oak Valley subdivision.  Pursuant to Section 15162 of the Guidelines for Implementation of the Environmental Quality Act.  That concludes staff's report, and I'm happy to take any questions that you might have.  Thank you. Are there any questions for staff to my left?  Vice Chair Ober?  Just a couple, and they'll be brief, but I'm noticing in the mitigation measure 4.4-2,  page 9 of Attachment H, a mention of installing natural gas hookup in proposed fireplaces.  And I'm just wondering if that's definitely going to happen.  I mean, I think that current common practice is, in fact, I want to say that there's a state that suggests  that natural gas is not recommended.  So I'm just curious if I'm, maybe I'm wrong about that, or what the plan there is.  Or maybe I'm reading it wrong.  Taking a look at this mitigation measure that you're speaking of.  And again, that was 4.91, I apologize.  No, 4.4 on page 9.  4.4.  4.4-2.  My apologies.  Sorry.  Yeah, I was going to say, you were saying 4.9-2.  You're probably correct.  This is a mitigation.  It's a time piece from a long time ago.  I think any utility or any fireplace would have to be consistent with California building code.  Right.  Likely wouldn't allow.  Okay, good.  I think you're certain about that.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  And then my only other question is on the tree plan, on the tree schema,  I didn't see any trees that were needing to be removed.  But there is, again, a mitigation measure of 4.8 that talks about when tree removal  is necessary, et cetera, et cetera.  Do we know if there are any trees that need to be removed?  I do not believe that there are any trees proposed to be removed on this particular  project.  It's just that's the mitigation plan for the entire Oak Valley development.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate that.  Of course.  Any questions to my right?  One quick question.  I didn't see that we had any ARHPB minutes from their meeting.  Were there any conditions that they added with their approval?  I apologize.  I apologize for not including the minutes, but there were no additional conditions.  Okay, great.  Thank you.  Anything else?  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So we will open the public hearing on Plan Development Permit 22-01, and we will start  with the applicant if they are here.  Hi.  Sidney Stone, Director of Real Estate Development for Christian Church Homes.  I'm from the  We are a 61-year-old nonprofit with approximately 4,000 plus units in seven different states.  We are already here in Chico.  We are the owner-operator of Jarvis Gardens Senior Apartment over on Notre Dame and 20th.  In this part of Northern California, we do have a presence in Redding.  We have three developments in Redding already.  We are working on our fourth one right now, which is going through the tax credit process.  With our Chico project, we're really excited. We're really excited to be able to get the  We're really excited about this one.  Eighty units, you know, all single-story, 24 plexes.  We've already been awarded approximately $12.5 million from the County of Butte for disaster  relief to, you know, add housing in areas that were affected by the fires.  This one will also go through the tax credit process beginning in March.  We are finishing up the NEPA right now, which is the federal requirement, because we also  have some project-based vouchers on that.  We're going to be doing a lot of work on this.  But, you know, it's going to serve residents in the, and I'm going to go laps into housing  lingo here, but it's going to be between the 30 and 60 percent area median income.  So, you know, we've got actually a large waiting list at Jarvis Gardens.  We know there is a lot of demand for housing at those low-income levels, and this should  go super quick, because it's easy construction.  It's cheaper than a lot of other housing.  It's more affordable than most affordable developments are going these days.  You know, if you hear stories, you hear stories of, you know, units costing $700,000 a unit,  $1 million a unit.  This is, should come in at under 400k unit.  And again, on four acres, all single story.  We are utilizing local GC, SunSery, contractors, who has vast experience in doing affordable  housing.  So, if there's any other information you need, I'm here to answer any questions, and definitely  glad that I'm first.  Based on the fact that everyone is here for the next one.  Are there any questions of the commission for Mr. Stone?  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Do we have any members of the public wishing to speak on this item?  We have one member.  And we can call him up.  Sean Reese.  Sean Reese.  Sean Reese.  Sean Reese.  Sean Reese.  Good evening, commissioners.  My name is Sean Reese.  I'm a field representative from the NorCal Carpenters Union, at Local 1599.  I'm here to talk to you about providing area standards for labor for the Humboldt Road Apartments  project.  Area standard labor language needs to be the template that developers use in the great  city of Chico.  I would like to express to you that without these standards, the construction force is  systematically abused through wage theft, 1099, where workers have no workers' comp  when injured on the job, and a litany of safety violations.  Thank you.  Help helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps  helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps  helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps  helps helps helps helps helps helps  helps helps helps helps  or go into a dance recital instead of sitting in traffic for two hours.  The language that should become the policy here in Chico would support responsible contractors  that are already doing the right thing by their clients, employees, and the city itself.  These responsible contractors have proven time after time that they can perform to the highest standard.  This policy would bolster Chico's working class and cultivate a responsible market for good contractors.  This would create a minimum standard for developers that are coming into Chico,  telling them that you value your citizens that build on our land.  By adding area standard labor to the city's prequalification language and to this project,  you will show to the public that you value not just the city, but also the men and women building the city itself.  I'd very much like to have a real and valuable conversation with each and every one of you,  as well as the developers, on how we can cultivate a prosperous construction industry in Chico.  I look forward to talking more about this with you in the future. Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Nicole, you said that was the only speaker we had?  Yes, ma'am.  Okay.  So we will close the public hearing then and bring it back to the commission.  Thank you.  I move that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution No. 2209,  Resolution Approving the Plan Development Permit 2201 for the property identified as APN 018500160  and determining that the project is within the scope.  And the FEIR prepared for the Oak Valley subdivision pursuant to Section 15162 of the guidelines for the California Environmental Quality Act.  I'll second that.  Great.  So we have a motion by Commissioner Cooper and a second by, or a motion by Commissioner Poulin and a second by Commissioner Cooper  to adopt Resolution No. 22-09.  Is there any further discussion?  All in favor signify by saying aye. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So that motion carries seven zero. Thank you Mr. Stone.  Opposed?  So that motion carries 7-0.  Thank you, Mr. Stone.  All right.  As staff sets up for Item 4.2, just a couple of notes I want to make for you guys.  We will be, if you want to speak on the next item, if you could please get a speaker card in,  and we will close that after the staff report.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The number of speaker cards that we have will determine the number of minutes that we will allow.  I see a lot of new faces.  Not all our planning commission meetings look like this.  So just a couple of ground rules for how we run our meetings here that might be different from some other meetings you may come to.  So this is a place that we really respect and honor whoever is speaking and everybody in this room.  So I know that while my fellow commissioners might not vote the same way that I do, they all do their homework.  They're all very conscientious.  And they all care about the city of Chico.  So we'd like you to address them with respect.  The same for CCC.  City staff who put in long hours making sure that all the I's are dotted and T's crossed.  So please direct any comments that you have.  If you have any questions, staff can't answer them during the public hearing.  But if you direct them to me, I take copious notes and will address those at the end of the public hearing.  The other thing is, although this is a public format and it is a great privilege,  to be in a democracy where we can all come down on a rainy night and share what we think about an item.  At the end of the day, this is my meeting.  So if anybody is getting unruly or is not respecting anybody in here, I will ask you to leave.  And I have two city staff who are available to help me control that.  So please make sure that your comments are germane, on point, and that we're just being respectful to one another.  I think that's it.  Did I cover it all, Mike?  Okay.  So get your speaker cards in and we'll go from there.  Thank you, Chair Scott.  I will take it away from here.  Okay.  Should I announce the agenda item for the speakers at home?  Okay.  So we will go into item 4.2, Valley's Edge Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment Rezone and Development Agreement.  And we have with us Principal Planner Mike Solley.  Thank you, Chair Scott.  I want to thank you specifically for helping me with this slide.  I did make a change right after we were done.  And unfortunately, my presentation is now 30 minutes instead of 20.  I will try to keep it as tight as I can.  But there's a lot of just baseline knowledge I think that we all want the room to know moving into the item.  Oh, I also want to introduce some guests we have with us tonight.  We have Christine Cronenberg from Dudak and Adrian Graham.  They're from Environmental and Planning Consulting.  Environmental and Planning Consulting.  They helped us prepare the EIR.  Christine was the project manager of the EIR and Adrian was the project director for the EIR.  And they helped us prepare that document.  The outline for my presentation is here and it starts with the project entitlements.  The applications that the Planning Commission is being asked to make a recommendation to the City Council.  And the proposal that the City Council has made to the City Council on tonight includes the specific plan.  And I'll talk in great detail about that.  And to make that effective, we also need general plan amendments, re-zones, code amendments, and there's also a development agreement that I'll speak to later.  The general plan amendments would change the land use diagram to look like the specific plan instead of what we have on it now.  And it would change the policy and Appendix C, which talk about needing to plan these special planning areas.  It would modify that to speak to this plan.  And then we would use this project being an approved project, implementing part of that general plan.  Moving on to the specific plan.  What is the specific plan?  It's basically a set of planning policies for just an area of the community.  It's like the general plan, just a little bit smaller.  And the subdivision houses come later.  So we don't talk, it provides for development.  It doesn't propose development itself.  So that's how it's like the general plan for us.  We have one at the north end of town.  It's called the Northwest Chico Specific Plan.  That was approved in 2005.  And it's about 600 acres.  And it programmed, you know, you can kind of see on here that there's different land with different coding on it.  Low density, medium density, commercial stuff.  And then since 2005, a lot of it has been built out.  There's a lot of single family homes out there now.  Multi-family kind of clustered around the school.  There's a community park.  The DeGarmo Community Park is built out.  There's a lot of community parks now out there.  And as well as one improved neighborhood park.  And on the east side of the freeway, we have Hicks Lane now.  It's just being graded now here, you know, 17 years later after the plan's been adopted.  We're still building out that specific plan.  And that's actually, you can see the grading on the east side of the freeway there.  Moving over to this project site, here's a specific plan on the other end of town just to orient us for this project that we're talking about tonight.  It's located on the east side of the freeway.  It's located at the east end of 20th Street.  If you go all the way to the end of 20th Street, there's a gate.  That is one entrance to the property.  This project would extend 20th Street into this property.  It's east of the Steve Harrison Memorial bike path.  That's the bike path out there that cars can't drive on.  There's the big sprockets that kind of alert you to that.  And then it's off the skyway.  It's north of Honey Run Road.  It's on the east of the town.  It's currently unincorporated.  Part of future approvals down the road would require annexation of the site.  It has been on our general plan diagram since the general plan was adopted in 2011.  It is identified as special planning area number five.  Even though it's SPA 5, it's actually the first of our five growth areas to come forward requesting approval by the city.  Since 2011, we have been doing the infill intensification parts of the general plan.  Now, as we're midway through the planning cycle of that, we're going to be doing that.  But as we're moving forward with that general plan, we're looking for future capacity to have more land to build on in the future.  That conceptual diagram that we have on the land use diagram is really just a placeholder waiting for a project that studies the landscape and proposes land uses that would work on that landscape based on the fact that there are small creeks going through the site and such.  And the general plan amendment would change that.  So we're going to change appendix C from this to this as well as the land use diagram.  And this is the project site.  The proposed Valley's Edge specific plan land use plan.  And to make it manageable, we're going to talk about it in three different chunks here.  The north half, the south half, and then the regional park is all that green down there by Honey Run Road.  So this is a slide I showed at the comment hearing a year ago.  I just want to revisit it because it well depicts that.  The site has lots of broad grassland, open space areas dotted with trees.  The trees are kind of arranged in lines and that reflects the geography of the landscape going through there and grade changes.  And it also kind of portrays where the creeks are.  And if you were about to turn on the land use diagram so you can see that the land uses are proposed, the development areas are between most of where all the trees are.  And then the north half, the south half, and then the regional park is all that green down there by Honey Run Road.  So that's what we mean when we say the project is doing avoidance by design.  It tries to remedy or minimize its environmental impact by the way it's been designed.  It just, we aren't proposing to build stuff in places where there's more sensitivity.  To do it in reverse, you can look at the aerial here and then we can turn on the open space zonings.  I'll talk about these more in a minute.  But the point here is just to show how they cover up all of the creeks.  All of the areas that are not in the area.  Not all of the trees, but lots of the trees.  Where you still see lots of trees dotting inside these planting areas, that's where you'll find that we have lower density zoning proposed.  And that's to allow the pad sites for the tree, the houses to go between where the trees already exist.  So looking at the north half of the site, there's about 18 acres of very low density residential.  That's half acre minimums.  And then there's 131 acres of low density residential with 15,000 square foot minimums.  That's those LDR areas that are the smaller polygons where those trees had some, where we saw some conflicts with trees on the previous slide.  And by doing less density in those areas, we can retain more of the trees and they can plant around those.  Then we have 133 acres of production housing.  That's on the flat grassland areas that will be much easier to develop and not need such space between the houses due to topography changes.  And then there's 9 acres of residential.  That's 16 acres of medium high density residential.  And this north half of the site, there's 63 acres of medium density residential, which is a real flexible zoning district where you can either have small houses and small lots or duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes and such.  And all that totals about 1,420 units.  And there's going to be one of the two locations for a water tank to have an elevated million gallon, maybe 1.5 million gallon water tank.  And then there's a lot of other areas that we're going to be looking at.  That's a lot of high on the landscape that will create pressure throughout the site down below.  And it helps our sustainability for keeping pressure on the lines.  That's one of two locations.  This is probably the location that would be chosen if the north half of the project were chosen to proceed first.  Then there's the south half of the project.  The south half is planned for senior housing, age restricted to 55 years and older.  And it has eight acres of VLDR, very low density residential, 201 acres of production single family housing, and then 38 acres of medium density residential where they're planning to do more cottage type units.  There's graphics in the plan that show the cottage products and how they're arranged on sites, modest housing.  And those all total about 1357 units maximum.  And then the second potential location for a water tank, if this side of the project were to go first, would be around that location there.  Then there's commercial uses in the site.  There's a village core.  There's 13 acres of village core and 44 acres of village commercial.  And those land uses in the project allow a potential for almost a half million square feet of commercial square footage and almost 900 jobs potentially.  We don't really know what uses will go there.  But this...  Plan provides for those types of things to happen.  There's also allowances for residential uses in these commercial districts as there are elsewhere in the city.  Only these go up to 35 units per acre, which is a good high density that will allow many different types of things to be developed.  And there's also a potential for affordable housing site pursuant to the DA that I'll talk about later in this area.  It needs to kind of hover near this vicinity of the project because whenever we have an affordable housing site,  we like to put it next to where?  You'll have services within a reasonable proximity.  And part of that would be the elementary school site.  You see in the middle of this slide, this is the open space slide.  It features the regional park, which is all that green, like I said, down in the bottom right hand corner along Honey Run Road.  It basically contains most of the Comanche Creek watershed that traverses the site.  You can see it there.  It's heavily wooded along the bank.  So it shows up really dark there.  And that area is just a little bit more open.  It's being completely avoided by the project.  Then the regional park also extends up the east side of the project, providing a 300 foot buffer to the agricultural uses to the east.  And across the north side of the site, providing about 150 foot buffer to the folks that live down on Stillson Canyon Road.  And then there's even a little strip that returns back up to 20th Street, creating a nice big circuit around the project with this regional park.  It's 419 acres.  Then all the open space in the middle.  Between all the little planning areas there is called Valley Open Space.  And it also contains three neighborhood parks.  The one on the north side is called Homestead Park.  The one on the south is called Pioneer Park.  And there's one in the middle called Child's Meadow Park.  There's also featured on this slide the primary open space areas.  That would be over here.  This kind of snowman shape is for a buffer to Butte County Meadow Foam, which occurs in some wetlands in the middle of those areas.  And then there's some other types of meadow foam in this little half circle thing of primary open space.  Then there's primary open space down at the foot of the project where there's a floodplain area that floods from time to time.  Then like I said, there's the school site.  There's a community park right next to the school between the school and right adjacent to the bike path and the multifamily site as well as the village core.  Here's a picture from the plan about the village core that kind of shows how it ties all these things together.  The school's at the top.  There's a community center which will be part of the community park in the parking lot there.  We expect to see a park and ride in the future which might be part of the transportation demand management program that the project has to come up with.  And other commercial properties.  And then this would be the road that would take you up to the senior housing component.  I'm going to talk only about half of these things in detail.  So hitting the second half first.  There's lots of development standards in the plan.  Those are modeled after our Title 19 standards, only customized for this site.  For instance, you know, have setbacks only near Stilson Canyon.  Rear setbacks are going to be 45 feet to make sure that we don't have homes that become visible to existing residents that live down in Stilson Canyon.  Things like that where the development standards do a little extra different thing than our normal standards would.  You know, the chapter about parks shows us depictions.  And descriptions of the parks so we can have a good feel for what those will be like.  It talks about rock walls and how those are largely avoided.  I know the applicant has a presentation that will speak to the rock walls and how he's avoiding those with the streets.  So I'm going to move on from that.  Then there's the trails.  There's a variety of different trails.  Some so good that you could drive a fire truck on them or a class one bike path all the way down to a nature trail that's just a dirt trail.  And then trees.  There's a whole tree appendix that is modeled after our municipal code.  Our tree preservation regulations are kind of mimicked and expanded upon in Appendix E, which is the Valley's Edge Tree Preservation Program.  There's an implementation chapter with some and that presents the financing strategy for the project and different allowances for what's a minor change, what's a major change.  And different implementations.  So there's a lot of information.  Questions are answered there.  And then there's a bunch of design guidelines that really show details and depictions of what we're talking about when we say earth tone colors or dark sky lighting.  And that's part of the standards in places.  And then it's illustrated in the design guidelines.  So moving back up to the principles, goals, and actions.  That's basically chapter two of the plan.  There are five overarching principles.  Again, the applicant is going to talk about those.  So I'm going to skip them for now.  But the rest of these are the chapters.  And then the chapters of the plan, basically.  And chapter two is parks, recreation, and open space.  There's six goals and several policy actions for each of those goals in the plan.  And those will be really helpful in the future because, like I said, the specific plan just creates potential for future projects to show up at this planning commission and ask for approval of a subdivision.  And, well, should we approve the subdivision or not?  Well, is it consistent with the goals and actions of the specific plan?  That's why those are going to be really handy in the future.  Just to give an example, there's a goal, LU4.  It says to minimize lighting, visual impacts.  And then that's complemented by five different actions.  Action LU4.4 says minimize light pollution with dark sky best practices.  And it includes a hardscape lighting intensity standard right there in the policy.  So we know what to do with lighting based on that.  All right.  Moving on into foothill development standards.  There's a special standard.  We're going to go through this section on that because this obviously is in the foothill area and there's topography to deal with.  And so similar to our zoning code that has foothill development standards, those are largely reflected in this plan.  And it talks about all these things on this list or this ‑‑ yeah, I won't read it to you.  But these are important things to do to minimize the viewshed impacts and create reasonable transitions between the housing sites.  We want people to look for the flat spots.  And look for those areas to build the houses, not just start lining them up and demolishing whatever is in between.  And here's an example of one of those design guidelines for foothill development.  And this is the same thing you'll see in our code.  Except for we'll call out special things like the height restrictions near Stillson Canyon and along the Steve Harrison Memorial bike path.  Because by the way, that bike path will be a visible area of the project when you're driving down Skyway crossing the bridge there.  Moving on to the firewise design standards.  It was one of the requirements of the general plan.  The policy in the general plan we changed talks about what needs to happen in this plan.  And dealing with wildfire was one of them.  And of course that showed up as part of the proposal of the project.  And we worked with the fire department based on what was proposed in the plan to really refine that and change it and expand it quite a bit through the process.  So I want to thank Chief Standridge, who I also failed to introduce, but he's here too tonight.  You don't usually have him at the planning commission meeting.  For helping us with this.  It's a lot about access.  Getting the fire trucks up there in an emergency.  Giving them the ability to move between areas.  I'll show that on the next slide.  Making sure structures are within distances that can be reached by fire trucks and hoses and fighters.  Then the structural materials.  There's a whole building code that goes with building and fire areas that deal with the exterior materials, the vents, and basically hardening structures.  And so that's what we're doing.  We're trying to minimize their vulnerability to fires.  And then fire breaks as well.  I won't read everything on here, but there's different other things.  And eventually it gets down to where the HOA will be educating their members and making sure that there's annual fuel reduction taking place.  I'll mention that again in a minute.  So here's the WULE plan.  The wildland.  Urban interface.  When we say WULE, we mean the wildland urban interface.  And this is what it looks like.  It's in the plan.  You can see the red buffer or the edges are all of the areas where those hardened conditions are required.  The vegetation clearing is required to make sure that we have a little bit of buffer around where people are versus where the open space is.  We didn't start with this plan.  We had an earlier version that we were working with.  And through extensive efforts with the fire department, we improved this plan and ended up with the one that we have today.  Although having these side by side do show that there was also some other refinements along the way.  So you may notice that this area over here, it used to be called Equestrian Ridge.  It's been removed from the plan.  It was a little isolated over there.  More problematic at WULE around its entire edge.  And so that's no longer part of the plan.  You won't see that in there.  And there's also small little planning areas right here on this ledge that's down below the southern mesa.  Those were also removed.  And the hope is that that will provide the ability to have a little more ability to create a fire break along this area.  And to make up for the loss of those areas, some areas in the middle of the site were up zoned.  Moving on to the street sections.  We have a lot of  concerns.  One of the concerns on this project was that it might have effects that burden city maintenance staff and requirements.  And so that that doesn't happen, we have now, they want to do these low impact development or lid swales.  Basically roadside ditches that slow down the storm water and get it able to infiltrate to the extent it can out here.  And the city is not in the business of maintaining roadside ditches.  So this section and others in the plan show how the city would maintain the middle part of the road that we're used to maintaining,  but we wouldn't, the roadside ditches would have to be maintained privately by the HOA.  Or a maintenance district or something of that sort.  This is a slide to make sure I didn't forget to say certain things.  The vegetative fuels reduction part of the firewise design guidelines require annual inspections by the fire department.  Where they'll go out and inspect the site and say clear that brush, remove that tree or whatever they say.  And part of that effort also is anticipated to include goat grazing like you see in Bidwell Park.  Because they'll have a big regional park that will be kind of like Bidwell Park and you know, we can feed some goats and minimize the fuel buildup out there.  And then I mentioned the firewise construction standards.  There's also standards that apply to private landscapes to try to play, not plant, thank you.  Things that are super flammable and that'll largely be policed by the HOA amongst themselves.  And then there's infrastructure funding and maintenance which is required of the developer just like other projects.  Okay, getting close to halfway here.  Talking a little bit about the site.  This is the soils map.  Everything that I didn't cover up in white here are really poor soils as far as any sort of agricultural use or anything goes.  I don't know how to explain it.  I don't know how to say it other than this is not the type of place you want to go have to dig a hole.  It has very shallow soils which creates fast runoff and then there's bedrock.  So the bedrock just creates a situation where lots of rain will run off very fast.  So the creeks fill up really quick and then they go down really fast.  And I'll show some pictures but first I want to show some more of this.  This is a picture out of the plan.  Showing the soil.  The grade changes.  So you'll see that the areas in green are 10 to 15% slope and then blue, dark blue and purple are steeper areas.  And just to take home here is that the areas planned for development tend to avoid those areas that are colored blue and purple.  And including those little areas along the ledge that were removed.  Those, you know, and even this one here is really impacted by that and that's why it's very low density residential.  Only a few houses can go in there.  But it is developed.  There's a couple spots in there.  So that's why the different types of densities and lot sizes were chosen for these different areas.  This is what the landscape looks like out there on the flat mesas.  There's a lot of head size rocks strewn about the landscape, cobbles.  Like I said, the soils are not deep.  It is a grassland but don't get it confused with prairies and deep soils that have grasslands elsewhere.  There's just not a lot.  There's not a lot able to grow in this austere landscape.  And then a couple pictures out of the geotechnical study that mention that it's on lava cap.  Here's a representative example of a rock wall.  This is kind of near the village core area.  And large, beautiful oak trees that tend to be planned around with stuff.  On the edges of the mesas is where you'll get some abrupt changes in grade.  And this is more of a gentle one on the left and more of a cliff one on the right.  Maybe the right would have generated some of that dark blue and purple on the previous slide.  And then that's where it drops off, sometimes to another tier that kind of has a flat area.  And then eventually it will work its way down to a creek.  And that's what these slides show.  So here we are at the creek.  And we're getting ready to introduce Christine.  Christine for the EIR.  The creeks are largely avoided, especially by the development areas.  They have to be crossed by streets to provide connections.  And that's another thing I want to talk more about.  But first I'm going to introduce Christine Cronenberg from DUDEC to go through the EIR process.  And she'll have a few slides for you.  Thank you very much, Mike.  I'm going to try and make this as quick as I can and brief.  So I'm going to first briefly address the environmental review process.  And go over the EIR very briefly.  So to start with, just briefly, an application was filed.  An environmental EIR was done for the project.  It was released for a 45-day comment period.  We prepared responses to comments.  That's that large, voluminous final EIR.  And now we're at the hearing stage.  So just to kind of give a little bit of a background.  The notice of preparation was released on August 14th.  For a 30-day public review period.  And a public scoping meeting was held on August 29th, 2019.  The city received a total of 34 comment letters.  Eight from agencies.  Two from organizations.  And 24 from the public.  The draft EIR was then released on October 29th.  For a 45-day review period.  It closed on December 15th, 2021.  And the city also held a public meeting to take oral comments on November 18th.  There were a total of 52 comment letters received.  Six from agencies.  Five from organizations.  And 41 from the public.  Going on.  The EIR evaluated a total of 15 issue areas shown on this slide.  Pretty comprehensive, including land use and planning.  As you can tell, the EIR was quite a large, detailed document.  And it was a very comprehensive report.  Of the issues that were evaluated in the environmental impact report, there were numerous.  There were three particular issue areas.  Energy, public services, recreation, and public utilities.  Where all impacts were less than significant.  And no mitigation was required.  There were nine issue areas where impacts were able to be mitigated to less than significant.  Through compliance with mitigation.  And they're shown there on the slide.  There were two issue areas where impacts could not be mitigated to a less than significant level.  And impacts were determined to be significant and unavoidable.  It was in aesthetics and in greenhouse gases.  Which I'll discuss a little bit more further down the slides.  The next few slides I'm going to talk about, they touch upon a few of the issue areas where mitigation is required.  Compliance generally with requirements set forth in the city's general plan.  Also in the city's municipal code.  As well as existing state laws.  And the specific plans, various design and development standards.  Help to address and mitigate many of the project impacts, as Mike noted.  The plan is basically designed to be self-mitigating as much as possible.  However, even with compliance with these existing laws and requirements.  There are project impacts.  That do require mitigation.  Not all of the mitigation measures are identified as I go through this discussion.  But I wanted to highlight a few to provide an example of the types of mitigation measures that are required.  For example, in aesthetics.  The specific plan includes a detailed set of design guidelines and development standards.  To guide future development.  To promote quality design and construction.  To protect the existing site character and environment.  As well as to ensure proposed improvements are compatible with the characteristics of the community.  However, conversion of this undeveloped site to a developed environment.  Results in a permanent change in the existing visual character and public views of the site.  Therefore, mitigation measure AES1 addresses this impact.  However, it's designed to ensure that all new development determined to be major.  And would be required to be reviewed by the city's architectural review and historic preservation board.  With those smaller or minor projects.  Able to be reviewed by the city's community development director.  To ensure consistency with the specific plan.  And the design guidelines and development standards.  Here are a few visual simulations that were prepared to show how views of the site.  Would change.  Once developed.  As shown on this slide.  Views along East 20th Street and Skyway would change.  As you can see.  Views of the homes would be visible looking east along East 20th Street.  And northeast from Skyway.  Most of the public views of the site.  Along these two roadways.  And including Honey Run Road.  Would be from cars passing by the site.  However, this slide.  Shows how views would change.  Looking east from Dawncrest Drive.  Showing how development would change the existing undeveloped nature of the site.  As you can see.  These two slides also show.  One slide B.  Without mature vegetation.  And slide C.  Shows how it would look once the trees are mature.  However, even with compliance with the city's municipal code.  The general plan.  And the specific plan.  Development standards.  The site would permanently change the visual character.  Development of the site would permanently change the visual character.  Resulting in a significant unavoidable impact of the project.  Next I want to chat a little bit about.  Air quality.  The specific plan includes a number of goals and actions.  Designed to maximize energy efficient development that reduces air emissions.  The project.  Would be required to comply with the goals and actions in the specific plan.  Of course the city's general plan.  And also title 24 of the state's building code.  However, future project operation.  Would result in an increase in air emissions.  Resulting in an impact specific to.  Reactive organic gases.  Or ROG.  Nitrous oxides.  Or NOX.  And particulate matter.  Mitigation.  There's an example here of mitigation measure air quality three.  Or AQ3.  It includes.  This is just a snippet.  But there are additional requirements.  That.  Help reduce those pollutants.  Some of these requirements include.  Installation of energy star appliances.  Energy efficient heating and cooling systems.  To minimize those project related emissions.  In addition.  The project is going to be required to offset.  This.  These contribution of ROG NOX and.  Particulate matter.  By purchasing credits.  As part of the air districts offsite.  Mitigation program.  Which would be equal to the project's contribution.  Of these pollutants.  As indicated in this mitigation measure air quality four.  The air district has been very successful in using these funds.  To replace old farm equipment.  For example.  And other types of older inefficient equipment.  To reduce pollutants within the larger air basin.  Construction equipment is another source of toxic air contaminants.  Primarily associated with diesel particulate matter.  This mitigation measure air quality six.  Requires contractors to use cleaner burning energy.  Engines excuse me.  There is a rating system for engines.  Tier four is a very clean burning engine.  Or electric or compressed natural gas.  To reduce those emissions of diesel particulate matter.  In addition.  Air quality seven requires a health risk assessment.  Be prepared for any.  Future uses.  That would create these types of toxic air contaminants.  Such as a gas station.  If that were to be a proposed use.  As Mike.  Talked about earlier.  The site is has a lot of biological resources.  Trees streams.  It has it's definitely a beautiful site.  And the project would impact those resources.  Including potential loss of special status or protected plant and animal.  Species or wildlife species.  Many of the mitigation measures.  Included.  Require compliance with standard.  These include standard requirements to conduct.  A variety of different surveys.  Prior to any site disturbing activities.  The type of species that these surveys would include.  Would be things like nested birds.  Burrowing owl.  Swainson's hawk and bats.  Compliance with best management practices during construction.  Would also be required.  And then the other thing that we would look at.  Is the.  And I want to highlight.  Specifically mitigation measure bio one.  Which addresses the protection of the Butte county meadow foam.  Mike also mentioned.  This mitigation measure includes an operations management plan.  To be prepared in coordination with California department of fish and wildlife.  And includes a variety of requirements.  Specifically.  Maintenance a fund to maintain the preservation of these preserves.  Protocols for ongoing monitoring of the preserves.  And preserve management to ensure the health and viability of the plants.  The mitigation measure includes performance standards that must be met.  To ensure the plants were protected.  And there'll be no net loss.  Mitigation is also included to protect the health of the numerous oak trees.  And other mature trees on the site during construction activities.  As Mike mentioned.  The specific plan calls for a tree preservation program.  That has been prepared.  Consistent with the city's municipal code.  Which provides specific requirements to be followed during construction.  Lastly.  There are over 17 acres of aquatic resources on the site.  Including vernal pools, drainages and seasonal wetlands.  The specific plan directs development away from these biological resources.  Where possible.  However.  Absolute avoidance of wetlands may not be feasible.  Therefore mitigation measure bio 10.  Requires the creation preservation or restoration of any wetlands.  That may be lost.  To development by obtaining permits from the required.  Permitting agencies including potentially the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  California Department of Fish and Wildlife.  Or the regional water board.  And complying with the terms of those permits.  Another issue that Mike also touched on.  Is the concern of wildfire.  The specific plan includes numerous fire wise and vegetation guidelines.  That address building site design.  Fuel management.  The requirements of the homeowners association.  Education for homeowners.  The site is located within a designated moderate fire hazard area.  Wildfire is definitely a concern.  And it will be an ongoing concern during construction and operation of the project.  Therefore we added additional mitigation measures.  Mitigation measure W fire one.  Requires preparation of a construction fire prevention plan.  Consistent with the California building code.  To be provided to all construction contractors.  The specific plan will address training of construction personnel.  And fire suppression procedures.  The plan also identifies potential sources of ignition.  And methods to reduce the risk of ignition during construction.  Work restrictions obviously during red flag or high wind days.  Emergency communication.  Response in the event of a fire.  And on site fire awareness coordinator.  Just to touch upon a few.  Mitigation measure W fire two.  Requires the specific plans fire wise guidelines.  To include maintenance of fuel treatment areas.  Adjacent to trails or roads.  Consistent with California fire code.  Locating all residences within 150 feet of fire access roads.  Per the California fire code.  And requiring all buildings be constructed consistently.  Consistent with the fire resistant building materials.  And standards in compliance with the fire code.  Now I want to touch very briefly on those significant unavoidable impacts.  As I mentioned earlier the environmental impact report includes.  Identifies significant unavoidable impacts in aesthetics.  Related to the permanent change in visual character of the site.  As I mentioned earlier.  And in addition.  The emissions of greenhouse gases.  The specific plan includes numerous goals and actions to reduce greenhouse gases.  Associated with project operation.  And the city's recently adopted climate action plan or cap.  Includes numerous measures to reduce greenhouse gases.  Consistent with the city's goal to reach carbon neutral by 2045.  And the state's goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 1990 levels.  By the year 2040.  However the project would still exceed the city's per capita threshold.  Of greenhouse gases.  Resulting in a significant impact.  Compliance with some of the air quality mitigation measures.  To reduce construction and operational emissions.  Would help to reduce the project's overall greenhouse gas contributions.  But there are no other feasible mitigation measures.  To reduce the impact to less than significant.  In addition.  The project's consistency with other projects.  And other plans to address greenhouse gases.  Including the city's cap.  The Butte County Association of Government's regional transportation plan.  And the California Air Resources Board scoping plan.  Were also evaluated.  To determine how consistent the project was with these plans.  Although the project is generally consistent.  With the goals and policies set forth in these plans.  It still exceeds the city's greenhouse gas reduction threshold.  Affecting the city's ability to reach its goal of carbon neutrality.  By 2045.  And the state's greenhouse gas reduction goals.  There is no other additional mitigation available.  To reduce the project's greenhouse gas emissions.  Therefore the impact remains significant and unavoidable.  And that concludes my brief overview.  Now I'm going to turn it back to Mike.  Thank you Christine.  That was really good.  What's next?  Project merits.  So.  In order to adopt.  Approve a project that has.  Significant unavoidable impacts.  The city has to adopt a statement of overriding considerations.  And that's one of the documents in your packets.  I think it's attachment A2.  Where we prepared some of those.  And a lot of them are similar to what I'm just going to say here.  Part of the project merits involve.  That it helps us implement the general plan.  It's as we showed you.  Part of the general plan.  And the directives that the general plan gives this project to do.  Are reflected and met by the specific plan.  It also provides an inventory of land.  For future housing capacity.  Not all land that's inside the city.  And underdeveloped or undeveloped is for sale.  And we hear a lot from developers that there's.  They don't have enough land to purchase.  To keep the houses coming out that are in demand.  There are very few houses on the market from what I understand.  Provides an actively managed wild land interface.  Meaning that those buffers around the project site.  Will be actively managed through those annual inspections.  And the fuel reduction.  And it will create a hardened edge.  Out past where we have the city now.  As opposed to the other ways that we see the city edges looking.  Where we basically have a road up against the edge.  And that's like a fire break.  And we hope that the.  The fire can't jump the road.  If it were to arrive there.  So this is a comprehensive system to do that.  And it will also provide fire access out past the development.  And that's important for the fire response.  It also provides land for a community park.  And a school site.  The commercial areas will enable job creation and tax revenue.  And this has been an opportunity to comprehensively plan.  And to do that.  And then we also have.  And we rarely get that in the city.  Because.  A lot of it is piecemeal.  We have.  You know.  Developers able to pick up a piece of property.  And they want to develop that piece of property.  And so we might have a sidewalk from nowhere to nowhere.  And none beyond it.  And stuff like that.  So.  This is an organized development that would go.  Sequentially.  From where the roads are right now.  And extend the development.  Up the hill, basically.  From one of the two directions.  Something I didn't mention earlier.  That I do want to get in.  Is that.  If the north half were to start developing first.  They can only build so many units.  They can't build all those 1400 units up there.  As soon as they get to.  I believe it's unit 450.  They have to create the connection road.  That main collector road.  That connects it down to the skyway.  So people would have two ways out.  Before too many units get constructed.  And.  That was just a really.  Good thing for us.  As city planners.  To be able to.  Have.  A.  Ability to comprehensively plan a site.  That takes me down to the staff recommendation.  Actually.  There's one more thing.  I got to talk about the development agreement.  I'm sorry.  I have a three slide diversion here.  Before I can get to the recommendation.  Because.  I don't leave you without going through the development agreement.  A little bit.  It's different than what we see often.  It's basically a contract between the city and the developer.  That.  Sets out.  How this is going to go down.  It.  It.  Kind of.  Sets the rules of the road.  It.  Would have a 20 year term.  It would have a 20 year term.  It would give to the developer vested rights to proceed with development of the property.  Per the plan.  And.  I mean.  We're approving the plan.  So we expect that.  Right.  But it's important for them to know that they have assurances.  To make large investments.  And move forward with the project.  We're not going to change our mind.  In a year.  And say.  Actually.  We don't want that project.  So.  It would give those vested rights.  To proceed.  And it also locks in the laws of the day.  We can't come up with new laws.  And apply those.  Only.  If.  If new laws do.  State or federal laws come into play.  They have to meet those.  As long as it doesn't preclude them from.  Carrying out the project.  As described.  So.  Then there's also.  Importantly.  A section that.  Allows.  A transfer.  Of a chunk of the site.  That would be developed.  And that would be a sort of.  Of a transfer that has obligations with it.  The developer that buys that chunk.  Has to perform.  In the ways that the plan expects for that piece of the property.  And that's different from this termination clauses that we have.  Where if you.  If you buy a developed house out here.  You will.  You will purchase a developed house.  And you won't be subject to the development agreement anymore.  It'll.  It recognizes that if you're the buyer of a fully developed site.  With all the improvements in.  You're not on the hook for these other improvements.  That the development agreement talks about.  It does extend entitlements.  So if we have subdivision maps come forward in the future.  They would have the same life of the development agreement.  Or.  Maybe four years if we're reaching toward the end.  Of the development agreement.  You have to pay all the existing fees.  But the city can't.  In enact new fees and exactions to the project.  Again that goes back to the assurances of.  To the developer for their investment in the project.  This is the.  Abbreviated list of the developer obligations.  They will need to construct all needed improvements.  Some of them are.  Are some of the improvements needed for this project.  Are in the capital.  Improvement program.  And they may happen someday.  But if the developer wants to move forward development.  They would be responsible for providing that infrastructure.  Or waiting for the capital improvement project to come along.  So in that way they have to fund all of their infrastructure.  And then they would also have to dedicate the community park site.  Thirty thirty six acres.  As per usual you do get.  The developer would get a.  A value back for that compensation for dedicating that.  Land.  However.  It is set at ninety thousand dollars an acre.  Which is a very low number for vacant acreage.  So it's a pretty good deal.  Improve trails along roads.  Oh so as we're building roads.  We would build you know the sidewalk next to the road.  But in this case we have.  Class one bike paths that go up the creek over there.  And so the idea here is that we have requirements to where the trail system gets extended easterly.  As the roads get extended easterly.  And then everybody has those options to get to and fro.  Then there's roundabouts required.  Those are recommended by the traffic study.  In order to establish good access at autumn fields way.  And then there's another one needed in the village core that's inside the project next  to the school and near the village core.  And unfortunately we're going to have to construct a signal on the skyway instead of a big roundabout.  We did leave the roundabout.  In fact.  We're going to have to do that in the plan.  Because that option does exist in the future.  If the south gate interchange is able to be constructed in a timely fashion.  Down the road when we're talking about this.  Then we might be or if it looks like it's adequately funded to be arriving in a reasonable  amount of time.  We might go ahead and do the roundabout.  Because it would it wouldn't have the problems that the traffic study saw that it would have  if that interchange were in.  But we can't guarantee that interchange is going to be in.  And that's causing us to require the signal.  Instead there's also required to implement mitigation measure noise six which is basically  if you add enough cars to that road on 20th Street.  If you add enough cars to 20th Street it creates noise impacts from all the traffic.  And this probably will never be necessary.  I'll just say it because when they connect the connect collector road down to the south  it will alleviate the traffic influx on 20th Street.  And we'll have to look at it though.  Down the road around the 2000th unit to see if this is in fact necessary.  The noise study thought it might be to remedy a one decibel over the limit threshold.  So enough about that.  And then there's an affordable housing site required.  That would be a four acre site or multiple sites sufficient to construct 90 units of  affordable housing.  And that's another thing that will have to come later in the project.  Because you're only going to be able to score well and get funding for your affordable housing.  If you have amenities around it.  So it would be great if there was a the village core was up and running and the school was  going and you had the community park.  And it's going to take some time for all those things to come online.  The city doesn't have very many requirements.  We're supposed to expedite the permits.  We do that anyways.  There's a six month grace period built in for building code cycle updates.  So if you have a master plan site that you can replicate very easily you don't have to  get that updated with a building code cycle update.  But you do after six months.  On to the staff recommendation.  So attached to your resolution that we've prepared it would recommend approval to the  city council on seven different resolutions and ordinances.  The first resolution would certify the EIR.  The second would adopt the statement of overriding considerations.  Three is to amend the general plan.  Four would amend the zoning map.  And then the code amendments.  The code amendments would add a little further.  The second would add a section of the code of the valley's edge overlay.  And that section of the code would point people to the plan to look for the rules of the road  on developing the site.  And then it would also adopt a resolution to adopt the valley's edge specific plan and  approve the development agreement.  So that's our recommendation.  And we think the findings can be made.  And there's a bunch of other issues we might get to tonight.  But maybe we could get to the public hearing and hear from the public.  And then have whatever feedback we're hearing maybe help us figure out what order to  go through these different issues.  And staff is here to answer questions.  We would love the opportunity to do that before and after the public hearing.  Thanks, Mike.  Before we get into questions, I neglected to ask for any ex parte communication.  So if we could start to my left.  None.  None.  None.  I did have a brief conversation with Mr. Broward.  All right.  Thank you.  So I'm going to turn it over to Ms. Broward.  Yeah.  I just wanted to note a couple of things.  So after the last public hearing, that was in November 2021 when we first reviewed the  draft EIR where commissioners were asked to kind of step back and ask our questions later.  And listening to the public, I submitted my questions and comments to staff.  And that comment is available to the public along with all the other comments.  It was just noted that I should bring this up for the public's benefit if they want to  read that comment.  And I think that's a good way to end the session.  So in this virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual  and I did get some non-city emails  that I did not respond to.  Okay.  I received several non-city emails  which I too did not respond to  and I have had expert take on conversations  with Bill Broward in regard to the time of build-out.  So I'll add that I received non-city emails  which I didn't.  I think all of us did.  So I'll say I received non-city emails  that I also did not review.  I did not.  Okay.  So a little bit to guide.  Mike, do you have your wonderful slide at the beginning  that showed the process?  Could I ask you to go there?  Just.  Trying to manage time.  Yes.  Perfect.  Okay.  So I think what I'd like to do  is have the commission ask their questions  and maybe at this point  and then open the public hearing if that's okay.  Maybe we take a quick break  after we get through our questions  so we can stretch our legs a little bit.  For the public that's here,  just a little bit about this process  and why it's important.  So I think it's really important  that's set up this way.  So the idea of what we're doing tonight  is the planning commission,  we got a pretty hefty agenda  that we go through and we read ahead of time.  And then, so that's one piece of information that we have.  We don't come in really knowing how we want to vote  or what our decision is,  but we have a lot of questions  that come up from what we read.  So then we have a staff presentation  that helps fill in the blanks.  We don't fill in any blanks that we might have  that helps us to better make our decision.  And then we ask questions of staff  just to kind of set the context for us  of what are some of those pressing questions  that we didn't get answered in the staff presentation  or through the reading.  Then we have the applicant come up  and that's part of the public hearing.  That's really the time for the applicant  to share anything else that we need  that's important for us to make our decision  and we'll ask the applicant questions.  Then we go to the public speakers  and really what that is  is an opportunity for you to share with us  information that would be helpful  in us making our decision.  So I know a lot of times it may seem like,  well, maybe if we all say the same thing,  they'll keep hearing it over and over again.  That's not as helpful to me personally.  I'd like to hear more what are the specific reasons  why we should or we should not.  when we pass a project  or what some potential improvements could be  as we're making our decision  on whether we pass this project or not.  So after that, because the applicant  has put a lot of time and effort into preparing this for us,  they get to come up and say,  here's some things that you might have heard  that aren't entirely accurate  or here are some things that you might have heard  that we're willing to address.  And then we close the public hearing  and we'll make our decision based on that.  But I do want you to know the public hearing,  an opportunity for you to help us make our decision. So as you're starting to prepare  your comments, what's really helpful is what are the key aspects of this project that are good or  bad, that are challenges, that are improvements that you want to see made, or if the project is  great as it is to let us know that. So with that, questions, let's start. And why don't we,  typically we try to do like one question a piece, but maybe let's get all your questions out,  Commissioner Wall, and then we'll just go down the line. Okay, I'll end with the questions. I have a  question. In the report here someplace, it says there's going to be damage to Butte Creek if this  project goes through. One, what would be the damage to Butte Creek? Secondly, there's some concern  about the Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle. Have there ever been any seen in that project property?  Or any adjacent property? And lastly, is there any Butte County metaphone on site? Or is it a  different metaphone? I can answer the last two. I don't know what you mean by impacts to Butte Creek.  I don't either. That's why I'm asking. I would have to get a reference to where we are. We're  talking about in the staff report, but there is elderberry bushes on the site, like growing out of  a rock wall and a couple of those. I don't know if there's beetle activity on the,  but they are large enough to potentially have beetle activity, and that's enough to treat them  the way they're treated. And then, yes, there is Butte County metaphone. The site has been studied  since at least 2008. A bunch of different studies over the years, and they all keep popping up in  the same spot if they're found on a given year. So, yes, there's Butte County metaphone. That's  what that snowman shape in the diagram was supposed to avoid. Okay.  Okay.  Just one question. The Valley Oak subdivision, that's right down the road. Now I'm getting my  subdivisions mixed up here. When was that specific plan approved? Because that changed the skyline  area as well in a similar manner. Oak Valley was approved, kind of took a while. It was kind of  partially approved in 2000 and then partially approved in 2000. And then,  finally approved for development in 2006, 2005. Is that about right to you? Yeah.  Okay. Thank you.  Vice Chair Oberg?  So, I'm not sure that I have. I have one question of staff, and then I have  any number of observations, but I really want to hear from the public before I  offer any of those. So, just a point of clarification having to do with affordable  housing. So, am I understanding correctly that it's a requirement that there's a  So, I'm not sure that there would be 90 units of affordable housing, and I'm not sure how we're  defining affordable housing in that case. So, I'd also like to know that. But 90 out of 2,777 are  required to be affordable? Am I understanding that right? That's my question.  That is the minimum requirement from the development agreement for, yes. And it is defined also in the  development agreement what we mean by affordable housing.  Okay. Thank you.  In the beginning there, it's seven.  Okay. Bottom of page 4 of 47 on Attachment A7, Exhibit 1.  Okay. I think...Mike, I have one question for you, and then I think two  for Christine. So in the development agreement...I don't know if I can get you a  page, but essentially it says the city may review the development agreement annually.  Is that something that we have done in the past? And would there be any? It's required by law. It's  not a may, it's a will. It's a will. We will. It might say may, we will. Okay. It's a requirement.  So all DAs will say that there will be an annual review. Thank you. And then Christine, two  questions for you on the, one on the significant and unavoidable impact of greenhouse gas emissions.  Is there, if we built 2,777 units anywhere in the city of Chico,  would we still have a significant and unavoidable impact of greenhouse gas emissions?  Or is that, is that impact specific to that site?  If you built 2,777 units in downtown Chico, in a more developed portion of the city,  the impact would be a little bit different.  It would be a little bit different to greenhouse gases. Correct. In part, it's associated with  mobile emissions, with vehicle trips. So if you were in an area of the city where you had a lot  of transit options and people used the transit and used bicycles and were not driving their vehicles,  it would be a different, the impact would be different.  But we don't have land to build 2,777 units in downtown Chico.  Okay.  And then similarly, you mentioned, I believe that we are at a, that site is in a moderate  wildlife hazard area.  Moderate fire hazard zone.  Moderate fire. Okay. And then do you have a sense, I know you were really focused on this site,  and maybe this chief, you could weigh in on this, but how much of the city actually is  under that designation?  I don't know the answer to that.  In a moderate,  I don't have an answer to that. I would need to go and look at the maps. I don't know if the fire chief would know that.  It's none. There is a very high zone at the very tip of Bidwell Park.  Okay.  Once you get inside city limits, it's a different map.  Okay.  The state map has a donut hole for cities, and then the city has a map that's special for the city.  The only thing that pops on the city map is way up in the top of Bidwell Park.  Okay.  But, you know, we would expect this to be at least a moderate zone.  Because it came from a map that shows it as a moderate zone.  Yeah, sure.  I guess I'll start with you, Mike.  My understanding is that the build-out in this project is 20, maybe 30 years projected.  Yes, thank you. That was something that I really meant to say, and I think I missed it.  But, yeah, this is a long-term build-out.  So it seems like some big numbers.  But if we're really talking about building 117 single-story,  two-family, and multi-family units a year for 20 years, the city does that.  It already does that in other places.  The reason I ask that is to make sure that I understand that when we're talking the total number of housing units  that are going to be built, they're just not going to plop down the first year.  It could be 200 the fourth year after some of the improvements go in,  and X number the next year, or whatever.  So one of the things I'm wrestling with is how fast things in our society,  how fast things in our society change.  Does the report, the EIR or anything, deal with the fact that maybe 10 years from now,  everybody's going to be having at least one electric car?  I mean, just how much?  No, the EIR is pretty handicapped in that way,  because we had to use a modeling software that we even updated it.  It used the 2020 update to it, cutting-edge technology,  but it still uses 2017 emissions data from cars,  and that emissions data set is only informed by the laws  that were on the books leading up until the 2017 release.  And subsequent to that, there's been another iteration where they've caught more.  And I explained this at the end of the staff report,  where the EIR doesn't rely on things we can't absolutely bank on and guarantee are going to happen.  And that's why it also seems to be divergent from the Climate Action Plan,  because the Climate Action Plan says a bunch of,  if you do this, then you can expect these good outcomes,  and if you achieve these good outcomes, then you'll be on a certain path.  But that's speculative, and we can't do that in an EIR.  We have to...  to see what we can bank on.  Okay, thank you.  Alright, is it my turn?  Right.  I think this is probably a question for the applicant,  but Mike, do you have any insight on how the amount of 55 and over housing was determined?  How many what?  Oh, how it was determined the number of units that would be restricted to age 55 and older.  I do not know that.  Alright, I'll ask the applicant.  And I'll try to scoot up to the mic a bit more.  Okay.  As far as the process for this, tonight, what happens if we have recommended changes, theoretically?  What would the process for that look like?  I think you could recommend, you could adopt the resolution with a couple tweaks.  And then we could just add those, record them, and then we could just add those.  And then we could just add those, record those, and move on to the City Council and report those,  that that was the Planning Commission's recommendation.  There'll be a part of their staff report that talks about this meeting and what the Commission recommended.  Okay, thank you.  Commissioner Cooper, do you have any questions?  Yes, well, one was about the electric cars.  I thought, same thing.  I mean, even me, I looked at this truck now, and I'm like, ooh, electric truck, this is cool.  I never thought I'd have an electric car.  So, yes.  I think that's a good point.  I think that will change, and that's good.  So that would impact a lot of people up there probably having electric cars, electric blowers now, electric everything.  So that would impact.  But to you, Mike, also just want to clarify each, it's like California Park.  I remember years ago when California Park had open land, and then subcontractors came in and did 10 lots or 20 lots.  That's going to come before the Architectural Review Board.  It's going to come before the Planning Commission, each one of those.  That's it.  It goes.  Uh.  Right?  Yeah.  Subdivisions.  So at that point, we can be very specific and more fine-tuned.  So that's going to happen.  And other than reading everything else, the 10,000 pages, I think I covered all the other questions.  So thank you.  I think we're good.  Are we good?  With Mike, you have one more.  Yeah.  How far behind is Chico in housing production on an annual basis, and what do we need to do to bring it up to work?  And where it ought to be?  I'm sure there's a few different ways to answer that question.  We consistently hear that whatever it is happening now, it's not enough.  There's not enough houses on the market, and there's a lot of competition for each of the houses that come up for sale.  I guess we could hear for some realtors tonight, but I don't have any hard data for you off the top of my head here.  Okay.  Because California is almost a million houses short for the population.  And of course, Butte County and Chico will be a little bit more than that.  There's probably several hundred, if not thousands behind in that.  For sure.  We saw the persons per household go up quite a bit since the Camp Fire.  So people are bunking up together, as it would seem, and there may be an appetite to spread back out again if we could deliver the units.  And we did just complete our housing element update, and that was one of my questions is if we've ever met our RHNA numbers.  And we've never met RHNA numbers in the history of the housing element.  So I'm just curious to know if you have any thoughts on that.  Thank you, Mike.  So we're going to take, we've been here for 90 minutes, so we're going to take a quick 10-minute break.  I'd ask that if you are a member of the public and you're super eager to talk to somebody from the planning commission, please don't.  And part of that is I don't want them to have to report any ex parte communication.  But also, even if you're talking about your holiday plans or a great bike ride that you took, it's the appearance of ex parte communication that could be going on.  So 10 minutes.  I'll see you all back here at 740.  Great.  Thank you.  Thank you. Effects Effects Effects Effects  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Thank you. And the same is true with kids. We've also listened to kids, what they want to do on a daily basis. And a lot of them don't want to get in their room and play TikTok. They want to get out of the woods in the forest and play. And the parents want them to do that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  kids. We don't have to get in our car to drive to a neighborhood park.  Valley's Edge wasn't drawn on a map in a Sacramento or Santa Barbara planning office.  It was drawn standing out in the fields, on rocks, looking at trees, taking maps,  and drawing lines around that tree which we want to save, and around this oak woodland which we  want to save, and the streams and creeks. All those things, I mean, it's down to 10 feet what's  open space. There's never been a planning effort like this in the history of Chico.  This is what Chico News and Review back in 2008 called it a remarkable vision for development.  And the architects for this development is the community  in the written description contained in appendix C of the general plan.  Planning shall result in a recreationally oriented mixed-use community with a broad  range of housing types and densities. That's the order that you and the community gave me and my  team. Do that. In this written description, they touched on open space, parks and public uses,  vehicle trail connectivity. They told us kind of what to do, but they didn't tell us where or how  to do it. And we've been able to implement that.  In a very profound way.  We began by developing kind of principles. And these principles developed as the general plan principles,  goals and policies were being adopted.  It shows you how long we've been working at this. This is, the general plan was adopted in 2011.  Number one, implement Chico's general plan.  Number two, the land matters. Listen to it.  That means planning open space for the community.  That means letting nature define what should and should not be changed with the built environment.  Dirt's good.  Play is transformative.  Let's get people back out into nature again.  Let's make it easy for our kids to get to the parks.  Promote healthy and sustainable community.  Let's develop the most resource efficient, the most energy efficient homes in the state of California.  Let's make fire-resistive homes firewise policies.  Compliment hometown Chico.  Let's respect the green light.  Let's build where food doesn't grow.  Let's promote economic vitality.  Let's move our stewardship beyond us to our kids.  Let's cultivate things like heritage of the land and the history.  How to harvest an acorn.  How to plant trees.  What's important on the land that we're preserving.  All those things.  And promote our social vibrance as well, which is why a lot of what we'll see in the specific  plan is those third places to get people energized, those vibrant social cores that happen when  you create those parks and those places, picnic areas, so forth.  The vision.  Is a community in a park.  I want to talk about the importance of open space.  Much of this presentation revolves around open space.  These are the four corridors of Chico.  If we could reimagine how we laid Chico out, we would do our creeks very differently.  We wouldn't have backyards with fences.  We would have wide, open, linear parkways with make it safe for people, kids, to ride their bikes back and forth east and west through the community.  Thank you.  You can't do that anymore in Chico.  Designated bike paths and streets.  If we could redo that, we would be planning open space first, and that's what we did in Valley's Edge.  We planned the open space first.  Planning open space first is we do that to protect the oak trees, to stay away from steep slopes, to protect four miles of heritage rock walls that are out there.  To protect the old doping.  To protect the old mill wagon road.  To preserve metaphone and avoid endangered species.  To protect, again, steep slopes, heritage elements, all those things.  Once we do that, there's an incredible opportunity because that becomes the framework where people connect.  What's left are areas that could be developed.  The question is what should happen in those areas.  And Mr. Salli's presentation addressed some of that.  How the land informs not only what could be developed, but also what type of development should happen in those areas.  Whether it's very low density homes to protect isolated oak trees or whether it's high density apartments adjacent and within the village core or medium density housing.  It's separated into beautiful meadows within the planning area.  You're going to hear some things tonight.  And you're going to hear it's too big.  You're going to hear it's only for luxury.  High end housing for Bay Area people.  You're going to hear it increases wildfire risk.  I hope the chief gets a chance to address that for the audience.  You're going to hear that over a thousand oak trees are going to be cut down.  And that infill and densifying downtown is the only measure of smart growth in the community.  If any of that were true, I would be filling out a comment card and standing up here opposing this proposal.  But the fact is that is not true.  Now we can agree on our opinions based on the facts.  But we cannot invent, I don't believe it's good for public discourse to invent things.  And I can address some of those for you tonight.  Again, let's talk more about parks and open space.  For perspective, city and card, lower Bidwell Park with the active areas in lower Bidwell Park.  Middle Park is the Bidwell Park golf course.  All of community parks, all of Chico's neighborhood parks, all of our mini recreation areas, our pools, our centers, our linear parks and creeks at Greenway.  We have 647 acres of open space for a community of 110,000 people.  Valley's Edge has 732 acres of open space.  That's a big number.  It speaks to the extent to which we respect and want to promote an appreciation of nature and get people back in to enjoy this.  Get people back in to enjoy this.  Get people back outside.  This is the typical development character.  It's relatively free of oak trees.  Not entirely free, but relatively free.  All oak clusters of woodlands are protected.  But these are the hard areas, and Mr. Sully also showed similar photos.  Relatively gradual slopes.  The hillsides have been taken out of it with open space.  The average slope from the Steve Harrison Memorial Bike Trail to the highest point of development is 3.5%.  That's the same slope as the hillside.  That's the same slope as this ramp.  The final, the Master Land Use Plan, and as Mike pointed out, we've made some changes in this as a result of continued conversations with our neighbors and with members of the community and in response to the draft EIR, which I believe strengthened the plan.  750 acres of open space, public uses, parks and preserves.  And one of the more significant changes we made was the creation of the Creek Canyon Preserve, which is preserving the entire mile and a half frontage of Honey Run Road.  There's no housing.  There's no roadways.  It's the largest preserve in the Creek Canyon history, and it's right at the front door.  The development footprint, again, a 250-acre senior village.  And Commissioner Goldstein, you've said this.  I can probably, I'd like to address your question when I finish here.  350 acres of family neighborhoods and about 55 acres in the village core and commercial areas.  Do you have a timer?  Master Trails Plan, I'm going to go right through this.  This is a very welcome front entry.  The Steve Harrison Memorial Bike Trail is the entry to the public space in Valley's Edge and the village core.  Illustrations of the neighborhood parks, tot lots.  Craig, a mountain design group, led this effort.  Our front door, which Mike has talked about.  Amenities like Horseshoe Lake, public parks, picnic areas, the largest community garden in Chico.  Multifamily workforce housing, which I'd like to get into.  Outdoor amphitheater, clubhouses for socialization and swimming, tennis, that sort of thing.  The village core is not.  It's a village scale.  It's not a Safeway.  It's a neighborhood grocer.  And when we talk about luxury housing only, I want you to look at this graph.  11% of the land uses and capacity for housing in Valley's Edge is what we might call luxury housing.  It's estate lots for custom home building.  Workforce housing is 34% of the total.  And single family neighborhoods just under 50%.  About 6% of the housing capacity is for single family.  And the other half of the housing capacity is for multifamily apartments in the village core.  But those are also an allowable use in the 50 acres of commercial ground.  So this understates the amount of apartment and multifamily living in Valley's Edge.  We also talked about, Commissioner Ober, you raised the point about a regulation requiring subsidized housing.  This is our voluntary commitment.  There's no regulation imposed on us for the amount of open space or subsidized housing.  We met with CHIP.  We met with housing providers.  We've met with multiple affordable housing developers and the city housing authority.  We felt this was the right thing to do.  Just like we felt creating the biggest preserve in Butte Creek Canyon was the right thing to do.  That's the Chico way.  This is homegrown plan and that's what we do.  These are examples of workforce housing.  There's 100 acres of this type of housing.  It's over 1,000 units.  Starter homes, entry level homes, small lot homes, attached cottages.  We talk about affordability.  Land is the common denominator.  You need land to build homes and those homes, they can be affordable by design.  Doesn't mean they're subsidized.  It means you're reaching price points that you can't reach in traditional single-family development neighborhoods.  People are right.  It's big.  It's Chico's largest master planned area.  It's the largest network of hiking and biking trails.  The largest community garden.  The largest voluntary oak woodland preserve.  And again, the largest park in Butte Creek Canyon.  It's Chico's first all-electric community.  There was a question earlier commissioned over about whether or not electrification was something that was regulatory.  It's not.  We're doing this voluntarily because we believe that's the direction that our country and our state and our world is going.  We're advancing that commitment.  Just like we advanced the commitment for all solar.  Before that was a regulatory requirement.  It's Chico's first 100% neighborhood electric vehicle community.  And I believe that is going to be a very prominent effort in this area because your daily needs are met within the community.  Local area acknowledgments.  We've been working with the Chico Fire Department for a decade.  Coming up with what are being described as a model for a firewise community.  How we have to be looking at building in the future.  Chico Police Department.  We're the first to implement crime prevention through environmental design.  That's how you design buildings and spaces to be safe and reduce incidents of crime.  We've worked with Chico Unified School District and Chico Area Recreation District to create the first joint use elementary school and community park.  That's been also a decade of effort.  But it's not over yet.  It's not just designing that.  It's designing the trails that lead to those safe places.  Both from outside the property and inside the property.  20 minute neighborhood is a classic definition of smart growth.  Valley's Edge implements every single one of these disciplines.  Local schools, lifelong learning opportunities with OLLI, playgrounds, green spaces, community gardens, sports and rec facilities.  Walk a bit.  Housing diversity.  Ability to age in place.  Affordable housing.  Local transport.  Safe cycling.  You go around this list.  Valley's Edge hits every single one of them.  I want to close with the general plan.  A couple more slides and I'm done.  A lot of us look out and we see these expanses.  Chico's got a lot of area to grow.  Put it someplace else.  Well, here's our sphere of influence.  And this is the green area.  The green line.  40 years it's withstood pressure.  Here's all of our parks, public preserves and environmental preserves.  Here's the two resource conservation areas.  Or what's it?  Resource constrained areas.  And here's the five special planning areas.  When Valley's Edge gets approved, it will complete what we've always described as the growth of the state.  And that's the goal line.  Development will never approach further east.  It cannot.  To the north, you've got conservation easements, public open space.  To the south, you've got topographic constraints.  Valley's Edge, the buffer, the edge to that community and the regional park is there to preclude, as directed by the city, any encroachment further into the foothills.  This is a compact urban form.  And Valley's Edge location is a compact urban form.  And it is right next to Chico's largest employment and shopping region.  That's where you want to put your bedrooms.  You don't want your bedrooms to go down into Orland and Red Bluff and commute in every day.  You want bedrooms to be right next to where we shop and where we get employed.  Downtown would be great.  But it's not going to provide housing like Chico needs.  And it's not going to be right next to where people drive.  We think this is an ideal location for a master plan complex.  And it's not going to be a perfect fit for the community.  I want to thank the team of professionals that have spent a decade working on this.  I want to thank everyone that's come out to the site and given their ideas and their objections.  All of that is what has shaped what's before you tonight.  Happy to address any questions.  Thank you.  How do we start with Commissioner Goldstein's question?  I believe that was, how did you determine how many units were going to be for seniors?  We first started, again, by what does the land say?  So the senior community, we looked at what natural barriers or what natural boundaries they would be.  So we wanted it to be defined by open space, as the rest of the property is.  And that worked out to about 200-some acres.  Now, the primary demand for active senior communities is single-family detached housing.  After the Camp Fire, we saw the need to provide a higher density product.  And that was, again, to reach that lower level of affordability with what's referred to as senior cottages.  It usually attracts kind of what we call super seniors.  And they're smaller, 750 square feet.  And so we dedicated a good deal of that to medium density, which is the same prototype I showed you previously.  Cluster housing, small lot housing.  Getting down to those affordable homes.  And affordable by design concepts.  So if you add up traditional density for single-family detached and those medium density cottage products,  it works out to, that's how we determine units.  Listen to land first.  Listen to the market.  And then plan it close to the core.  Thank you.  Are there any other questions for the applicant?  Commissioner Wall?  Bill, what would be the necessary housing production over the next 20 to 30 years?  To keep up with the population growth of Chico?  The last graph I looked at had, depending on what you look at per person per unit, and I don't know what the future holds.  I'm not a fortune teller.  But it was about 850 units per year.  Based on what I saw.  And Chico has really never produced that much.  And the short, the inability to provide entitled land is one of the reasons.  But it's also market demand.  I mean, no one's building houses before there's a stated demand.  In July, there were 10, there were 1,000 qualified homebuyers competing for 10 homes.  That's a bad model to have for affordability.  It's driving young families out of the community.  Ultimately, that kind of a model where we're not keeping up with supply is going to gentrify our community.  Young families are going to move out.  You know, more people retired.  That can afford it, move in.  And that's how we lose our affordability.  By not planning for our future.  Not having a plan to accommodate a natural growing population.  About how long do you estimate the build out of this plan to be?  Well, I think if somehow, if somehow they're away, it'll be ever.  Never.  Admittedly.  It'll be years before a plan like this is ready to develop any part of it.  Four years maybe.  And then, again, it happens in response to market demand.  I was involved in California Park in the early 80s.  And that came to Chico in 1970, March of 1970.  It's taken 50 years to build out.  50 years.  Valley's Edge is significantly larger than California Park.  But today, you look at California Park and you see 60-foot trees.  You've got an urban landscape.  You can't see barely any rooftops.  It's the same ground, the same lava cap that Valley's Edge is.  It'll take a while to build that landscape.  But it happens.  And to me, I mean, I think it's 20, 30, 40 years.  The EIR has to be very conservative.  I think the EIR looks at 20 years.  But in my estimation, it would take quite a bit longer than that.  So the point is, it's not like something that's going to be built in the future.  It's going to be built in the future.  And I think something's going to be dropped in on us in the next two years.  And we've got 2,700 new units to contend with.  It's going to be over a long period of time as the community dictates.  In a decade, you won't see much of an impact.  In two or three decades, two or three generations down the road, the community will evolve.  But this is a long term.  When I say long term, as a planner, I want to think three and four generations down the road.  I don't want to think about next year.  How do we get that kind of run up to our community so we can plan our infrastructure?  You have to think in multiple generations.  So it's going to take generations for this area to develop.  And again, it's not a project where someone's going to develop.  It's a planning area that will have generations of planners and builders and home buyers and renters.  Thank you.  It's a long term product.  And that's why I think thinking large when we master plan to make sure trails go places,  you have to have a large canvas.  You can't do much on a two acre site.  You can do a lot on a 1,450 acre site.  Well, I think you've got a very detailed and comprehensive and thorough report  and a plan to work on for the next half of your life.  And the only thing I think is missing from your plan is an airfield.  So I think you're going to have to think about that.  Thank you.  Any other questions to my left?  To my right?  No?  Okay.  So we have 45 speakers.  And I'm trying to balance out.  It's now 8-12.  So we need to balance being able to hear from everybody and everybody having time to do that.  And also people being probably want to see how our decision is going to unfold.  So keeping them here.  We typically are allowed to give our speakers one minute, two minutes, or three minutes.  Is there any will from the commission on where we might fall on that?  Two?  Okay.  So great.  So we will do two minutes.  And we will, that's still going to be a significant amount of time that will be in this room.  So we'll try to take a break probably around speaker, we'll say probably around speaker 20.  We'll do that.  So let's start with the first speaker.  And then to just help move the process along, a couple things.  One, if the next speaker could queue just right behind the speaker.  And then, you know, if you have any questions, you can just ask them.  Please no clapping.  If you would like to show your support, I'm all in favor of the hand waving.  That's helpful.  But just no clapping so we can keep moving through.  Ready?  Yep.  First speaker is Noah Zappi.  And next is Elizabeth Devereaux.  Okay.  Noah, come on down.  Yeah. You have to.  All right. I'll try my best to be extremely loud. Normally I'm pretty soft spoken.  But hello, my name is Noah Zoppe and I'm a resident here in Chico. I am 22 years old  and I have lived in and around Chico my whole life. Today I'm speaking in favor of Valley's  Edge because I look to Valley's Edge as an opportunity for our community to grow for  generations like mine and many more to come. We need economic growth opportunities and housing  here in Chico. A few positives I want to highlight tonight are as follows. Valley's Edge is a perfect  example of how planning can both preserve land and provide housing and commercial space.  Over half the project is open space by going bigger and looking at the entire 1,446 acres.  It allows for us to preserve the open space and for buildings to coexist. In this case,  bigger is better. The EIR shows there is zero percent impact on endangered species,  which is extremely rare for a development of this size.  For my experience,  living in Chico, the opportunity to take this land and provide a place for us to live,  work, and play feels like it doesn't get any more Chico than that.  From a development standpoint, the EIR points out that Valley's Edge is built with sustainable  building materials, is an all-electric community, and is walkable and bikeable.  The plan creates an outlook on not just what we need today, but what we will need in the future.  We can sleep well knowing it will be done right.  Valley's Edge is good for Chico, and it is as close to being perfectly planned with the lowest amount of environmental impacts we could hope for.  I know we all view development differently here, but I hope we can all agree on one thing tonight.  The Valley's Edge team has gone above and beyond to ensure this development puts community and quality of life first.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Elizabeth?  Yes.  Elizabeth Devereaux, then Joshua Pierce.  Thank you.  I will say as a start that I've known Bill Broward for many years, and I like him.  And I disagree with him though.  And I think part of it is that I envision, I have a very different vision of how Chico should grow,  and that is smart growth in underutilized spaces,  both in downtown and right near Park Avenue, Mangrove, and so Kmart, those areas.  I will say as a resident of Butte Creek Canyon, there would be heavy traffic on Skyway and Bruce Road,  and they estimate 23,000 car trips a day, which would permanently shift our air quality in Butte Creek Canyon.  The runoff would send water and pesticide runoff to the area.  And that would be a very, very big deal.  And that would be a very, very big deal.  We are in a very desperate situation in this area.  We are in a desperate situation in this area.  I'm worried about evacuation in Butte Creek Canyon and certainly with Skyway and Bruce Road.  So water, we're on a well, as many residents in the canyon.  And in this mega drought, with instructions to ration water, 5,600 plus residents would definitely lower the groundwater and many wells in our canyon would go dry.  In terms of aesthetics, aesthetics doesn't only apply to design guidelines and development standards.  It applies to the land itself.  It would result in changing forever the visual character of Chico.  And Valley's Edge would have significant and unavoidable impacts on aesthetics.  And the impacts on aesthetics cannot be mitigated to be less than significant.  The only way the impact on aesthetics...  is avoidable is by the no project alternative.  Thank you.  Just for our speakers, we're going a little bit over.  So if you could, right behind me is the timer.  You can see it go red.  If you could wrap up your comments by the time it's read.  So the red isn't like a yield and now you have five more seconds.  I got to have you wrapped up by then.  I just want to queue up.  This is Josh Pierce and then Greg Milton.  Mr. Pierce.  Thank you for your time.  I had some prepared statements and after hearing some of Bill's comments, I decided to put them away.  I've spent the better part of 25 years banging my head against the wall trying to convince planners, developers and builders to improve the way that they build their homes.  To improve the kind of planning that they do.  To achieve a more accurate and sustainable development.  To create a more equitable future for my kids and the next generation.  I've been working really hard for a long time.  With people who are not always willing to look forward.  And I've had the pleasure of working briefly with Bill on Valley's Edge.  And I can say with some level of authority that I have not seen a more thoughtful, more...  Not intelligent, but more intentional...  Plan that has incorporated so much of the community's involvement in my 25 professional years working in sustainable development.  The rest of my comments I think will be heard by other folks presenting today, talking today.  I can also say that I'm really looking forward to retiring in Valley's Edge and riding my electric bike to see my grandchildren and take them to the local school.  Before I go down to the coffee shop and sit down and argue with my...  Grumpy old friend Mark about my neighbor's noisy chickens.  So thank you for your time.  Greg Melton and Marty Dunlop.  My name is Greg Melton. I'm a landscape architect and a recreation planner.  And I'm very proud to be part of the Valley's Edge project.  I work on a lot of projects from Truckee to Eureka to the Bay.  And this is one that I've...  I definitely have been very, very proud to be engaged with.  I've lived in Chico since 1984.  I was 22 when I got here, wherever that first guy was.  And now I've lived here for almost 40 years.  I came here from the Monterey area because I love Northern California.  And when we looked at this project, we looked at the essence of Bidwell Park.  And when I came here, Bidwell Park was why I stayed.  And I love that open space.  And I love that open space.  And now we have an opportunity to recreate that.  And that's...  As one of the planners, that's what we really, really grasped onto,  was the essence of Bidwell Park and the quality of life that Bidwell Park supports.  What if we didn't have Bidwell Park?  700 new acres of parkland.  This is unprecedented in any development I've ever worked in.  We're matching Chico's parks.  So...  It just creates the quality of life that we're looking for.  Recreation and education.  We met with Chico Unified School District.  I've met with CARD.  They're here tonight.  We really listened.  We did what we could to really pull that together.  With the school, we located the school center of the site.  Safe access, trails, and safety for our kids to get back to school without mom having to take them to school.  Or dad.  Finally, I want to thank you all.  Finally, wellness and way of life.  This project goes way beyond codes and ordinances.  It takes it beyond what is required by a developer.  And in my mind, this project sets a new standard for the park.  I would live there.  Would you live there?  Thank you.  Marty Dunlap and then Suzanne Racina Hutton.  I'm Marty Dunlap and I've lived in Chico for over 50 years.  And I have to say that the thing that I like most about Chico is the compactness and the small town feeling.  And so when I hear about Valley's Edge, I become concerned about sprawling out and what that means.  Because areas that have a lot of housing developments that are spread throughout an area tend to make me feel uncomfortable.  I see six different areas.  I appreciate the time that both the city and Mr. Broward has put in.  There's some real thoughtfulness that have gone into this.  But my concerns have to do with traffic, fire safety, does it meet the housing needs of Chico, water availability, loss of habitat for plants and animals, as well as the loss of open space.  I want to speak first, though, to water availability.  I have studied the water issues in Chico for quite a while.  And although I'm not sure what the real problem is, I think it's important to understand that there's a lot of water availability in Chico.  And although there has been assurances from Cal Water that there will be adequate water for 20 years, I don't think so.  The Vina sub basin has been known to be in overdraft.  The Lower Tuscan is also underneath it and known to be in overdraft.  Yes, Cal Water will put in deeper wells, and they can afford to do that.  But the people who live in this area that are on domestic wells and the small farmers, their wells are going to go dry.  And so what type of guarantees or protections do they have?  I think a risk analysis does need to be conducted on the hydrology of the property so that we know what are we looking at here in terms of the precariousness of drawing down our groundwater any further.  In conclusion, I just want to say I think that Valley's Edge is a development that doesn't really serve the housing needs of Chico.  Over the last eight years, 82% of the permits have been for above average housing.  And 60% in the last year have been above average.  We need affordable housing.  I have three questions for both, probably the developer.  One is what percentage of the open space will be available to the public, the 732 acres?  And then what's the estimated cost of the housing for the workforce housing?  And what's the estimated cost for the single family housing?  And so maybe that can be addressed later.  Thank you.  Suzanne Huttin and then Sarah Salisbury.  Good evening.  I live in Stillson Canyon and have experience with the landscape in which Valley Edge is proposed.  You may not be aware, but the campfire burned into Stillson Canyon.  And our dear neighbor lost his home to the fire.  His lot is contiguous with Valley's Edge boundary.  Our neighbor directly across the street's well has run dry.  For Thanksgiving.  She had to run a hose from next door.  She has a water tank that needs filling regularly.  In fact, in recent years, many neighbors have had to drill deeper wells.  We have rich wildlife, including deer, bobcat, ring tail, skunk, bats, raccoon, more than 70 species of birds.  And we have bears.  In the canyon, we've actually modified our garbage pickup time to dissuade the bears.  When I walk in the canyon, I often carry an air horn with me.  And to get anywhere in Chico, we in the canyon drive.  There is no bus or easy bike path.  The impacts are real.  Valley Edge development will harm habitats.  It's planned for an active fire area.  Water is precious.  And air, the increased traffic will harm the air.  2,777 units is not a new neighborhood.  It is a new town.  Please don't approve this development.  The foothills are wild lands, important lands, a fire buffer, and a home to wildlife.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sarah Salisbury and then Gabrielle Broesch.  2,777 units.  Every one of these is going to have a toilet.  Everyone is going to have bathing.  Everyone is probably going to have a washing machine.  So on and so forth.  The water, the water, the water.  I'm not hearing where that water is going to come from.  I'm hearing from Cal Water.  I don't trust it, frankly.  Okay, think about the water.  We need more information about the water.  Workforce housing is super, super important.  What did we hear?  We heard 90 units.  Where's my notes?  Four acres and 90 units.  That's not enough out of all the units that are planned.  Workforce people make our lives good every single day.  They take our money at the gas station.  They are the tellers at our banks.  They're the CNAs.  They're the teacher's aides.  We need more workforce housing in a project this big than Mr. Brower discussed with us today.  I paid taxes in the city of Chico for 23 years now.  I know there are a lot of people here.  It's been longer.  I overlapped with 47 years of paying taxes.  I'm not going to go back to the county.  And I feel like the needs and desires of those of us who have invested in this community,  this extant community for all that time, are not being respected by the idea of taking  up this open space.  Yeah, there's going to be patches of open space, but not that feeling of, I can breathe,  right?  Where are the eagles going to land and the ancient oaks?  I don't think they're going to go around all these houses.  It's going to ruin the character.  It's going to spoil, okay?  I don't want to say ruin is too strong.  But it's going to spoil the character of the town that I've devoted the greater part of  my life to living in.  And I'm really, really disappointed about this concept looking like happy stuff for  people.  I don't think it's a good idea.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Gabrielle Broesch and then Jacqueline Chase.  This is the first time I've done anything like this.  So excuse my vibrational.  My vibratory.  So I'm going to read from my written notes.  So Valley Edge's development is wrong.  The final environmental impact report is legally inadequate.  And that's a quote from the attorney from the Sierra Club.  It gives way to a lack of confidence for the whole Valley Edge specific plan.  The development will significantly stress our water supply.  It's time to conserve, not exploit.  It's been determined by the Department of Water Resource that the site of recharge for  the Tuscan aquifer lies on the eastern side of the Sacramento Valley through the Foothill  regions.  The Valley Edge will destroy the natural beauty and the habitat and nature.  The environmental consultant failed to identify numerous species of concerns that exist on  the property.  Valley Edge is not good, excuse me, for the citizens of Butte County and wildlife.  It doesn't reflect our values and why we live here.  Are we going to sacrifice this all for developers?  No one's asked the profit margin for this big dream that's going on.  This is precious land and we must remain open for wildlife and generations to come.  This land needs to be put into preservation.  We're all loving this land.  Well, let's just wait.  We're all going to preserve it.  I do not recommend Valley Edge specific plan, the final, and the final environmental impact  report.  This land does matter and listen to it.  Thank you.  CHAIR CALLIN CHASE AND THEN GAIL WOMACK.  GOOD EVENING, COMMISSIONERS AND STAFF.  THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR INPUT.  I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS WITH THE PROJECT WHICH ARE PERTINENT TO THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE.  I'VE READ DEEPLY INTO THE FINAL EIR AND THAT'S WHERE I'M KIND OF DRAWING MY COMMENTS, ESPECIALLY  THE SECTION MASTER RESPONSE WILDFIRE, WHICH I BELIEVE WAS ADDED AFTER THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT  CONCERN EXPRESSED BY PEOPLE LAST YEAR ABOUT THE PROJECT.  AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE POINTS THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY NOW IN CASE I DON'T GET TO  THEM ALL.  ONE IS THAT THE PROJECT, I BELIEVE, MISLEADS THE PUBLIC AS BEING A PROJECT.  AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PROJECT THAT'S BEING RESPONSIBLE, REASONABLY SAFE.  I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN REALLY SAY THAT ANYMORE ABOUT AREAS IN WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE  COMMUNITIES.  THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO GET TO IS THAT I THINK THAT THE STUDY ALSO KIND OF CHERRY  PICKS AND MISREPRESENTS CURRENT WILDFIRE URBAN INTERFACE RESEARCH, SAYING THAT THERE ARE  PEOPLE OUT THERE ACTUALLY KIND OF PROMOTING AND PROVIDING A RESEARCH THAT IS NOT A PROJECT.  AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE MESSAGE FROM MOST OF THOSE RESEARCHERS IS,  THAT IT'S OKAY TO BUILD.  I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE FIREWISE, YOU KNOW, COMPONENTS ARE REALLY MEANT TO ADDRESS RETROFITTING  AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO REBUILD IN FIRE AREAS.  SO THOSE ARE THE THREE POINTS.  THE FIRST ONE ABOUT THE MISLEADING, I THINK THAT WE JUST SAID THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF  need to look at some of the cases of suburban fires in the last few years in our own area  reading um of course um santa rosa where they said these these communities were built to resist fire  and guess what um furniture set on fire you know there's always going to be something that happens  so that's those are my points thank you gail womack and then gracie marvin  well i approve of valley's edge i have been following the development of valley's edge for  the past four years i have attended meetings at the site had the opportunity to be driven around  the property shown where future building sites will be and discuss the issues of the trees  water fire and natural preservation i'm also an environmentalist and i see where valley's edge  has extended its concepts over the past  four years and i hope that will continue to be a part of the development of valley's edge  14 years to incorporate the concerns of our community.  I approve of their expanded plan and support the need for housing for all of Chico.  Chico needs Valley's Edge development.  Thank you.  Grace.  First of all, I don't think we need to build a whole other community,  a HOA community separate for most of us.  We need to fix the one we have right here.  Valley's Edge does not, nor does Valley's Edge adequately address diminishing groundwater,  the need for very clear evacuation plans,  and what to do about the loss of groundwater and power during a fire.  Planners even admitted that there are unavoidable effects on greenhouse gases and visual elements.  Moreover, the Butte Regional Conservation Plan should be completed  before valid mitigation measures can be addressed.  Why do we need to build 2,777 Valley's Edge units on annexed land in the WUI  to house more than 6,000 people?  According to the Chico housing element,  the city's population will be only 3.  3,164 people between 2020 and 2040.  It has gone way down after the Camp Fire years.  Valley's Edge homes would be unaffordable for thousands of Chicoans currently needing housing,  but would be designed to attract well-off outsiders.  And costs to maintain streets, traffic, and lights would rise for Chico.  Chico's job is to build a sustainable, sustainable community.  The general plan, moreover, calls for affordable housing.  In recent years, more than twice as much housing was built to meet the demands of above-moderate income level.  And we can see in the housing element the city fell far short of meeting the demand for 7,000 affordable homes.  We need to use our resources for a smart growth approach mirrored in recent legislation  that addresses greenhouse gases and environmental issues.  We need to find ways to helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps helps  I've been working with Bill on the Ballot's Edge plan 10 of the 14 years that he's been  working on it.  And I will say that when we started, we both had a lot less gray hair.  But we're—a lot of effort was gone into the plan.  One of the distinctions that I just wanted to touch on and help answer Bill—touch on  briefly was the location and the amount of senior housing that we're proposing to put  in.  And one of the critical elements is some of the amenities that you need within, say,  the Dale Webb-type community for the clubhouse, for the trails, for the parks.  You need roughly about 1,000 units to be able to support that type of endeavor.  And you need to have it located close within itself.  And that was kind of the genesis of the plan, where we decided on the amount and the number  of senior houses for the community.  In terms of census numbers today, city of Chico, proper, excluding Butte County, there's  about 22,000 residents that are of retirement age.  By 2030, that's going to increase by another 10,000.  A lot of the seniors—my parents just went through this recently—they had to leave  their home because it was no longer a good place for them to live.  So trip hazards, two stories.  They end up moving to Nevada and moved into a senior community there because there was  nothing there for them as an option.  I would hate for that to happen to the senior population in Chico.  I would have them shipped off, grandma, somewhere into Arizona or Nevada and Boise, when they  could stay here in Chico, a great place in Valley's Edge, with good social connectivity  to their friends and family.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ken Sobin and then Austin Barron.  Thank you.  Good evening.  My name is Ken Sobin.  I'm the president of AltaCal Audubon Society.  I'm also an ornithologist, and I study a species of special concern, the northern saw-wood  owl.  When they say that open space is—it talks so much about open space, but when you have  the open space, the overlay is very misleading because the birds that I study migrate through  the area.  They need to perch in a tree and roost overnight, and then they go into the grassland to feed.  That's a good question.  That's a good question.  When there are homes in the grasslands where they would be feeding, that does not help  these birds that need to refuel before they move beyond Butte County.  So the overlay is pretty, it's sexy, but it's not really biologically accurate.  It does not support biodiversity, and that's the most important thing.  The pictures of the rocky grassland, that is vital habitat, although it looks like you  wouldn't want to plant a garden there.  Lots of animals, lots of species live in that area that need those rocks to hide underneath,  that perch on top of those rocks.  Seven hundred and fifty acres is not open space for Chico.  It is open space for HOA, paying HOA members.  And then someone said, I want to retire.  It's not affordable.  That's the goal of some of the designers, to move there and retire.  But it's not.  It's not available for the general population.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Austin Barron, then Susan Teshutti.  Good evening, commissioners.  Thanks for donating your time here in this long meeting tonight.  And my name is Austin Barron.  I'm a local commercial real estate agent as well as an architectural review board member.  And I'm here to talk about the  The  The !  And I support Valley's Edge.  You know, when I look at Chico, the one thing I see is a need for housing.  I see it as a real estate agent.  I see it as a resident of Chico.  I see it all over the place.  And it's really unfortunate that we're struggling to develop these housing elements here in these subdivisions that we're running out of land.  So I think approving this specific plan is a way to create more housing for workforce people, for affordable people, for our seniors.  I like that it really encompasses everything like that.  Environmental concerns.  You know, I hear it.  I read pretty deep into that report and as much as I could.  One thing I noticed was, you know, a lot of people commented on sustainability.  I spotted owls and the woodpeckers as well.  And I looked into, you know, potential habitats that those animals could live in.  The entire city of Chico was lit up green with that habitat.  So I know there's some concerns about existing burrowing owls.  But, you know, the whole city of Chico is a potential habitat for those animals.  So I would recommend approving this plan.  I hope to move there one day.  And I hope to see this come true.  Thank you.  Susan Tshuti, Nancy McCune.  My name is Susan Tshuti.  I have some prepared remarks.  But first I just want to make a few comments in response to Bill Brower's wonderful presentation.  I went to the first scoping meeting in 2019.  And I thought, oh, my God, this is the most beautiful community I have ever seen.  And it is.  It's stunningly beautiful.  All of these parks and waterways and trails.  But it's the wrong time and the wrong place.  This is a 50s vision.  It's not a 2022 vision or a 2040 vision.  In fact, it will be even worse in 20 years out from now because we have diminishing resources.  We have stresses to our environment.  And this kind of project, as beautiful as it is, is not appropriate.  It's not appropriate for where we live.  I have two questions.  And I think they were already brought up.  But one of them is, what are the prices of the workforce housing?  Because I don't think that they're cheap.  And the second question is, I forgot.  It was really important, too.  But I want to quickly, the greenhouse grass emissions created by this massive village next to Chico.  Are unmitigatable.  We know that.  This alone is cause to reject the plan.  It would be irresponsible to move forth on this plan.  We have some aspirational ideas.  We'll have more electric cars.  Or we'll have electric cars within the unit.  Or people can go on buses, which won't come out there.  There'll be vans.  It's aspirational.  It's not real.  23,000 daily car trips.  Well, exacerbate the traffic.  You know we already have in Chico.  And the statement of overriding considerations in the staff report is weak, I believe, when compared to the existential threat of climate change.  We can't ignore it.  Nancy McCune.  Next after Nancy will be Eric Nilsen.  Good evening.  Yeah, people care about the environment.  In fact, a lot of people are getting.  A therapy for climate anxiety.  And I just don't think that.  You know, we've heard about the car trips and the mitigating factors of using, you know, electric high appliances is going to really mitigate the.  The greenhouse gases from the 23,000 or 29,000 car trips.  I.  I.  I think that.  You know, buying, you know, setting off setting credits is not going to clean our air.  And I'd like to make a distinction between having your kids play out in nature, IE roomed landscaped parks and really getting out into nature and wildlife.  They're just not the same.  This is grassland that the birds need that.  I've lived in Butte Creek Canyon for almost 20 years.  I worked on the Butte Creek Canyon overlay.  We were told this land would always be green.  And then we were told that it would always be agricultural, which it isn't.  And.  We have apex predators of Butte Creek Canyon.  One of those is the bear and lots of other animals that depend on the salmon.  There was a question about what's the harm to Butte Creek.  Well, 40 miles of paved roads.  The tire particulate is particularly deadly to Chinook salmon.  All that runoff.  The retention.  There was no talk about the retention pods.  All that runoff.  If there was, you know, over.  Flow from those retention plans goes into Butte Creek and we won't have Chinook salmon  in the creek.  They will be gone.  So I think there's a lot of things like other people have talked about the fire safety.  I evacuated from Butte Creek Canyon.  Very scary.  You're going to put more and more people and a hospital and another high school there and  expect us all to get out.  I don't think so.  Eric Nelson and then Ann Ponzio.  I'm sorry.  I'm a member a board member of the environmental council and the environmental council's mission  is to protect and defend the land air and water of Butte County and the surrounding  region through action, advocacy and education.  B.E.C.  Butte Environmental Council opposes the values that development because it is the antithesis  to this mission.  It will add significant carbon to the air.  We breathe and hinder Chico's goals in the climate action plan.  Chico climate action plan while adding traffic control.  equivalent to 23,000 vehicle miles traveled per day.  It will increase significant stress to an already overdrafted water basin,  water that serves the residents of Chico and farmers.  It will eliminate an important wildfire barrier that currently protects Chico citizens.  It served as a buffer from the campfire and has burned several times in the last 15 years.  It will result in the loss of 1,000 blue oak trees and hundreds of acres of habitat,  home to many species critical to the natural landscape's health.  It does not address the needs of Chico's housing as documented by the projected housing needed in Chico,  2022-30 draft housing element.  I would direct Commissioner Wall and the rest of you to read that plan.  It gives you hard numbers about the kind of housing that's needed in Chico,  and the Valley Edge development does not satisfy that need.  Valley's Edge is not good for Chico.  We advocate for smart and thoughtful growth.  It focuses on infill, rezoning, repurposing, and redevelopment.  A vision that will ensure a clean, healthy, and sustainable community for all of us and for future generations.  Thank you.  Ann Ponzio and then John Howlett.  Good evening, and I want to thank you all for your service to our community  by sitting on this commission and the staff for all your hard work.  I'm speaking in opposition to Valley's Edge,  and I've actually kind of thrown away my notes, which is a little scary,  but I'm a transplant from the North Bay, from the Greater Bay Area, 20 years ago.  Very fortunate by choice to be able to live here, because I wanted to live in Chico,  and I wanted to live in the Chico that was just described in the ER  when they had the column about why we love Chico.  It was the column,  and the common theme was small town, quirky, engaged community.  Community, community, community.  So my main question here is that this is truly probably a visionary,  I don't think it's the right vision for this time,  and brilliant planning, but what's going to happen to the rest of the Chico?  So do we want Chico? want Chico to follow in the same kind of directions that the Bay Area did? Is that what we want to create? Because that's what we will create.  Do we want Chico?  in San Rosa, I saw these kind of developments,  and they're lovely and the people who live there have a very pleasant life.  I saw them grow.  I saw the downtown deteriorate.  I saw the sense of community to be really changed.  And I also saw them burn down, by the way.  So those are my off-the-cuff comments.  I'm wondering if there's anything else I wanted to say here.  No, that's about it.  I think it's the wrong direction for Chico.  I think we'll regret it.  I also don't understand why we're saying that smart growth can't meet our needs  because that's what all the cities are trying to do now  to correct the mistakes they made when they went to this kind of development.  Thank you very much.  Chair Scott, next will be, after John Hallow, will be Leonard Gunner,  and that is our 20th speaker.  Thank you.  Good evening.  On October 10th of this year,  State Attorney General Rob Bonta released a report entitled  Guidance to Local Governments to Mitigate Wildfire Risk from Proposed Development in Fire-Pwned Areas.  I'm not sure if staff or any of the commissioners have read that report,  but I wanted to read you some of the highlights that are mentioned from that report  as they relate directly to the application you have before you tonight.  Since 2010,  wildfires have killed nearly 150 people in California,  including, and since 2005,  97,000 structures requiring mass evacuations  and exacerbating California's housing crisis.  The report goes on to state,  recent changes in fire frequency, intensity, and location  are posing increasing threats to the residents and environment of California.  More acres of California have burned in the past decade  than in the previous 90 years.  The climate crisis is here,  and with it comes increasingly frequent and severe wildfires that face,  force mass evacuations,  as we have seen here in this county,  destroy homes,  lead to tragic loss of life.  We must build in a way that recognizes this reality.  This guidance is intended to provide local governments  with concrete considerations and specific mitigation measures  for developments in wildfire-prone areas that,  so five, ten, twenty years down the line,  were not faced with a catastrophe that could have been avoided.  Specifically, the topography of this area  is what's caused it to burn four times since 1980.  Fires are going to continue.  It doesn't matter what you put there.  It doesn't matter how fireproof you make them.  You build there, you put people there,  the area is going to burn.  You'll be putting residents and public safety people.  You're going to be putting people at risk.  So if you're willing to roll the dice  and say that may not happen,  then you can vote yes.  But in the eight years that I spent on your commission up here,  most importantly was,  don't make any harmful decisions to residents  or to the public in any way.  And I hope that you'll stick with that philosophy  as you make your decision tonight.  Thank you.  Leonard Gunnert.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I moved here in the 80s,  and before that, I lived all over California.  I lived in Sacramento.  I grew up in Lodi.  I lived in Los Angeles,  fighting the 405 traffic.  And I even lived in San Jose.  And when I first moved here,  there was a movement  to maintain the green line called No Way San Jose,  and I'm sure many of you remember that.  And the reason I moved here was for a job, of course,  but beyond that, I wanted to get away from the rat race.  And in my opinion,  this would go towards bringing back the rat race.  And by that, I mean all the things  that people have already mentioned.  Traffic, number one.  And if you think traffic is bad,  it's bad now.  Wait till this thing gets built.  And there's so many problems with it,  and I know that a lot of people put a lot of work into it,  trying to make it better.  But I think it could be even better than it is.  And I really encourage you guys not to just, you know,  rubber stamp it, send it forward in the name of growth,  because growth is not automatically all about growth.  It's always good.  You know, we've heard the term smart growth,  and I don't think this meets that bar.  I don't think that meets that standard.  And I only have a short time here,  but all of the things that are in there,  you know, things such as traffic,  greenhouse gases, congestion,  a lack of, a glaring lack of affordable housing,  I think about 1% of this plan would be zoned low density.  I mean, I'm sorry, high density or medium high density.  And that's unacceptable.  We need to get people off the streets.  We need more affordable housing.  So please consider these things before you rubber stamp it.  Okay?  Thank you.  Okay.  We are going to take,  say, a seven-minute break.  If you can let the commission maybe utilize the facilities first  so that we can get them back.  I'm going to start at 9.03,  whether you're in your chairs or not.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening.  I think it's still evening, Commissioners.  Thank you so much for your time.  Thank you for this wonderful presentation.  As people have said earlier,  this presentation is highly aspirational.  It's not terribly practical.  By the reporters today's current statement that Chico is close to built out,  it makes no sense to me to take our insurance card, the largest insurance card, and spend it now.  Where will development go for two generations down the line?  Is the Green Line going to be sacrificed?  Can we move up the valley for future development?  No.  The only option is grow up.  We should be growing up now.  We have ample vacant lands, underutilized lands within the city limit  that would allow for denser neighborhood growth throughout Chico.  As other people have said,  this is arguably the largest,  the largest development Chico has seen since Chico was established.  We need to take our time, get it right.  Don't squander this resource.  I'm a parks person.  I'm a retired professional parks manager.  I have great concern for the amount of environmental overlay done in the environmental impact report.  When you talk about open space, are you talking about developed parks?  That would be a great question.  I think it would be totally inappropriate to use this land for that purpose.  To put grass and trees and soccer pitches on this land would be one incredibly costly,  impractical, and unfeasible to maintain.  In addition, I think there's one thing missing from the EIR,  and I'll say this really quickly,  there needs to be an economic impact report.  The citizens need to understand all this open space,  all this new infrastructure.  How does the city plan to maintain it?  That piece is woefully missing.  We are not maintaining what we currently have.  Why would you take on more at this time?  Thank you.  Steve Rockwell and then Ann Anderson.  Evening.  Can you hear me?  I have asthma today, so I'm having a tough time.  I wanted to speak to two items.  One, I think it's important to note that the city has reported  that this plan will not address our housing needs.  Only 3% of the projected housing will be for affordable,  and it won't be built for 20 or 30 years.  That does nothing for us.  It does nothing.  And I also want to speak to the vision of this plan,  this vision of recreating Bidwell Park.  And putting trees and grass and landscaping and people  where nothing has ever been.  I live on Chico Creek.  And Chico Creek in this time is being drawn down by all the housing  that's being built across the city.  We are living, we can't rebuild Bidwell Park.  What we're seeing is we're destroying the very heart of our city.  Our creek is dry longer than it's ever been.  And that's because we're not planning.  We're basing our plans on a 2015 pre-drought report.  We're not figuring out how the water table is going to be affected.  And we need to do that for all of us.  Because all of us use this resource.  No matter whether we live at the edge of town,  or we live in the very center of it.  Thank you.  Ann Anderson and then Beth Sisk.  Beth Sisk has gone home, just to let you know.  Thank you.  I am here for the first time in front of a commission or a city council,  anything, staff.  And it's a little overwhelming.  But I want to thank you for all that you do.  I moved to Chico 45 years ago.  And did so largely because of the  open spaces that were wild.  That were nearby that I could get to really quickly.  I want to, and so I'm not particularly in support of this development.  But really what I want to share with you is this most recent week,  I was in Bend, Oregon.  And I've been going there for 45 years.  I have family there.  And my, my family is there.  And my niece, who is in her 40s, she's a social worker.  Her husband is a paramedic fireman.  They have three young girls.  They grew up in Bend, the niece and her husband.  And they talked extensively about how left out they feel in Bend.  And how Bend has lost its character.  And that the development is just extensive.  And in all areas.  And promises made are not made.  And not promises kept.  So I, I was a no growth person.  I come into this as a no growth person.  I actually think that's not realistic.  Growth will happen.  But I do not think that this project is based in truth and science.  And though beautiful, I, I think we're looking at water.  Come on.  We're restricting water use.  The creek is.  The creek is down.  I live on the channel.  There's been so little water in the last 10 years.  So I, I can't support it.  It needs, I need more proof.  I'm just a citizen.  I need more proof.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Julian Zener.  And then Bill Locher.  Good evening, commissioners.  I strongly disapprove of Valley's Edge Pacific plan.  The largest proposed housing development in Chico's history.  For me, it's the equivalent of breaching the Green Line.  But to the east.  The first large development extending up into the foothills.  The critical risk from wildfires, groundwater depletion, traffic congestion, sprawl, greenhouse gas production, and habitat destruction has been mentioned by others.  I want to concentrate on inappropriate and poor land use.  Many don't realize that the future of housing in the U.S. is not enlarged.  Single house dwellings.  Baby boomers and Gen X, our fastest growing demographic, are increasingly living in homes alone.  According to the federal census and academic studies, there has been a two and a half fold increase in Americans living in single occupancy homes.  That's 13 to 33 percent.  Since 1960.  A three fold increase in single occupancy homes for ages 50 and more since 1970.  And a whopping 32% increase just since 2000 in this age group.  I left off papers so you could check these references.  Historically, Chico has generated too many large single afforded houses.  Much more than called for in the U.S.  in 2020.  And then Brett Silverbauer.  Hello.  Thanks for giving me some time.  I'm Bill Loker.  I'm a resident of Chico that's here 26 years.  For six years, between 2006 and 2012, served on the Climate Action Task Force before it became a commission.  I'm going to be brief.  You've heard from a lot of people.  My main objections to the development are that it's not consistent with the Climate Action Plan for the city of Chico.  I think that two speakers, Jackie Chase and another gentleman, spoke very clearly about the wildfire danger in this area.  I don't think it can be mitigated.  I think climate change and other factors have made wildfire predictably more.  I think that we will be putting people in harm's way.  And finally, as many people have mentioned, yes, there is a shortage of housing stock in Chico.  But this development does not fulfill the housing needs of Chico.  If there is going to be affordable housing in this development, it should not be segregated on four acres of property.  It should be integrated into the plan for the community.  So that people...  You have a diverse community.  And diverse neighborhoods in this planned development.  So I don't think the development as currently presented should be passed by the commission, certainly not by the city council.  So I urge you to vote against recommending the development.  Thank you.  Brent Silverbauer and David Welch.  My name is Brent Silverbauer.  I'm a local real estate agent.  I just want to speak a little bit to the demand of housing.  So a little anecdotal story.  I listed a house about three weeks ago.  And interest rates are up.  So we kind of priced it a little lower.  So the mortgage rate would be affordable for most people in Chico.  What we didn't anticipate is that we got over 100 tours.  I ended up getting 14 different offers on the house.  This was three weeks ago.  So we got so many offers.  We got so much paperwork.  We had to make a spreadsheet keeping track of all the people writing an offer on this house.  It ended up going $81,000 over the asking price.  And these people right here, I feel like I've got to represent them to a degree.  I'm excited.  I called 13 people and say, I'm sorry you didn't get the house.  I'm sorry you didn't get the house.  And these people, I met them at open house and stuff.  Teachers, PG&E workers, small business.  People that we want in our community.  And what happens when you don't have enough houses, basically you have too many people trying to get one house.  And the price goes up.  It's just supply and demand.  If you would interview these people, they're not here tonight.  These are mainly like kind of younger families and stuff.  If you interview them, they would say, man, I wish you had 13 more of these houses.  Then the price wouldn't have gone up.  My sellers were excited.  But at the same time, we need more housing.  What happened is one of the people I met at the open house, this is kind of an antidote to the story.  But I said, you know, hey, sorry you guys didn't make it.  Oh, that's okay.  We're looking at this house in Oroville.  So now they're in escrow with a house in Oroville.  Married couple, little baby.  So they're saying we're going to drive half an hour from Oroville to our jobs in Chico.  So both of them now have two cars, half an hour one way, half hour back.  So that's two hours of driving because that's the place.  They could afford a house.  So if we talk about CO2 emissions and all this other stuff, if we build stuff in Chico when we have the land,  I think there's going to be people that are going to stay in Chico as opposed to grow in Oroville and these kind of things that we're seeing right now just right in front of us.  So that's all.  We have a huge housing supply lack right now evidenced by the offers on these houses.  Thank you.  David Welch and Laura Flucard.  After Laura there will be Jessica Gignola.  Hi.  I'm Laura Flucard.  Hi.  After Laura there will be Jessica Gignola.  After Laura there will be Jessica Gignola.  After Laura there will be Jessica Gignola.  After Laura there will be Jessica Gignola.  follow up with what he said. I 100% agree. So I'm actually here tonight to speak on behalf of  my family's feelings regarding the development. I'll touch briefly on our family dynamics,  so hopefully it will add some weight to our voices. We feel as though Family Edge would  greatly impact our, sorry, Valley's Edge, would greatly impact our family and future generations.  My husband and I are both in the trades. He is a working builder for the last 20 years,  and I is a realtor with 15 years experience in the building industry.  Both my husband and I have been an active part in helping Chico rebuild our community and have  had a creation of somewhere, have helped assist in a creation of somewhere around 1500 single  family homes. We have really looked over the Valley's Edge proposal, and we feel like it is  fitting the needs of our future generations. My oldest son is 19 years old and working with a  local organization in the Valley's Edge. We feel like it is fitting the needs of our future  architect, went through the Chico Unified School District and Chico High architectural program,  and as a proud parent, I would love for him to be able to have his future work remain here in Chico  versus feeling like he has to outsource and move. Let's keep our generations that are coming up  after us here in Chico. Let's keep the feel and preserve the Chico love and community that we have,  and let's build an infrastructure that we can actually maintain and sustain for the years to  come for all of our generations, mine and several after, because that is who we need to be taking  into consideration. Thank you. Jessica Gennola and then Jared Geiser.  Let's see. I just want to share. We have to take all of our future development seriously,  and we have to take it seriously. We have to take it seriously. We have to take it seriously.  risks that are known now and not 20 years ago when developments were originally approved.  We know our water is disappearing.  We know wildfires are increasingly catastrophic occurrences.  We know greenhouse gases are increasing our average temperature, creating more fuel for  wildfires, losing more homes and entire cities to disasters.  These homes proposed may take decades to build, but the impacts will be felt immediately and  continuously by those of us living nearby.  So 20-something years I live right across Bruce, I will be forever feeling these impacts.  Congestion from development in completed new neighborhoods will make evacuations risky  and place area residents at high risk of being trapped during wildfire occurrences.  The sound pollution, I was hearing on that, that could be substantial for somebody who's  living nearby.  Not only is this section of Chico in a flood risk zone where permeable ground exists now,  the paved development will send watersheds to the area.  I live in the neighborhood of  the Camp Firecrest.  I've already experienced periodic flooding.  When we do have rain, although we haven't had it in a while, it still happens.  It's a high-risk fire zone.  That's where we live.  From my street, I watch the Camp Firecrest, that ridge, that ridge, those foothills where  this development is proposed, right there.  It's an annual or periodic spot where fires do happen in five, 10 years, and it's going  to increase in frequency.  We're running out of time, so I'll have to skip a whole bunch.  The sewer, where's the sewer coming from?  We have a failing sewer system and this huge, Orland-sized build.  We're going to have to do a lot of work to get it back.  Where is it planted in this area in this area in this area in this area in this area in  this area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this area  in this area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this  area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this  area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this area in this  Cal Audubon Society, and our organization promotes the awareness, appreciation, and protection of  native birds and their habitats. And so I submitted a public comment to the planning commission. It's  on page 281 of your agenda report where I go into more detail, but I'll try and cover the main  points. So we urge you to oppose the Valley's Edge Pacific plan and certification of the  environmental impact report. And the main reasons why is because the significant and unavoidable  greenhouse gas emissions would exacerbate climate change impacts on birds, other wildlife,  and Chico residents, while also being inconsistent with local planning documents such as the Chico  General Plan and updated Climate Action Plan. The Climate Action Plan has a target of zero  emissions by 2045, and this project will be operational around then and be emitting significant  amounts of carbon. So from my perspective, this is completely inconsistent with that Climate Action  Plan. And the other one is that this project is proposing large-scale habitat destruction and  fragmentation of the climate action plan. And so I urge you to oppose the Valley's Edge Pacific plan  and certification of the environmental impact report. This project will not reduce the  threshold of significance of the greenhouse gases. This will still significantly impact climate  change. And the city's own planning documents, namely the City of Chico Climate Change Vulnerability  Assessment, identify specifically how climate change will negatively impact residents. Some  of these impacts pose public health and safety threats. Some of them threaten recreation  opportunities. They include the fact that the City of Chico has a lot of climate change  extreme heat, increased wildfire risk, increased storm and flooding events, reduced snowpack,  reduced summer stream flow. I wish I had way more time. Wow. So yeah, as I mentioned,  the large-scale habitat destruction would significantly harm native birds and wildlife.  And so in our public comment, we identify several bird species that depend upon this grassland and  oak and pine, foothill pine woodland habitat that have faced significant declines in their  populations, ranging from 33% declines in their population to 76% declines from land use changes  such as what Valley's Edge is proposing to do. Maggie Scarpa and then Jeff Glatz.  Good evening, commissioners and staff. I am a resident of Chico. I'm a board member for the  BEAP Environmental Council, and I also am a land use and long-range plan here for Yuba County.  I care deeply about the environment. I'm a resident of Chico. I'm a resident of Chico.  I care about the growth, development, health, and future of Chico and the community,  and I urge you as such to vote no on this development for a variety of reasons.  First, there will be a significant and unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions as an impact,  which exceeds and obstructs the newly updated climate action plan as well as state climate  goals. With this, Chico as well as California and the United States are already facing climate  impacts that have been discussed.  Second, the project is detrimental, as so many people have talked about, for the threatened,  endangered, and sensitive species. Types of development like this are the reason a lot of  species are threatened, endangered, and sensitive, which include some of the ones that the EIR touched,  the burrowing owl, western pond turtle, Butte County metaphone,  and more.  Lastly, there is no need for this type of housing, as many people have discussed.  For Chico, the regional housing needs assessment was done for Chico and looked at what type of  housing Chico needs for extremely low, low, moderate, and above moderate income. Since 2022,  the planned and produced housing for above moderate income reached thresholds of 219%  for extremely low income.  For Chico, the planned and produced housing was only 49% met.  We really need to focus on infill, redevelopment, mixed-use housing. That really is what smart  growth principles are about. And so I urge you as planning commissioners to vote no on  this as well as discuss in the future either a development code update or a general plan  update to re-zone this property.  Jeff Glatz and then Brian Kress.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Uh, hello commissioners. Uh, being on commission I just wanted to show up cause  when these things are usually this big it's a lot of opposition. Uh, where's the speaker?  Uh, okay. Sorry. I'll get a little closer. I don't speak too loud. Uh, so I, I, I move  for, of course this, this development. Uh, I think it would be a great, a great move  to Chico. Great, a great boost to, to, to what we can do with our community going forward.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  off track there, so I've got to start here. Listen to some of the comments, and  everybody has respect for some of these comments that people are giving. There are concerns. But I think  being a commissioner, sometimes you have to make tough decisions and unpopular  recommendations to council. But these things need to be done.  And I've heard a lot of what can go up, but there's also  a lot of conditions of approval. Mr. Browder's team,  they've gone through city regulations, county, state. They're doing  everything they are supposed to do to match what the  city and the state require. But I've heard what  will the project do for Chico. This project for Chico, if you don't live in  Valley's Edge, just think about the job creation that this will do for the city of Chico.  Jobs will be created for 20 years or whatever. The build-out's going to be  a school's going to go in there, teachers, retail. There's going to  be a lot of opportunity, a lot of job creation. I think that's one of the things the city should be  concentrating on most is job creation.  And elevating the working salaries of the workers to make  the housing affordable for them to elevate their idea.  I think it goes underappreciated what Mr. Browder's team are doing for the city of Chico.  I've got 20 seconds. Hundreds of millions of dollars they're going to invest into our community.  I think there's going to probably be over a billion dollars worth of property tax,  I mean property value, that can be taxed over the next 20 years.  This is a significant economic impact that can help Butte County and help the city of Chico.  And that can help with our roads, with our parks and all the other things.  So this will benefit the population of Chico. Thanks for your time.  Brian Kress and then Mary Kay Benson.  Hi, y'all. I'm here as a commissioner on the Climate Action Commission in Chico.  Our remit is specifically about greenhouse gas emissions.  And that's one of the critical points of failure of this plan.  It's important.  I think especially when we look towards new development in this city,  that we look for new development that doesn't exceed the targets  that we're trying to reach in the next 10 years or 20 years,  especially as those targets, you know,  the targets that we're seeing right now are exceeding, you know,  our per capita goals in 2030.  You know, the report said these emissions are significant and unavoidable  as the plan is currently constructed.  And I think I agree with Susan that it's irresponsible for us  to imagine some wishful thinking around that people are going to adopt EVs  at some certain rate or that we're going to have a certain new way  of navigating the city to mitigate these transportation, you know, realities that we have.  I think it's important also to point out that the consequences of climate change  and the consequences of these emissions have significant impact to our community,  especially in flooding, wildfire.  And increased temperatures.  I don't know if you all know,  but the nonpartisan legislative analyst office from California  put out a series of advisory reports about climate change impacts,  and they asked decision makers to put on a climate lens.  A couple of points they make about housing.  One is that, you know, we need to put a climate lens on where and how new housing is built,  and decision makers should not depend solely on historical data,  but instead, you know, imagine the future of climate change,  especially, for instance, wildfire here.  Another recommendation they make is to think about how this may, in fact,  may impact insurance availability and cost in fire-prone areas,  which this is, of course, one of those.  For example, insurance companies experience historical losses to recent wildfires,  and these companies have increased rates broadly and dropped homeowners  in some wildfire-prone areas, which affect low-income population.  I'll finish with this.  I'd encourage all of you to put on your climate lens.  Look at that.  That emissions report really critically,  and think about our future and the increased risks that are escalating,  not decreasing in the next 20 to 50 years,  as part of the way you consider this project.  Thank you.  Mary Kay Benson, and then Emily Alma.  Hello, Commission.  Thank you for your service.  I just want to touch on a couple of things that other people didn't.  First of all, I'd like to pay homage.  to the Mechoopda tribe.  This is unceded, occupied Mechoopda territory.  They don't plan for a couple of generations ahead, you know.  Seven generations ahead is how we have to be thinking, like them.  And I also want to pay homage to Bill Guillermo Mash,  who just died suddenly.  And if you knew him,  his tagline for his Without a Roof program on KZFR,  always said,  if you have a roof, be grateful.  And I was surprised when I heard commissioners  not knowing what our shortage of housing is here.  Because Ed Mayer, the executive director of the Housing Authority,  says we have 6,000 to 8,000 housing units,  right now.  We lost 20,000 units from 2018 to 2020.  We have to replace those.  They were mostly low income.  So where do these 20,000 and 15,000 square foot single family dwellings  fit into the equation?  They don't.  Okay, so I just want to talk about shelter for all.  I want to talk about...  I asked the Mechoopda tribal member,  who's a TEK master, recognized by her tribe,  Allie Matters Knight.  She said, you take down those oak trees  that bring the water level up,  you won't have any wetlands to promote.  This is privatized public space.  Thank you.  Emily Alma and then Mark Steeman.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  Thanks guys.  large farmers and the people with a lot of money.  And that's a reality.  And I was going to talk about hydrology and all that,  but I want to change over to a memory when Mr.  Broward was presenting this beautiful park,  beautiful wild area that he wants to develop and add houses and roads and  schools and human stuff to.  And about 23 years ago,  we were on opposing sides of stopping.  I was on the side of stopping the Otterson drive extension from being built  across Comanche Creek.  And Mr.  Broward's side was promoting it as a way to provide a park for Chico,  a wonderful park on either side of the bridge,  and the road that would cut across the beautiful Comanche Creek Greenway.  We came together and stopped that project.  And now it would be,  it has been a very beautiful,  wonderful greenway where people can enjoy the beauties of nature without  having to listen to the rumble of parks and breathe this,  the pollution.  So it's interesting that now this is an expanded vision,  but,  but it's also a very similar where we don't need,  let the city of Chico find a way.  There's a lot of money to buy and save beautiful wild land.  And then we can ride our bikes and we can drive our electric cars and  we'll hike there.  So thank you.  Mark Steeman.  And then Courtney Casey.  Good evening.  I'm a resident of the city of Chico.  Last month,  Dr.  Ray spoke at Chico state about climate anxiety.  She shared a study that found that 75% of the young people around the  world say the future is frightening because of climate change.  56% said they feel humanity is doomed.  I spent an afternoon in a climate cafe with inspire high school students  and our youth feel the same way.  Dr.  Ray also shared that the connection between these negative feelings and  you saying that they feel betrayed by governments and lied to by leaders.  This is the concept of institutional betrayal.  When the institutions that people are dependent upon fail to uphold that  responsibility.  All of this is really psychologically damaging to young people.  They don't have the confidence that things are going to be okay.  They can't gather the confidence from looking at institutions and  witnessing them doing the right thing.  Tonight is a textbook example.  The EIR for this project,  which includes that it would result in significant and unavoidable impacts  regarding greenhouse gas emissions.  So you must make a special overriding consideration that the economic and  social benefits of the project outweigh the significant impacts on the  climate for future generations.  As if yet by issuing another statement of overriding considerations,  the planning commission once again betrays our youth and this  institutional betrayal of our children must stop.  You cannot keep doing this.  And we could not keep cooperating.  So respectfully, I do not intend to passively sit down.  You're going to have to stop this meeting and have me removed.  My primary hope is that when you finally start the meeting again,  the next speaker does the exact same thing.  And the speaker after that, and the speaker after that.  The public, especially us parents, need to stop allowing our government  institutions to betray our children and our grandchildren.  And tonight is a good time to start.  I'm happy to answer any questions before you temporarily adjourn.  Does anybody have any questions for Dr. Stamen?  Okay, we'll take a quick minute break.  And could we please have Mr. Stamen removed from the premises?  You're not even going to get up, huh?  I guess I should have glued myself to the podium.  Thank you.  Who wants to go?  I don't think it's time.  Okay.  So you guys are in charge of this.  So you guys are in charge of this.  So you guys are in charge of this.  So you guys are in charge of this.  So you guys are in charge of this.  So you guys are in charge of this.  So you guys are in charge of this.  So you guys are in charge of this.  So you guys are in charge of this.

It's Courtney Casey and Alan Hawthorne.  Thank you.  So, good evening.  I've been a resident of Butte Creek Canyon for 36 years.  I have seen fires, floods, a condo project that was planned by the Board of Supervisors, approved, took before the voters.  65% of the people said no to the condo project.  That land sat idle until the campfire.  It was an ecological preserve.  That campfire came into our canyon and destroyed nine homes around me.  You can't tell me that you could fireproof a home if you can't fireproof Santa Rosa with a six-lane highway.  It's impossible.  November 28th, it rained almost six inches in the canyon where I live.  I had to empty my rain gauge.  The water came off the hillside a foot deep.  All the way across the hillside behind my house.  And I don't live on the creek side.  I live on the hillside.  It hit my house 40 miles an hour and turned into a waterfall.  It brought 200 yards of material from fire debris into my yard.  It was a catastrophe.  $80,000 in flood damage and my wife had just bought flood insurance two years before.  She was smarter than I was.  You don't know what this hillside does in an event.  In a fire event.  Where are we going to get our new equipment to fight a fire up there?  How am I going to escape the canyon in a fire with 5,000 other people trying to leave all at the same time?  This is serious business.  This is life and death.  And if you don't...  If you don't think it can happen, look at Paradise.  Just think about it.  It's a catastrophe what's being proposed here.  And it's wrong.  Alan Hawthorne and then Pamela Posey.  Is there a speaker here that I'm supposed to be talking into?  Greenlight.  Greenlight.  Okay.  Good evening, commissioners and staff.  My name is Alan Hawthorne, executive director of Friends of the Creek.  Focused on the protection and restoration of the last best run of wild spring run salmon in all of California.  Rivaling many of the rivers of Oregon.  I want to focus on two items.  Water and water.  Water supply and storm water runoff.  One is the groundwater that this project proposes to extract for a recreational lake.  Mr. Broward said we need another horseshoe lake.  Okay.  Like a hole in the head.  Also, extensive landscaping, supposedly to protect from fire.  This...  The overdraft of the Vina sub-base of groundwater is real.  And the Vina Groundwater Sustainability Agency is struggling with ways to manage and recharge our precious resource.  This project completely ignores the sacrifices the agricultural industry...  has to make to attain groundwater sustainability.  Chico, Butte County and the farming interests of this area have worked very hard to protect agricultural land from development.  And make no mistake, this property is agricultural land.  It is owned agriculture and it does produce food.  Mr. Broward has a grazing agreement.  They raise cattle on that ground.  People eat cows.  We need to do the same to protect...  The most important...  Input for farming...  Water.  The second water issue is runoff.  I'm talking way too slow.  This proposed project is the single largest incursion in Dubuque Creek watershed since the development of the Town of Paradise.  Runoff from this will carry...  All kinds of...  animal waste...  pesticides...  fertilizers...  and...  More importantly...  Runoff from vehicles...  oil...  other fluids...  and a little-known chemical that comes off of tires as they shed rubber onto the road.  This chemical has been shown to have deadly effects on salmonids in the Pacific Northwest.  The other important study from the Pacific Northwest is that the more urbanized a watershed,  the less likely salmonids can survive.  And all we have to do is look here in our city of Chico, Big Chico Creek.  Mr. Hawthorne, can I have you wrap up?  We still have a lot of speakers to go.  Pamela Posey and Karen Laszlo.  Good evening, honorable members of the Planning Commission and staff.  My name is Pamela Posey.  I have been an educator and librarian for the County of Butte, CSU Chico, and Chico Unified Schools.  I am here to plead for Butte Creek Canyon, the Chico Foothill land that is being considered for development as Valley's Edge.  A misnomer.  I came to live in Chico in 1970, having lived all over the world, all over the U.S., Europe, and Asia.  I decided that here was one of the best places to settle down in the whole world.  What captured my heart and mind was the wildness, the pristine, accessible beauty,  full of creatures right at the edge of town, right from my doorstep.  I could walk out there and be...  ...in wildness.  This is the essence of Chico, the unique landscape.  These are the treasures of Chico that will be gone forever if this development proceeds.  You've read the EIR.  It has many unanswered questions and raises many more.  The city of Chico, in a recent document, has stated an increase of only 3,100 residents by 2040.  ...flexible.  It is a fact.  It is a fact.  It is a fact. Please follow the guidelines as found in Chico's general plan for a compact urban form, not sprawl. In the words of Edward Abbey, Wilderness is not a luxury but a necessity of the human spirit and is vital to our lives as water and good bread. As a civilization which destroys what little remains of the wild is betraying the principle of civilization itself. Wilderness is not a luxury but a necessity of the human spirit and is vital to our lives as water and good bread. As a civilization which destroys what little remains of the wild is betraying the principle of civilization itself.  the principle of civilization itself.  On behalf of many others,  we would like to offer this proposition  to purchase the Foothill Land  to create a park for all to enjoy in perpetuity.  This has been done across California.  We can accomplish this here.  I will support and work for that endeavor.  Thank you for your time and attention.  Karen Loslow and then Mike Trolinder.  While I'm quite concerned about the environmental impacts  and loss of habitat for wildlife,  especially to the birds,  right now I want to address  the possible social injustice impacts  regarding Valley's Edge development.  Our Chico General Plan calls for a compact urban form.  Valley's Edge is a place where  Valley's Edge is not compact, it's sprawl.  It's the exact opposite of where our town should be heading  in regards to new housing development.  We need small workforce houses, duplexes, apartments  that are affordable to middle and low  and lower income residents.  Valley's Edge will be mostly large single family houses,  affordable to only a few wealthy people,  from out of Butte County, yes, that's right,  such as the Bay Area or Los Angeles,  who are seeking to retire in the country.  It makes no sense to house people,  especially senior citizens,  uphill on the outskirts of the city  where they would have to drive to all their needs,  such as groceries, medical appointments,  and all the rest in case of a fire, which is likely.  It would be hard to evacuate the elderly  who would be dependent on others to drive them to safety.  All inhabitants of Valley's Edge will be dependent on cars  for every ordinary need, thereby increasing greenhouse gases.  Valley's Edge will do nothing to answer Chico's housing.  It will, however, create an elitist wealthy class  living high up in the foothills above the rest of us here below,  in Chico's flatland.  I don't believe this is the kind of housing development  the majority of people want for Chico.  Thank you.  Mike Trollander, and then Nicole Nava.  Hello, good evening, I'm Mike Trollander.  I'm probably one of the few urbanists in the room here,  a lot of environmentalists.  So my concerns really is, if this moves forward,  what creates a great urbanism?  Because that's what we're doing here.  People are gonna live here,  and we have a lot of examples around Chico of bad urbanism.  So I'm gonna start with very simple stuff to read here.  My one and only EIR comment is,  will this project cost the city  and lead to further urban decay?  We know what urban decay looks like,  when our roadways and infrastructure  don't have the funding to meet community standards.  Chico, like most of California's cities,  has damaged its quality of life by unbalanced density,  miles and miles of roads, sewer lines,  and public infrastructure built to service  way too few dwelling units.  The best possible approach isn't to eliminate low density,  single family, it's to balance a range of densities  in a block by block pattern that prioritizes single family.  I'm not against developing Valley's Edge,  but I'm also not against the project being stopped  over environmental concerns.  I think the planning team has done incredible work  in preserving the landscape and clustering it,  and also in restoring the developed parts.  The low density at the outer reach of the project  is perfectly programmed.  Where the project doesn't meet good planning muster,  the proposed village and village node on 20th Street,  the segregated land uses to compose a village  is going to yield a disconnected, not very walkable,  unlivable village.  I'm sorry, I'm out of time.  Thank you.  Nicole Nava and then Anne Beicker-Kaufman  is our last speaker.  Good evening, Commissioners.  So, I have done a lot of speaking to a lot of community members  through various events, farmers markets,  some other opportunities, and a lot of people  were concerned about this project.  But what I found to be true amongst a lot of people,  and I think a lot of those folks,  is that they hadn't read all the information about it.  They had read one person who objected to it  and made their own PowerPoint,  and that got shared around and people got rallied  to come show at things.  I'm a little concerned because I will point out  that the general plan and the housing element  were actually drafted and approved  by a prior liberal council,  and there are five special planning areas,  four bumping up against the green line,  one bumping up against the green line,  one against the brown, now gold line.  And so, I feel like people were trying to pursue  the lesser of evils, if you will,  about needing to develop.  Infill is an interesting thing to talk about  because depending upon who's talking about it,  you may want some, you may not want it.  I talked to a lot of people in the avenues  who now that all the ADUs are popping up,  some of them have lost their view.  They're not getting the sun they used to get  for their organic gardens.  So, it's a matter of perspective.  This will bring a lot of jobs, a lot of opportunity.  The environmental concerns,  I just wanna call out the elephant in the room  that the Butte Environmental Council is supposed  to be charged with looking out for the environment.  Many times I was here begging them, we've sent emails,  we've tagged them on social media to ask them to help  with the encampment situations, which were a danger  and still are to the riparian habitat,  the wild animals, the wild animals, the wild animals,  the wildlife and other things.  So, if we're gonna be concerned about the environment,  I think we should all pay attention to that consistently.  Also, I find it problematic that we're not paying attention  to experts like our fire chief and his department  that weighed in and to people like Cal Water  who say there will be enough water.  And I'm going over the red because lots of people  went over the red and I needed to finish.  So, I think we should really think about this  for the good of Chico.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ann Byker-Kaufman is our last speaker.  Ann, welcome.  Thank you.  We've been waiting for you.  I bet you have.  Okay, so I wanted to make just a couple of comments.  One, I am also on the Climate Action Commission  and the thing that really jumped out to me  is that this development, the per capita emissions,  the emissions of CO2 will be 13% above the target  for the per capita CO2 emissions for Chico in 2030.  So, for Chico to meet its target,  that means that the rest of Chico would have to emit  less than the target amount for us to reach  the total target amount.  And that's not fair to have a small community  cause the rest of us,  to have to emit less CO2.  So, that's one part.  The other part is the very large proportion  of this development that's planned  to be single family housing.  Single family housing nationwide is bankrupting cities  and the same is happening to Chico.  We have too much single family housing.  We need to balance that with multifamily housing,  with duplexes, with the missing middle, and with the !  So, that we generate enough tax revenue to be able  to maintain the infrastructure that we have.  And a huge new development of single family housing  is gonna take us in the wrong direction  and will potentially bankrupt Chico.  So, I really urge you to vote against the plan as it is,  if it could be modified to have more concentrated, higher,  density, and more affordable housing.  And more open space.  Because of that, it could potentially be a good thing  for Chico.  Thank you.  Thank you.  With that, we will bring back up the applicant  and probably any members of the team  to address the questions.  And Mr. Broward, I've kept a list.  So, maybe we could...  I don't know how to speak.  You okay?  Okay.  Okay. There's two questions I heard and I thought I could address them.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  That's it. It's trails. That's it. There's no improvements in there. There's no buildings.  It's regional park. So think Upper Bigwell Park. You're outdoor. You're in nature.  198 acres of linear parkway. Those are the seasonal creeks and other woodland corridors  that move through. Pretty much the same thing. Trails are allowed. We have pockets of play.  We're along that trail system. You might take your kid. You go down. You got a little picnic  area near the creek. Park courses, other types of very low impact passive recreation places.  But basically all open space. Natural. And then the 48 acre preserve for conservation.  That is 100% no touch. That gets fenced off needing a docent to review it. So that totals  665 acres. That will be natural. No irrigation.  Out of the 738 acres,  that's 42 acres of open space. So that's 90% of the valley's edge.  Land in Valley's Edge would be pristine, natural.  The other question, it's a really good question. I hear it a lot.  And I'm sorry I don't have a better answer for it. But it's how much are the homes going to cost?  Well, home pricing isn't based  the developers and builders, subcontractors don't  don't price something. Homebuyers price something.  Developers can barely control costs. Many times they can't control costs. So this is a land plan.  Our job is to provide this policy framework. So future generations when housing is needed in Chico,  future generations of builders and developers can step up and deliver the kind of housing that the Chico community is asking for.  It's not the other way around. You don't build housing and then hope somebody is going to come.  The market will have to change.  The market will have to change.  This is land on which that appetite for housing and this is land on which that appetite can be sustained over the long term.  I can't answer how much the house is going to cost because I don't know when they're going to be built,  what the requirements are going to be built, what the costs are going to be at that point in time.  Our job isn't to decide house pricing. It's to decide a range of housing  that serves the entire mix of home buyers and renters in the community.  That's the mix of housing. We showed graphs on it earlier.  11% of that is high-end housing. The rest of it serves the marketplace, including the subsidized housing.  I'd yield the rest of my 25 seconds to any questions and board's deliberations.  Does the commission have any questions for the applicant?  Okay, Commissioner Cooper.  It's on level cap.  Yeah.  It's on level cap. There's a lot of talk about the water.  How much really gets absorbed up there?  Maybe someone else can.  To me, it runs off. Lava cap doesn't really absorb.  It's going into the little creeks.  It's still being placed where it should be because it's not really sitting there absorbing.  Say if it was down by Bidwell Park one mile where that soil is going to suck that in.  Very limited groundwater recharge.  But those areas that have potential for groundwater recharge are in the creeks.  You can see cobbles.  Where you see cobbles, it's usually groundwater recharge.  Where you see lava cap...  Not so much.  But the idea of fracturing the lava cap actually creates greater opportunity for that water to seep through it.  Because you're creating fractures in something that's relatively impervious.  The ground is the same as it was in California Park.  I mentioned that earlier.  It's hard.  You know, and food, I guess, doesn't grow there. The cattle.  But it's...  From a groundwater recharge standpoint, you know, we've done everything we can to stay away from those areas.  And then actually work on biofiltration and other things that help retain that water.  Project like this, it's obligated by law to have the pre-development, meaning current case, and post-development flow characteristics off the property.  The same before and the same after.  So there's retention ponds.  Obviously a lot of low impact development standards that filter out contaminants.  So it's a big lot.  It's a big part of development.  It's making sure that you don't...  You don't mess up the whole stormwater.  When we went out on the property, one of my things is,  Wow, that'd be cool to go on these paths and enjoy this lake or to see this waterfall.  But then it's HOA.  But you did mention, and this might be to other people, I just wanted to bring it up,  that the HOA would be selling like a $25 a year membership to be able to ride your bikes and use the facilities,  which also would help pay to keep those facilities up.  Okay.  I told this story earlier.  A couple had asked me about it.  And my office is right on the lake in California Park.  And I'd be looking out there and I see a couple of 12-year-old kids.  And they're fishing.  And I'm thinking, man, this is exactly what our kids need to be doing.  Right? They're not in on their iPads, they're out fishing, they're having sticks, they're playing, they're laughing.  Security guard comes by and asks them for their pass.  They don't have one.  Go back to the bedroom.  Get back on the iPad.  We shouldn't be doing that.  But there's a stress, an understandable one,  where you've got a certain group of people paying for an amenity  and everybody else in the community or the world using it.  You have to remove that stress.  So we've approached it in two ways.  One, we are going to sign a gift grant deed to the City of Chico for 419 acres  to gift them as a regional park.  As soon as the city does that, that becomes a public park.  Until the city accepts that, we have to have a management entity.  And that management entity is the HOA.  So my solution, I'm all about getting people back into nature,  getting the kids out there.  We've come up with a way where if anyone is going to be invited,  so it's available to HOA members, their guests,  and non-resident members that simply have to go to the HOA,  sign a liability waiver, pay some nominal fee.  I don't know what that nominal fee is going to be.  But if the HOA is smart, they're going to have that be where you actually,  it's a revenue generator to maintain those open space.  And the HOA is going to need that.  It's also probably the best marketing you can do  is invite people out to a community like that.  So I think we've found the best solution we can.  Anybody else has a better idea?  We're all ears.  And one last one about the community.  Is there any roads going into Butte Creek area?  There's a lot of worry about concerns of people being able to evacuate.  Is this more, there's nothing going into Butte Creek.  It would be Skyway and 20th Street, correct?  That's correct.  And then emergency evac.  So nothing on Honey Run or anything coming out of that area?  Nothing on Honey Run.  Okay. That's it. Thank you, sir.  Any other questions for the applicant?  Thank you.  Thank you.  With that, we will close the public hearing.  Just felt official.  Any questions for staff?  We do have our esteemed fire chief here.  If anybody has any questions for him as well as other city staff.  I have a question for probably our planning staff,  but this might be other staff too.  I kind of wanted to follow up on,  we had a commenter ask,  will this project cost the city and lead to further urban decay of our roads and infrastructure?  And this is a concept I'm somewhat familiar with that,  you know, when you build infrastructure like roads or sewer out to edges of the town,  it can cost a lot of money and sometimes that's not a sustainable cost.  So I'm just curious if staff can help answer that.  I'd like to give a little bit of an answer and then maybe invite Leanne.  Leanne Sutton, the public works director of engineering to finish off whatever I missed.  Early discussions on this project,  we had operations and maintenance public works in meetings talking about this project,  especially the regional park and that they're not equipped to take something like that on right now.  So that's why we suspect the city will not want to accept that dedication of the regional park.  And the streets, like I showed,  those street sections are now segmented away.  So that's why we're trying to make sure that those streets are being taken apart in ways they wouldn't normally be  so that some areas are set aside for the HOA or the maintenance districts  to take care of local people that live in that project.  We'll have to take care of those instead of it being a citywide burden.  But I believe the typical repaving of the trafficways and stuff would be in our typical repaving program or something like that.  There we go. Thank you.  So I just want to add that the developer is going to be participating in the development of the project.  And we're going to be adding some of the things that we're going to be adding to the development impact fee program.  And then we have a nexus study that was done several years ago.  We're in the process of updating that.  And some of the things that came out as a result of this EIR are going to be added to the nexus program.  And so your question about decay and the roads and all that,  the developer is actually going to be helping improve infrastructure in the city of Chico.  Glad to hear it. Thank you.  Just for the general's knowledge,  could you just quickly, sorry,  we know what a nexus is,  but when you say the developer is going to be paying for those fees,  those are part of the impact fees that he pays when he goes to develop that land.  Yes.  Can you just, I guess just for the general public,  know that that money is being set aside to fund those infrastructure.  Yes, it is.  The development fees are set out.  Yes.  They're developed in the nexus study that was completed.  And that nexus study includes a list for,  for example, for the sewer impact fee that are collected.  There's a list of projects.  P18 is already on that list because it was included in the 2013 sewer master plan.  And we already have a CIP project set up and we're already starting to work on that pipeline that runs out to Valley's Edge.  And as far as the roads go,  we have a list of many roads that are developed,  that are development driven,  what road widenings,  it's set traffic intersection improvements.  And we also have bike path fees or projects that are part of this program that are identified in that nexus program.  And then there are a few items that came out of this EIR,  which we're going to be adding to the nexus.  And so that by the time this gets to build out,  we'll be able to have collected fees  and either the developer will step up and build it with that money,  or the city will develop a CIP project and build that infrastructure in a timely manner before it's actually needed.  Other impact fees include like police facilities,  fire facilities,  neighborhood parks,  community parks.  There's a variety of impact fees that are associated with commercial as well as residential.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'll ask.  So Chief Standridge,  we heard a lot about wildfire and impacts.  You know,  we make decisions on policy and land use,  but you're really the front line that's going to have to deal with any of the impacts of what we pass.  Is there anything in this plan that causes you concern?  Uh,  we worked extensively  and met with Mr. Broward and his team.  We did site visits.  We evaluated the terrain.  That area is moderate,  and we have other areas that abut our city to the north  and as it wraps towards the airport that are high,  and I have less concern about the way this development has been built out  as we've been able to integrate significant concessions by the developer  to include access north and south,  which has been a problem, for example, in Canyon Oaks  where our resources can get drawn up on one part of the subdivision  and then have to come back around and then redeploy all the way around the community.  We also were able to get Firewise,  standards built into the HOA rules,  which will allow for enforcement.  I don't think people have an appreciation  for how much authority the HOA will have or has in a community  because they can dictate and enforce the HOA provisions  and rules and regulations to include the Firewise standards.  So that also includes the landowners,  or the homeowners that would have to adhere to the Firewise standards  and therefore mitigating and limiting the types of vegetation  that they plant around their homes,  the types of materials they use for fencing, and so forth.  So that's a very powerful tool,  and it transitions the enforcement to an HOA  that allows them to monitor themselves within the guidelines  that are established through the HOA  and through the DOJ.  So that's a very powerful tool.  with the general plan.  The other aspect that they've done for us  is created access points to the exterior  along all the, around the perimeters,  and it allows our apparatus to get in there  and it actually gives us better access than we currently have  because the lava rock makes it really challenging  for our apparatus to move around in those fields  because there's a lot of big lava rocks in there  that make it really difficult for us to move around in those fields.  So it's really, really challenging.  So this actually gives us a buffer  and a way to access the exterior  and create breaks that are natural or manmade.  Thank you.  Any further questions of staff?  Madam Chair, if I may beg for another chance  to answer Commissioner Poland's question earlier.  I think Commissioner Wall...  You don't have to beg. It's okay.  ...asked a very similar question about...  and then the question is,  how many units does Chico need?  And then we heard a bunch of testimony  with varying numbers about,  well, how many units does Chico need?  I tried to provide information about that  in the statement of overriding considerations.  The very first one does that.  I just went to the best source of data  that I think we have,  which is BCAG, Butte County Association of Governments,  and they did a post-campfire study in 2020,  and it indicated that Chico's expected to need 12,  almost a little bit less than 12,000 units  from 2020 to 2040.  And that's up from about 8,000  that was previously predicted in their model  that was pretty on par.  We were really happy with their mid-level modeling,  but they had to replace that now with 12,000 units  instead of 8,000 over those 20 years.  And part of that is maybe skewed  because there's, like I said earlier,  more people per household right now.  So the additional housing allows that  to normalize back out to, you know,  below the 2.5 mark instead of being up by around 2.6.  And that small difference makes actually a lot of impact  on your population based on that number of houses that you have.  Can I follow up with that, Mike?  Yeah.  In addition to that total number,  I think you said 12,000,  do you have the RHNA numbers in front of you there  just to show the breakdown in terms of the type of housing?  You know, because the total number,  the total number is one thing,  but there also are,  the RHNA number points out the type of the need  based on income and, you know,  the affordable or affordability level of those units.  So I'm just curious,  if you don't have that in front of you,  I don't want to put you on the spot,  but I think that's an important calculation  when you're talking about what the need in the community is.  I don't have those numbers in front of me.  I have them in front of me.  Thank you.  I recall them from, you know,  the most recent report.  And, well, Lindsay's about to tell us.  I think that we were way over in terms of at the top level  and way under in terms of at the lowest level of affordability.  I would agree with that generally,  except for our 2022 to 2030 plan,  which for everyone's knowledge,  the commission worked extensively on this housing element plan  that has to be updated by law every seven years.  And so those RHNA numbers,  and RHNA stands for Regional Housing Needs Allocation,  because we talked a lot about housing needs of Chico and affordability,  and it's broken up into tiers.  And the tier that actually needs the most housing  for the next 10 years is above moderate.  We do need low, low, very low, low, moderate, and above moderate.  But above moderate is actually the highest percentage.  So, but...  And to Rich's point, we did produce above moderate.  We did reach that RHNA number for the last housing element.  But we have never met the RHNA numbers as a whole  for any period of time.  So...  Can I just add that when you're talking about this housing element,  that's an eight-year cycle.  And we're talking about the build-out of this project potentially being 25.  So perhaps three building or housing elements.  So, just kind of from perspective.  The reason I say that is the projects that were approved  in the early 2000s, the Northwood Chico-Pacific Plan,  Book Valley, Marion Park, again, coming up on 20 years,  those are what we have been building out and developing  and meeting our RHNA numbers with over the past 20 years.  And the best example I have is Book Valley.  I don't think they ever intended to have affordable housing projects  that were saved when it was approved.  It was dictated by their project.  there are now three affordable housing projects associated with that.  So, it's not like we're doing SimCity where we're dictating  where exactly the affordable housing projects are going to go.  In some cases, we are getting a commitment to the development agreement  to 90 units, but it's possible in the future  that affordable projects will go into these projects as well.  It's just...  Sorry to correct Director Wieg,  but you approved a fourth affordable housing project in Oak Valley tonight.  Yes.  So, just to clarify,  I don't want anybody to come away with a misunderstanding here.  I believe the RHNA numbers indicate pretty clearly  that while there's potential for change,  we don't know exactly what's going to happen in the future,  but we have historically underperformed, underprovided,  underbuilt affordable housing by the RHNA numbers  as compared to every tier above,  and we've overperformed at the highest level dramatically.  And so, while there's...  The city has done much better,  and maybe in the future the city will do even better than we have  in the very recent years.  Historically, the numbers are pretty clear  that we're not providing adequate affordable housing.  So, I wouldn't want us to come away with kind of a rosy picture here  that we've fixed the problem.  I don't think we have.  We're a little bit probably off topic here.  I think in terms of this proposed plan,  you know, it's pretty clear what is planned in terms of affordable units,  and that's the only reason that I think it's important  that we all understand both the history  and the potential impact or lack thereof  of this proposal as it relates to affordable housing.  Yeah, like I said earlier,  when you look at the full complement of things necessary  to deliver affordable housing,  they're not going to be in this project for quite some time.  The project creates capacity for future building,  and the market just doesn't deliver affordable housing  without the incentives provided by the state,  and those incentives are linked to those amenities being very nearby.  So, that will limit this project's ability  to provide affordable housing.  And it's common amongst all, most cities in California,  from what I understand,  that they don't meet their RHNA numbers,  except for in the above moderate category.  Any further discussion?  Motions?  I'll make a motion.  Oh, okay.  But first, I'd like to say that we need growth.  There's no getting around it.  Maybe it's a dirty word to some,  but it's something we need.  Okay.  And this project fulfills a part of that future growth.  And there are other groups and other people in the community  who are providing housing at all levels,  and those need to be encouraged as well.  But this project is the best project I've seen in my time in Chico.  When I was a kid in Chico, riding my bike,  I went to the grocery store,  there was a sign on the escalator that said,  Chico population 12,300 and some odd.  Now, that's a while ago,  but it goes to show you that any time along the line between then and now,  the city council could have stepped up and said,  we're done with growth.  We're not going to do any more.  We got the green line,  we're going to have the brown line,  we're going to have the skyline,  all of those things to stop growth.  And where would we be today?  A lot of the people in this room tonight probably wouldn't be here  and probably wouldn't be in Chico had that happened.  But it didn't.  And now there are people who want to stop it at this point,  and that's short-sighted for what we need in the future.  And so I really encourage the rest of the commission to move this along to council  and for this approval to go forward so they can get busy on this project  and others can get busy on their other projects.  Incidentally, when the green line was being fashioned,  some years ago,  there were those who said we've got to build the green line  so we don't go into ag land.  Well, gee whiz,  we can go up the foothills since we don't want to go into ag land.  Now, here we are, 40 years later, changing course again.  Not such a good thing.  We need the housing.  So I would move that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 22-10,  recommending that the city council  certify the Environmental Impact Report,  adopt the statement of overriding considerations,  and approve the Valley's Edge Specific Plan and Related Applications,  Specific Plan 1901, Rezone 1901, Code Amendment 2202,  General Plan Amendment 22-03, and Development Agreement 22-01.  I'll second that.  Thank you.  So I have a motion by Commissioner Wall  and a second by Commissioner Cooper.  Commissioner Wall, I'm very impressed that you knew what all those acronyms stood for.  So if I can offer some comments.  I would urge my fellow commissioners to vote against Commissioner Wall's motion  for the following reasons.  The...  The final EIR calls out two very specific and critically important places  where mitigation is impossible.  That's both aesthetics in terms of the impact on the Hillview Shed,  but even more importantly, it's on greenhouse gases,  greenhouse gas emissions.  And for us, I think it would be irresponsible  for the Planning Commission to essentially ignore the fact  that this plan fails those two extremely important criteria.  If it isn't able to meet...  If this project went anywhere else, or virtually anywhere else,  I mean, it's a terrific project.  It just doesn't fit there because of the impacts  both on the two failing mitigation elements,  aesthetics and greenhouse gases,  as well as the impacts that we've talked about a lot tonight  and we've heard an awful lot of very articulate  and data-driven presentations tonight  from people who know what they're talking about.  And I think we all know it too,  in terms of the impact on water  and the...  the woodland-urban interface and the threat of fire.  So even without those last two,  and the fact that a fire will go through that area again  based on history,  even without that,  we've got two mitigation elements that can't be met,  problems that can't be mitigated.  And while we're allowed to ignore that,  we're allowed to say,  okay, well, but we're going to do it anyway,  it would be irresponsible for us to do that, I believe.  And so I urge a no vote because,  not because I'm opposed to this project,  it's a fantastic project.  If we can do this in a way that was responsible,  in a place where it fit,  I agree with the comments that said it's beautiful.  I love that.  It just doesn't work there.  It just doesn't fit.  And so again,  I urge a no vote.  I think it'd be irresponsible to ignore  the staff report that says it's impossible to mitigate  against those two things,  as well as the fact that,  we've got other problems that are pretty clearly delineated.  I haven't even talked about birds right now,  but a lot of people did,  and it's pretty critical.  There's no mitigation that's going to bring those  bird mouths back,  install a one-way door,  and they leave and they can't come back.  That's not mitigation.  So I urge a no vote on Mr. Walz's motion.  I also have some comments,  unless you're going to...  Oh, no, go ahead.  Okay.  So sorry if this gets a little long.  First, I really appreciate all the work put into this,  from our staff, the applicant, consultants,  and us and the public being here so late.  Yeah.  I've spent a long time reviewing the hundreds of pages  of specific plan and EIR documents,  because I believe that this is one of the most important decisions  that we're going to be voting on in our committee.  And I think that's why I'm here today,  as planning commissioners.  And I put a lot of time into developing some comments,  and I've grayed some out,  because other people already talked about them tonight,  so good job.  And I'll try to keep this brief and interesting  and to the point.  So tonight, we're asked to vote on certifying  the environmental impact report document,  as well as voting on whether or not to approve  the Valley's Edge specific plan,  along with a statement of overriding considerations  that would state our reasons for approving a project  that has significant unavoidable environmental impacts  related to aesthetics and greenhouse gases.  So I found the EIR for environmental impact report  to be reasonably complete and accurate,  so I'm focusing my comments on the accuracy and merits  of the VESP, Valley's Edge specific plan,  and the recommended statement of overriding considerations.  So I'm going to describe some of the ways that I found  the overriding considerations proposed to not be sufficient  to approve a project with significant unavoidable  greenhouse gas emissions.  But I want to clarify first that I do believe that there are ways  to grow in a smart way,  and I will be open to further discussion on this,  but first want to talk about these issues that I have.  So yeah, huge opportunity.  With this huge site that could be annexed into the city of Chico,  and I think as a commission,  we have a really exciting opportunity to shape what that looks like,  like what types of housing, what types of uses.  And normally when projects come to us,  they're very solidified and we just check the boxes  to make sure that everything looks right.  But I think we have more opportunity here  to make sure that this is what's best for Chico.  So first, I want to recognize that there is a major need  for housing in our community.  I think we all can agree on that.  Several months ago, we approved the general plan housing element  with the RHNA, or Regional Housing Needs Allocation,  which showed we have an extreme need for housing,  largely for low-income folks,  and that in our last cycle, we bill over twice as many houses  for above moderate as were needed.  So I really agree with Rich Ober's points that, yes,  we do need above moderate housing,  low-income housing, but we've been really underbuilding  low-income housing and need to ensure that that does get built.  And one of the ways we can ensure that it gets built  is ensuring there's enough land available.  And some of our public commenters have noted  that there's not a lot of land in the current proposal  that would be available for medium-high residential,  which naturally supports more affordable housing use types  and also can support subsidized housing.  So I think that's a really important point.  As we learned in the housing element process,  the state HCD, Housing Community Development,  designates 30 units per acre density  as supportive of affordable housing, potentially.  So that's one thing that I would love to see,  is more of that dense zoning area at the foot of the project.  So...  Yeah, so as it's proposed,  it would largely be low density,  which houses on large lots go for a lot of money right now.  Even R2 zoning, medium density, I've looked it up.  Houses are for sale, brand new houses on R2 lots  for between $450,000 and $550,000,  something that I can't afford,  nor can most moderate-income people and families.  And seniors.  And that is, of course,  a byproduct of our terrible housing market right now.  And I do enjoy some of the proposed R2 zoning types in this,  like the cottage housing, I think is a really smart addition.  So there are some great elements of this project  that I just want to appreciate.  Okay.  And yeah, like I said,  would love to see more of the medium-high density zoning,  or R3.  I'm concerned about senior housing.  Our housing element also had a lot  of discussion of what housing is needed  for seniors in our community,  and quoted, let's see,  that about half of the seniors in our community  are low or very low income.  And they also quoted Passages,  an agency on aging-serving caregivers  and older adults in our county,  as saying that there is a need for smaller homes,  one-story homes, wide doorways, grab bars,  walkable neighborhoods,  and being near public transportation.  So those are just some things to consider  in designing housing for seniors.  And...  Okay.  I will try to make this somewhat quick.  Let's see.  Finally, on the topic of senior housing,  of course we need to be building housing for our seniors.  I have personal concerns with designating  about half of the project for seniors only.  I don't quite understand  not including seniors within the entire project  because age diversity is important,  especially for people to be able to live near their elders  and elders to be able to live near their children  or their grandchildren.  And I understand the need for a large amount of it,  but not the land use being separated that way.  That's just a side note, I suppose.  As for general plan consistency,  some...  That was one of the overriding considerations.  I do think that in some senses,  this project does comply with some of our general plan goals,  which is great,  but there are some where it doesn't.  Commenters had pointed out,  or I noticed in the staff report,  one of them is goal sustainability six,  reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions citywide.  And as people noted,  this project would have significant  greenhouse gas emissions.  There's also a goal of circulation nine  in the general plan,  reducing the use of single occupant motor vehicles  and policy circulation 9.3,  emphasize automotive trip reduction  and design review and approval of project  and private development,  which this project will reduce...  Increase VMT, vehicle miles traveled  and greenhouse gas emissions,  which I don't feel is consistent.  And there are some other ones about policy land use 1.2,  maintain long-term boundaries between urban  and agricultural uses in the West  and between urban uses in the footway.  And there is also a goal  and limiting expansion north and south  to produce a compact urban form.  This project does not produce  a compact urban form  when you look at the entire project  and extends into the foothills.  And policy CD-24,  protect view sheds from foothill development  through the careful location and design of roads,  buildings, landscaping,  and other infrastructure.  There is indeed some context sensitive planning  in this project,  which I appreciate,  but it does extend further  into the foothills  than what was originally proposed  in the general plan,  as we saw in the staff report  at the very beginning of this meeting.  And one more general plan policy  that I'll specifically point out  is policy circulation 5.3,  transit connectivity and projects,  states that we need to ensure  that new development supports public transit.  And according to the Butte County Transit  and Non-Motorized Transportation Plan,  a general threshold for transit support  of residential uses is 15 units per acre,  for high frequency bus service.  And the community core  could theoretically support that,  but I think that we would better support transit  with more multifamily zoning  like the medium high density residential.  Like I mentioned, it differs a little,  the Valley's Edge specific plan is proposed now  from what was proposed originally  in the general plan,  which was alternative to in the EIR,  as it leaves less open space in its current form.  So that concerns me.  And I think it could be done better.  So the only way that I would consider  this to be really consistent with our general plan  and the needs of our community  is if the project was relatively compact  and served the families of our community  who truly need housing of all types.  And I think this would be possible  by providing significant space  for naturally affordable, denser housing types  with naturally lower environmental impacts,  which would look like preserving more open space,  higher in the elevations,  while including much higher density,  lower down and more of the mid to low density  surrounding that.  So yeah, I think I have just another page.  What I joke about that.  Well, like I said,  this is probably the most important thing  we're gonna vote on.  And my term at planning commission's almost up.  So if I don't get it,  I'll get reappointed.  You all won't have to.  Anyway, so yeah,  there's going to be a community park site,  which I think is great.  And that's one of the overriding considerations.  My criticism of that is that the city isn't sure  that they can manage the park  and that a lot of the open space  is going to be HOA members only.  And I would love to see all the recreational spaces  be entirely open to the public.  And yeah, so in summary,  I think, yeah,  I do not believe that there's substantial evidence  to support the proposed overriding considerations  of the project as it is currently proposed.  I am however,  open to making significant changes to the project  to find a compromise that would both supply  the necessary housing for our community  and avoid harm to our environment.  Okay, I'm done.  Let me ask you a question.  Of course.  Are you proposing that Valley's Edge  solve all the housing problems you just went through?  No.  I don't believe that one development can solve all of them.  You implied that, however.  Well, I think that it would be great  if Valley's Edge can play a significant role in solving it  because it's such a large development.  They are doing that.  They are doing their share.  I mean, there's a lot of other opportunities  around the other three quarters of the pie of Chico  that can be utilized to help with that,  not just Valley's Edge.  This is a long-term project  and it's not going to fix today's problem.  We definitely differ on opinions there,  I believe, that because we have the ability  to shape this project as a special planning area  that we should require it to help solve more  of our deficit of low-income housing.  Do you mind if I pipe in so I'm not the evil guy  that's seconding Larry's motion without saying why I sort of did it?  I don't mind at all.  Can I start off?  I grew up in North County, San Diego.  I can't start off.  It's going to be a long one.  I don't have anything typed out.  But I did.  And I grew up where I actually,  Interstate 15, I went under the freeway  and I fed horses.  I drove a dirt, we took a dirt road to the beach.  I get it.  I was like, and then I saw all of a sudden about 1986,  every hill, everything was covered with houses  and truck houses and they messed up.  They didn't plan.  I mean, you got this little tiny park.  You couldn't find it in somewhere in a neighborhood  and traffic.  And when I came to Chico in 93, I was like,  oh my gosh, this is so cute and adorable.  And I hate growth.  I don't want to see it either.  But I don't want this to be Boulder, Colorado either.  My wife was fortunate enough to go to school there.  And you can't buy a rat shack for less than like $600,000  there because they stopped all growth.  So we, everybody, we talked about this affordable housing,  affordable housing for the city doesn't build.  The contractors can't build.  There's no demands for low-income housing.  If they can't afford, you know, a $2,000 a month,  studio.  So we have to grow.  We have to expand.  I think Bill's project is beautiful.  I also, if we build up north, we keep the second thing was  everybody grab the greenhouse gas, greenhouse gas,  greenhouse gas.  Well, we build 2,000 units up north.  That's going to triple versus where Valley's Edge is.  So that also would be bad for our environment because  they're all traveling down here.  We have an elementary school, the high school,  all the shopping all right there,  plus their own core village and bike paths.  So I'm like, okay.  So I just want to say that I don't want Boulder.  I don't want, I would love my house value to jump up double.  Sure, I'm fine.  I own a house.  I'm good.  But for the future generations, they need houses.  We need to grow.  So that's just some of my explanations.  There's a lot more, but Tony's giving me dirty looks.  So.  Any other comments?  I have one.  One more thing to say.  You know, there's a lot of talk about growing up instead of out.  And I just want people to kind of understand that that's a great concept.  But there are also constraints to zoning and height limitations.  And when you're talking about low-income housing,  there's constraints for funding that they have to be so far away from a bus stop.  So it's not as easy as saying we want to build more affordable, low-income housing.  It's not that easy.  So, you know, it's a lot of that stuff is dictated at the state level, federal levels,  and the city's hands are often tied.  But I think that to Paul's comment, I think when you're between a rock and a hard spot,  there's not a whole lot of options for the city to grow.  Opportunity size.  There's a chance for it to grow.  Sorry.  We closed the public hearing.  Thank you.  So I think that what we have before us tonight is they've checked a majority of the boxes.  It's the best development plan I've seen for Chico, period.  And they've, you know, really taken a lot of things into consideration that a lot of developers don't.  So thank you.  Okay.  So I'll stop.  I'll weigh in.  Commissioner Goldstein, I think ‑‑ I don't think this is the most important decision  of your tenure.  I think it's the most important decision that really as a generation that we're going to make.  We heard from city staff.  We have not seen a special planning area development plan come to us since the general plan was passed.  Okay.  So I think this is really the first opportunity that we have.  And maybe ‑‑ I've been on the planning commission for, oh, gosh, ten years.  And haven't seen anything like this come forward.  So the weight of what we are doing tonight is not lost on me.  And I will say, knowing my colleagues fairly well, I know it's not lost on them either.  With the amount of energy and time that we've put into this.  I would say ‑‑ I think it was Pam Posey who mentioned something about how great it would be for the land to be purchased and be an open space.  And, gosh, I thought that would have been wonderful.  And it would have been wonderful to be in an ag easement forever.  And personally, as, you know, a resident of Chico, I would have loved that.  But that's not what we have before us today.  We have before us a plan that fully aligns with where we said in our general plan that we want growth to happen.  So we had years and years of discussions on where are the areas in Chico that we are going to put the houses that we need.  And this falls right within one of those five special planning areas.  So this is where we said we as a community, and maybe not each and every one of us individually, but this is what was passed.  This is where we as a community want to grow.  So then where do we go from there?  Because now we have a plan in front of us.  I think it's very special that we have, you know, this developer on this project.  And I think it's very special that we have this developer on this project.  Who is coming before us.  Who has spent 14 years, 15 years putting together a plan that I think is very thoughtful and very intelligent.  And, you know, very well done and intentional.  It is something that I don't know that we always have that opportunity to have that type of project before us.  And so I'm thankful that we have that.  You know, this was something that a lot of thought was put in.  into. I would add, I appreciate Commissioner Goldstein's comment, and I think as we're voting,  making a statement of overriding consideration is a very significant action that we're taking.  And that is something that we have to fully align with what those statements of overriding  consideration state. I stand here, sit here, I guess, because it's late, fully believing that  the statement of overriding considerations do align with what we are significant and unavoidable  impacts.  The greenhouse gas emissions, I'm not a climate scientist. I'm not going to say that I would be  one. I think there's a high probability that we will probably get that impact on any of the  special planning areas where we have designated that we want growth to go. I don't think that's  specific to this site. So really what it comes down for me is that aesthetic. Is that aesthetic  something that we want to be a part of? I don't think that's specific to this site.  I think that's specific to this site. So really what it comes down for me is that aesthetic. Is that  So this is something that I'm willing to give up to have open space, to have the additional  housing that we need, to have a plan that has community parks and open space and all the things  that we say we want as a community. And that's something that I can hang my hat on. So with that,  I would fully support Commissioner Walz's motion.  And if nobody wants to say anything, does anybody want to call for the vote?  Let's call for a vote.  Okay.  Oh, go ahead, Commissioner.  The only thing I was going to add is that I think Chico,  and I want to be the optimist here, is going to grow in the right way,  and we're going to solve whatever problems we each individually  or communally see over the next few years  and have the city that we all want.  And I think it takes lots of different projects,  lots of different ways of going about it,  and I think this is one way of doing it.  This is a long-term project versus there's lots of things  that can happen in a much shorter period of time  which solves some of the concerns about more affordable housing, I think.  Just a couple of days ago, I was made aware of a project  on East 6th Avenue by the water towers  that adding a number of ADUs  and bringing...  bringing a lot of really low-priced, affordable type of housing.  And I think there's a lot more of that going on  than sometimes we're aware,  or city staff could probably tell us,  but I was impressed by what they were able to do  on just one lot in Chico,  in the, I call it the core or whatever.  So I think it's going to take a lot of different projects,  a lot of different ways of going about it,  whether it's a Kmart development,  or, you know, lots of things have been talked about,  but I think...  I'm...  I'm in agreement.  This project, I think,  over the long run,  is a good thing for Chico.  So...  I'll support it also.  Okay.  All those in favor  of the motion that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 22-10,  recommending that the City Council certify the EIR,  adopt the Statement of Overwriting Considerations,  and approve the Valley's Edge Specific Plan  and related applications,  signify by saying aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  No.  So that motion carries 5-2.  And we will move to the next item,  if you guys could hang with me.  Regular agenda, there is none.  Reports and communications?  No, Madam Chair.  I have nothing to report.  Okay.  And are we planning to have a meeting on December 15th?  No, we're not.  Okay.  So we will see you next year.  Yes, please.  Okay. Thank you.  Your turn's up.  When is the...  When do they redo?  Don't you know someone that could appoint you?  Again?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
