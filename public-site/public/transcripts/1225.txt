 i believe we have six.  all right. i'll call the first  two names and if you could line up in the middle  aisle and be ready to  come forward. the first two speakers  are sam barber followed by james  hetchinson.  james.  james.  james.  hello.  i'm wondering when the cops in the city of  chico will be satisfied with the amount of  funding they get.  yet again we're in a place where nearly half  of our budget is being allocated to them.  not only that but about 60% of the measure  h funding is going to the police as well.  measure h was something largely branded as  being used to fix our infrastructure,  homelessness, how many times we have to  allocate such a large portion of our  budget to something that has been proven  time and time again to not solve the  problems facing chico.  homelessness is on the rise.  downtown is in shambles run by greedy  landlords who don't care for our  community or the small businesses in it.  i can tell you from experience as someone  who's owned a business downtown for five  years now i've only seen my landlord a  couple times they could care less for the  building they purchased or the well-being  of the tenants.  all they care about is the passive income  they receive.  our streets and roads are crumbling.  people are more scared than ever and struggling  to pay bills and afford rent.  i'm wondering what the end goal is with  continuously giving the police more and more  money.  it seems we always have money when they ask  for it but when it comes to meaningfully  addressing homelessness enabling small businesses to thrive downtown, protecting renters and ensuring rent is affordable, creating a more democratic  election process, paying our public workers  living wages, or ensuring all people in chico  have access to health care, we never  have the money, we never talk about it,  or it receives pennies on the dollar  relative to what the police get.  how many weapons and police do we need  until it resolves the problems facing the city?  how are the police going to keep people's  rent affordable?  how will they address homelessness other than terrorizing them and taking them from one place to another?  how will they create an environment downtown  that enables local businesses to thrive?  how will they address the rising costs of  rent and protect those who need a place to live?  i'm growing tired of my taxes  going towards something that has been proven  failure over and over.  we as a city can do better and set an example  for other cities not only in california  but the united states.  but instead we continue to slam our head against a wall  trying over and over with a failed method of  half our budget going to the police.  some of our council members should be more concerned  with these issues facing chico and its  everyday people than garnering 500  plus dollar donations from the better chico  pack. it seems that when you take money  from packs associated with real estate developers  that it influences your ability to effectively  lead. the last piece i want to end with  here is something that makes me feel very unsafe  is when there's a modern day genocide and holocaust  going on that the majority of the council  will not acknowledge or condemn.  thank you.  thank you. james hutchinson followed by  connie lecroy.  there are some that would probably prefer  i don't have a term but with that i'll  just say it.  okay.  we're in a new world out here.  when people want to move their business  they're no longer looking through a  series of spreadsheet tabs or any of the  other research things.  they're going to ai.  and what is ai telling them?  if you ask ai, any of them,  seven reasons why i shouldn't  relocate my business to chico,  guess what?  you heard a lot of what you just heard.  and these are ai. these are separate.  there's also though,  they're talking about homelessness.  they're talking about high commercial  rent costs.  vacant storefronts and limited retail  variety. parking difficulties  and new parking systems.  economic challenges and job market  limitations. these are what people  researching why i should not bring  a business to chico.  okay. simple. crime.  crime is  repeatedly brought in here.  substance abuse. rising  cost of living and living wage  pressures, best put.  but that's only one of the  search engines.  two more on the same question  reached a lot of similar conclusions  except they're focusing on what's  the business environment here.  we don't see when you're going  through all these new reports  you're doing any input from the  outside world.  we don't see that.  from the outside world,  in a lot of ways,  but i've also lived in chico for a  long time.  1975, off and on.  i have a good idea that these  people, these ai's are actually  tapping into what people outside  of here are thinking. and that's  the important thing. it's not what  you think. it's what people who  want to bring a business here  think. what they have.  i've mentioned before i worked for  a company that wanted to relocate  here. a laser company.  it was very successful.  and eventually became part of  hoya.  because when they tried to move  to chico, they went into the  chamber of commerce,  the ceo, and when he got in  there, they couldn't understand  what the laser business was all  about.  in the meantime, in oroville,  there was another laser firm.  guess what? compatible businesses  that could have been a growth  industry for chico. you have people like sandy  who chose not to come here because  of the way she was treated.  but you need to look at these ai's,  lay it out there, and see what  the outside opinion. what's out there  in the market? how do they see you?  they're calling this party town  again in other places.  party town. because all the beer  you're trying to throw everywhere.  they're calling it party town.  they're going backwards. not forwards.  you're not bringing in new businesses.  goodbye.  thank you.  thank you. Thank you. Connie LaCroix followed by Andrew Merkel. Hi, good evening. I'm here to talk about the state  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem If I go to the deep end of the pool, the water is only up to my knees or my hips. I see a lot of kids diving in.  podem  podem  podem  podem  there and bathe there. So it's actually a health hazard. This last weekend, I was able to speak  with the lifeguards. They know that legally, they're supposed to be able to see the bottom  of the pool. They cannot. So the question is, I would like to know when and how the problem will  be alleviated. I have talked to CARD. It's not their responsibility. I have talked to maintenance.  They have to talk to Fish and Game. So it seems like there's a little loop going on here.  So I hope that you can address this soon. It's June now. We only have about two or three more  months of swimming. Thank you. Thank you. Andrew Merkel, followed by Cynthia Perrine.  Dear City Council members, I want to address the ongoing vagrant crisis in Chico,  which has reached the top of the list of the highest-hitting  and most dangerous species in the world. The virus has reached alarming levels. Recently, a stabbing  attack at a homeless shelter in Salem, Oregon, injured a dozen people, highlighting the dangers  we face in our own community. A man entered the shelter with a knife and attacked multiple people,  individuals demonstrating how quickly situations can escalate. This incident should serve as a  wake-up call for all of us. In Chico, we have a serious problem with drugs and homelessness that  is not being addressed properly. Feeding the wildlife does not solve our issues. It only  masks them. We have to address the problem of the virus. We have to address the problem of the  virus. We have to address the problem of the virus. We have to address the problem of the virus.  The judge has not responded to the concerns of our community, and the council seems unwilling to  challenge his decisions. Building more low-income apartments and using vacant city lots for  pallet homes will not fix the problem. It's like playing a game of whack-a-mole, spending $6 million  over three years, but seeing no real progress. A recent study failed to differentiate between men  and women, and it also went against federal laws. Renting out vacant land with sheds has always been  illegal on county and state. The law is not being used to address this problem. The law is being  passed against the city's property. A responsible city council would stand up against the judge's  ruling. Taxpayers should not have to bear the cost of these services when we are getting nothing in  return. We continue to face the same issues day after day. It seems that most of our city council  members are too close to the problem to provide a strong leadership. If I were the mayor, I would  firmly tell the judge to reconsider his priorities and not impose unfair measures on our community.  We deserve better support and real solutions for our people. Thank you.  Thank you for your attention to this critical issue.  Thank you.  Cynthia Perrine, followed by Tammy Harvey.  Madam Mayor, Council, and City staff,  I'm here in my capacity as Executive Director  of Northern California Regional Land Trust  as part of Accreditation's Periodic Public Notice.  An accredited land trust since 2000,  incorporated in 1990,  Northern California Regional Land Trust  serviced area of Butte, Glenn, Tehama counties  includes Chico, where our board members  come from sectors of local business,  agriculture, natural resource law enforcement,  and education.  The mission of NCRT is to assist landowners,  communities, and public agencies  to voluntarily protect land and other natural resources.  We do so largely through conservation easements  and mitigation banks.  With long-range planning that promotes  or restores watershed's health and wildlife connectivity,  ensures proactive fuels management within the wildlife urban interface and  conserves or enhances prime agricultural soils. Over 35 years this approach  alongside skilled partners and land stewards continues to serve local people  through new opportunities to maintain and enjoy in perpetuity our unique and  unparalleled wildland features including those surrounded Chico. I'll briefly  sketch our current holdings relevant to City of Chico and share imminent  acquisitions in our pipeline. Currently with a portfolio of 40,985 total acres  17,618 are located in Butte County with an additional 16,156 acres located  within a 10 mile radius of Chico. 750 acres are peripheral to the City of  Chico and 330 acres are directly within the City of Chico sphere of influence.  Thus as land managers City of Chico  and the City of Chico are in the same boat.  The City of Chico and NCRLT are not just partners we're neighbors and as neighbors we both benefit from active engagement.  Within that 10 mile radius of City of Chico 12,735 acres are under agreement  with NCRLT to establish legal land protections over the next two to five  years. This is really exciting for our community. You can learn more by reaching  out to me directly to a member of our board or by responding to our  organization's request for partnership.  NCRLT vision for the future is a world where well-planned communities informed by  meaningful stake holder input hold space for nature. We vision green spaces  accessible to everyone. We appreciate your ongoing partnership to pursue where  your community land trust vision  intersects with the City of Chico.  I thank you for your time this  evening. Thank you. Tammy Harvey is our last speaker. Hi.  This is my first time doing this, but I have owned my own home in Chico for 12 years.  When I purchased it, I was told that city sewer was going in the next five years.  In 2021, my septic system failed.  I called the city to tie into the city sewer and was told that there was no longer any plans.  My only option was to rebuild my septic system.  I hired Chico Septic to do that, and I had it enlarged to accommodate an ADU that I was having built.  I started the permitting process last year and was told that my septic system is no longer sufficient,  and I am being told that all of city of Chico is in a nitrate zone,  and then I need to have a denitrification system put in.  From the engineers I've spoken to, there are currently three nitrate maps out.  Two of them show that my home address is not in a nitrate zone.  One shows it is.  The building department said I'm not in a nitrate zone.  Environmental health says I am in a nitrate zone.  I have been going in circles.  I've been going in circles since last year to try to get my ADU permitted.  I do not think that it is fair that I just had my septic system rebuilt less than four years ago.  I do have to have it completely rebuilt again.  I'm not sure what else I should say, but thank you for listening.  Thank you for letting us know.  All right, public hearings.  Hearing to consider the final annual engineer's report and levy in collections  on the 2025 assessment for the Housa Ranch.  The next item is the Housa Ranch Nob Hill neighborhood.  Mr. Gustafson.  thank you, mayor Reynolds and council.  This is just our annual approval of the engineers report to levy the assessment,  the landscape and lighting district on the Housa Ranch Nob Hill neighborhood for the playground.  The annual levy for this year is $86.07 per parcel.  That is a $1.95 increase from the 2024-25 assessment.  We recommend approval.  All right.  Any questions from our let's get our speakers first and then we will open the public hearing.  Do you have any speakers on this item?  We do not.  Okay.  Close the public hearing.  Does anybody have questions for staff?  No.  All right.  Move to approve.  Second.  Second by council member Hawley.  Okay.  Council member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council member Hawley.  Yes.  Council member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Hearing to review and approve the 2025 consolidated plan on the 2025-2026 annual action plan.  Mary Jo Alonzo, our housing program manager. [inaudible]  All right.  Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council.  Tonight is the final public hearing on the city's 2025 through 2029 consolidated plan  for the use of community development block grant funding and home funding coming from  the department of urban development, HUD.  As discussed during the first public hearing on April 15th, the city contracted with housing  and housing tools to assist with the completion of the consolidated plan and Sherry Mercado  is here if you have any questions after this short presentation.  As a reminder, the consolidated plan is a five-year strategic planning document developed  through a collaborative process that allows local jurisdictions to define the vision for  housing and community development.  It aligns with HUD funded programs and with locally identified needs and priorities promoting  consolidated planning, community engagement and efficient housing.  city and the current uses of resources.  The plan establishes program goals, specific objectives and measurable benchmarks to track  our progress.  The department of housing and urban development requires a consolidated plan to address specific  national goals focused on serving low and moderate income individuals.  The goals are listed on this slide.  And they're targeting low income individuals, which I had mentioned at the last meeting,  are those earning at or below 80% of the area and building area.  And those are those individuals that are meeting income.  For example, this would be a family of four earning less than $72,000 a year.  The consolidated plan is comprised of five overarching priority needs and each priority  need is broken down into 12 goals as shown on the table above.  The priority needs and goals were developed through our public engagement process with  with interviews with stakeholders,  and with the overarching goal of aligning our goals and directives,  as outlined by Council,  in the recently approved housing element  and with last five-year consolidated plan.  As I went over in our first public hearing,  these are lofty priority needs and goals  that serve as a strategic framework  for maximizing the impact of our limited HUD funds.  Proposed programs and activities were prioritized  because they aligned with past HUD-funded priorities  and, as I mentioned, aligned with goals in our housing element.  HUD recently released the 2025 allocations.  There was a very slight increase to both the CDBG and the home,  which are shown there.  And there were slight increases,  and so that meant I had to revise the budget a little bit.  Those changes are noted in Exhibit B.  That's attached to the staff report.  The few minor changes I'll highlight  is that we rebudgeted CDBG funding  for a current project that we're working on  with Habitat for Humanity.  It's a small owner-occupied project  building five homes on Roslyn Court.  It's currently under development.  Staff is also requesting amending language  in our annual plan to allow CDBG funds  to be allocated to either the North Cedar Street project  or the Fair Housing.  The new project is the multi-modal reconstruction project.  This allows flexibility to allow staff  to align environmental review processes  and requirements of either capital project.  I do want to let you know that the CDBG funding  does not affect either project's ability  to proceed for completion.  And then, in addition to the changes to the budget,  we updated the CDBG funding. ! Just wanted to show that as it's a change from what you saw last time.  effectively And so that funding went towards the rehab program for Turning Point Commons.  program for turning point Commons  And as mentioned in the public hearing on April  15th I want to highlight that significant public outreach has been undertaken to encourage citizen participation  During this plan the plan was available for over 30 days for public comment. We haven't received public comment  and tonight is the last time for public comment before I  Ask you for  Review and approval and this concludes my report happy to any answer any questions that you might have any questions for missile Alonzo  No, all right  Open the public hearing  Do we have any speakers? We do not we do not. Okay close the public hearing  consider a motion  Move to approve second  Motion in a second  Councilmember Goldstein  Councilmember Holly yes councilmember O'Brien  Councilmember van overbeck  Councilmember Winslow vice mayor Bennett. Yes mayor Reynolds. I carry 7-0  All right under the regular agenda  So we are going to hear item number 5.4 first before we go to the annual budget  And so I will toss it to council member O'Brien  Thank you mayor first I want to thank chief Standridge and his team for moving this cancer screening program forward  Thank you very much for that. That's innovative and  Really an outstanding way to take care of your men and women your people Thank You Steve  Second the purpose of my request is to ensure that we are giving all our public safety professionals this cancer screening for free  we asked these  professionals to put themselves in harm's way to  protect our community and that can inadvertently include exposure to carcinogens  Well, we do our best to mitigate that risk through equipment and training it is impossible to remove the risk completely  So I remember vividly two funerals I attended as chief of police one was for Chico police officer Darren Reichel  Who died a cancer cause from a non-duty exposure and the second was Chico Fire Captain Joe Duran  Who also died a cancer cause from a non-duty exposure and the second was Chico Fire Captain Joe Duran  hear the answer due to an on  duty exposure shortly after I  retired a third public safety  professional and second chico  fire captain steve andrews died  from cancer again attributed to  an on duty exposure. Before we  go further into why I support  this I would like to hear from  our fire chief and a little more  about the program and thank you  chief for bringing this forward.  good evening council  mayor vice mayor council members  and thank you council member  o'brien. This is a subject that  hits our hearts in the fire  service as council member o'brien  talked about captain joe duran  and steve andrews died within  three years of each other due to  a line of duty death by cancer.  We also had to medically and  medically check the condition of  retired another firefighter  recently for the same reason and  fortunately he is still alive and  doing well. This program is  actually the collaboration  between the individual who  brought this to our attention to  chief zinko he couldn't make it  tonight to make this presentation  as he has been the one that has  been pushing forward with this  program and it is a great tribute  to what he has done to help our  firefighters. The gentleman on the  left, on your left I guess too,  is the individual is travis  egan and he brought the proposal  to us as part of the battalion  chief testing process and it was  really a really well written  document. I have a lot of  information for cancer rates and  then this program in particular  was what he was working on. I  think it is a great opportunity  that is wanting to bring it.  Several years ago I came forward  to ask for funding to fund this  program and it is a very unique  process. I will talk a little bit  about this in a moment.  I will highlight some of the  information I presented the last  time for the council members and  community who may have not seen  this. Firefighters have a 9%  higher risk of being diagnosed with  cancer than the general population.  Those cancer types are shown there  below that and you can see that  they are anywhere from about one,  a little over one to 2% higher than  anybody else in the community.  And so we take this very seriously  because these are the types of  cancer we can treat.  We can have. The last two are the  only two in the grail that don't  detect multiple myeloma and brain  cancer. This information was the  result of a 2010 study by NIOSH  and unfortunately there is no data  available that we could find for  police officers but we know they  have a higher percentage of cancer  as well.  So the impact from the perspective  of our firefighters is having this  program in place it is a consistent  testing process. It tests for 50  different cancer types. It uses  blood and the DNA in that blood to  find the markers that might indicate  that you have cancer. Or early  detection anyways which is what we  want to do is get ahead of it.  Career development is a very  The number of careers can be  preserved.  Personnel, personal and family  impacts are immense.  And then lastly is just a peace  of mind knowing each year we are  getting tested for the groups that  are eligible for it in our program.  From the city standpoint these  numbers are old.  2023.  I suspect they have gone up  substantially but the city also  pays dear price for this as well.  We have had staffing issues where  we have had people on for multiple  years waiting for their claim.  Waiting to either become healthy  or retire out.  Morale issues knowing that this  is lurking at every incident that  we go to and can expose us to  cancer it is something that weighs  on us day in and day out.  We take great precautions to do  as much as we can to diminish that  but there is always an inherent  danger regardless of the  circumstances.  And then of course the work comp  claims themselves are costly to  the city as well.  So the gallery grail program the  benefits as I alluded to improve  cancer survival rates through  early detection, reduce long-term  healthcare costs and potential  liability to the city.  We are minimizing the staffing  disruptions.  One thing that we are doing is  One thing people don't realize is  when somebody goes off on a  medical leave in this case cancer  that could be years before they  can fill that role but we are  waiting for that individual to  get better and come back to us.  It disrupts our staffing patterns  so we have to still manage that  person's seat in the engine so  we have a lot of overtime  associated with that which also  And then again peace of mind for  our public safety employees and  their families.  So the parameters that we set  into place back in 2023 we  requested 2,229,807.  And we anticipated about a cost  of 26,000 a year and we would  cover between seven and eight  years.  We reduced the cost I think it  was over $1,000 per person to  take this test.  We got them down to 649 per  firefighter that are for all  firefighters and firefighters  that are within that age range  and the years on with the fire  service.  And then family members or people  that want to pay out of their  pocket including city employees  So we're starting to see it  starting to get legs under it.  Test eligibility for us is 35  years and older and at least 60  months of professional wildfire  or municipal firefighting.  And then the eligible groups at  what we started with were  retirees, our volunteers, fire  personnel, family members, city  staff and we opened that up and  that's where we're at today.  Overview.  We have a lot of work to do.  We started in 2023 establishing  a capital improvement plan.  It was funded with that $229,000  seed money and contracted with  the grail company and started  our testing cycle in 2023.  That first year we had 30  firefighters that we tapped into  it was 19,000 a little over  19,000 and 60 total individuals  tested at the discounted rate.  And then we had a lot of  testing that we did in the  last year and we had a bump up  to 37.  So did our costs and we ended  up with 40 total individuals  testing at the discounted rate.  We anticipate the total funds so  far expended has been 43,483  with the remaining of 186,324  so we estimate another six to  seven years that we continue to  use it with these parameters.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So I will get to the nuts and  bolts of it.  We were asked just to be  restrictive to the public safety.  There was some discussion about  public works operations.  We did not do the numbers for  them but they could certainly be  included in that in any fashion  that the council desires.  So if we were just to pay out  for the rest of firefighters  with no age limit or no years  When we combine both sworn police  officers and all firefighters we  jump up to 113,575.  And that is the conclusion of my  presentation and I'  m happy to answer any  questions you may have.  All right questions for  council member wenzel.  There'  s a discounted rate for all  city employees and you mentioned  60 and 40 people use that.  Do you know what classification  and we may have them.  We don'  t know the people that take the  test and we certainly don'  t know anything about their  results.  So I couldn'  t answer that question I can  certainly get that if it'  s available.  Okay thanks.  Council member bannon.  So chief in 23 we approved  this for the fire department.  Correct.  Yeah so what we'  re talking about now is  extending it to the police  department.  Yes it would ours has  restrictions because we wanted  to spread it out as best as we  could over the course of that  money.  So we put into place the 35 and  over as well as 60 months in the  fire service.  Whether it'  s here elsewhere or a  combination of both.  Thank you.  Council member holly.  Very last slide there was a  cost estimate for all  firefighters and all police  officers combined.  So we had to go through a  number of different  estimate was 35 years old and  up?  No it was for all.  For all firefighters and the  number of sworn police officers.  Okay so no age limit no 60  months served.  And that'  s what I asked chief  standards to bring back to us to  be clear.  And the program works really  well.  It'  s pretty smooth we haven'  t had any issues with it.  It'  s been a really good experience  working with them.  And so we would continue to  retain that managing that  program so it doesn'  t create any  administrative burdens on  anybody else although it'  s not much related to it.  When somebody has oh  sorry.  Go ahead council member  Goldstein.  Go first if you like.  No go ahead.  Okay well I had a quick  question.  Do public works employees in  operations also tend to have  higher cancer rates?  That I couldn'  t tell you.  Okay.  I wish I could tell you.  But no.  Fair enough.  And also following up on  council member Holly'  s question did you get a  chance to look at if we included  both firefighters and police but  with the age and time served  restrictions how much that would  cost?  No we just analyzed it for  all.  Okay thanks.  Mine was just an easy one.  When somebody has this do they  recommend this screening yearly  or when somebody has it done do  they.  When we get to 35 and over  we will have a screening  monthly.  And effectively effectively For as long as the funding will support it. Support. OK.  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  They're breathing nasty stuff all the time, too.  Well, I will say this.  The police provide a lot of support for us on fires.  So they're closing roads down.  They've had a history of now going in and doing evacuations and wildfire incidents.  So they're supposed to do the same stuff.  They wouldn't be as prolific as we have.  And like I said, we have a very prescriptive process to clean our bunker gear, get cleaned up, and limit the amount of off-gassing that occurs and creates that carcinogens that would enter your body.  And if I may also add to that, police officers are exposed to drug labs and the dangers they present not knowing what those are.  There's a whole generation of drug agents that have died because of those exposures.  A whole generation.  In addition, there are times where police officers go into buildings and do not know what's being put in the air.  I can tell you from personal experience as a sergeant, the same exposure that Darren Reichel experienced was in a local feed store.  We started to smell this in the middle of the night trying to catch a burglary suspect.  Didn't know what that smell was.  Smelled like hay or something, which would not be out of the ordinary in this place.  Ended up being they were fumigating that building.  And we did not know that at that time.  And that caused that cancer.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So do we have any speakers?  We do.  We have two.  Okay.  And I'll call both your names.  James Hutchinson, followed by Lori Monroe.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  When this issue first became an item for this council, I was here and I spoke on it.  What I asked was whether any studies show the validity of this test that proved it.  Understand, this test does not meet the FDA requirements yet.  They have not passed yet.  They are still doing studies.  The one study they've done was a group of people in an older age of 50 to 79, 6,600, somewhere around there, people.  But they were older people and they were selected because they likely did not have any genetic factors that could lead to cancer.  They didn't have any known cancer.  And this study was the only one that's been completed.  Okay?  And you're saying this thing works well.  Did you hear during this whole report how many cases of cancer were found by this test?  And this test has been used.  So how many were?  If you go to the website for these people and look at it, they have a special section for firefighters.  And what they admit in that section is they've never tested firefighters as an individual group in terms of the validity.  And they've never done that.  Okay?  And you're telling me that this is going to work perfectly.  It's going to work for the police.  It's going to work for the fire.  I'm all in favor of testing for cancer.  My wife was operated on in December of 2023 for bowel cancer, a tumor this big that had to be removed.  She's not the only person I know that's had cancer that is not a police officer or a fire officer.  The North State is unusually high.  And cancer rates.  The efforts that are being made by Enloe are dramatic.  And that's one of the things we should be funding for everybody.  But here we have this whole test.  We have no new studies.  Since the last time I appeared before this council, I'm not hearing it here.  I'm not hearing any test.  The risk group that they, if you read their site, they constantly refer.  They refer to risk at risk groups.  And they refer to this 50 to 79 year old group.  It's not related to what you're talking about here.  They really aren't.  They're not people out in the field.  They're not people facing really toxic items.  And yet you're saying this works.  This works.  It's DNA.  It must work.  It doesn't because it hasn't been proven.  Until it's proven.  It's proven to work.  It doesn't work.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Lori Monroe.  I recently retired as 25 years working as a nurse practitioner in primary care.  Primarily.  And so cancer screening was a major daily part of my job.  And my concern about this program is that it doesn't involve the primary care.  Provider.  The person who knows that individual well.  It's a it is a proven fact that police officers and firemen get higher rates of cancer.  And it would probably behoove the city of Chico to encourage their employees to be screened for cancers.  And they can be screened at an earlier time.  The I did a real quick Google search.  And if I was still working I would have access to other data.  But.  There is an increased risk and there is a recommendation that standard screenings for instance lung and colorectal cancer start for firemen and perhaps also for policemen.  I don't recall at an earlier age.  But they could do it with the insurance that the city provides them.  And they can do it.  In coordination with their primary care provider who can follow up on the results and make sure those results are followed up on.  And you I' m certain that the city of Chico is paying more for health insurance because you have policemen and firemen working for you.  And so you should take advantage of this ability to provide a service.  To them.  Through.  The means that is already present and already paid for.  And since the enactment of the affordable care act screenings for cancer come without copay.  So those are visits and studies that can be done without additional cost to the individual or the firemen or policemen or public works person.  And it would be good for the city of Chico.  To educate their staff about the need for screenings because their staff are human beings and because of their particular risks related to their job.  Thank you.  thank you.  And she' s our last speaker.  thank you.  All right.  Council member o'brien did you have something additional.  I will make a motion unless someone else has a comment.  yeah.  council member ben ober.  thank you.  thank you.  So this particular test.  there are no tests that are perfect.  They are always false positives and false negatives.  This particular test works by detecting anomalies in genetic material.  That represent different kinds of cancer.  So you take this one test.  It' s a blood test.  It' s not a colonoscopy.  And I' ll spare the details for those of you young people who haven' t had that experience.  But you know it takes a day.  And it' s very expensive.  But you can get screened for 50 different kinds of cancers with a simple blood test.  And it' s a completely different technology and really fantastic.  And I want to thank Steve.  I had it done when they came through in 23 and 24.  I want to thank chief Standridge.  I think it' s exactly the right thing that it be extended to the police force.  And I' m going to be presumptuous and make a motion that we approve.  well if I may can I make the motion as I have a couple things to say if I may.  I just have one really quick thing.  yes.  I' m sure all the firefighters in the back of the room are sure happy we' re talking about their bottoms right now.  But besides that is there anything that would stop the anybody from working with their personal health.  I' m sure there' s a lot of people that would like to be a personal practitioner and going and getting whatever preventative maintenance that they want to do.  This is just additional resource that we' re providing for them correct?  that is correct.  We do have annual wellness checks as well as a department.  And there are several cancer screening there.  They are welcome to go to their primary care provider and get additional ones.  This is just one of many different tools that you can utilize to create a wider breadth of potential detection.  And to answer Mr. Hutchinson' s question I know of at least one positive cancer screen.  And that was going to be my next question.  I' m sure that HIPAA would not allow us being told any of the results of any of those.  No.  We just know it was.  Somebody.  It was one person out of the group.  If they wanted to share with us personally that they found something they could.  Correct.  We can' t get the results on that.  I would just personally say that if I don' t have to attend another funeral or look at somebody else' wife and children in the eyes again like I did with Mrs.  Andrews then to me it' s a success and a win for our city.  That was my only question.  Thank you.  All right.  With that thank you Mayor and Councilmember Van Overbrook.  Thank you to Mr. Van Overbrook for your comments and of course Steve.  For bringing the details of this program forward and really starting it.  And all his team.  So no test is perfect.  We know that we understand that.  But early detection does save lives.  We know that and we also know that the men and women of public safety deserve the best when it comes to cancer screening.  That best should not cost them anything.  Since they'  re the ones that put their feet in the air.  They are the ones that are going to save their lives on the line for us.  That is their duty.  Our duty is clear as well.  As such I will make a motion in honor of chico fire captain joe duran, chico police officer darren reichel and chico fire captain steve andrews to make this cancer screening free for all firefighters and police officers after the successful completion of probation.  I would like to make a friendly amendment if accepted by you council member o'brien that this program be extended to our public works members who are at high risk exposure because as we know they are working with a whole plethora of chemicals on the job as well.  I don' t disagree with that.  I would like to have a little bit more data.  We have not looked into the cost and or the higher rate of cancer for that group.  I would like to have a little bit more data.  I would suggest we look at that in six months if you' re agreeable to that.  I will accept that.  thank you.  just before we express my I want to say no to something like this without explaining why.  I' m very supportive of health care for all people and especially making sure employees are well taken care of.  When we start getting to the territory of benefits beyond insurance I think we had a really well data based case on the firefighters.  I see a concern about the cost of the insurance.  I think we' re a little less there.  I' m concerned about expanding this to some employees without any data to even say they' re at higher risk than some other employees we' re not including in this.  We have this thing we do labor negotiations like a me too clause.  Everybody shows up and wants some of the same thing.  The fact that we had this discounted rate and people were able to negotiate us having this discounted rate makes it really broadly available to even council members and city employees.  I think that' s fantastic.  I' m concerned and we' re about to get into the budget is not great.  We can' t offer all the things that would be good.  The budget is good for our employees.  I would at least like to see more like a realistic comparison with actual data on what or which of our employees are most at risk in order for us to start selecting employee groups and give them special benefits.  if I can speak next.  I' m also concerned because I' m not seeing the exact data and when we' re questioning or we' re asking for more data on one group.  The public works employees at high risk.  and I'd also like to see what the risk factors are for each group but also I  was initially a little bit unsure process wise because our next item will  be on our budget yeah where is the money going to come from from this and in our  budget discussion based on some emails that we had it sounds like we might be  discussing some other items related to funding for fire and areas that could  receive cuts to receive money and it just feels like this would be a better  discussion for the next item and I'm not comfortable yet voting for this even  though I obviously really want to make sure that our employees are safe can you  address that yeah as noted in the chiefs presentation we set aside originally  $200,000 I think there was what about 146 remaining  chief  estimates that it would last six to seven years at its current rate so  adding PD would seem to fall within the current level of funding it would  obviously increase the speed that we go through that point is it wouldn't be  something we would have to address tonight we would if you were to extend  it to PD we would continue with the funding that's already there and then  gain some understanding of how many people utilize it okay I appreciate that  clarification so it's a good question. thank you.  it sounds like we wouldn't have to amend our budget to cover this.  do you have any idea we have this  fund it'  s safe for six years  currently as it is and at the end of six years do we have any expectation of  insurance will uncover it will receive fg approval and will be like other cancer  screenings?  I would hope so but at this point I don'  t know what their process is to get it approved through insurance companies.  thank you.  We have a motion and a second.  Did we get a second?  Yep, we did.  To clarify, does the motion include later revisiting the other employees,  or is that just something we'll want to bring back later?  In six months, correct?  Yes.  Okay, great.  So that friendly amendment was for the public works workers.  Are you talking all city employees?  You did, Council Member Goldstein mentioned you'd like to see more data on all groups.  Well, for now, we can focus on the public works employees.  Okay, I just used the clarification.  Well, the motion and the second with the friendly amendment was just that.  We'll review that in six months.  Okay.  All right, Council Member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council Member Hawley.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Carry 6-1.  Okay, I'm going to do a super quick break because I don't think we're going to get through budget real fast.  So let's take a super quick one,  and then we'll come back.  We'll come right back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  We'll come back.  All right.  Item 5.1, resolution to adopt the fiscal year 2025-2026 proposed annual budget.  Mark Sorensen, city manager, take us away.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  At the May 20th meeting, Council reviewed the proposed 25-26 fiscal year budget.  At that time, Council asked to consider additional options for the staffing of Fire Engine 1.  Chief Standridge provided revised cost estimates for the fire engine 1.  Chief Standridge provided revised cost estimates for a couple of staffing options in the fiscal year coming up,  25-26, for staffing to begin in early 2026, as well as full-year fiscal estimates for the following year.  The following offsets that I'll read through for funding the options could be utilized in any combination to arrive at the total necessary to cover the added personnel costs.  One would be to reduce police officers.  By roughly an equal amount to the number of firefighters.  Another option is to eliminate the recently added tree crew.  That would be a cost savings of roughly $270,000 a year.  Another would be to reduce contributions to future year capital road projects from measure H.  Any other general funded expenses that you can think of, preferably those that are reoccurring to match the federal budget.  podem  podem  balance. Another option that'  s not advised is to allow the  general fund balance to fall  below the reserve as set forth  in the budget policies. Another  option is to wait until about  the october time frame when we  would have fairly firm  information about where all of  our funding balance is ended in  this current fiscal year. At  this point there are projections  we will not have final numbers  until roughly september or  october time frame. Usually in  october we have a very clear  idea as to where this current  fiscal year lands. Obviously at  this point in time we'  re utilizing  some projections because we only  have anywhere from two to three  quarters of actual data to rely  upon. With that I will look to  council for directions.  anybody have questions and  comments for the city manager?  council member Winslow.  it'  s a little off. We'  re talking about the budget  everything is on the table. I  feel like at the last meeting  we had discussed this fire  engine. I don'  t think anybody properly  got a feel for the impact of  the decrease in funding for  roadway maintenance that we'  looking at. One we heard the  east 20th street we'  looking at doing park avenue  all the way to bruce road. That'  s been cut in half. Now just  looking at 99 to bruce road. I  had a conversation with Mr.  Auduboni about the cascading  impacts of next year do we  finish that 20th street project  or do we do the next project we  have scheduled. Downtown we'  re looking at getting a grant  for a particular time. Is that  going to now move to the  and move that ahead of other  things. Essentially our whole  capital improvement plan is  falling by the wayside a little  bit. I want to bring some  attention to that which being  that'  s one of the options for  funding engine one we could  just stop maintaining the roads  but of course I have caution  against that. I don'  t know if anybody feels like  hearing more about that we  could because we'  re going to have to have a  future conversation about that  capital improvement plan based  on the way things are looking  right now and I want to make  sure in approving this budget we  all understand that.  so nobody is talking about if  we slide road construction  schedule out in order to fund  this our capital improvement  projects and improving roads is  not going to stop. There'  s approximately $100 million  that'  s going to be spent over the  next three years. If we take a  million or two we'  $100 million to fund a fire  engine that we need downtown  that'  s completely misleading.  we'  re already there. We had  $10 million per year is what we  had scheduled out of measure h  and we'  re under that. That'  s correct right?  We'  re like $3 million short of  that $10 million now is what  we'  re looking at and we could  have further cuts in future  years too just to understand  that.  Mr.  Ottoboni do you want to speak  to that?  Just to clarify.  In 2023 the council adopted the  10 year road rehabilitation plan  which assumed a $10 million  contribution from measure h.  So I believe the budget has below  that roughly $8 million in the  current proposed budget.  Is that because less came in  from the budget?  I think it was more than that  expected or because things got  appropriated somewhere else.  That might be Mr.  Sorensen.  It was or Barbara. That was a  combination of some revenues  particularly sales tax revenues  came slightly below expectations  and then the added cost of  payroll and public safety got  shifted to measure h.  okay. All right. I don'  t see anything else up here for  right now. Let'  s see if we have any  speakers and then we can  continue the conversation.  I will call the first two  We have five.  Okay.  I will go ahead and call  the first two names. Please line  up. Patricia  Hieronymus. I apologize if I  mispronounced that. Followed by  Ken Smith. Go ahead, Patricia.  Hi. Thank you, council. Sorry  about that. I appreciate the  opportunity to be able to speak  on this budget. 1,008 pages is a  lot to get through. I would like  to thank the city of Chico for  I was a little confused when I  saw this on the agenda. Thank  you, council members, Holly and  Goldstein for both posting about  this so I could go back and see  how the city of Chico sales and  tax use tax measure presented  measure eight back when we  voted on it in 2022. The first  line says to support vital city  services including maintaining  slash repairing streets, storm  drains, sidewalks and fixing  potholes, addressing homelessness,  protecting 911 emergency response  times, preserving the number of  non-duty police officers and  firefighters, maintaining and  improving bidwell park, neighborhood  parks and funding other general  services and essential activity.  So I brought a book about bidwell  park calling it the crown jewel of  Chico. And as it is listed in the  budget, one of the largest  municipal parks in the United  States, I would argue that it is  aging infrastructure and by that  I mean it is a groundwater  dependent ecosystem as defined by  the nature conservancy and  Audubon, California. We just had  a groundwater dependent ecosystem  tour with the view county water  and resources conservation  district. And so in defining our  groundwater dependent ecosystems,  it can determine our aquaculture  health and investing in the aging  infrastructure which is our canopy.  We are protecting lives because I  have heard quality of life thrown  out a lot around this budget which  is very vague to me but I would  argue being alive, you need to be  alive to have a quality of life.  And if you are hit by a tree, you  will not be alive. So I would  encourage you not to take any  budget away from tree care because  we have already slashed and burned  our urban forest canopy master  building. And so I would encourage  infrastructure plan in so many  ways that is disheartening and  okay, 50 seconds. 60% of measure  eight is going to police  currently. And it was projected  25 million would come in for  measure eight and I understand  from this we just said 8 million  we have reserved. So the fire  engine budget would only be 1.2  million and 2.5 the following  fiscal year. So where is all of  that 25 million minus 1.2 for  the fire engine budget? I would  build a fire engine. Where is  all of that money going? I think  south barber neighborhood, my  neighborhood district 7 needs  fire protection, disaster  assistance. We cannot build in  the barber yard specific plan  172 more units without a fire  station near us. We cannot have  LAFCO approved fiery ridge up  there on Tuscan ridge without a  fire station. That is 6.5 miles  away. And if it doesn't have a  fire engine, people will die. die thank you Ken Smith followed by Lucia Vanner Council Ken Smith representing Chico firefighters local 2734 and the fire department in general station one has obviously been delinquent in its delivery of services to the downtown district without a fire pumper for a very long time and it's taken this long to get to a point where we're having real serious conversations about finding the funding to stop this and I  finding the funding to stop this. And I appreciate, uh, Councilman, uh, Don Overbeck talked about  the road projects are going to continue. We've, we've heard an open forum, the promise to roll  over those funds, and we're not stealing funds to do other projects. I've said it before to you,  you, in our world, you fight the fire you have, right? And we are, we are in great desperate need  of a fire pumper downtown. You've been inundated with data numbers showing our call volume.  There's no department North of Sacramento that even comes close to our call volume for the number  of firefighters we have on duty. Every single day, we're, we're astronomically off the charts with,  with, um, with that. I'm not going to bore you with exact data, right? It's, it's a matter of,  we are understaffed and the compounding effect that you're going to see  from engine one back in service downtown will be incredible all the way down to the foundation of a  solid fire department is training. So the truck company downtown, we, we have a really hard time  committing them to training, which the truck company does the highest risk maneuvers in our,  in our world, right? They're going to the roof. They're doing the heavy extrication. They're  doing all these high risk things that they need to train on constantly, constantly. Well,  without an engine down here,  if we pull that,  that ladder truck down to the tower to train who's down here, no. Okay. Your closest response  station two that we run two engines out of, cause we just don't have enough stations.  That's down the road, right? We're talking about that. I just have to applaud you for  taking this on and really digging deep and, and directing the city manager to go back and find  some solutions. He's provided some solutions that now giving you a menu,  that you folks go empowered to do the work of the people by being elected to make policy to make this work. It's a way this functions. It's your turn. It's your turn to be brave. Do what needs to be done and, and make it. You want to happen and appreciate it. Thank you.  Thank you. Uh, Lucia Vanner followed by Jordan Gardner.  Good evening, council.  Member.  podem  podem ! questions about our city's priorities especially when the visible crisis of homelessness continues to worsen in recent years we've seen a pattern of !  podem  podem !  podem  podem !  podem !  podem !  podem ! the lack of support services this approach not only fails to resolve the  This approach not only fails to resolve the issue, but worsens it, contributing to cycles of trauma, incarceration, and instability.  Other cities and nations have shown there's a better way.  Finland's Housing First model, which provides permanent housing without preconditions and wraps people in support services, has led to a 68% reduction in long-term homelessness.  Finland now saves approximately 15,000 pounds per person annually in emergency and criminal justice costs.  In Salt Lake City, Utah, Housing First practice used the approach to provide permanent supportive housing and on-site case management, resulting in chronic homelessness dropped by over 90% at one point after full implementation.  Utah saw a net savings of over $8,000 per person per year, according to the Utah Housing and Community Development Division.  And in Houston, Texas, collaborative data-driven Housing First model.  The model housed over 25,000 people and avoided the expansion of its policing footprint.  Since 2011, Houston has reduced homelessness by more than 60%.  In California, despite billions spent on fragmented approaches, we're still seeing rising homelessness and unacceptable outcomes, like the 166 hypothermia deaths last year, many of which were preventable.  I myself have faced debilitating health challenges, which have rendered me temporarily houseless.  And if not for the support of family and friends, I could have easily been displaced.  And those who are homeless are never going to be able to get a place to the street.  Without the privilege of people and resources, many of us are only a few unforeseen emergencies away from houselessness ourselves.  This is a reality many find themselves unable to digest.  And a projection of these fears, I believe, contributes to the rampant dehumanization of unhoused people.  I urge the Council to reallocate a portion of the proposed law enforcement budget toward permanent supportive housing, affordable housing development, community-based mental health and substance use services.  True public safety means everyone has a place to live.  live, access to care, and dignity. I hope we can choose ethical long-term  effectiveness over short-term enforcement.  Thank you. Thank you. Jordan Gardner, followed  by Cynthia Perrine.  Thank you, Lucia. Hello,  council members. I am also concerned  about the budget and the allocation towards the police department.  I do not come with statistics today,  but I do come with a personal story with  my interaction with the cops in Chico.  I was walking into work one day during  the pandemic, and I had an unfortunate interaction  with a homeless man.  I proceeded to walk into work and go  about my day.  I did inform the people that I worked with what happened,  and my boss called the cops without my consent.  I had to interact with them,  and they told me that I needed to get in the car  to do a drive-by thing to identify this homeless man.  Long story short, I'm in the cop car,  and four police officers are holding down a man.  They hold him up, all four of them,  and there are four police cars.  I don't think that they are underfunded right now  if they have the time for four policemen to come  and hold down a man, a single man.  And...  I...  I...  I don't feel safer in that situation.  He didn't deserve to go through that, and I also.  It was frankly really traumatizing, and I've never cried that hard in my entire life after that situation.  The homeless are a part of our community.  I was raised as a Christian.  I firmly believe that.  And they do not deserve to be harassed by the police, and that's not the only example that I've seen of that.  So I would please, I beg you guys.  I understand that I fully support the firefighter that came up and said they need more funding.  I fully support the trees management.  That would be awesome.  And also.  I commute on my bike, and there's a lot of potholes, and I would really like the money to be allocated towards that instead of the police.  So thank you for listening to that.  It's not the easiest story to tell.  So thanks.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Cynthia Perrine.  Thank you.  I wanted to talk in support of funding Engine One.  I bought a house in 1996 down on 12th Street.  And part of the reason I chose that particular house to purchase is because of its proximity to the fire station.  In 2009, my home burned down.  And in what I understand from the firefighters who were there, there were two things that contributed to it being largely, it did burn on the inside, but the structure remained.  So it reduced the cost, and nobody was injured because of their very fast response.  But I'm really concerned because the houses in the area are very close together.  And if they had been burned, they would have been able to get out.  And if they had not responded so quickly, it was really a great possibility that two additional neighbors would have had their homes touched fire.  So I understand.  I'm a nonprofit executive director.  I understand competing priorities and limited budgets.  But I really urge you to find a way to creatively fund that Engine Number One.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  That's it.  All right.  Further questions or comment from counsel?  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yeah.  So to people who have made comments about the level of police staffing in Chico, I would argue that we don't have enough police funding.  This is not a wealthy area.  And a large portion of our general fund budget goes to police.  But if we had the same level of staffing that the average city in California our size has, and that number is 1.6 police officers per day, that would be a lot of money.  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively the level of the average town our size we would have a hundred and seventy sworn police officers so the idea that we have too many police officers completely wrong and another data point I'd like to put out is a couple of years ago we had 12 people die in traffic accidents that included pedestrians and bicyclists and we didn't have a full-time traffic officer and in the city and now we have  the city and now we have four  and a half and we'  re putting in  a red light camera system which  will make the streets safer for  everybody. We have a different  point of view on this but our  problem is not too many police  officers is not enough but it'  all we can afford.  council member holly.  I understand the previous  council did approve the  additional cso positions for a  reason those were needs that  required by pd I just need to  advocate for staffing engine  one in exchange for however many  cso positions that would require  I understand there are a couple  of trainees currently that are  training to fill those seven  open positions and I was  curious if maybe the  district is still in training  I was going to say chief  aldridge but I was like wait.  I'  m captain  penya.  I'  m curious if those four  trainees are still in training  excelling and looking towards  filling those seven positions?  we do have currently I believe  three in the program that are  still training.  okay three?  our current vacancies are four  we are in a current active  recruitment so we are looking to  fill those positions. Those are  absent the three positions that  we had requested for the red  light camera project so these  were community service officers  that are going to go out to  patrol and do also our general  transports.  So this is an existing need that  we had to try to mitigate some  of the impact that council  member van overbrek mentioned  which is we don'  t have the patrol  staffing or the specialty  assignment staffing so it is a  way that we are able to mitigate  some of that lack of service or  gap of service with non-sworn  or less expensive personnel.  okay thank you I think that was  important information for everyone  in this room to hear. I think it would be  vacant positions that we currently  have people that are training to  pursue. I wouldn' t want anyone in  the city to be at risk of losing a  position that they are training towards.  With that being said I also think  previous council while making these  decisions did not equitably  consider the risks and the needs  that our fire department has.  That'  s the angle I'  m coming at.  I would like to hear from other  opportunity to have a  training pursuing.  I may jump in if I may  mayor. I will not support that  council member holly. I will  support funding some fire  fighters but not by cutting the  police department as council  member van overbrek  particularly expressed they are  not overstaffed. They are  understaffed and this is what we  can afford. I'  m not going to cut or  cut them. I will  fighters but not by cutting the  police department as council member  van overbrek. I will support  funding option 2. I'  m not going to  make a motion quite yet. I know  we'  re still discussing. With an  idea of looking at funding the  rest of that in November but at  least getting them started towards  that. I think we owe that to our  fire department. The reality is  fire danger fire risk has changed. Whether we want to admit it or not it'  s different. I'  impact. In my 35 years of law  enforcement experience I'  ve never seen it more dangerous  right now to include in the city  of chico relative to fire danger. The way the fire model works and the only  way it works in California is we  have a mutual aid system. If we  have a large fire here we draw  firefighters from outside the  area. If there'  s a fire in another  area like l.A. We send  firefighters to them that'  s how that  works that'  s how we put these fires out  this is how we save people'  s lives that'  s the model. We have to build  capacity the fire department has  to have capacity to do all those  things to keep us safe. And no I  don'  t like cutting road  projects roads are extremely  important our staff does a  lot of work to keep us safe  communities safe. We have to  fire. We have to keep our  communities safe from fire. If  we'  re not keeping our  communities safe from fire  we'  re failing at our jobs as  council members. I'  m sorry they need  capacity. Capacity means safety.  did you have a how would  you propose that we fund it?  I propose that we go ahead  and move option two to the  front for the three new  that we need to be paid for by  cutting whatever that amount is  from some of our road projects  not from the police department  and then revisit that in  November as our very wise city  managers said to look at our  budget what that looks like at  that time to see if we can add  the other three to make that  I think we have to start  somewhere. I propose starting  with three option two that chief  standridge provided us.  Option two is?  Three new fire fighter  fte' s and promotions.  Council member van over  rick.  Council member o'brien so  it'  s maybe a semantic  distinction but instead of  cutting the road budget can we  think about sliding the road  projects out?  that'  s a much nicer way to put  it so yes we can call it what  we will but we can move that out  a little bit that'  s fine.  just implement them at a  slower pace than we had planned.  absolutely we'  re not going to remove  projects and thank you for  pointing that out. It'  s just not going to  necessarily move at least some  projects as quickly as others  we'  re still going to pay a lot  of roads.  thank you for that.  council member holly.  I'  d like to quickly identify  the ten-year plan I'  d like everyone in this  room to also remember this  includes repaving third street  and south campus one of the  rockiest roads I'  ve ever been over in my  entire life this includes  20th street this includes the  avenues and many more I'  m just thinking my  district because.  I can'  t imagine going to the people  who I talked to running for  office and telling them we  decided to put it off  essentially indefinitely I know  you can say it'  s like well eventually  we'  ll get to it  push it down the line but we'  re not going to be funding  design for repaving these  neighborhoods that are on the  list if we don'  t have money for  cutting the money right now  we'  re going to cut it more in  the future because we can'  t budget for something right  now I think in six months maybe  something is going to turn  around we'  re going to suddenly have  more money. If we hire these  people we'  re setting ourselves up to pay  for these people if we don'  t identify now how we'  re going to fund that then  we'  re going to be in a tough  spot down the road.  I'  m just going to throw out  there since my membership we  have had at least three  instances that I know of for  sure where we have had every  fire apparatus in the city  designated and we'  ve had I think there  was a lady that had a heart  attack and we had to call in  resources from somewhere else  because these gentlemen are the  first responders that go when  that happens so that could be  somebody'  s mother daughter sister  sister or something like that  and we have had a lot of  people that have been in here  for a long time and I don'  t want to be here for the  time when that happens however  we made a promise to our  voters of what we were going to  do with our roads and we'  re doing more with our roads  than we have done in a long  long time. I'  m not sure I'  m a little bit worried  about with only doing the  three we aren'  t I don'  t know if we'  re actually getting that  apparatus going and is that  going to get us where we need  to go and then what are we  looking like on the roads and we  aren'  t know what we'  m not going to know until  October or November what we end  up with sales tax revenue so I'  m not saying I have the answer  I'  m just saying it is a huge  decision and we shouldn'  t remember when we had  mandatory overtime on all of our  dispatchers because we were  almost to a point where we were  going to have nobody to answer  phones for dispatchers and we  had to take care of that and it  was a major emergency. But I  think we'  re getting very very close with  a town of 110,000 people we  have a lot of people that are  going to have a lot of people  that are going to be in the same  fire department. We have 60  firefighters and we'  re supposed to have 110 so  we'  re in almost the same  position with fire as we are  with police. Councilmember  goldstein.  councilmember goldstein.  as I said last meeting as  much as I believe we need to  staff engine one and it'  s the fire station down the  road from my house I will  absolutely not support cutting  road projects further. We  already this year are  allocating way less measure h  funds to our capital improvement  plan to our road projects that  are going to be cut down and  we had in the previous year of  course it fluctuates but we  already are having to cut the  20th street section in the  chapman town area between park  ave and the freeway and who  knows what could be cut in the  future if we don'  t prioritize funding  our roadway projects. I am  hoping that if we'  re strategic and we'  re careful about what  we'  re spending our city funds  on then when we look at the  budget again as mentioned this  fall or next budget season we  will be able to do that. I  would not support cutting road  projects or cutting tree  maintenance or other things that  also ensure our safety in this  community. I think that we  obviously can'  t get  everything we want in the  budget every time but in the  future we really need to make  sure that every meeting we'  re being proactive to  making sure we can fund our most  essential services especially  fire and fire  maintenance and that we'  re being aware that we  might have continuing to falter  or dropping revenue in the  future. We need to be a little  bit strict about what we'  re spending our money  on or investing on for years to  come. Again we'  re already cutting road  projects I don'  t think it'  s the solution to cut  them further and I also don'  t think that just pushing them  further down in the schedule is  any different than cutting them  if we were to cut them  further down in the schedule.  I don'  t think that would be  palatable either. Let'  s try to fund this in the  future.  vice mayor bennett and  council member van overbeck.  is your name van overbeck?  did you mean dale?  I said vice mayor bennett.  I'  m sorry.  council member van overbeck  next.  city manager sorensen.  quick question for you. I  think you already answered this  when we chatted. The community  benefit fund has a  s already been rolled into  the general fund.  yes.  so it isn'  t sitting off by itself  anymore.  no. it'  s in other taxes.  thank you.  now mr. van overbeck.  I think it'  s pretty amusing that the  progressive members of the  council are complaining about  road projects. Now before 2020  I'  d want to say which place  we'  the political orientation of  people that ran the council.  now we'  re spending something like  six or eight times as much  money on roads as was spent by  those councils. now we'  re saying instead of  spending I don'  t know. brennan is it eight  times or seven times as much  money on roads as we did in  18-19?  we'  ve had a lot of grant funds  come to fruition.  I'  m looking for the total  number we'  re spending.  in the three-year period of  time it'  s been about $100 million.  if you go back to 2020 over  that comparable period of time  the number was probably $15  million.  do you have something to propose  here?  are you proposing that we fund  something somehow?  be patient.  what I'  m saying is we'  re spending now six or seven  times as much as I know you'  re not good at that but that'  s right.  six or seven times as much on  roads as we did on the  previous progressive regimes and  now we'  re proposing to maybe make  it six times instead of seven  or eight times.  just to keep that all in  perspective.  are we really?  actually I had something to  say that was next in the queue.  council member oberlin.  thank you.  I'  ll get you next.  the bottom line for me is I'  m not going to lose sleep if we  delay some road projects.  not going to lose sleep.  I care about that but I'  m not going to lose sleep.  if we lose a neighborhood because  our fire department is  our fire department is not  if we lose a neighborhood because  our fire department is not  adequately staffed.  I will lose sleep over that.  that'  s why I'  m supporting what  I'  m ready to make a motion on.  if there'  s no further comments.  public?  no?  we can still discuss  after you make a motion.  all right.  so I will make a motion.  to support option number two as  presented by chief standards  which is three new firefighter  efforts.  the FTEs and promotions.  that money will come from  measure h road projects delay  those projects with a comeback  in november or october or  whatever.  and look at if we can hire the  additional three to make that  six which would fill out option  one.  I'  d love to make a  subsequent motion after  councilor goldstein.  no.  I yield the floor to you.  thank you.  I'  m sorry.  we don'  t have a second yet.  I'  m on a second.  okay.  so we have a motion and a  second.  can you?  okay.  I'  ll make a substitute motion  on that.  before.  we have one more meeting before  we have to have the budget done.  so we have one more opportunity  to have analysis and direct and  have more thorough analysis  rather than just saying let'  s just take all the money out  of the budget.  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively I don't even know that our engineering staff would know what the consequences of that would be right now so I've requested that the police department return with the proposal at the next  effectively [inaudible]  Was that you?  I'm sorry.  That was, okay.  Council Member Hawley.  Okay, so that was a motion to direct the Police Department to cut return with 70% of the funds with cuts.  Yeah, proposed cuts to me.  Proposed cuts.  I don't want to say sworn officers or whatever this or that.  You should decide.  With proposed cuts and the council will figure out the other 30%.  Is that correct?  And that's a substitute motion.  So we'll take that first.  Council Member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council Member Hawley.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  No.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  No.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  No.  Mayor Reynolds.  No.  It fails 3-4.  And then that would go back to the original motion, which was to, that was made by Council Member O'Brien, seconded by Council Member Van Overbeck,  to adopt the budget as amended to move.  So we're going to move for option two for the three new FTEs, cutting that amount, including promotions, cutting that amount from the road projects, and then to possibly review it and add the additional three staffing in November.  And if I may make a slight adjustment, as Council Member Van Overbeck said, it would be delaying the road projects, not cutting.  And I do have that in there.  I just didn't read it.  Thank you.  Can I ask for a friendly moment on that?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  We see what that looks like at the next meeting, and then we would have our final budget approval at the following meeting.  We have a motion and a second on the floor.  And I'm not going to accept that friendly amendment.  I'm not accepting that.  Thank you.  So the friendly amendment was not accepted.  Okay.  So Council Member Goldstein.  No.  Council Member Hawley.  That money has increased substantially for a reason.  No.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Carries 4-3.  All right.  5.2.  Confirmation of Deputy Director Human Resources Risk Management.  Ms. Barbara Martin, Administrative Services Director.  Thank you, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and members of council.  Before you tonight is the contract for our hopeful candidate.  I want to thank you for the deputy director of human resources risk management.  Back in January, we lost our director of human resources risk management and you all approved  a reorganization of the department and established this new position.  We went through quite a lengthy search and are very happy to have found Ms. Tiana Gray.  She comes with over 10 years of experience at Butte County and then additional a couple  years in government as well.  So she has quite a bit of experience.  We think that she is going to be a great fit and a great addition to the team.  So with that, I will take any questions.  All right.  Do we have any questions?  Council Member Winslow.  She is not here, is she?  I was kind of looking around and looking with your staff and not seeing anybody new.  So it' s not.  No, she' s not here.  Okay.  All right.  Do we have any speakers?  We have none.  Okay.  I' m ready for a motion.  I am.  Move to approve.  Second.  Second. Member ran over back in Holly. Okay and that includes that the city managers proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Tiana Gray as the deputy director human resources and risk management with an annual  Second.  confirmation that state law that you have to read that. Council Member Goldstein. Aye. Council  Member Hawley. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member  Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Carrie 7-0. All right we're  going to hop over to 5.5 which is the growth and community development ad hoc committee report  and I will then send it to either Council Member Van Overbeck or Winslow. Mayor I have a request  this this one we're going to try to make it as tight as possible short as possible but it's  still going to take 45 minutes or an hour can we take a short break? I are you guys good with that?  Okay I'll take a short break.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right. Council Member Van Overbeck and Winslow take it away.  Okay. So I'd like to lead off.  This we've been at this for 10 months I believe. And our mission basically was to see if the general  plan Chico's general plan was adequate to guide our growth as a community. And if it wasn't  to suggest some some way to effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  to make it better yeah and the main question is the Chico's forecast  forecasted to grow 1% annually it's perfectly reasonable for people to say  we don't want the town to grow because we like it the way it is and we want all  the open space around town to be a park and some communities have made that  decision and there are consequences to that but what what our committee agreed  to do said we it was important for us to accommodate 1% growth annually with  that means is in the next 20 years we need 20,000 additional housing units and  the big question is where they're gonna go okay yeah we didn't have this  rehearsed but yeah so councilman over and over and I were chosen to be  co-chairs of this we each selected some people for the committee we agreed upon  having a planner professional planner present too yeah ignore the number we  each chose two people and then there was a professional planner and this there's  been a ton of people who have taken part in this I will say  but I think it's important to make sure that we're not just talking about the  developers just like advocates from throughout the community we had people  whether they're giving presentations or just taking part in public comment this  was an effort that involves a whole lot of people at one time another we did our  best to try to make sure that there was public involvement even though it wasn't  a Brown Act committee and I mean yeah thanks to everybody who so yeah I got a  couple comments about the committee I want to thank my co-chair mr. Winslow we  are the demographic and I use ideological bookends on the City Council  and  we have been able to reach agreement on most things but he has been great to  work with Mark Wolf was a City Community Development director and had decades of  experience in planning Jim Stevens was involved North Star engineering civil  engineer for decades Eric Nielsen who's here Eric put your hand up Eric's our climate warrior and kept us safe and sound  our feet to the fire around making sure we didn't burn the planet down and I'm  and by Kirk Kaufman you know the smart growth people have a lot of ideals and  and lives that lives them she rides her bike everywhere there we go rides her  bike everywhere lives in cohousing and had a lot of great input thank you I  want to thank everybody because everybody worked really hard on this so  the presenters we had the expert we had the experts  efforts on affordable housing  and mayor and land use and  Dan Gonzalez who has probably  done the most significant  infill project in Chico for a  while.  Pam Figge was also on the  committee.  Land use planner professor at  Chico state and Brandon Slater  from construction.  He had a lot of very valuable  specific suggestions which we  incorporated.  One of the leading, probably the  leading commercial real estate  people, Kerry Welch.  We really had experts in every  field related to planning and  development.  We also both did presentations  that both of us suggested  presentations.  We both received criticism from  people for giving in too much to  each other in terms of what  we thought was important.  We had to incorporate everything  we thought was germane to these  major points we have.  All of my friends told me  you had completely abused me and  taken advantage of an old man.  I wouldn't say anybody said  anything like that to me but I  did receive criticism for being  strong armed by council member  Van Overbeek and all this.  I think we ended up in the  right spot.  Instead of having a bunch of  people say, I'm going to do this  that you all have, that three  page report, and we bolded the  important points so we can get  through this quickly.  Let me get going here.  The number one, I'm sorry, when  we got the information from the  presenters, that information  became findings.  This was the information that we  The second one is the 2030  general plan goals vision are  adequate to divide development  decisions in chico at least for  the immediate future.  That assumes we actually conform  to the general plan and use it.  I'm going to interrupt you  for one second.  Make sure you get as close as you  can to the microphone.  We have lots of people at home  listening that are riveted and  want to know all about this.  I'm sure.  You want to do?  Tom did make this powerpoint.  I'm following along with what he  pulled out of here.  Climate smart planning is a core  consideration.  This was a finding of disagreement  initially and we ended up working  this in.  Climate smart planning is embedded  in chico's identity, goals and  policies and general plan.  This is part of it.  The housing mix is a historic  look at what has held pretty much  stable for a long time.  It's about 40% multifamily, 60%  single family.  That's what our housing makeup is  currently.  This was an area of disagreement.  Some of our more the smart growth  people believe it's going to shift  in the direction of multifamily.  The majority of us don't believe  that people move to chico to have  an urban life.  They live in chico because they  have a yard and a dog and a garage.  Even though we need to plan for the  next 20 years, as market demand  shifts, the building types shift.  Increasing the supply of housing  of all types is essential for the  economic well-being of the community  as called for in the 2030 general plan.  I'm sorry we're going to lose you.  .  We're going to have to do this  That means we not only need more  affordable housing, but we need more  housing for doctors and executives for  businesses.  We need more housing of all types.  Housing in chico is very  expensive.  That's one of the primary driving  forces of us trying to support this  ongoing policy reform in favor of  building more housing, which the city  has been doing for some years now.  .  Housing means subsidized housing.  So under the, because of building  costs in California, you can't build  affordable housing that's market rate.  So without subsidies, it just can't  happen.  The main factor in chico's higher  prices is compared to neighboring  communities is the cost of land,  which is due to high demand and a  constriction in the supply of  developable land.  So what that means is there are more  people trying to buy houses than we  have supply.  So Mr. Slater, who really helped us  with this committee, did an interesting  I'm not going to steal his thunder  because he's going to talk about this  later, but he built three almost  identical houses in paradise,  Oroville, and chico.  The one that he could sell for $295,000  in Oroville, it had to be $437,000  in chico, and almost all of the  difference was in the price of land,  which was roughly $130,000 in  house that costs $300,000 more  because it's more expensive because  there isn't enough of it.  This is probably one of the most  controversial points in here.  We all agree that infill is preferable  in a lot of ways.  It utilizes existing infrastructure  so it improves the value of the city  as it is, doesn't extend us out into  areas that are sensitive for all kinds  of people.  I think the majority of us, and this  is one, there was an asterisk  for one disagreement on it, that  infill land is not really enough.  The way I see it is if you try to  limit growth all around the city and  just build into infill, you might  have higher land values and that  will encourage people to build more  on that less land.  But if people just can't pay enough  money to pay the rents to build those  higher price apartments, then you  just end up with higher land values and less housing, and so a higher cost burden on everybody.  We need to find a balance somewhere.  We landed on what we currently have  as a sphere of influence is that balance right now.  A lot of people don't understand is that  just because you have a blank piece of  ground within the city limits,  it doesn't mean you can build a project  that's financially viable, meaning  the developer can get their money back  in a profit and that it's a project  that somebody wants to buy or rent.  So it's the economic threshold  that's really held us back.  For situating yourselves where you might  be in this, I think it's worth noting  that the controversy in this was both  people who I think you'll hear from  saying that we should be looking at expanding  a sphere of influence, we should look at crossing  the green line, look at new opportunities for  new areas, and then other people who thought that we should be restricting  our sphere of influence and in trying  to focus even more just on infill and redevelopment.  I feel like just reading this,  I'm like,  did I write this one?  Yeah, so this is, yeah, what's our strategy, right?  I think this goes along with like affordable  housing, capital A, is subsidized.  That's how it gets to be that cheap for people,  normal people around to be able to afford it at the  rates that we have said is affordable  since like 1980, 30% of your income.  What we can do to try to address  that is we try to make it less expensive  and easier for developers to build housing, and that's  through our regulations. We set in place  a lot of these things that make it difficult  and costly in a lot of ways. We put restrictions  on every piece of land throughout  the city, some more than others.  The vast majority of land in the city  is zoned low density residential.  That's the yellow on your zoning map.  And it's very restrictive. And the primary thing  we can do is try to encourage some housing  opportunities within what land we have.  So I think a lot of people thought  there might be some silver bullet here  that would magically enable us to sell houses  for $250,000.  Again, there's not.  This stuff is nibbling around the edges.  The big issue is land cost.  That is why housing is so expensive  in Chico.  Compared to neighboring communities.  And the city doesn't really have the money right now,  if you recall, to subsidize housing  to make it affordable for everybody.  No.  Chico must plan to accommodate.  So whatever our projected growth is,  .8 in some places, it changes.  We had a pretty heavy growth here  it looks like this last year.  But the goal is that we plan to accommodate that.  There's no intention to try to close Chico off  to people who are going to move here.  These population estimates are based on  a number of things.  We want to make sure that people  who are coming here for these reasons  are accommodated with the housing that we have.  Okay.  There were some, those were findings.  We hit the high points.  There were some disagreements.  One of them is that lawsuits and activism  and unreasonable environmental rules  increase the cost of housing to consumers.  I don't know if people saw the Dan Walters article  or something like that.  I think it was in the  column in the Friday's ER  that it cost something like  four times as much money  to build an affordable housing unit  in California as in Texas.  So there are,  this did not make it onto the list.  There were three people who supported this.  But it was viewed to be  a little too inflammatory.  What we landed on is  we included a lot of  these two statements,  except there was two parts of them.  You can tell that Council Member  went over to the powerpoint  because it only has his side on here.  I can't remember what the flip side was.  So kind of the counterpoint to that one  isn't to say like no,  like yeah, if there's lawsuits  and stuff holds up housing projects,  that does drive up costs.  I don't think that's really in question.  But Chico has a long history of  grassroots environmental movements.  You could go all the way back to the 19th century  that it was well protected  and that has enhanced the quality of life for people.  And so we said, the others of us said,  grassroots environmental movements  have made Chico a better place.  Do you realize you made Rob Berry laugh?  That's not the first time.  No, he did. He made you laugh.  That's a first, okay.  That's not the first time.  Yeah, that's what I thought, yeah.  There were some people on the committee  and there were a number of us that didn't think,  if you want to live in a high density  apartment development,  that's great,  but if you want a single family house  for your kids and a dog to play in the backyard,  that should be fine too.  We believe in housing choice.  Yeah, I always thought this one was ironic to put it  as like, oh, the smart growth people  want everybody to live in these tall apartments  when the zoning says that you have to live  in a single family house in like the vast majority  of the city.  So it's quite the opposite to say that we're encouraging  a mixture of housing types,  that doesn't require people to live in these things,  but gives people the opportunity to develop  on their piece of land something that's going to  house more people on that land.  And yeah, I think the line that we had on this  was, you know,  for considerations for our city finances in the long run  and adequate provision of services and infrastructure,  the city should seek as a goal to shift to a somewhat  of a higher density pattern in order to meet  that we're trying to make ends meet,  because it is not cost efficient to have just one  person living on a cul-de-sac,  nor is it eight when you could have 24.  So recommendations.  We're going to go through these quickly,  because I think we have a lot of speakers.  One is to relax, or it says reduce or remove,  relax off street parking requirements.  I'm thinking of the dope store over on Park Avenue  required to have the parking lot across the street.  I've never seen it more than a third full.  Not even that.  I think we need to have some requirements,  but at some point leave it to the marketplace to decide.  Big emphasis on select areas of the city,  because that's what we landed on.  It's not everywhere is appropriate for that.  Also, we'll mention when you reduce off street parking  requirements, that does not prevent developers  from providing parking whenever they see that that's a need.  And developers tend to do that.  That's what we find.  But we want to be able to enable some opportunities  for a different kind of development pattern  that's going to be much more beneficial to the city  in these core areas.  Thank you.  So increase the level density to R1 and R2.  There's a bunch of stuff in here.  The big ones are  amend the city's beauty code  to allow ADUs to be sold separately  from the main house, and that's called out  in AB 1033.  Also, implement greater tiering  for impact fees for residential development.  Right now, if you want to build a  three-bedroom, two-bath house,  the fees are $43,000.  And that's before  the suggested increase  in the transportation  and stormwater  increases that are proposed.  For a smaller house,  Brendan helped me with this,  so if it's two bedrooms  and one bath,  Mr. Arbani,  so it drops at 30%  if it's two bedrooms and one bath  or two bedrooms and two baths.  Yeah, I don't recall,  but we have an existing tiered structure  where there's reductions and increases based on  bedroom-bathroom combinations.  So it drops to $30,000 instead of $43,000, but what we're suggesting  is to look at the tiering and see if we can't,  because that becomes a disproportionately  large part of the cost  of a lower, medium-priced home.  As with a lot of these things,  the city's been kind of shifting in this regard  gradually over time, and a lot of this  is just saying we should turn up the dial on this.  We have some tiering of fees, but we think  we should do some more tiering of fees, because we're not  getting the same, the kind of results out of  the housing that we want to. I want to add  on one that you skipped, because I think this is actually  one of the most important things on here.  So we were looking at ways to  make housing more affordable.  I mentioned the majority of residential land  in the city, the vast majority, is low-density residential.  That's just become a pattern that we have  high density across an alley from low density,  like all over the place.  So there's no missing middle, very little R2  except in certain areas.  And we're looking at how do we open up opportunities  for there to be some more housing there?  The state has allowed for ADUs, so this is taking off  in a certain respect.  And the simplest way would be to just say,  well, it's R1, let's just make it R2.  If it's R2, we can just make it R3, and just up-zone it like that.  There can be significant drawbacks.  People don't want to see some different character  of development.  That would be unnerving to a lot of people,  and it could lead to a kind of rapid change,  even if it is just kind of a bump up in a neighborhood.  So we're looking at more creative ways to do this.  And this actually was an idea from a city planner  in talking about these different ways  that we can up-zone neighborhoods.  We have traditional neighborhood development zoning.  This is Merion Park.  This is a form-based code.  We'll talk about that more later, maybe.  In Merion Park, that they're building out on,  the character of the place,  without saying that this is a max number of units,  and this must be residential,  this must be commercial.  Within that, they have building types,  things like a cottage court,  which is around a shared walkway, you have housing,  as opposed to everybody having their own street frontage.  And these things are allowed in different areas  within the neighborhood,  in line with what kind of intensity is expected.  So an idea that he had was,  we already have these forms in our code,  so we could just import this piece  of traditional neighborhood development code  into the other codes,  and then just allow these sort of building types.  So it wouldn't say that you can build an apartment  that looks any way.  So you can't just have one of these big apartments  with a big parking lot in front.  But you could have something like a cottage court,  which I think most people recognize is really cute  and is welcome in our neighborhoods.  And there are other sorts of things like that.  So is that like Melrose Place?  Sorry?  Melrose Place?  Miller's Place?  Melrose Place.  Never mind.  There's one over in Park Forest.  Sorry, different generation.  Yeah, there's one in  Dome Hill.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Let's see.  For the general plan to support  development of land in special planning areas  in order to support projected population growth.  This is a big problem.  We have five SPAs,  five SBAs.  The only one that  they've existed for 14 years.  These were identified as areas for future growth.  The only one that has been built on  is Merion Park.  And for a variety of reasons,  development has been stalled  or stopped  or referendum out in those other areas.  So as a result,  we only built, I think,  116 single family homes last year.  And the demand is for more like this.  We're under producing them.  Yes, and that recommendation in particular  is to look at like the infrastructure requirements  that are a barrier to those,  in particular the North Chico special planning areas.  We could get way in depth into all these things.  It was very informed by  Mr. Audubon coming in and talking about impact fees  and us looking for ways to try to increase  the feasibility of development in these areas.  Palona Avenue  opportunity site,  which is on the southwest side of town,  is a site that was  in a previous council.  None of us were around for that.  They removed it.  There was opposition from development there  from a shelling plant, which later just shut down.  And that area could use a lot of help.  We're going to be replacing the bridge.  I hope we're still replacing the bridge there.  TBD.  But this was included in the general plan EIR,  meaning that we projected that we'd have growth there.  And because whenever an idea came forth  for apartments,  then there was a bunch of opposition to it. It was removed.  So this is an easy one to reinsert.  It's an area that has been deemed appropriate for development.  We have environmental review done.  And we see it as simpler to reinsert.  And there could be a good project there.  Support high density redevelopment  in walkable neighborhoods along  transit corridors of Park Avenue.  We're going to hear from Ms. Goldstein  about that. I think that's a great idea.  Again, these  concepts have been in place for a long time.  And the reason they haven't happened is because  the  threshold for financial  reliability hasn't been met.  They're not, they don't,  it's not financially viable for a developer to build them out.  As far as  expanding the corridor opportunity sites,  these are the areas you can build the highest density towns.  So downtown, Park Avenue.  And it's actually going to,  we plan to have it in the next round of  residential readiness code updates.  I believe maybe in the fall or something is projected  that we're actually already going to look at this  because that was a recommendation in our housing element.  However, it's so important we decided to say it again.  So I want to make a comment.  I want to close by  complimenting  Director Veague and his staff.  We went to, you were out of town,  we went to sit down with Mike and  we came with, I don't know, 17 or  18 recommendations and he said,  oh, we're already doing that. That's in the works.  I mean, you guys are,  you guys have seen the same thing the committee  saw and you're headed in that direction.  And that was very reassuring.  So what we'd like to do is to refer  this to staff  for implementation.  And that's the end of my comments.  Yeah, yeah. Which is to say that,  and this was actually Mark Wolf, so former  Community Development Director, really insisted that  we come with this report with all these things,  the expectation that we say, yes,  go ahead and do all those and no further  action required, but  it's that we've kind of brought these menu of  things that we want to get your confirmation  that the city should be doing  and we're going to have a further  discussion with more analysis.  We did this on our, what you could call  volunteer time.  So no consultants were hired in the process  of these  recommendations.  So the next step is to have some more  thorough analysis. And you'll notice if you go into  those recommendations, there are some open questions  as far as what are select areas to eliminate  park requirements, for example, that  we want to have feedback from staff and then  make the more firm decision at a later date.  Thank you.  Alright, thank you.  I think we have several speakers, so if you guys are  Do you want us back up there?  Yes.  We can ask questions from here.  Yeah, we can ask questions up here.  For brevity of time, because I think we have  several speakers,  are we good holding comments  or questions up here until we hear from our  speakers? Okay.  Alright, how many speakers do we have?  We have 22.  22. Okay.  So technically I could go one minute, but I think  that would be not very nice. So we're going to  go two minutes each.  Okay. Yeah.  Alright, and I'll call the first two,  and if you can line up. As I call your name,  Brandon Slater, followed by David Welch.  Dang, I don't get any time to prepare here, huh?  Hi, I'm Brandon.  Tom mentioned it earlier.  But yeah, I just wanted to share with you guys  a little bit about my little experiment  that I'm doing. I'll correct Tom  slightly in that I'm not actually completed  with all those houses. I'm just finishing  up the first house in Paradise.  And the houses that I'm  building in Oroville and  Chico are taking substantially  longer to just get through the process.  Chico I had to  split a lot, so there's just a lot more  into that. So all of my,  I have actual costs on Paradise,  and then the other  two houses are estimates. But  basically what it,  what my experiment was  is to build the same house in three different  towns and then compare costs of  land, compare cost fees,  build costs, and then just  be able to share it with everybody. So  the numbers Tom was referring to  was the fact that  a complete turnkey lot,  which is frontage improvements,  bare empty lot with utilities to  it, kind of ready to build,  in Chico is $136,000  more than both Paradise  and Oroville were very,  very close.  My experiment will be  concluded when I sell each  one of those houses and then, you know,  compare,  look at all the costs and then look at the  sale price. I think everybody  knows that the market in Chico is  substantially higher. So anyways,  that's just an interesting little  tidbit, just wanted to share with you guys.  I also went and did a little research  myself. Oh dang, two minutes is going super fast.  So California has the highest  homeless population,  has the lowest dwellings per capita,  and they have the second highest  median house prices. So  look at the land cost,  So that's a reason for that. You guys  have to make your own. Newsom says we needed to build  3.5 million more houses in California,  or dwelling units. That didn't happen.  Way behind,  if you follow that to Chico,  that would mean we'd need 1,300.  No, I'm done.  Thank you.  David Welch followed by Rob Berry.  Yeah, thank you. I think there's an  interesting question here in terms of  ways that  it can be made easier  to do the kind of development that  we want to see. I think  some of that stuff is particularly  about the tiering of impact  fees makes a lot of sense.  I think to take that to an  extremes, I think we ought to look at  really minimizing impact fees  for homes  that are built on existing streets  that don't require a lot of new  construction, a lot of new infrastructure, and  maximizing impact fees for  homes that require a great deal  of new infrastructure to build them.  And that really shifts the  balance of cost.  I think it's also going to be important to remember  as we make these decisions, to remember  the will of the people  of Chico here.  The people of Chico had their opportunity  to express that  will on a very large,  what I would call grandiose development  last year, and  despite the proponents of the  referendum being outspent by about  10 to 1,  that was a  landslide against that very  large scale development.  I think that we do  need to be building housing, we need to be  building appropriate housing,  but I think that you're going to find  a lot of continued resistance  to very large scale developments.  On the other hand, you will  not see, for example,  this is not an opposition  to all growth, it's not an  opposition to all building,  you will not find  any of the people who  led the referendum campaign  against Valley's Edge acting in opposition  to the Barber Yard development  because it's a more appropriate type of  development, a more appropriate scale of  development in a more appropriate place.  And so I think that's  an important thing to keep in mind, is what  the people of Chico are willing to accept.  Thank you. Rob Berry,  followed by Patricia.  Doug Gillen is out of the country,  and asked me to read his speech,  so I'm going to try to fit this into two minutes here.  In Chico,  the 2030 General Plan developed  between 2009 and 2011 was a product  of years of effort, input from professionals,  environmental groups, business leaders,  and engaged citizens. It was  meant to serve as the constitution  for land use in Chico urban area  through 2030, as former  Planning Commissioner Panfigge often  noted before she resigned from the committee.  However, its implementation  was derailed in response  to an activist-led referendum targeting  traditional single-family zoning,  and an ad hoc committee was formed.  While the committee allowed  for presentations and public comment,  it failed to meaningfully  address a central issue,  the disappearance of traditional  3,500 square foot lots,  single-family lots,  along a symbol of the American Dream.  Since 2018,  about 3,500 lots  have been stripped from the  plan through lawfare and referendums,  driven by a NIMBY-style activism.  Does the report  acknowledge this loss?  Are there plans to replace  these 3,500 lots?  So far, no answers.  Instead, the focus shifted to infill  and smart growth, emphasizing  high-density housing, bike lanes,  and reduced parking.  While well-intentioned, this approach assumes  that such policies alone can meet  future housing demand, they can't,  not even close.  Here is the dirty little secret.  Limiting land for new traditional  single-family homes drives up prices,  basic supply and demand.  Activists fully understand this,  and  as Chico looks forward to the  2050 general plan update,  it must establish safeguards to prevent  future plans from being hijacked  by special interests. The stakes for  housing, affordability, and community  balance and traditional  community values  are too high to ignore.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Patricia Hieronymus.  Okay.  Adam Fideli, followed by Mark Lance.  Good evening, council.  Thanks for serving.  Thanks for being here tonight.  Major compliments to the  ad hoc committee.  We're right here. We're right there.  We're all kind of on the  same page, as much as we  can be ideologically,  politically, socially.  So, the next step is,  speaking in my  capacity as local government relations  committee chair for the  local association of realtors, is  keep on the creativity.  Keep on the flexibility.  When somebody comes forward with a  project, don't let the zoning  knock it off course.  Do what we can  in advance.  Brendan, I'm not trying to make your life any harder,  but do a little more,  call it  burst planning.  You know, say, okay, we have this little thing, we have an opportunity  to create some housing. Let's focus on that  real quick, see if it makes sense,  and do it.  And do what we can to facilitate those things.  Lots of land pieced around in the city  that's been pointed out many, many times,  but you can't do anything with it  either because of the zoning or some  complexity or some other issue.  So we need to eliminate  that kind of stuff.  Get that little hanging fruit.  You know, because that's where the  opportunities are within the urban core.  The state has made it a lot easier for us.  We're on  the verge of, you know, a major  infill project out in my neighborhood  in South Chico.  The Diamond Match Project.  So we need to keep our foot on the gas  and continue  this good momentum.  Because we've all swirled around, like  Mr. Van Overbeek said, for 10 months  we've swirled around together and we've got, you know what,  we're pretty much on the same page.  It's just like, how do we take that next step?  So,  leadership, welcome to  real estate. Let's get creative.  Let's go back and forth  and make things happen.  Thank you, Mark.  Mark Lance, followed by James Hutchinson.  Okay, Brian  Kress, followed by Elizabeth Devereaux.  Hey, everybody.  Thanks, y'all. I'm Brian. I'm the  Vice Chair of the Climate Action Commission.  Here to just underline  that every development decision  that we make today is a climate decision.  Whether we acknowledge it or not.  With each  increment of warming, the losses and damages  continue to grow.  Councilor O'Brien, your comments earlier about  how we've never seen fire risk like this before.  That risk will continue to  escalate. And this will be an  incremental problem where every action counts.  Every ton of  emissions down, our progress.  So what does this have to do with development?  There are two things. The first is  that our annual emissions are  460,000 tons of carbon pollution.  Over half of that is fuel  burned in cars.  It's the driving that is driving up  our emissions. And the Climate Action  Plan is designed to bring that pollution  down. We've already made significant  investments into the Climate Action Plan and  that work. And the growth that we do should continue  to build on those successes, not go backwards.  The second  is those policies that direct growth  towards where people already live,  work, shop, go to church. All those  directing growth in those places are  force multipliers for everything else we're  trying to accomplish in emissions reduction.  So you get lower emissions  for transportation, housing services, food,  goods, and future development  again should continue to build on that.  Because the truth is that urban form  is the closest thing that we have  to a master key to unlock  emissions  and emissions savings.  So as you consider the findings in front  of you, I'd encourage you also to  request that staff  and the Climate Action Commission  bring back a recommendation  on a threshold for new  vehicle miles traveled, or VNT,  which offers a direct way  to estimate transportation related  emissions to new development,  which should clear the way to ensure  all new development meets the goals  in our cap, in our general plan.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Elizabeth Devereaux, followed by  Julian Zenner.  Yeah, I  actually handed out  these pamphlets to the  Council, so maybe you could follow along.  with me.  As we plan for the future, and I'm talking  about the value of the land.  As we plan for the future of our  city, it can only be  challenging to quantify the  value of preserving open space.  These features may not appear in  traditional fiscal reports,  but their value, both ecological  and economic, is substantial.  Especially  landscapes that support  endangered species, slow  growing blue oaks and vernal pools,  and rare  meemamels.  Preserving open space is a  far better long-term investment  than urban sprawl.  Sprawl increases public costs  through extended infrastructure,  causes greater traffic congestion  and higher demand for utilities  and emergency services.  Creates carbon  emissions from vehicle dependence,  accelerating climate change.  Pushes development  to fire-prone wildland areas,  raising both risk and insurance costs.  By contrast,  conserved natural areas  reduce public expenditures.  They might mitigate flooding,  filter stormwater,  cool the urban heat island effect,  and lower the cost of public health  through cleaner air  and increased physical activity.  These natural spaces are not  just scenic backdrops,  they are vital habitats  for birds and wildlife.  And just a minute,  I've got a picture here  walking on this land  at sunset or in the evening  with our region's dark,  star-filled skies, unimpeded  by encroachment of housing developments  and artificial light.  These experiences and the ecological  systems that support them  are not just picturesque.  They are strategic assets  that distinguish our region  in an increasingly competitive landscape.  That's time, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Julian Zenner,  followed by Grace Marvin.  Good evening,  Councilors.  I'd like to address  two issues related to Chico housing.  Projected population growth  and housing affordability.  Over the past century,  California has experienced  an amazing growth  from 2 million in 1900  to over 2 million in 2020.  To 10 million in 1950.  Then more than tripling  by 2000 to 34 million.  However,  growth has dramatically  slowed since 2010.  Many demographers  compare California growth  to upper Midwestern  Rust Belt states.  From 2020  to 2023,  the population growth  has been  We lost more than 400,000  population,  predominantly young adults.  Prior estimates  had us at 45 million  in 2035.  And 55 million  20 years later.  Current estimates  have us  plateauing a little over  40 million over the next  20 to 30 years.  This is important  because the major dispute  between our development  community and smart growth  advocates  is  land availability  for our housing  with continued growth.  There's not enough  land for infill.  With smaller  land  growth,  or plateauing,  there is enough land.  That's time.  Thank you.  I didn't get to housing,  but most people  cannot afford  single houses,  three bedrooms.  That's time. Thank you.  So Grace Marvin,  followed by Jacqueline Chase.  I'm his wife.  I wish I could finish it up, but I can't.  I'm the conservation chair  for the Blue Oak Group locally.  And I'm a member of the Smart Growth  Associates and a retired sociology  professor from Chico State.  We urge your support  for developing better housing and services  for our homeless  and creating a beautiful downtown  all the way down  South Park Drive.  How? Focus on how we can  build more housing, businesses,  social services, tree-lined  walkways by building  up rather than out as an  urban sprawl.  That includes building housing, for example,  on top of existing  businesses.  Or building  higher apartments  and so forth downtown.  We do not need or want  that sprawl since it would result  in more traffic and air pollution  along with less  public access to land  and waterways that we need  to protect. So that all  This also means protecting  the green line while improving  the visuals of housing,  businesses, and parks downtown.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jacqueline Chase followed by  Gabrielle Broesch.  Good evening.  If this ad hoc committee was a warm-up  to the  I would like to  thank the committee for  The current safety element of the  general plan has 17 lines devoted  in its introduction to fire,  which is less than flooding, less  than geologic hazards.  Flooding alone has 57 lines  and two maps.  I feel like there was a missed opportunity here.  The ad hoc committee could have addressed  this, but it did not.  When did fire become so irrelevant  to where we put our houses?  The unpredictable and catastrophic  nature of wildfire  are signatures of climate changes  we just heard from Brian.  Chico has had near misses with fire  recently and everywhere  fire survivors have been  identified as our neighbors.  They live on our streets.  If our lives are so shaped by fire,  why do we have this omission  in this important ad hoc committee?  Since 2022,  CAL FIRE has identified areas  of high and very high hazards  from wildfire within our city limits  and has revised hazard maps  in the SRAs,  the state responsibility areas  around our borders.  Chico's own community wildfire  protection plan and veg management  plan go much farther than the general plan.  And so,  I feel like we already have  a lot of material,  but it just didn't come together  in this ad hoc committee.  Assurance from one fire official  for this ad hoc committee was enough  to set the issue aside.  So, a little disappointing.  You probably all received a letter  from Kathy Kutz recently  that kind of describes some of the tools  that are available, so I encourage you to look at those tools  for incorporating land use planning  that has fire in mind.  Thank you.  Thank you. Gabrielle Broesch,  followed by Ann Bykert-Kaufman.  I'll be meeting for people who are here.  Quite a few people couldn't be here today,  so that's why I'm meeting.  Can you put in the microphone?  Thank you.  Okay.  The agreement in the report is a positive step.  There's still some work to do  in the disagreements.  If the disagreements are out of  the report,  the work of identifying points of contention  will still be  need to be repeated in the future,  wasting valuable time.  It was, number two,  it was recognized that infill  is difficult and costly.  Both sides stated they liked infill  and the values of  compact urban form.  Since infill is inevitable,  why not build now,  for it will be more expensive in the future.  By saving our land,  protecting our nature-loving complexion  that makes Chico attractive.  Number three is really long  and I'm afraid I might not have time,  so I'm going to jump to four.  Four.  I appreciate the energy of the committee  invested in this report.  I believe more time,  thought, community input  needs to drive the final draft.  There isn't a rush  to come to conclusions  and decisions.  That 1% growth,  1% equity equals  500 houses or...  Democracy is the fullest  expression of us all.  Voting is the voice of the people.  Voting is citizen involvement.  This makes Chico  a better place to live.  We are in disagreement  of any suggestion  that referendums interfere  with the provision of housing  is unfair and misleading  to assume that the referendum  on growth is anti-growth  The voters were strong  responding to facts,  data, and arguments  and helped them make informed decisions.  Every district with one exception  voted decisively against these measures.  It was non-partisan,  non-NB,  rejection of sprawling subdivisions.  Like previously said,  it was a grassroots...  All right, that's time.  Thank you.  I'm getting that in there.  Followed by Derek Sanderson.  Hi.  Hi, Ann.  Thank you for the opportunity to be on this committee.  It was a lot of work, but it was a lot of fun.  So I just wanted to say I support  all of the recommendations  that the committee made.  I would like to speak specifically  to recommendation 2D,  which is to have greater  tiering of impact fees  for residential development.  So for several months this year,  we had a local developer  who was on the committee,  and we were working to determine  the feasibility of developing  a .7 acre lot on Humboldt Road,  an infill lot,  where it zoned R3,  it already had water and sewer,  and what we envisioned  was 16 two-bedroom apartments,  and we could not  get it to pencil out.  And one of the  reasons that it wouldn't  pencil out was the high  impact fees,  which were almost as high  as for a single family home  and greenfield development.  So impact fees should reflect  the actual impact  of a development city.  And so the current structure  does not do that.  Small units on small plots of land  pay more than their fair share.  Dense housing developments  generate much more tax revenue  per acre than the  low density developments.  And also the footage of streets  and sidewalks and lighting  and all that is much less  for the smaller units.  So they're paying more  than their fair share.  So greater tiering  would more accurately  reflect the impact,  and it would make it much more  feasible for developers  to actually build small units  on small plots of land  as infill, which Chico does.  So I think that's  of what we desperately need.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Derek Sanderson followed by  Eric Nielsen.  Greetings, Mayor, Vice Mayor,  Council, city staff.  I had the privilege of presenting  to the ad hoc committee with  my business partner, Brent  Silverbauer.  We presented some data on what was going on locally with real estate prices, inventory.  Campfire,  COVID,  mortgage interest rates, all that  fun stuff.  I'm a firm believer that  the best way to make decisions  is to do it based on data.  And at the core of who I am,  I believe that helping to educate,  equip, and empower whoever is in front of me.  I'd like to say that the data  I, myself and Brent,  presented,  that it got better  from last year, but it hasn't.  It's actually gotten worse.  So I'd like to just share  a few numbers with you.  So as of 2023,  Chico had just over 100,000  residents.  I'll come back to that.  As of 3 p.m. this afternoon,  there are only 139 single family  homes on the market in Chico.  The median list price is  $599,000.  35 of those,  139, are under $459,000.  And only 16  are under $400,000.  If we take the population  of Chico based on how many  single family homes we have,  we don't, if, obviously  everybody's not looking to buy, but if we take the  population, that's one house  for every 100,000  residents. That  is not enough inventory.  So 1,000.  1.3 homes  per 1,000 people, or almost  14 homes per 10,000.  In May,  this last year, 76 homes sold.  That's down 17%.  While the median sales price  has risen to over 500,000  and risen by 12%.  We don't have enough inventory.  Thank you.  Thank you. Eric Nelson, followed by Pamela Posey.  Good evening.  From the 2030 general plan overall  vision of Chico, it says,  quote, in the year 2030, Chico is a livable,  healthy, and sustainable community.  It is characterized by a vibrant downtown,  a healthy economy, compact urban  form, identifiable neighborhoods,  with diverse housing choices, and a  focus on alternative transportation.  With that in mind, I believe the committee  has provided some ideas that create  an environment for building diverse housing choices  by making infill and opportunity  sites more palatable for developers  so that we build housing that is attainable  and affordable for all Chico citizens.  As a smart growth advocate, I  participated with the assumption that the  focus would be on new ideas for livable  and community-oriented neighborhoods  located on opportunity and infill sites  with existing infrastructure to ensure  financial and environmental sustainability.  The message from the voters  with the defeat of the Valley's Edge development  was not to build yet another  car-dependent, sprawling development.  Early in the process,  it became clear that much of  the agenda was geared towards  arguments to relitigate Valley's Edge  after its defeat, a regrettable  direction that resulted in a loss of  time for a deeper dive into ideas for  development that would benefit our entire community.  Examples of smart growth exist  all over the country,  a great one of which is in our  own backyard, Merriam Park, a neighborhood  that provides a creative mix of housing  choices, calmer streets that support  walking and biking, and mixed-use  commercial residential. The world  is changing before our eyes.  We have endured two horrific fires,  both of which portend to pivot  from the suburban car-dependent sprawl  that started in the 50s to  wiser land-use development that bolsters  our resilience and adaptability,  and builds community and connection to  each other through a new vision for housing  and development. As we move to update  the general plan, I urge city leadership  to make decisions about housing  and development based on smart growth  principles. Doing that will help to  ensure a sustainable future,  environmentally and economically.  Thank you. Thank you.  Pamela Posey, followed by Chris Giampaoli.  Good evening.  Sprawl is out.  Infill density and cozy  community neighborhoods are in.  Eating up open space  and destroying habitats of other  living things is out.  Building where there is already  infrastructure and connectivity  is in. Building in the  wildland-urban interface is  out. Creating a buffer  against fire is in.  Building housing only for the  well-to-do is out.  Building housing for everyone  is in. Builders of  large subdivisions and city officials  have claimed that it is  impossible to meet the housing needs  in Chico with infill.  Smart growth advocates  believe this approach of building out  demonstrates the bias of a  previous generation, of a time  when land was cheap and plentiful  and the environment was not  under threat. Times have changed.  Circumstances have  changed. We  need a vision that reflects current needs.  Those who reject  infill for Chico's future development  need to try harder.  They need to look more carefully.  They need to think more creatively.  They need to change their way  of doing things. Consider  how can downtown  accommodate housing?  How can abandoned buildings, garages,  factories be torn down or  repurposed for living spaces?  How can smaller lots be  turned into green spaces with cottages?  How can commercial and  living spaces be shared?  Where can we tuck in duplexes  and triplexes?  How can we use modulars and prefabs  to make housing more affordable?  How can we change zoning to make  new ways of providing housing  possible? Instead of  saying no, people in the housing  business should be asking how.  Thank you.  Thank you. Chris Giampale  followed by Marty Dunlap.  Hello, Chris Giampale, Epic Homes  Builder here in Chico. Tom Van Overbeck  asked a question of the group when we  went to all the meetings and he asked how many people  lived in a single family home and everybody  raised their hand. Single family homes  is the reason people come to Chico.  That's what we've been building  for many years. We have special planning areas.  There's five of them. Brendan can contest.  Of what we've learned, three  of those five aren't going to be built  is what we're told. So that leaves you  with our yard, which will happen,  and 300 more units that's over  there along Bellmere. Is that  enough for the housing? We're not going to  increase our sphere of influence is what  this recommendation does, which I think is wrong.  You need to look at what the numbers are.  If you take those three out of there,  which is about three quarters of the  population of your special planning  areas for the general plan, you haven't  accommodated for any more housing. And for  some reason, you think your sphere of influence  doesn't need to be increased. We've got  160 houses a year  is what we did last year.  We've done it for the last four years on average.  We should have closer to  250 to 300 single family.  Multi-family has gone through the roof.  We had a bunch of affordable  housing that was provided by state funding.  But when that goes away, what is  the backup plan? What is the contingency  plan? We don't have a contingency  plan. We mentioned it 15  years ago to tell you you've got to have other  growth areas that you should be looking,  because if you don't get them all, which we didn't,  Valley's Edge got defeated,  where else are you going to grow?  Because exactly what happens to UC Davis  or Davis there, you can go find  a way out there for  450 or 500 bucks a square foot to go buy a house,  and your kids and my kids  and everybody's kids aren't going to be able to  home around here. Our recommendations  should be number related,  and they're not.  We flat out, how are you going to  come up with the numbers that we've lost,  and none of the recommendations that are  in here show anything like that.  Thank you.  Thank you. Marty Dunlap followed by Bill Broward.  So, how to move forward.  I support the ad hoc group's efforts  to develop recommendations that allow  for modifications to building  codes and zoning that create  greater ease with infill,  redevelopment, and up and down zoning.  It is perplexing,  however, that two documents of  great value focused on Chico  housing were not utilized by  the ad hoc group. The first of  these is the 2018  land absorption study  that focuses on the demand for  and supply of developable  land for Chico through  2035.  The second document not utilized  in depth is the Chico housing  element, which incorporates  data housing constructed,  data on housing constructed, available  building sites, income levels  of residents, and projected population  growth. The regional housing  needs allocation developed  by the state with use of this data  projects that only 450  housing units need to be constructed  annually to meet Chico's housing needs.  This allocation indicates a balance  of housing is needed each year  between one-third of affordable  housing, typically multi-family  units for rent, one-third of  market rate single-family detached  homes, and the last third, housing  that matches up with income levels  of those living in Chico who can  afford a mortgage, but not necessarily  a conventional house.  This group is the missing middle  whose incomes are above the median  of the average Chico household earnings,  yet due to the inflammatory cost of  housing makes purchasing a home  unattainable for them. In the report  under findings of disagreement, activism,  lawsuits, and unreasonable environmental laws  are listed as contributing to the  increase in the cost of housing.  For some reason, this was an area  focused rather than on the increase  in the cost of construction and  material costs. I hope  that council will consider holding  well-utilized public forums in the  future where interested citizens  can contribute and determine Chico's  future growth.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. Bill Broward followed by Austin Barron.  Good evening.  I want to offer sincere thanks to  committee members, to the professionals,  the objective professionals that  offered objectivity, reason, and knowledge.  They consistently, as LAFCO,  Butte County Housing Authority,  the housing authority,  the housing authority,  several that are listed in the report,  they consistently  underscored the importance of implementing  the general plan. Chico has  a very good, solid  plan for sustainable growth and  development. It is the Chico general plan.  These professionals,  objective professionals, consistently  underscored the importance of  implementing that plan. Whether your  interest is affordability,  economic stability, schools,  parks,  hiking, traffic, wildfire  preparedness, and  greenhouse gas for our  climate activists.  Implementing the general plan is how we  attain all of those values.  These professionals consistently  warned, professionals  consistently warned  that disabling  our general plan undermines these  very values.  To argue climate change is a  reason for opposing a special planning area  doesn't  make any sense if you're reading the documents.  I agree. Vehicle miles traveled,  big objective.  The best thing you can do is locate  your housing, where people  work and shop.  So, the best thing the city can do,  the report says the best thing the city can do  is adopt some findings.  I don't disagree with those findings.  The best thing the city can do,  which staff has told you numerous times  in their reports, implement the general plan.  I want to make one other change.  I've got 10 seconds.  One out of 10 housing units in this  market are new.  We sell about  1,000, 1,500 units,  about 100, 150  are new. The market determines price.  Thank you.  The market determines price.  Thank you.  Austin Baron followed by  Beth Sisk.  Good afternoon, council.  First, I want to thank everybody  who worked on that committee sincerely.  I do think this is the  closest we've ever been to an agreement  on both sides  of this argument of how  are we going to build, how are we going to house  our population.  I truly think that  the end statement, the last slide  you had up there, Tom, is the determining  factor here is that we need to  build to suit our population.  Knowing that  our population is currently  60% single family  residents and 40%  multifamily residents should be a  good indicator that we can  do both.  We can build these single family  home neighborhoods for the demand that  we have, that Derek was so nice enough  to bring statistics with him.  And we can build the multifamily,  the low income  affordable housing or just the market rate  multifamily  buildings to suit the  renter population.  I think what we've got to do really here is stop  getting in each other's way.  We see  multifamily projects come across and  we have the neighborhood folks  that live in the single family come and  want to shoot it down.  We see these large single family projects  and we see folks that  wanted to hire density come and shoot it down.  I believe in my heart  that we can all work together  on this to build  to suit our 20,000  people that we're expecting in the next  10 to 15 years.  I think we can do this guys.  We have some projects coming down the  pipeline. We have a great  well worded general plan  that through this committee we have  affirmed that it's correct.  It's a good document.  I think we just need to execute.  We need to stop getting in each other's  way.  I prepared a nice perfect speech for this  and I decided today to just speak from the heart.  So I hope you enjoyed that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Beth Sisk.  I'm not so professional as a lot of other  people that have spoken and have done  a lot of work on this subject.  As someone who's moved here  from the Bay Area  many years ago to go to school here  and have been established in this  community, I just really  want a lot of respect  for the people even voted for the  referendum to really consider  the zoning changes  that had to do with Valley Tedge.  And to really  think consciously about  how we want to live with the quality  of life and respect  for the environment,  respect for the times that we're  living in, that  we're kind of  used to  a privilege of just thinking  we can have  as big a place or  as big a home. We can  use resources however  we want and not really be  conscious of the  conditions of the times that we're living  in. And also  really about what makes a  quality of life  to be able to  not be in our cars all the time  or to not be always  on the go. To enjoy  our lives, our communities,  to be able to contribute  in conscious ways to the  well-being of our community  and I think that means that we have to  really look at some really  creative ways of  how we're going to build, how we're going to  live, what really makes sense  and I think  it's time to really readjust  our thinking about  how we all live together in harmony  and respect  for the planet and  for each other.  Thank you.  All right.  Council members have questions,  further comments  for the committee  or recommendations as  to where we go from here?  Well the final recommendation  from the report was that  we direct staff to  compile a presentation based upon  the ad hoc committee's recommendations  and then go to the planning commission  and then to city council.  So is that, do we have consensus there?  I didn't see that in there.  I thought it said to direct staff  to bring back some suggestions.  This committee requests city council  direct staff to evaluate and provide  reports to the planning commission  and city council in the following.  That's it.  Yeah, we want to pass this to the staff  with the council's approval  but I think probably  the most important thing is that we  I think the most efficient thing  is maybe Addison and I  as the co-chair sit down with  whoever, Brendan or Mike  and don'  t look so happy Brendan.  And see how we can see  what the practicality is of  implementing these things over  some period of time or not.  The staff may come back  for some very good reasons why.  Right. We have layers of review from staff on this.  I think the first one would be  that somewhere down, some months away  because they have other work that'  s already scheduled, they would bring  reports to the planning commission.  We would see planning commission  review on it and then it would come to  council for approval of anything in particular  which can happen in whatever phase makes  sense from their standpoint.  I am not comfortable with that.  But this is a huge amount of staff.  You said that staff suggested and said  we' re already doing this, we' re  already doing that, we' re already doing this.  I think it would be great to have staff  delineate in here what is  we' ll call it low hanging fruit  that can maybe be possibly  taken care of and done in a rapid way  and then bring some sort of a list  back to council, maybe ranked or however  you want to do it. You can work with the committee  or whatever and bring back. And then if there'  s something we want to send people further down  the road on and send it to the planning commission  or whatever, but I' m not going to have staff  sending stuff to planning commission that we  haven' t directed that  it seems like there' s a lot. How about if  planning commission and I sit down with  director veeg and we can figure out what the next steps are.  I would concur with that.  You guys vet the things obviously that are possible.  Like you said the low hanging fruit and  then let' s bring something back to full council.  That' s what I would be comfortable with.  But I' m not like you, mayor, comfortable  shipping this off without some very specific  direction. I like to have a little  vetting. I think the two committee members  have a lot of experience.  I' m happy to hear what the committee  chairs have to say about that. I think I'  m really pleased with these outcomes and I  really appreciate that this has been pretty  well vetted by people all over the political  spectrum, people who are building in our  community, advocates for open space and smart  growth, and our staff. I would love to see our  committee chairs and staff work together to  bring this to the planning commission.  commission and to us but open to whatever  that looks like according to our staff and  committee chairs.  I think vice mayor  benning.  this is a huge undertaking for you to take a look at.  I agree I think for you and councilor winslow to sit down  and talk about this.  I would like to go down and go over this.  I will give you a couple of months or however long you need  to take a look at it.  I am absolutely convinced much of what is in here is already  being performed by you.  In working with developers and working with the ideas about  growth and what direction.  Much of this has been done for quite a few years.  I think the general plan is just fine.  I do not support sending this to the planning commission.  It should come back to the committee.  It should come back to us.  We are the decision makers.  It would be I think a burden on the planning commission to take  a look at this prematurely.  I support taking a look at it.  But bring it back to us.  councilmember rohn over back.  I would like to respond to councilmember  bennett' s comments.  What you are seeing here are not things the city is currently  doing.  They are very consistent with the direction the city is taking.  I don' t see this as a contentious conversation at all.  It is maybe accelerating some things that are already moving in  that direction.  Mr. Vitek has a second.  first of all I will give kudos to the two chairs who did  reach out both with mike but also with me individually and  again with me and mike.  And vetting back with your groups, your subcommittees or  I will go to the other side.  In some cases as the committee chairs shared with you all there  are some things we have already committed to do in the housing  element.  There are some things coming up that aren' t even planning  related.  The tier fee structure is something where you can give  general direction and as part of an upcoming impact fee update  if that direction is given staff could look into that.  we gave feedback to the two of them on these recommendations.  There were some things on there we said that'  s a little bit more complicated.  The second one is a non-starter.  Those things came off.  A lot of the things here there may be simple answers about  making amendments to the code to allow adus to be sold  separately.  We talked about that about using existing condominium laws  that the state has already.  There may be clean ways to address some of these ideas.  I think if we got together and chatted some more we could put  some staff slash chair analysis together for each one of them  to talk about their viability.  there may be some items  ultimately when people say we  shouldn' t necessarily go  straight to planning commission  we will go to the planning  commission because they give  recommendations to council on  changes to title 19 but it would  be nice to get your direction to  go to them. All of these are  things I think have come forward  thoughtfully they are not out of  left field and I do appreciate  the chairs engaging staff  throughout the process  especially towards the end.  I' m as it relates to this list  comfortable with us trying to  work through with the chair and  the council I think these are  working the edges as the  committee members have said and  the chairs there' s no open  heart surgery here in fact some  cases are reconfirming our  commitment to the special  planning areas I' m comfortable  with the list.  my feedback on some of the  suggestions for how exactly we  move forward as far as council  re going to do. I' m not sure  what we'  re going to do. I' m not sure  re going to do. I' m not sure  what we'  would get to without picking  some things to be way deeper  into. I want to remind everybody  about the residential readiness  program. These are code updates  that were spurred by the housing  element update because in there  was a whole much longer list of  things to do. They broke this up  into some phases that are  bite-sized. These are big  bites too but they'  re bite-sized. They go through  the planning commission come to  council and we did the final  approval of the phase two a  couple of months ago and phase  three should be in fall. How I  envision this because we'  re already doing that  sort of thing is this is  essentially rolled into further  phases of residential readiness  that staff would determine what  are the things that'  s easy for us to do  quickly? What are the things  that require some really firm  direction? Some of these things  we talked about like limiting  parking requirements in areas.  We'  ve got to pick what those areas  are if we do that. The reason  why I wanted to send the planning  commission is not to get  people to the planning commission  but really give those agencies  expedited decision making really  give them the opportunity to  vet it for us. Also understand  that us having more firm  direction for them is helpful in  some regards. As far as what the  direction is I'  m open to a  variety of ways we do it but I  do think that this is the last  time we should look at this as  the large thing that it is and  the next time we see this we  should be breaking it up into  sections where we can be looking  at fine points of  Well, I typed it in as a motion without anyone making a motion, but just because you're directing staff to probably look at it, to re-review that with the two chairs, and then to bring that back to council.  It's going to be more than an hour's time, which means we're going to need direction from us.  Okay.  Well, you just very articulately and concisely stated the motion I was going to make.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'm glad you filled that in.  Who is the second?  Sorry, can you say that again, what the motion is?  That this is going to be, that the list that you prepared is going to be passed to staff and to look for those items that are low-hanging fruit, and that they are to meet with the chairs of the committee to bring back to council for a future discussion, and then you'll determine what goes on from there.  Does that make sense from your  operational standpoint?  I don'  t think it has to be an  exhaustive exercise. Some of it could be, yes, do look into. There are some, the most controversial thing to me so far is the whole parking, where that might be parking elimination or great reductions in certain areas. We already have done that on our corridor opportunities. I want to make sure that'  s something that maybe there'  s an easy way. Maybe we do it like we did recently.  discussion recently on the topic of what was it where we did a moratorium where we'  re allowing downtown for one year people to come forward with a land use that includes an office use on the ground floor. Something where we just do a trial and see if there is anybody who'  s really interested in pursuing a project with eliminating or highly reducing parking. What we often find is people want parking as an amenity for their residents or their future clients. Maybe we have some simple solutions to some things that aren'  t be  re not trying to make it too  painful.  the only thing I would add to that is I would say it'  s not to only discover what the low hanging fruit is. I think maybe if some of that is prioritized and ranked for us to understand we can say you can easily move forward on this. Here'  s the harder stuff.  Kind of like what you just described. Bring the harder and then let'  s take it off piece by piece and  send what we need to the planning commission to do their job and what we can do here we don'  t need to bother them with. I think that'  was more my not wanting to send it to planning commission right away. I think there'  s some things we may be able to do differently.  Again, those are things that we need to be able to do that doesn'  t need to go that direction.  maybe a little analysis of each one of these ideas.  tell us what'  s happening in concurrence right now with some of those things. Like the fact that we'  re doing an exhaustive fee analysis. It would be silly for us to talk to anything about fees until that exhaustive fee analysis comes back. Attaching all those things that are happening concurrently right now that would be silly to send forward.  Again, those are things that we need to be mindful of.  Can I get a second so I was going to second that if I wanted to give councilmember Winslow's ensure the  One of the co-chairs the ability to second if you don't I will second sometimes he's recalcitrant  I like it when you second things to like you  Well, I also just I agree with you mayor Reynolds and I thought maybe in that  Motion you might be interested instead of specifying looking for the low-hanging fruit more generally  analyzing or prioritizing the recommendations  Classifying the food. Yeah, that's fine. Good fruit bad fruit  Did you second I did  All right, we got a motion in a second and it sounds like we might have some concurrence, okay councilmember Goldstein  I councilmember Holly. Yes councilmember O'Brien. Yes councilmember van overbeck. Yes  Councilmember Winslow. Yes, vice mayor Bennett. Yes mayor Reynolds. I carry 7-0  All right  Councilmember Goldstein request Park Avenue corridor. Can we go fast on this one so we don't have to another breaks?  We'll go almost as fast as the cars on Park Avenue. Okay, perfect  All right  So we heard about the needs for housing and for code changes to support infill development in our community and Park Avenue is one of  those corridor opportunity sites identified in our general plan for  Robots and  Robots and  podem  podem identified in our general plan for robust growth um and it has significant potential to help address housing needs while providing a vibrant walkable mixed use corridor connecting downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods and new development so there's also been some issues  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  time to plan ahead for the future of park avenue there's a group of stakeholders called the park  av working group that i've been meeting with and they want to work with the city to update and  implement the vision for park avenue which was previously established in a 2002 visioning study  it's also essential to the southwest chico neighborhood plan and as mentioned park avenue  and the wedge are opportunity sites so however this looks like the kind of key intentions here  are to look at increasing mixed use development opportunities on park av and in surrounding areas  including the wedge and redesigning the park avenue right-of-way to improve multimodal safety  and walkability so i don't have just one idea for how to start this process and i want to be really  sensitive to a for mentioned constraints on staff time and our budget but want to at least start  this conversation and so a few ideas that we had talked about for how that could go is maybe council  could do that and i think that's a good idea and i think that's a good idea and i think that's a good  that's a good idea and i think that's a good idea and i think council could consider directing  staff to begin a process of developing a park avenue corridor plan type of effort or request  staff develop recommendations and or council could maybe refer this to a committee of the  planning commission or something of that sort and i due to budget season haven't really had a  chance to talk about this in depth with planning staff unfortunately but of course would love to  hear from our planning staff if they have thoughts on this.  that'  s the end of my quick  report.  questions of council?  this is a question to director  vee I can'  t see him over  the monitor. Isn'  t there  going back to 2002 a plan for  renovating park avenue?  there was a visioning study  prepared at one point and I  think some people think it was  it was put on a shelf and  completely forgotten. I will  say that was not the case it  was picked back up as part of  the neighborhood planning  process at one point that was  taken done for south west and in  fact some of the concepts were  incorporated into the general  plan and so when we did some  rezoning we did some along that  corridor to allow more mixed  use to allow higher density I  do know that the vision has'  t come to be but I would  development. Park avenue doesn'  t suffer like any differently  than a lot of other corridors  that haven'  t seen the  height the density or the mixed  use. There is a park avenue  visioning study.  I applaud councilor  goldstein'  s intentions. I think park  avenue at some point is going to  effectively effectively  effectively effectively !  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  the reason that'  s not  developed is because we didn'  t have a good  vision it'  s because the  economics don'  t work.  I want to offer if there are  stakeholders or individuals  that are finding something  obstructing them from pursuing  development of a parcel they can  reach out directly to us I'  ve  not had any contact per se with  members of the park avenue  working group or maybe I have  and I don'  know that they'  working with us.  m not a member of the  park avenue working group we did  work with the group that was  focused on the wedge for some  time we did make significant  changes to county council to  allow residential uses in the  iomu zoning district which  opened up a whole world I  believe in that area. They were  going to do more due diligence  and come back with concepts for  planning staff they have not. I  also want to say one thing I  consistently hear the city of  chico has parking mandates that  adding a new parking lot as part  of a dispensary and that'  s just not  true and it continues to grow  that applicant requested and  desired to tear down a building  and put up a parking lot as part  of their business plan which was  supported by the planning  commission and by city staff it  was not a requirement. I want to  make sure that continues to grow  as if the parking mandates  dictated that parking lot that'  s not necessarily the case.  thank you. There were parking  requirements and they put that  in their plan because of the  parking requirements correct?  they could have managed parking  a number of ways that'  s something they  pursued.  they would have had to request a  reduction correct?  they may have had to request a  reduction or done something on  site or had something there were  a number of ways for them to  manage parking.  I mean it'  s not a !  barrier but it'  s not one of the key barriers  but I think it'  s worth studying what  actually could be in the way and  what could be changed.  is there any chance that we  could just add this to the list  that we just got from the growth  and ad hoc committee and rank it  and put it in with this list and  figure out where it comes back at  so we'  re not taking up something  else and throw it in here and be  like how can we add park avenue  corridor growth to the things we'  re suggesting in here?  I'  m just throwing it out there.  I think a lot of the  recommendations we have in that  report like especially when you'  re looking at specific areas they  apply to I think we could  acknowledge that park avenue and  the surrounding neighborhoods are  like those perfect places to apply  some of these more urbanist  concepts to which I think is  supported by the neighborhood plan  and stuff in the past but I will  say as far as development  potential there while park avenue  itself has some parking reductions  but there'  re still requirements and  things like that.  I think the city has the  highest density allowances in the  city but right outside of that  where you can build the highest  stuff is low density zone and  there'  s a lot of apartments  there that were built long before  they down zoned that.  But in the broader off of the  corridor itself and this is a  problem we have in other places  too we shift immediately from 60  unit max to 7 unit an acre max  and I think that is where there'  e more land and more flexible  opportunities and people more  often would prefer to live a  block off of park avenue as long  as it is a 40, 45 mile an hour  road.  so I think that'  s not very accessible.  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  Yeah, we also probably open up the public comment first and then discuss more of what the next direction is sure how many speakers do we have?  We have four all right  All right, Eric Nelson followed by Elizabeth Devereaux  Thank You councilmember Goldstein for bringing this to  This idea to all of us the Park Avenue opportunity corridor  I think has tremendous potential for housing and commercial development that reflects the goals of the general plan  To build close to the city's core  It already has all the infrastructure to build mixed-use commercial residential and to provide a variety of housing choices with walkable  bikeable streets for Chico citizens  But the impending revitalization of downtown and as you mentioned the strong possibility of the barber yard development  Which will have over 1,200 units likely of housing of a variety of houses  This is an opportune time to create a vision for Park Avenue  For the Park Avenue opportunity corridor that complements and integrates with downtown and barber yard  Generating and creating economic activity from Tres Hombres all the way down to the commons  Please provide funds  I would urge City Council either from the cannabis revenue and or measure H  To help pay for the costs of planning the Park Avenue opportunity corridor  This is what I see as an investment in Chico  A really wise investment in Chico done with professional planning will pay healthy dividends and could contribute to the vitality of our city  Thank you  Thank You Elizabeth Deborah followed by Adam Fedele  Yeah, I'm part of that Park Avenue working group also and  We started the whole vision of this in the  1994 general plan then  That was the ring  transportation quarter in 2002  The visioning study was done and then the general plan in  2011 was done with the Park Avenue becoming an opportunity site. So Park Avenue is now  Designed to be an arterial roadway development. It has not had the  visioning study of 2002 yet and I feel like  you know, I  Guess I would say  The time is now I feel like there's already a lot going on  There's a number of pubs that are developing up there. There's five landowners that are on our Park Avenue working group who?  actually would like to develop and  They want to probably have an easier way of doing that  by making the codes  You know better than they are right now and so I would say  I would support  council member Goldstein's  recommendations to direct staff to begin processing the developing of the corridor plan and I know that  you know  some of this is  In the works or has been done. Is that right or?  Anyway, I won't ask you and identify the barriers to develop and implement the Park Avenue visioning study  also, I'm also a  I think  that  You know, this is a time where we keep talking. In fact, the ad hoc troop was all about  developing an infill site so that we we actually preserve the beauty of our open space and this is  Probably one of the best places that we could turn our direction to for housing and I know Tom, you know doesn't  Say that it's possible right now  But I really feel that whatever the barriers are  We need to look at and and there are owners who are ready to build so I mean we need to make it easier for them  So and plus it's less expensive  Than going out in greenfield areas because of the existing infrastructure. So  You know for those reasons and for climate change and carbon emissions I'd say please  advise staff like Bryce's has recommended  Elizabeth can I ask a question you see you're on the  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  that he his architect is on our working committee, so he's working with us and then  Mike trollander has two buyers  Bill Smith and  That's the other person. I can't remember right now  They've bought a lot of the land there on the wedge all the way from East Park down halfway to Slakey brothers  And then on Myers as well. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for that. Okay, anybody. Thank you  Okay  So Adam Fideli followed by Austin Baron  Evening again, thanks Bryce for bringing this forward  I'm happy to be a part of this group. We've been tinkering with these concepts for a while, but it dovetails  Exactly into what I said previously this evening. This is an  Easy fit for the goals of the general plan. It's an easy fit  For land that's underutilized and it could really be something  else would help  from the city from  Interested parties we have a lot of things happening on Park Avenue that are happening organically at both ends, you know  Matt has bought that property the old Haleem II property with the tailors bite me burger  It used to be you know that and at the other end the Commons with the whole I call it the beer district as a neighborhood  You know, I run I'm up and down Park Avenue all the time  every time I drive down that road and  Said that could be really cool right there. It's a sitting there rotting  with the proximity to downtown and the proximity to  What's happening in diamond match?  It's gonna be a sales tax  boom for the city  There's a lot of people that are gonna live out in diamond match  They're not gonna want to drive all the way over the highway to Home Depot  They're gonna want to some services on Park Avenue. They're gonna be able to grab a bite to eat. They're gonna want to stay  You know in that cold?  I mean, I think that's what we're looking for. So this is  another opportunity for us to get ahead of that and  Some of the sales tax revenue that the cannabis dispensary is bringing in I think  We have to set a little bit aside just from some visionary planning so Brandon can pay staff  You know to help out with this kind of thing  To do this kind of intense little okay. We got this parcel. We know this guy wants to develop it. Here's the barriers  What do we do about it? And?  Just run with it  We're in the right mindset. This is the opportunity. Let's take it. Thanks  Second  Austin go ahead  Good evening council  So I want to speak on this  This topic here the Park Avenue corridor, I think Bryce for bringing this together  I think this is a great great example of how we can  You know work the the density side of the corn here and create a really good corridor  create some commercial opportunities and get rid of some some vacant lots or some  Former car loss on this on this this quarter here. One of the things I wanted to bring up which I didn't see anybody brought up before  Was this this entire area at least for the last two years has been under a qualified census tract from HUD  So it's actually eligible for bonus funds for low-income affordable development LA HTC projects  So this could be a great opportunity to create some create some housing create some retail  Create some uses that would be blend in well with the barber neighborhood, you know, we have a we have a dense  residential area in this in this  whole area and  You know be a shame for this bar your project to go through and like Adam was saying everybody have to drive all the way down  20th to near the freeway to go shopping. So  I'd like to see you know, some some work done on this maybe  Bringing back that that vision plan from 2002 and taking a look at what we can do here  and I think if the city can help out with making the the impact fee and  You know, maybe more affordable or the the zoning a little bit more flexible  So if we have a good project we can get it through without any barriers. This is the right area to do it. So  Thank you  Thank you, it's not all for speakers  All right further questions or comments from Council  I am remember Goldstein. Yeah, just thanks to the speakers  but also  I'm trying to think of a way that we can  Perhaps as was discussed kind of maybe combined forces here save some time by discussing this when we talk about the ad hoc  Committee recommendations. I don't know if that's piling more work on to staff and the committee chairs though  Or perhaps to take a closer look at parka when you're talking about this  So I just wanna mixed uses allowed  I'd end up with a question about the  If there are some impediments that the city is allowed reduce parking associated with those uses is allowed if there are some impediments and there are some  property owners that are trying to pursue something  Why don't we facilitate a meeting with staff public works planning price could be part of it and we can talk through and see if  There are in fact impediments. I  Mean, that's usually how this works when we have people that are pursuing something and something's not working  And if that is so obvious and clear that we need to make some amendments or changes to our zone  In code to support  Residential readiness. I don't see why we couldn't pursue those  So I guess I would like to be I'm interested in what these and these impediments are I don't  I think I guess that's where I'm confused. We have a 2002 study that has a visioning study that you know  I don't if there's a vision he's clearly said if there's something to bring forward bring it forward  I'm not sure hiring another consultant and spending another hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollars on a consultant to tell us what we're gonna do with our  City !  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  I feel like we might not even need a motion for that  If it's less than you think that'll be less than an hour. Oh, I don't know  All right. Let's let's see can direct and make a motion to  Direct direct staff to work with the Park Avenue working group  Can you word it for something like that for right?  And then you got a second by councilmember Holly  Okay, well, I thought Katie was making because quite frankly mr.  Rowe has some of the most beautiful drawings I've ever seen so why don't we just keep our drawings here locally and why are we spending?  Hundreds of thousands of dollars on consultants that don't live around here  Yeah, I understand for instance why some of the vision hasn't come to be I mean, yeah  It has buildings fronting the street looking up with trees and people walking down  But the buildings need to come first and that needs to come from so the city does what the city does  Exactly the private sector does what the private sector does  And so I guess  I'm kind of focused on this notion that there are some impediments now if there are some issues with the movement  transportation corridor multimodal  We'll bring along my friend Brendan out of  We want to make sure that  we're planning ahead for the next time the roadway gets redesigned and  Planning ahead for the transportation future and the development future at the same time  All right, so we got a motion in a second. Okay councilmember Goldstein  Councilmember Holly. Yes, councilmember O'Brien. Yes, I want to thank councilmember Goldstein for putting a lot of effort in this  I appreciate when council members do that. So thank you and I again vote. Yes  Council member van overbeck. Yes, council member Winslow. Yes, me vice mayor Bennett  Yes, mayor Reynolds. I carry seven zero  All right reports and communications the following reports of communications or items provided for their councils information  No action can be taken on items under the  Section unless council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda  City managers report  All right strategic plan we received and filed and councilmember requests. Do we have any councilmember requests?  Council member Holly this should be a quick conversation  I'd like to bring to the agenda reassessment of development impact fees and the annual adjustments  specifically when we are looking at decreasing fees with decreasing building construction at the moment and  we do only increase  Development impact fees with increased building construction cost and I think it would be only fair to do decrease those as well  when we see  opposite of inflation so that would specifically be  3.85  point three to our transportation facility fee adjustments  3.85 4 to o storm drainage facility fee adjustments three point eight five five to o Park facility fee adjustments and lastly  3.85 points  6 to o building and equipment fee adjustments  I would have seconded that before you read all the numbers. We will say probably just as in the Finance Committee bill second your motion  And didn't what you just reviewed it? Yeah, and we just reviewed that  That's not what we reviewed I'm talking about the way that we increase and and decrease  It's not based upon the construction cost and index. We're not talking about Caltrans highway construction cost  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem [inaudible]  podem  I' m looking at you and you'  re looking at me so what do you  think?  I don'  t know we can talk about it  until it'  s on the agenda.  obviously can discuss it it  would be a muni code change so it  would require some work to do it.  I'  m supportive of it in general I  have a quick question for staff.  We'  re doing this comprehensive fee  study right that we keep hearing  about is that you Brendan I'  m sorry.  that would be late next year.  I think what council member holly  is referencing is a policy decision  that wouldn'  t necessarily be part of the  development impact fee analysis.  I was thinking if that was close  to coming back we could tie it in  and do it at the same time that  was the only reason I was asking  that but I don'  t want to wait that long.  I'  m going to go back to what to withdraw it's okay councilmember goldstein aye councilmember holly yes councilmember o'brien yes councilmember van overbeck yes councilmember wenslow aye vice mayor bennett yes mayor reynolds  vice mayor bennet.  mayor reynolds.  carry 7-0.  any others?  no.  the council meeting at 6 here in  the chambers at 421 main street  in chico in case you don'  t know where we'  re at. It'  s highlighted in yellow I'  m supposed to say that out loud.
