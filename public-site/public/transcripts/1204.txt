Here.  effectively effectively effectively !  effectively Persons demonstrating rude,  effectively  effectively  effectively appropriate actions. appropriate actions.  introduce the first action. Our  first action is we have a  presentation by Mr. Peck.  good evening Madam Mayor and  members of the council my name  is joshua pack I'  m the director of  public works for butte county  and I'  ve been asked by the  council to give a presentation  on a summary of several reports  prepared by butte county  related to the five mile basin.  As you'  re aware the five  mile basin is located in  bidwell park butte county is the  local maintaining agency for the  infrastructure there which  includes several diversion  structures including the big  chico creek and lindo channel  basin as well as sycamore creek  diversion where we'  re also  responsible for the flood plain  within that general area butte  county does not maintain big  chico creek or lindo channel  basin. We are also responsible  downstream of this location.  So a little bit of history about  the basin the basin the original  infrastructure was built in the  1960'  s it was constructed by the  U.S. Army corps of engineers  and since that time butte county  has been the maintaining agency  and us along with the city of  chico have harvested sediment  and other materials from time to  time for its own use until the  mid 1990' s at that time various  environmental impacts the  responsible for that. The  concerns for that were brought  up and curtailed our activities  and that concern crescendoed in  2001 when the department of fish  and wildlife issued a cease and  desist order to butte county  from those operations. Since  that time operations have  generally ceased and sediment  has increased resulting in  concerns by engaged stakeholders  including the city. With that in  mind the board did direct my  staff to perform reports kind of  outlining the impacts of that  The first one is the  A  complicating factor was the park  fire and certainly the short-term  concerns with sediment and debris  flows. We'  re going to touch on both of  those. They'  re a little bit separate  certainly there'  s some connections between  those two but we'  ll talk about both.  Focusing first on some of the  short-term impacts and the steps  butte county public works is  taking to address those concerns.  A report that was done by the  state led by cal fire as part of  their watershed emergency  response team or work team for  short. Explored potential risks  in the burn scar including  potential sediment and debris  flowing downstream impacting the  five-mile basin. As part of that  reports the state conducted storm  water flow calculations based on  two-year and ten-year storm  events. I'  m going to refer to a term  called freeboard. Freeboard is  basically the difference in  elevation between the top of the  flood waters and the bottom of  that or the top of the  infrastructure meant to protect  the surrounding areas. The five  mile basin was designed to  for a 100-year storm event once  every century to have three feet  of freeboard. Basically three  feet of difference between the  flood plain elevations that  flood levels and the  infrastructure meant to protect  it. I'  ll be referring to that term on  several occasions. The short-  term concerns that was identified  by the state when they looked at  the two-year and the ten-year  storm event. With the two-year  storm event still plenty of  sufficient capacity at the basin  to manage potential flows. A lot  of that is eroded away within  that ten-year storm where we'  re seeing freeboard approaching  its capacity. One of the things  I want to mention with this and  we'  re going to talk about this in  the next slide is this is a  fairly conservative estimate.  It'  s also unmitigated. Many of the  recommendations that were  presented by the state that the  county has adopted and embraced  help address many of those  concerns. You can see in that  picture there in front of you  that'  s one of the recommendations that  infrastructure. One of the  measures we took we partnered  with a local contractor with a  specialized piece of equipment  to pull debris out of the basin  during the most recent bomb  cyclone in November. This piece  of equipment is specialized  because it can pull debris out  in real time while minimizing the  threat and risk to the  surrounding infrastructure. This  equipment was critical in  helping to protect chico and the  infrastructure during those bomb  cyclones in November. As part  them with a number of  recommendations. The county has  worked closely with city staff  and we appreciate their efforts  and feedback on our measures  that we'  ve taken. This is just some of  the measures. We'  ll show some pictures to  outline and highlight some of  that work. We did some early  maintenance in the weeks and  months after the fire to provide  early protections including minor  debris removal. We coordinated  with the state of California on  vegetation removal. Not as much  as we would have liked to have  done. The state was pretty  particular on the way that we  additional work on what we could  and couldn'  t do. We'  ll talk about the  limitations of that in a future  slide. We did do a fair bit of  vegetation removal that we feel  was vital in helping to protect  the infrastructure from these  recent storms. One of the things  we did that was really helpful  in the park fire is we improved  our standby and emergency  reporting procedures. We'  ve shared that with city staff  so especially after hours,  weekends, we'  ve given them direct contact  information to the folks who  make the greatest difference.  One of the things that'  s been my credo is you don'  t need to talk to me to talk  to three other people to get the  work done. They'  ve gotten direct  communication and engagement  with the folks who are directly  responsible for the maintenance  so we cut out the middle man.  There'  e no reason for me to be  involved if I don'  t have to. Let'  s get the folks who are  responsible out there to get the  work done as quickly as  possible. One thing that we'  re in the process of installing  is remote monitoring cameras.  We'  ve purchased two cameras. They  actually came in last week.  We'  re in the process of scheduling  time to go out and install one  at each of the diversion  structures so we can monitor that  and really get the work done.  in real time. One of the goals  as well is with all of our forces  spread throughout the county if  we do have concerns we can pop  up on our mobile phone and take  a look. We can look at our  office. If there are issues we  can address those. Sometimes if  we know there'  s not as much of an  issue we can focus on other  parts of the county  infrastructure that'  re at need. A couple of other  efforts we'  ve staged equipment and  materials on the site  especially in advance of  activity. That green piece of  equipment that'  s called a  ceneboggin that was a  was a  piece of equipment we partnered  with a local contractor to store  at the beginning of the bomb  cyclone and again was very  quickly able to be deployed at  each of the basins or each of  the diversion structures to  address sediment and debris  flows. We partnered with a local  contractor to provide those  services. Again they have more  expertise and experience than we  do in these very delicate  operations. Our crews can do a  lot of the routine work. Very  good at that. But when flows are  high and we need a very deft  hand with 20 years of experience  with a very simple and  efficient equipment we can  do it. The !  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  the water. This is one of the  diversions structures before  you can see a lot of vegetation  and overgrowth our crews  working with the state  department of fish and wildlife  went in and cleared those to  provide additional capacity  reducing the risk of debris  getting stuck and lodged within  the infrastructure. You also see  some of the vegetation removal  not to the extent we would have  liked but we did do some  non native species removal and  limbed up trees about six feet  to reduce the risk of that low  line material getting clogged  or stuck in the basin. This is  not to the level we would have  liked but we were very limited  by the state's permit  requirements and I will have  more opportunities to beat up on  the state in a future slide.  Shifting from the short term to  the long term and that was the  original intent when we started  in May at direction of the board  the amount of sediment that has  been deposited in the basin over  these decades. We estimated based  on analysis done by our  consultants that approximately  67,000 cubic yards of sediment  have been deposited in the basin.  How much is that? If we took  dump trucks it would hold 15 tons  of material each that is about  4500 truck loads that is a lot.  Certainly something of concern  that we need to address.  Again free board we modeled this  with the help of the  state's hydraulic modeling  computer software to determine  what the impacts are with this  additional because as you raise  the elevation with that additional  material that in turn raises the  elevation of the floods reducing  that amount of free board. Over  the 50 year event this is again  that twice a century once every  50 year event we still have  sufficient capacity exceeding  three feet or more. The 100 year  storm event you see that eroded  the entire basin. That is  definitely a threat to the  environment. We have seen !  The ! One of the things that I think is especially one of the questions we get is  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the we were prohibited from doing that based on the environmental impacts.  the 1960s or wasn't heavily considered in the 1960s and so we have to address those concerns  whether it's fish and aquatic species or  Fauna and other habitat whether it's biological  There are items that we have to address now  The Board of Supervisors can adopt what's called a statement of overriding considerations  It allows them to weigh the balance of the environmental impacts with the immediate public health and safety need that doesn't  Remove our our necessary due diligence to account for those impacts  Quantify those and try to do our best to address those reasonably in addition  There are a number of regional state and federal agencies that claim jurisdiction over this basin and have quite onerous  regulatory requirements many of which don't begin until after we complete our environmental process  In addition we know from other similar projects that there will be various interest groups that are very interested in this project  We need to do our best to address those concerns have earnest conversations  regarding those concerns  Finally as with any project that has the potential to destroy native habitat under most circumstances  We have to take measures to address that by creating new habitat or paying for credits for that  That takes that's a costly measure that happens with other EIRs  The reason I share all this is this is not something we can snap our fingers and do we we did that for 20 30 40 years  ago and got our hand slapped multiple times by the state  It takes time  We anticipate taking anywhere from three to five years under a normal time frame  which is  Under normal circumstances, that's the process  Unfortunately, this particular effort won't be able to help the park fire short-term concerns  That report suggests that those impacts should last about two to three years with maybe some lingering concerns an additional year or two  We're we're already  through at least half of that first year  so  One of the things and one of the big issues too. I'm gonna go back real quick is the cost of seven eight million dollars  That's not something  That the board has readily available  Certainly have concerns with that cost especially upfront cost  Fortunately previous iterations of the Board of Supervisors and your City Council addressed that in the 1960s when  when the infrastructure was built  Both agencies agreed to create County service area 24. It's a special district that was specifically identified for this particular purpose  It includes most of Chico's urban boundary as well as the surrounding unincorporated areas  Approximately fifteen thousand two hundred parcels the vast majority of which are located within the city limits  It includes other area-wide drainage services, but the infrastructure maintenance within the basin is included within that cost  I'm gonna geek out for 30 seconds  I apologize about this  When the CSA was created it was originally intended to have a per parcel service charge that didn't occur in the 1960s and 1970s  When the board had more broader authority to assess property taxes before prop 13  They utilized their authority to use property taxes to fund to be the proper mechanism to fund this  To fund the the maintenance of this infrastructure in 1978 when prop 13 passed it severely curtailed the revenues  There was a bill called a B8 which helped restore some of that funding but over time  We continue to rely on the use of County property taxes, and there's no annual per parcel service charge as a result  There's not sufficient funding within the CSA to help pay for this activity  There's about three million dollars and with all of the work  We're doing to maintain the infrastructure in the basin over this last year that my numbers generally trending downwards  so one of the items we brought to the board is the  For their consideration was the potential creation of a parcel charge  Again, it was the original intent 60 years ago a per parcel charge could provide not only funding for the removal project  It could also fund future maintenance and perpetuity. So we're not here 25 years from now having the same discussion  The approximate cost based on the current cost estimates is about five hundred dollars per parcel  That does not have to be in a single year that can be spread out over a number of years to make it more palatable  to the potential folks included in the parcel charge  The post project assessments could also be included. So again after this project is completed  We can continue to collect smaller assessments to maintain it to a greater level and then potentially include future  sediment removal projects in more frequent occurrences  One of the challenges with this is this qualifies as a majority ballot election for proposition 218  Which means we have to go out to a ballot  15,000 voters we need to get more than 50 percent of those who vote  To support that in order to fund in order to be successful  There's a lot of time and effort as part of this and so that's something to recognize  We'll have to issue out a request for proposals to we don't have the in-house staff to be able to do this  So we'll have to farm this out  Now we did get some direction today from the board. This is a new slide  I repaired just several hours ago  The board did direct us this morning to begin a concurrent effort to expedite these efforts to begin the project design  secret process environmental permitting process and at the same time begin pursuing a prop 218 election  To include a ballot assessment for the property owners those 15,000 property owners within the existing boundaries of the CSA  Now the board did discuss potential contingency actions if the ballot election fails  But also want to recognize too that the board does prefer to utilize CSA 24 as a funding mechanism for this for these improvements  over time  So that's a little bit of a truncated version of the presentation. I gave my board earlier today  That ends my hopefully somewhat brief presentation. I'm sure you've got questions  I'm gonna do my best to answer them and I appreciate your time and the invitation to be here today  So Josh, thank you very much for that comprehensive report, so you mentioned  15,000 people will have to vote on that if it went to election are those mostly all in the city  Did you say 85% to hear that correctly?  Yeah about 85% or within that?  So we had a little bit of a difference in the number of people in the city at least under the current boundary  So yeah, most of the folks that be voting on that and those are those are folks that in the 1960s  You want to win when that CSA map was prepared?  Those are the folks that received direct benefit from the infrastructure that was constructed at that time. Perfect. Thank you  Josh yeah, thanks again for a great presentation  So I have two areas of concern one is  the the  100-year event was was  set at 16,000 cubic feet per second in  1961  But 35 or so years later  there were flows in excess of  26,000 cubic feet per second and so I questioned whether that  100 that 16,000 cubic feet per second number is right and  Robin McCollum who's in the audience here and was with me this morning at the  board meeting  observed that at that time he was a flood  superintendent for the county  observed the water within six inches at the top of that levee now since then we've had  20  Whatever 27 years of sediment accumulation. I think we have to assume if we get another event of that magnitude  That levees gonna fail  Yeah, obviously that's a concern as we shared with the data especially a sizable  You know hundred-year event there are concerns  That's one of the reasons why the board is part of their direction earlier today  Approved an expedited approach over a more traditional  Sequential approach great to go after the funding at the same time begin the CEQA immediately as a matter of fact earlier today  My first three four hours after that meeting were sent prepping that so including  We need a budget amendment from the board to approve the funding  We're gonna ask for a million dollars in advance funding to begin that work  So we're gonna be expediting that work  Here in the coming weeks praying to utilize expedited  Consultant selection process to get this on the off the ground and going as quickly as possible  So we we agree that a sizeable event there is risk  And we've received direction today from our board to begin addressing that risk. Yeah, and that was great. So the second concern is I  Read a hydrologist report. I'm gonna see if you agree with this that as that because of the campfire and  the burning of water  much of the  watershed of Big Chico Creek  The loss of the vegetation is going to result not only in sediment flows  But also higher peak water flows first. So for a given amount of precipitation  the water is going to come down faster and the peak flow is going to be higher and that that  Is a  multiplier of  1.8 to 2. So that says that if normally you had  10,000 CFM coming downstream. You'd have eighteen to twenty thousand. Am I interpreting that correctly?  Yeah, I would say that's that's effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  my understanding and  interpretation as well. I'  happy to address that. In the  short term as we mentioned this  project we'  ve  approached the state on several  occasions about expediting and  we'  ve had little to no luck. The  board also directed us to reach  out to our state and federal  legislative representatives to  see if they can push this in a  different direction that maybe  the regulatory agencies are  being a little more difficult to  deal with. No promise is there  but it doesn'  t hurt to ask our elected  representatives to provide  assistance. As I mentioned the  long term sediment removal  project is not going to affect  the short term park fire. We  certainly see free board  concerns but as I mentioned they  gave a number of different  actions that we can take to at  least address that in the short  term. We'  ve been very aggressive as far  as our team to address that with  these aforementioned but you'  re right absolutely with the  potential flows from park fire  that potential flows from the  potentially present a different  risk and increased risk over  more traditional conditions  before the park fire.  this morning I really got a  sense of urgency from the board  and from you and our public  works guys have said that it'  s been great working  with you and your team so I want  to thank you for that. We'  re playing  Russian roulette every rainy  season with this situation  until we can get that stuff out  of there. Thank you for your  help.  thank you.  thank you.  great presentation.  would you go to the slide with  the county service area  boundaries?  absolutely.  my understanding is that the  highest flood risk in chico and  we have this in our stormwater  master plan report later is in  south chico on the south bank of  little chico creek primarily and  that'  s with the creek  diversion project. Do we have  similar issues there and is that  also under county jurisdiction?  I'  ll speak to the second  part and I'  m sure my  counterparts in public works can  speak to that as well but no the  county'  s jurisdiction is limited to the  basin and the infrastructure there  and the two diversion structures  especially talking about lindo  channel and big chico creek that  infrastructure helps regulate flow  so there'  s gates that we can  control we can raise and lower to  help restrict flows we can divert  flows but beyond that though that  infrastructure downstream is not  .  I'  m not referring to downstream  it'  s in the little chico creek and  there'  s a diversion dam that  funnels water to butte creek on  the south end of chico so it'  s a really similar structure but  it'  s a different one that  we'  ve been talking about  a little bit.  it'  s my understanding I  heard it in the audience and I  want to reiterate it'  s my understanding it'  s dwr's  responsibility department of water  resources they have broad  jurisdictional authority over a  number of streams especially on  the south side of chico I would  defer to your experts in house to  provide a little more information  as needed but that'  s my  understanding the county'  s jurisdiction is very limited  except at least in this area  except to that.  And we'  ve several  levies as well.  that answers it I appreciate it  and what that goes along with  that is it'  that is because the higher  flood risk areas are just in  those areas on the south bank  of little trickle creek. People  are not required to have flood  insurance in this area.  if you'  re not within the  flood plain it'  s my understanding you'  re not required to have  flood insurance.  if we did have one of these  events we'  re talking about a lot of  people would be noninsured or  self-insured if you want to call  that.  that'  s my understanding.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  I understand that a  proposition 218 election is  fairly strict in the process and  that includes things like  community feedback workshops.  but $500 per parcel even spread  out between a number of years is  fairly substantial for some of  the people who live in these  zones.  so i'  m curious of any prospects  anything that you would like to  next question. About what you  think parcel owners will think  is it a possibility that maybe  only a portion of that $7  million need will be funded by  an election like this?  it'  s a good question  councilmember. I don'  t want to be in the  position of predicting and  projecting what the voters want  so I will be a little cautious.  I think the more local and  specific you can make a concern  and tie it and create a nexus  between the benefits of it and  the direct benefits to the folks  who are asking for the  assessment there tends to be a  greater likelihood of success.  In this situation as I  mentioned the residents who live  within this boundary directly  benefit from its maintenance.  The hope is with a reasonable  assessment. As I mentioned to  the board earlier today asking  for $500 in one year is a very  difficult ask especially with  the current budget and the !  Inflation and other concerns  and the pressing issues your  residents and our constituents  feel. My hope is with a more  modest assessment over spread  out over multiple years that  could be more palatable and  potentially something that folks  with a large sticker would take  sticker shock might be a little  bit more palatable. Again that  was the board'  s direction today to look at  that. They didn'  t parse out whether they wanted  a partial. Again there is some  concerns with fund balance  especially with the long-term  maintenance efforts over the  next several years. We do have a  fair amount of money I believe  there'  s a little bit over $3 million  in that account right now. We  only get about $300,000 a year  which that $3 million has been  building up over many years. That  wouldn'  t be enough to deliver a  project. I think the vetting  over the next six or nine months  a year is going to vet out some  of the concerns and if there'  s I think we'  re going to get a  better pulse on that with the  community through those discussions  over the next six to nine months.  that'  s helpful. One follow-up  question to that if it ends up  that that initiative may not meet  the full funding are we looking  at any other funding mechanisms  that might diversify our  solutions?  there are several council  member I can speak to. We'  ve talked with potential grant  funders and we have seen some  increasing competition in the  relating to flood grant funding.  One of the options we talked about  at the board today was federal  earmarks. The county has been  fairly successful in receiving  federal earmarks. My department  alone has received four federal  earmarks over the last three  cycles. This looked like a project  that could participate and compete  well especially looking at the  would be an option in a future  funding year. The board did  discuss other options including  using reserves and I don'  t want to speak for my board  but that being said I certainly  can appreciate in the past they'  ve expressed us to look at all  options. I don'  t think there'  s anything off the table with  some of those coming to the  forefront.  thank you very much. I appreciate  it.  thank you.  closed session announcement  effectively effectively !  podem  podem !  podem  podem ! Item 2.1, conference with legal counsel  podem  podem !  podem  podem !  podem !  podem !  podem  podem  podem  the city council was briefed  update was provided no final  action was taken on that.  thank you I did want to give  one quick announcement to follow  up on what Mr. Lam said on the  rule 60 motion there'  s been a lot of question from  the public I know this was filed  a long time ago but the actual  final final briefing of the  going back and forth and back  and forth was on November 27  so we'  re just now hitting that  two-month mark that the judge  has had that.  So the 27th of November was  when that was and we did reach  out to the clerk and let them  know that chico is anxiously  awaiting to hear from them and  they said that they are working  on it and along with all the  other items on their case load  so not that that helps a lot but  did want you to know that it'  s on the forefront and we are  paying attention.  Consent agenda all matters listed  on the agenda are considered  routine in nature and can  therefore be enacted in one  motion do we have any speakers?  Or council member does  qualifications?  I guess we do not have any  speakers on that item.  All right.  Any motion?  Move to approve.  Second.  Got a motion and a second.  All right.  Council member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council member  Vandenberg.  Yes.  Council member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Public comment.  Members of the public may address  the council on any matter not  listed on the agenda and within  the jurisdiction's authority.  The council cannot take any  action on the requests made under  this section of the agenda.  How many speakers do we have?  We have six.  All right.  Three minutes each.  Okay.  I will call the first two speakers.  If you can line up in the middle  aisle that would be helpful.  The first two speakers are Ann  Perry followed by James Hutchinson.  Good evening, everyone.  Madam Mayor and council members.  I am here to express my concerns and  I'm sure all of us are on this same  page as far as our on housed population.  I would really love to come down to  downtown and sit in Plaza Park and  support the local government and  support the local merchants.  But I see what is out there and I  cannot do it.  I cannot come down to the park and  sit on a bench.  I cannot deal with seeing the  conditions that are out there.  It's very upsetting to me as I'm  sure it is to most of the people  in this room.  And I feel as a taxpayer that  I would love to see and use the  parks without having to deal with the  present conditions that are out there.  So as you being my representatives,  I would love to know what actions  the city is taking to help these  individuals.  There seems to be more and more out  there.  Every area of the city is  different.  pretty much, that I travel in this  city.  I see it.  I go to Costco.  I see it.  I go down to Card on Belambroja.  There's a beautiful picnic table  there in the sun on a nice plot of  lawn.  It's always occupied by on housed.  I don't know.  I drive under the, I see under the  parking lot.  There's tents and just accumulation  of people's belongings.  I don't know what to do anymore.  It's just very upsetting.  It's just unfortunate that it's out  there.  And for there being very, seems  to be very little solution at this  present moment.  So I would like to hear from the  council and the mayor.  What really are, what's on the  agenda to help the city?  we can take to help these people  and provide the citizens of this  city with a more appealing  atmosphere?  Thank you.  Thank you.  James Hutchinson followed by Dave  Donnan.  And anyone coming up can actually  move that microphone so it's close  to your mouth and that would, it's  easy to do.  I want to speak to the council  about what's happening in the  understand what's going on with  the bike park.  Speaking to you, generally speaking  if I had my choice the bike park  wouldn't be there but it is going  to be there and a lot of people  want it.  But there's a problem and you're  letting it happen.  You've got there a major pathway  that goes up to the Marsh Junior  High, services that area.  But on top of that there's a  problem.  It's down to force and Humboldt  where the buses are.  What I mean where the buses are  there's two buses that serve that  area.  One is the 7 bus that comes down  directly by Murphy, near Murphy  Commons, Marsh Junior High, comes  down to force and connects there  with the 5 where you can go downtown  or further out or the 7 goes on  out to the courthouse area.  Okay?  But problem is 7 only runs five  miles a day.  So people who live in that area  are very low income.  So what's the problem there?  Okay, you're building a bike park.  You've got a beautiful sidewalk  that passes by that bike park  that these people can use to walk  on, to use their wheelchairs on,  their walkers on, and I've seen  those, canes, okay?  And when you start building that  bike park you're going to totally  disrupt their ability to get out.  There's no easy way from there.  There's a special sidewalk.  Part of it is sidewalked.  But then there's dirt areas where  you can't go.  You either have to go out on the  street.  If you've been out in that area,  it's not easy.  Not easy for these people.  If you took and put a further  sidewalk on the far side of that  street, on the north side, so you  had two sidewalk paths, and you  put that bike park in there, you're  not going to be infringing upon  disrupting their ability to get to  and from.  If you change the bus schedules,  because of the increased population  in that area you have there of low  income, if you change that seven bus  schedules so they're available on  weekends for these people, these are  simple things.  There's a little cost on the sidewalk,  the bus thing, there's controversy,  but it still works very well.  And make it available to these people.  As it is, they can't go out on Sunday  So please consider looking ahead  at the collateral damage this bike  park can cause.  The other thing, the beer garden.  I don't think you need a beer garden  where you have a large number of kids  going to and from school.  I really don't.  I wish you would consider these six,  please.  Thank you.  Dave Donnan followed by Steven Hazel.  Thank you.  I think we have a lot of  I think we have a lot of issues with the  card.  Recently last year they deeded over  Wildwood Park to the card association,  whatever, the district.  And what we did last year is we  changed the name of Wildwood Park to  Veterans Memorial Park.  That area of town, because of the fire  department and their designation for  9-11, the Elks Lodge, and East Avenue !  With the banners.  We thought it was appropriate,  the board decided unanimously  to change the name of Wildwood Park  to Veterans Memorial Park.  Two of the most recent issues  that we just brought up,  we made a deal with  Veterans VFW  to put in,  there's two ways to get rid of  an American flag.  To retire it, one was burning,  one was to bury it.  We have now dedicated a space,  at the park, to bury the  American flag in  memoriam. Also what we have decided  to do, and this has to  do with,  if you remember Rosie the Riveter,  Rosie the Riveter  was years ago in  World War II, women came  and in the  effect of  working for the war effort,  women were  designated to,  they helped in the war effort,  and so we have now  dedicated a part,  I want to recognize  Casey Reynolds' grandmother,  who just, I think next week,  is going to turn 100 years old.  She was an original  Rosie the Riveter.  We are dedicating  one portion  of Veterans Memorial Park  to have a rose garden  dedicated to Rosie the Riveter.  They used to call the women  Rosebuds, and they called  the men Rivets.  So I just want to  thank the city  for transferring over,  and the one thing that I asked,  if the city would recognize  since we've changed the name of  Wildwood Park to Veterans  Memorial, the start of  where the roundabout is  goes up to Five  Mile, if they would consider  changing the name of Wildwood  Avenue to Veterans Memorial  Way. Thank you.  Thank you.  Steven Hazel followed by  Robin McCollum.  Hi, my name is Steven Hazel,  aka God.  Am I not who or what you expected?  I live at Jarvis Gardens  and I live at  the one in Notre Dame Boulevard.  It's a long way, and I noticed  you took out the outlet.  I usually charge my  chair there. I'd like a full investigation  why you removed that, because your  chaplain, Tony Stover, just spoke.  This isn't citizen friendly.  You're taking out my only outlet.  So I find it ironic that that happened.  Would you like a billion dollars?  I can arrange it, but you'd have  to split half with your county  But I need your help. I noticed even,  I know it's  Redding, it's $5 million in a hole.  They have the same problem. They have the lowest  tax rate at 7.25. They're going to bump up  to 8.25 and make up for that. That's what you did.  How about dropping it down to 3%?  Actually, statewide,  you can do that.  All you've got to do is look at  May 14.  This is a 60-minute piece  of the Mormon church, how he's waiting  2023, checking out 60 minutes.  How he's, that's over $300 billion  for the second coming church.  I'm going to be Jesus Christ.  If I'm God, my son would be Jesus, right?  And also the great author of the Ten Commandments,  which is both true.  Here's my Carpenter Junior car.  I got a local 405. I'm 45 years old.  It was a $45 million deal.  It was that 18th floor  of the city of San Jose.  Also, I'm the  author of the Ten Commandments.  And that means...  Mr. Hazel, you're off topic. This needs to be on the city of Chico.  We're getting you the money, because what happens  is he's waiting for the second coming.  Well, Jesus started dead and gone  a second time. He was  killed since the Jews...  Remember, today was Monday. If you see, well,  remember, as the Bible, whatever it says,  a killer first born  and kill all Jews, right? Well, couldn't he  have been one of them during World War II?  He mentioned the river. It's all about World War II.  What he did, he was found  in Germany, and he was  born as a German Jew in 1929,  five years after  Satan appeared, which is George H. W. Bush,  which is the 41st president.  Okay, this is your first warning. You're off topic.  This is going to have to do with the city of Chico.  You're disrupting the public media.  Okay, well, I'll get it on topic.  I'm talking about getting you the money, because  what happens is...  So, if I say I'm God,  okay, and he has that much money  for the second coming, the richest person  in Utah is not donating.  The more mature is practicing in this town.  So,  what I'm saying is, that's money  that's going to be spent on the  And, you know, it's the greatest pyramid scheme ever,  because if he's already dead and gone the second time,  and they're still collecting, like he's still coming,  well, isn't that total fraud?  Which it is.  So, what about...  Um...  Um...  I'll just leave it at that.  I'll come at later, because I wouldn't be  kicked out of me for no reason whatsoever.  All right, that's time. Thank you.  Okay, our next speaker is Robin McCollum,  and he's going to be our  Good evening,  councillors.  Um...  I retired as Butte County's flood control  superintendent in 2004.  In 97, January 1st,  97, I observed the water  six inches from going over  the levee at  the Big Chico Dam.  And, uh,  about a year and a half ago, I had an epiphany.  I went out there and looked at all the  vegetation in the channel, all the  sedimentation, vegetation  exploiting that.  And I knew we had a serious problem,  because we had come so close to overflowing  before, and, uh,  had, uh, graded  substantially since then.  Uh, well,  right after that, I discovered that the city and county  were in disagreement  who was responsible.  And I'm glad that that was finally resolved.  Um...  I took some digging through a lot of documents  by, uh,  city manager Sorensen,  and, uh,  one of the senior engineers here.  I want to thank them for the work that they did.  And, uh, I want to  thank Director Pack  for finally embracing  what is needed,  and thoroughly.  Almost every point that I was concerned about  has been addressed by him.  Uh, there's a big problem with the financing,  and so, uh,  I want to, I hope that the whole community  and the city government,  wherever they can,  can help however they can  with, uh, securing those funds  and anything they can do to support that project,  because it is, uh,  of so much great importance.  The cost of failure there  far exceeds the cost of the work.  And so we should proceed with that.  There are, uh,  improvements that could be made  that would facilitate maintenance going forward.  I'd like to have an opportunity  working with Director Pack  in the future to include  some of those at the beginning of the project  where it would be most effective.  Um,  well, and otherwise, you know, I guess  my time is nearly up, and  I, I  just want to second the  point that we do need to expedite  this as much as we can.  So any political outreach we can do,  to get help from, uh,  Congress,  state legislature, et cetera,  uh, let's get on it and do it together  with the city and the county together on this.  Okay. Thank you all.  Thank you. Steve Depp is  our last speaker on public comments.  I would just like to, uh, piggyback  on Mr. McCullen's, uh, comments there  about working with the state legislature,  uh, for these issues.  Um, based on what's happened  in the Palisades and Southern California,  et cetera, don't need to berate  that, but, uh, it seems that our  governor is in the mood to, uh,  cut through some red tape, cut CEQA,  cut other issues,  and based on the report that I heard from  Mr. Packer, uh, Posh,  uh, Pack earlier,  uh, I think that report should be,  uh, condensed, put together,  uh, a letter sent to  our governor, uh,  asking to waive all the necessary  permitting, et cetera,  et cetera, CEQA,  and, uh, put this on his desk,  and not be in a position  like the, uh,  city councils and boards and mayors  in Southern California  that didn't take action on issues  that put the community at risk.  So, we have a tremendous risk,  we know the risk, it's been quantified,  and we have  multiple government agencies  standing in our way. So,  Thank you.  He's asking them to work with us. Let's just send it right  to the governor.  Can you condense that? Put it in a nice form?  And say, this is on your,  this is on your desk now, Gavin,  and take it from there.  Why, why battle  for five to seven years  when we flood out 15,000 parcels  in Chico?  You know, I think he's in the mood to waive some  restrictions. I think he'd like to take  some, some credit here in the  North State for doing some things right.  Um, but that wasn't the  reason I put in my speaker card, but I was  so taken with what Mr. Josh  put together that I just couldn't help myself.  Um,  I'm just a  simple guy. Every now and then I have a simple idea.  But, um,  just heard on the news,  Redding was applying for a half million dollar  fire prevention grant  with the California Department of  Forestry, CDF,  and I'm not sure if we've applied for that same  grant or taken action on that,  but, um, it would  sure be nice to,  um, once again, waive  some environmental issues and  I love native plants and everything, but  boy, I hope I survive longer  than they do. And, um,  Bidwell Park is, is  an issue. And if we're  not looking at that, we're gonna be  just like Palisades or  whatever Southern California cities  with, um,  we did real great and we  just watched it burn.  So, I think we need to get on  these things and take care  of it. And if there's rules and regulations,  let's pay the fines instead  of standing back and,  you know, waiting.  Thank you.  Thank you. That is it.  Alright, thank you. Are we all doing good?  Can we power through one more  before we take a break? Okay, good.  Uh, consideration of com- uh,  commission appointments. Miss Presson.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  Um, it's an honor to bring  forward the final process of the  biennial recruitment that occurred last fall.  It's done every two years  and my office is responsible for that.  Uh, you were  provided at the January 7th meeting  all of the commission applications.  We had several citizens  thankfully who applied and were  willing to serve wherever you felt they're-  they were needed. They did rank  them in the order of preference.  We provided you with a nomination form  and those were all turned in and we've compiled  them. They're included in the staff report.  So, um,  while the nominations  are made, it still requires that  action to approve the list as provided  would require a motion and  that would be a separate motion.  And then the Council, after you take action on  that, um, after discussion  and after the speakers, then we would ask  that you, using a balloting  process, would then  select two members to serve on the airport commission  and then to fill a two-year vacancy  on the Climate Action Commission.  So, if you have any questions,  I'm happy to answer them or we can  roll into the speakers.  Any questions?  Did you have a question?  Alright. I had one quick question  for clarification. Do we vote on  each nomination or is  it as a whole to approve all of them?  It's as a whole. That's the list because  the policy right now indicates  that the incoming Council members who are newly  elected select members  to serve on the Arts Commission,  Bidwell Park and Playground, as well as  the City Planning Commission and then  the Climate Action Commission. So we take it  in its totality unless you want to do it  and make any changes.  The Council can choose to do that.  I don't need to complicate it. Thank you.  Okay. Thank you.  Alright. Do we have any speakers?  We have one. Steven Hazel.  Alright. Steven, this is on the Council in consideration of the Commission of Wages.  Yeah, I understand. You're ready to jump on.  See, the whole thing is...  I was just reminding you what we were talking about.  No, no. See, the thing is, I know you want to...  I don't know. Maybe you got my speech already made.  You're like the other mayor.  We saw you pick mayor. That was ridiculous.  We know it was a 4-3. Boy, it was always ridiculous.  And the thing is, you would have clapped  after that. You said, no clapping.  The other guy said, no clapping whatsoever.  And you know what? You clapped. And I was offended  because I'm I. I have no party.  And the other side probably was upset too. I'm making a point  where you make  certain absolute, but it's okay  when you're elected mayor  and you go, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, the other  people didn't like it. I'm not of  no party. I'm God. I'm I.  I'm pure I. American independent  is a party. Now, the way you picked stuff  too, it was totally disingenuous  when Overbeak not made it  Winslow because he knew. That was so funny.  The way you're doing it. Okay, you're off topic.  This is your first warning. You're disrupting a public  meeting, Mr. Hales. No, I'm not disrupting. I'm making a point.  That's your first warning. I'm making a point how you  do, how you're electing people.  That's exactly what I'm doing. It's directly on topic.  You might not like it because it's directly  right at you. Stop being disrespectful.  I'm a citizen here. You're trying  to cut me off. You got FBI and your  own people. Don't let Steve in. Don't  see the top. Okay, I'm talking about climate, the climate action.  Okay, if Russia and China is here in  there's two seats in Mecca. Hit  Mecca, destroy it. Destroy it. It's a  weapon against the world. Russia, China,  cheat. Hit Mecca. Mr. Hales, your comments  are outside the subject matter. Destroy Mecca.  Destroy Mecca right now.  All right, thank you.  Yeah, what's going on in the Tesla?  All right, was that our only speaker?  Yes. Okay.  I will  I will Is that cheating? I will. It's a weapon. It's like the thing on the Firestar.  Yeah, three to four.  I will  All right. I'll consider a motion to accept  the  or a conversation if anybody would like to talk about it.  Otherwise I'll take a motion.  Move to approve.  I'll second that.  All right. We have a motion to approve.  I will call the motion and a  second.  Okay.  And that was, let me just,  council member Winslow made the  second, correct?  Yes.  Mr. Winslow.  This is the motion to approve  the nomination form submitted by  all of the four incoming council  members.  Council member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council member Hawley.  Yes.  Council member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice mayor Bennett.  Yes.  And mayor Reynolds.  I didn't want to get ahead of the  council so I had several ballots  made in case you had any changes.  But staff will be passing out both  a ballot for the airport commission  and it lists the two  remaining applicants that can be  considered for it since you've  already selected some who had a  preference of being on a different  commission.  So what you have before you are  the remaining applicants who can  be considered to fill two vacancy  two positions on the airport  commission for a term of four  years and then we have one  vacancy for the climate action  commission and that will be for a  two-year term.  So when you get those if you could write your name on the bottom of them and  then we'll wait to fill out both of  those and then we'll turn them in and  we'll tally it and it will take just a  couple of minutes.  It requires in order to be appointed to  a city of Chico border commission it  requires a majority vote of four or  more votes.  So sometimes it does take a couple of  rounds to narrow that down.  thank you.  can I ask a question?  yes.  so when we had the commission  members present martin  nichols who is currently on the  airport commission presented I  thought he wanted to stay on but  he's not on the ballot.  no.  his first preference was the planning  commission or no excuse me planning  commission or the bidwell park and  playground commission.  he was selected for bidwell park and  playground and so therefore I removed  him off the airport commission.  got it.  thank you.  probably too late but I probably should  have seen if we were allowed to do any  discussion before doing our nomination.  absolutely it's up to council if you  want to discuss the remaining  candidates or.  I will hold out our  ballots.  I will note that the climate  action commission seat is filling  the vacancy that I left behind by  getting elected and not fulfilling all  four years of that climate action  commission term.  So I suppose I can say who I am  voting for but for that seat voting  that we should reappoint chair brian  kress who has served on the climate  action commission and done a good job  of communicating with our commissioners  and council on behalf of the  commission.  that was my nomination she was  my nomination on the council and I  also voted for brian kress because I  didn't know him until he came and did a  presentation to our growth ad hoc  committee and he is phenomenal he knows  the stuff about calculating emissions  and very good communicator too I would  say.  I agree.  I would also like to voice my support  for brian kress I think he has done a  really good job about bringing people  together.  Sometimes you have to put a motion in  put a motion aside and try to focus on  where we can come together and  bipartisan support I think we really  need to continue that tradition.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  it will take a quick second to  tally those up.  I don't have my do do do do do do  I know the jeopardy song.  great nominations everybody.  I think they were good.  very lucky.  very lucky.  very lucky.  very lucky.  very lucky.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The original slide when we first  started looking at the  feasibility of creating our own  CCA locally and this was back in  17-18 era and we looked at the  benefits of course choice local  control at that time we were  advertising a rate savings of  about 2% which equated to  aggregately about $5 million in  savings to the region.  That was the biggest component.  2% on a bill is great.  It's cheaper than what we're  currently paying with investor  owned utility.  But really maintaining that  of economic impact to the region  versus being funneled out to an  investor owned utility to pay  shareholders every year made a  lot of sense. The economic  development of keeping that money  here made a lot of sense at the  time. Back then we wanted to be  more competitive with some of  our neighboring agencies that  have their own public utilities  to the south of us, cedar  roseville, biggs and north of us  city of reading has electric  utility. In that sense when a  company is looking at expanding  or coming to a new area and  talking to those folks they are  able to offer incentives and  discounts on energy where we are  not. If we were at our own cca  we could be more competitive.  That was a big component for us  back then as well. We all know  investor owned utility costs will  past. The risks back then we will  see a slight reduction in utility  user tax. A little foreshadowing  here also the risk noted back  then was the initial startup costs  for launching our own cca. Here is  a quick timeline. We started  these efforts in 2016-2017 era  with a feasibility study that  looked like it would be  competitive and viable. In  November 2019 council authorized  the implementation of the cca and  approved the joint investment  agreement with the county and  city of orville. As you can see  this timeline takes us to 2024.  The next few slides will focus  on 2020 and 2021 and the impact  that the pandemic had on our  startup efforts. We established  butte choice energy in 2019. It  was led by myself and brian ring  at the time worked for the county  and now he is the orville city  manager. It was put in place by  all agencies, orville, the county  and ourselves in 2019. In 2020  we hit the road and we are  city to get the ground running and  worked quickly to launch butte  choice energy. All of us had  brian and I had day jobs and  were by no means energy experts  and we found quickly the energy  industry is super complex and  very complicated. When you start  these new ccas you have to rely  on consultants to get started  until you can staff it and have  staffing professionals with energy  experience that can operate it.  We quickly issued rfps and secure  data management contractor, call  center contractor, marketing  contractor and of course legal  support. When you launch a new  cca you have to navigate the  california public utilities  commission and the independent  grid operator cal iso. Very  complex and takes a full legal  team to do that. We also started  recruitment for a ceo and narrowed  it down to two highly qualified  faced challenges right away with  a banking services rfp. We didn'  t have any respondents. That was  an early 2020 as the pandemic  was starting to ramp up and it  was a little uneasy that we didn'  t get any respondents for  financing the startup of butte  choice energy. As you will see in  further slides it'  s essential to procure  financing. You have to procure  tens of millions of dollars and  neither of the member agencies at  the time had that type of cash  laying around so of course as  most ccas do you finance it and  after you start to run for a  couple of years and build up  operating reserves you'  re able to pay that off. It'  s essential to have competitive  financing from the get go. Later  in 2020 the pandemic hit and  and that caused a lot of market  instability and price volatility.  The credit markets even tightened  further in financing for a  startup cca became nearly  unavailable. Ccas depend heavily  on financing especially from the  startup component or startup  space. Credit conditions and  market conditions worsened as we  moved further through 2021 and  credit availability dried up further  and really started to cause us to  put the brakes on. There'  s other two components  too that really changed market  conditions. There'  s an item called the power  charge and difference adjustment  pcia. What that is the investor  owned utility in our case it'  s pg and e argued to the cpuc  that they'  ve invested in long term energy  contracts for the customers and  they had to charge a pcia cost  that essentially quintupled in  2021 versus when we started to  originally look at this in 2018.  It rose dramatically. The other  component that caused changing  market conditions was ra resource  adequacy. That was a component  energy was and not only do you  have to procure your energy load  but you also have to procure ra  which is basically enough energy  to meet your peak load and then  some. It'  s like an insurance policy to  make sure you meet a certain  percentage above your peak load  and then some in case of a natural  disaster or a natural scenario  like a heat wave or something like  of the investor owned utility so  it came at a very high price.  Increased prices in pcaa charges  and resource adequacy charges  really shaped and shifted market  conditions that made it become  rather unfavorable.  So as launch scenario is  worsened, market conditions  worsened the board postponed our  launch from late 2021 to late  We had to get the board approved  decertifying our implementation  plan with the cpuc. Startup any  load serving entity has to develop  an implementation plan get it  turned in and approved by the cpuc  a year in advance before you start  servicing that load. Basically  that'  s a map kind of a guiding  document on how you plan to  service the load and make sure all  the conduit and everything is in  place for you to do so. We  decertified our plan and removed it from the cpuc which took quite a bit of effort.  At that time too, we had to  make sure that we had a !  We did explore some alternatives  we had discussions with some  neighboring cca's about joining an  existing one. It made sense back  then even initially when we first  started looking at the feasibility  but with respect to the butte  choice energy board and the member  agencies and I think specifically  some of the county supervisors there  is a big intent to keep it local  and the answer was now we really want to keep this local and have full local control.  Looking at joining an existing cca  wasn'  t an option at that point.  Here we are  last year  we started to really think about  as staff and communication with  Brian ring from  Oroville what are we going to do?  We have been in a holding pattern for five years  market conditions haven' t approved  they are still unfavorable  and do we  continue to just monitor market conditions  or do we look at the  We started to look at  alternatives and we started to think about  maybe it makes sense to look at an  existing cca that' s up and operational.  Ironically pioneer energy who is  a neighboring cca their executive group  reached out in early 2024 and talked  to us about some of their expansion  efforts and objectives and proposed  expanding to butte choice energy  agency members.  That' s when the conversation started.  Pioneer energy was established in 2018  as strong reserves commitment to  excellent customer service and in  2024 offered a 10% savings  for their customer base compared to  pg&e.  With that item we' re going to land on  staff' s recommendation  that city council adopt the following resolution  to terminate butte choice energy  joint powers agreement with butte county  city of Oroville and ourselves.  That will ultimately dissolve butte choice energy.  Do we have any questions  from council?  Mr. Wenzel.  The reason they have some of those costs  I think the savings are related to  local power projects but those savings  are committed to the whole cca so we  would have the same rates they' re  seeing in placer county and elsewhere?  No, some of the customers that  are in those particular I think they  get some of their hydro from placer  county that are in that irrigation  district have a higher savings rate  but on average throughout their  service territory they observe those  power plant.  We did that little feasibility  study did we come up with an estimate  for exactly what we would look at  saving here?  Lisa from pioneer is here it  might be a little more appropriate  to talk about that in the next item  but the feasibility study showed it  was favorable and we' re looking at  as you' ll see in the next presentation  we' re looking at a launch date of 2027.  We' re looking at a year and a half  and then we' re going to have to  get that approved by the cpuc and it  takes a year and you have to turn it  in a year advance before you service  the load and then the launch for that  feasibility study showed 2027 is the  most opportune time that will give  pioneer ample time to start to procure  energy for us. It' s hard to predict  into 2027 but so far it looks  absolutely feasible and we will  realize similar savings between 4 or  5 maybe close to 10 percent depending  on the time.  just to fill in where we' re at  I think our city manager told us  butte county authorized the same  resolution this morning and other  jurisdictions that already did it so  we' re all on this path together.  correct.  I think everybody saw the  insolvency happening. Anybody else?  do we have any speakers on this item?  all right. I will consider a motion.  move to approve the staff recommendation.  I will second that with the comment.  Council member  guftson you did an  outstanding  job  of  putting  this  together  making  the  complicated  simple  even  for  us  Council  members  so  I  appreciate  that  and  it  was  not  lost  on  me  and  probably  not  my  other  colleagues  the  acronym  investor  own  utility  is  i  o  u  so  that  was  somewhat  amusing  as  well.  Council  member Goldstein  Council  Goldstein !  Council  Member  Member  Goldstein  yes.  council member winslow?  yes.  vice mayor bennett?  yes.  mayor reynolds?  aye.  carry 7-0.  5.3 consideration of  ordinance to join pioneer  energy cca.  thank you.  we will get right to this.  this next item is to join  existing cca pioneer community  energy.  community energy and the  community energy that is  neighbors to us to the south.  quick overview.  we will talk about who pioneer  community energy is and the  benefits of joining as an  agency member.  how our customers are billed  which is extremely important.  the current rate products  available and land on our  recommendation.  here is pioneer service  territory.  you can see they serve nevada  city, grass valley, colfax,  placer county, el dorado  county, placerville, loomis,  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem and proven track record.  podem !  podem ! which is about $200 annually for a residential household.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  and they get to make $255 on  energy costs. Again that money  stays in the local economy  versus being funneled out to an  investor-owned utility to pay  shareholders in that investor  owned utility. That'  s a huge benefit to  keep those dollars locally.  And then of course local control  is important folks get to  choose the kind of energy  portfolio if you will you will  see in a few later slides and  they also get to choose if they  want to be with pioneer or stick  with pg&e. They'  re able to make that  choice and there'  s several options or  several points off ramps if you  will in this process for them to  choose to stay with pg&e if  folks feel they'  ll be better  served with pg&e. But as a  member agency there'  s no  weighted voting one agency one  vote so it'  s pretty  equitable and we'  ll have a seat at the  table. Regulatory advocacy  pioneer actively  advocates for the  actively represents member  agencies and legislative and  regulatory matters advocating  for customers interest with the  cpuc that'  s extremely  important. They support local  jobs and businesses pioneer  prioritizes local power  contracts as you see in a few  more slides they have a lot of  community engagement they formed  a community advisory committee  which we could take part in to  represent our own constituents  that helps develop good programs  like solar and battery leases  people in the marketplace for  energy decisions to help educate  users on which energy portfolio  they'  d like to choose.  And then out of that community  or excuse me the community  advisory committee member  agencies have tailored programs  that fit their constituents if  you will even more like led  retrofits hvac tune up rebates  was one of them and then  demand side management rewards is  also kind of a tailored project  for a specific jurisdiction.  I think we'  re pretty  similar to pioneer they serve  inland communities with similar  priorities customer savings  community and reinvestment  exceptional customer service  competitive renewable options and  economic development and then  they also strive to create  generation projects within their  service territory and form local  power purchase agreements and so  those are a few listed there  they have a $37 million contract  with el dorado irrigation  district for hydro a $10 million  hydro contract with placer county  water agency $1.2 million  contract with seer pacific for  biomass they have partnered with  grass valley for biomass rfp and  they are also partnered with  western placer waste management  on biomass efforts there too.  Again it aligns well with our  region too regarding local  energy projects whether it'  s wind  or solar biomass anything that  makes sense in economic sense  locally they strive to assist  with those projects and procure  on the local level.  Joining pioneer energy offers a  unique opportunity for the city  of chico to provide residents and  businesses with reliable cost  effective and sustainable energy  we could bypass the challenges  as you heard in the previous  item in financial risk of  starting a stand alone cca take  advantage of regional  collaboration and alignment with  have recently passed ordinances  or introduced ordinances to join  pioneer and again if approved  pioneer plans to submit an  implementation plan by march of  2025 and we will be scheduled  for an october 2027 launch we  have some time but it happens  pretty quickly and they need to  work with the cpuc and cal iso to  get our system in place for them  to serve our territory. This is  a big issue we had some of  these items were covered in  several other slides but again  local control customer service  energy future customers are able  to decide what type of renewable  portfolio they want programs  stability choice community and  of course the big one a lower  utility bill which we could all  appreciate and want. This is  also important I'  ve gotten this  question a few times what will  our bill look like are we going  to get two separate bills and  the answer is no. Again pioneer  they have a lot of energy and  it'  s distributed through  pg&e poles and wires they still  own and maintain that infrastructure  and also still provide the billing  service you'  re still going to  get one bill from pg&e the only  exception is it will have  generation and delivery line item  out there will be another line  item for generation and then  distribution or delivery as pg&e  calls it is another line item on  the bill so same bill just two  different things.  thank you.  this is a good slide to we'  getting near the end this is  their rate products currently you  can see what we'  ve done  here is taking a handful of  kilowatt hours and combine them  to get those rate prices the  first one on the right is pg&e  current base rate or current  rate it'  s a 30%  renewable and the cost is $278  the one on the far left is  $675 and the one on the left is  $265 and the one on the right is  $265 and they also have a green  100 rate which means it'  s 100%  renewable and that cost is still  slightly lower than the existing  pg&e rate at $272 those are the  two rate options currently for  pioneer community energy.  again we talked about this their  growth initiative these are our  neighboring agencies butte county  Nevada county sutter county  tuolumne county live oak city of  yuba city sonora county are all  in the process of introducing  ordinances to join pioneer  community energy.  again quick timeline we'  re introducing the ordinance  now we'  ll finalize the implementation  plan and get it turned into the  cpuc by march and then we'  re going to go live october of  2027.  we made it through my  recommendation is that council  introduce the following ordinance  authorizing implementation of  community choice aggregation  program with pioneer community  energy and amending chapter 15.60  of the chico municipal code.  I can answer any questions or  bring up lisa delavi if there'  s any really hard technical  questions she might be the one to  ask.  greg?  any other potential partners and  why did you pick pioneer?  great question council member  ben overbeck.  we did we'  ve been in active  discussions with another  neighboring cca valley clean  energy who serves city of davis  yellow county winters and  dixon I believe.  their ceo mitch sears is a  fantastic guy he helped brian and  the other partners in the  how to navigate and which vendors  to partner with and which vendors  not to.  he was a big help.  I'  ve had several  subsequent discussions with mitch  and it'  s not one of their objectives at  the moment to expand.  I had a recent conversation with  them last week and he was excited  that we'  re nearing this process with  pioneer.  pioneer is a fantastic organization  we can'  t beat their rates.  we'  re going to be in great hands  with pioneer.  that'  s comforting to hear.  one more.  if pioneer doesn'  t have investors like pg&e  how are they funded and do they  have pockets deep enough to  withstand economic shock?  great question again pioneer is  non-profit so they don'  t have investors to pay dividends  to that money goes back into the  local economy to build local  generation projects to go back  economy to fund community service  programs like rebates and retrofits  and things of that nature.  they'  ve been operating since 2018  and they have robust financials  and have built up a good size  capital and operating reserve to  procure energy and withstand  some of those market changes  that as a start-up cca we would  not have been insulated to but  they have enough operating  reserves to insulate themselves  to that and provide that rate  savings moving forward.  question was what I meant to  ask where did the capital come  from to create the entity?  did it come from the  municipalities that were part of  this?  fantastic robust financials now  but when they started in 2018 I'  m not sure if you financed that  because you really have to  procure vast amounts of energy  to get the capital out of the  city and we'  re talking tens of millions of  dollars.  member agencies feel free to  come up.  mayor and council.  we started placer county started  us we were first with placer  county and so they helped us get  started we were paying placer  county back for the start-ups  but we saved our customers  $108 million since 2018 our  board of directors is committed  to rate payer savings.  placer county financed it with  municipal bonds or because they  own dams?  they were able to help finance  the cca to get us started I'  m not sure exactly how they  funded it but they did and we  were paying that off.  one thing and maybe it'  s not a  question for now but I wonder if  issuing bonds for new power  generation infrastructure is  something you would do in  partnership with a member agency?  typically we don'  t fund  infrastructure we basically work  with partners like the elder auto  irrigation district on contracts  and what my western placer  municipal management association  we work with contracts and  partnerships that way.  less infrastructure no  infrastructure.  thank you.  great.  I have one question.  hopefully small question.  did I hear correctly the starting  date for us to go live with  pioneer would be october 2027  can you recap why it takes so  long?  we have to issue draft and  issue an implementation plan to  the cpuc and you have to do that  a year in advance before you  initiate to start to service the  load.  that takes a year and takes some  time to approve.  the feasibility study that was  would have a year with the  implementation plan which would  put us to 2026 but due to likely  market conditions and forecasting  that they performed they wanted  to get us a little into 2027 and  just past the high cost period of  summer months when hvac and  everything is through the roof  and do we experience heat waves  or anything like that.  they wanted to get us through  that potential hot summer month  and we have to go live with the !  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  council member holley.  I have a particular interest  and I think it was one of the  first slides about local power  purchasing opportunities.  I think it might have been  el dorado that had a program  both biomass and local power  purchase agreements.  I know that october 2027 is when  the project would take into  effect but I'  m curious based off of the  example of these projects how  long would it take to maybe have  accrued enough finances to be  able to kick start one of these  local power purchase agreements  and this might be a better  question for the partner agency.  I could take a quick stab at  it feel free to come up as lisa  mentioned it sounds like pioneer  doesn'  t necessarily want to own the  infrastructure that generates the  power but they will partner with  entities whether it'  s private or municipal or  public in their particular service  customer base.  But these are generators in their  service territory and I think  especially for biomass that road  map is there with their existing  contract with seer pacific  industries and their partnership  with grass valley for their rfp  and western placer waste management  so something like that the road  map is there for us to maybe  consider that in the future.  I think what pioneer would  probably want to do I don'  t want to speak for you lisa  feel free to come up but I think  probably want to get started  servicing our load first and then  they already have operating  reserves for existing customer  base but maybe start to build up  some reserves too from ours  because that'  s going to be a pretty  significant procurement process  for all of their expansion efforts  and then once that starts to flow  and revenue comes in and they'  re going to be  looking at local generation projects  in our service area would probably  take place.  thanks eric.  we'  re always looking at local power  purchase agreements.  right now orville approached us  on a biomass plant there brian  wong who you might be familiar  with we'  re working with him but we  are even though you'  re not a part of our  service territory yet we'  re very interested in partnering  we'  purchase agreement and if you  have opportunities feel free to  email us or give us a call.  give me a call directly.  we also offer rfps on power  purchase agreement so there'  s that opportunity as well but  we'  re always looking for  opportunities to partner and  obviously we want to get through  our purchase power procurement  that we'  re doing once we get everything  opportunities we'  re definitely interested in  looking at those.  i have one quick question.  once butte county joins you is  that the only expansion area you'  re going right now and are you  growing in other areas as you  continue to grow and take on more  and more does the math change for  the better or the worse for the  customer from that 5 to 10% as  you take on more would it be less  or as you take on more does that give you more buying power and it could be higher?  did that make sense?  yes.  thank you.  thank you.  re working with 13  jurisdictions now what wasn'  t on the map was glen county or  linden willows so we are working  actually there'  s a meeting tonight in willows  that we divide and conquered but we  are growing and definitely it helps  us with our purchasing power and our  financing and it just helps in so  many ways with advocacy  legislatively being able to procure  more power at better rates and we'  ve got a proven track record with  sns and we'  the cnp global a minus rating plus  we have a plus with better business  bureau so it does help that we'  re growing and of course the impact  assessment study really looked at  okay it'  s got to be a win-win for both  parties because our board has made it  clear we'  re not going to subsidize new members  coming in it'  s not a win-win so it'  s got to be a win-win and definitely  have rate payer savings in mind.  okay great thank you.  thanks.  do we have any speakers?  i do have a quick question madam  I have to ask this question if  things do go bad the process to  get out of this for us in the city  maybe that'  s a city attorney  question but maybe you can answer that  eric if for some reason saying they  would not deliver on their promises  but let'  s say it does go bad what are our  options as a city?  individual users could go back to  pg&e.  pg&e is still there and we could  go back to pg&e from a generation  perspective.  as far as if we wanted to  as a community form a new cca  like things change for some reason  that'  s a better idea.  we would have to divorce  ourselves from this cca and then  join a different cca or form a  different new cca.  but individually we would have the  power to do that as a member it'  s not like we would need a vote.  we would have the power.  even the union of the united states.  but I don'  t think we would have the as it  was having been a member of  northern california power agency  that provides the power to the  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively But we could, you're saying we could leave through different meetings and get out of that?  effectively  effectively  one. James Hutchinson.  We're looking at a very  unbalanced equation, and what's missing in  this equation is PG&E is a  partner in this. No matter how you look  at it, they are a partner.  If their rates are problems  that you've seen PG&E,  you've watched the recent commercials for  PG&E, I hope that's  so. I hope your improvements  in your system are  so. You're hoping that's  so. You're hoping those prices  do not go up. The providers  out there, if they  run into opposition,  you've got these people.  These people have a solar program, too,  and it's connected with Tesla.  Tesla might be a big  winner in this, in the infrastructure.  We don't know if it  fails or another one fails.  Go back to  what happened  here in our own city.  John  Bidwell would  grow a crop,  and this would be the supply.  He'd count on the money coming in for this  because a buyer said, I will pay you this much.  Turns out his competition  also had great  crops, and they could sell it for  less.  The result is the company  that Bidwell was going to sell  for went under, and this happened  to him. This happens in farming all the time.  You've  got PG&E providing  your infrastructure, and  you've got to count on them.  You know,  you sit there and you listen  to this commercial that says, I hope that's  so. I hope that's  so. But you're counting  on them doing it right. They didn't do  right with the power lines.  Historically, we used to have  gridlock because an area  between Santa Barbara  and the valley didn't have the power  lines to carry energy from  Southern California to the north  when we were short, or we  to send energy down there.  That was a P&G&E decision.  And guess what?  It cost us those brownouts you heard  about earlier and stuff. That  was part of the problem. The lines  you have out there, when you put the lines  underground, you increase the  cost. You're  going to increase the cost considerably.  And they have to do that now.  Someone's paying for that cost.  You think that's not going on in your PG&E  part of the bill? You've got  two parts of the bill here, and you're only looking at  one part. You're saying, hey, it's great. They can  buy energy for cheap.  But can they provide it for cheap? Always.  And you've got to ask yourself that.  It's not being asked here. PG&E  is a partner in this. If you want  PG&E and a partner, you've seen  what's happened. You've got to think  about it.  Thank you. He was our only speaker.  All right.  I'd like to do the honor of first  thanking Lisa for coming up here,  down here, depending on how you look at it.  And thank Pioneer for including in their  business plan expansion so we  have the opportunity to be liberated  from this chunk of the yoke of  PG&E on our bill.  Like Simone Boulevard right  now in South America.  Also, and kind of to the  points of Mr. Hutchinson there,  there are bigger pictures. There's more than two parts of the bill. There's a few.  Transmission, poles and wires, local  distribution. Valley Clean Energy, which you mentioned  from Yolo County in 2019, they  made an offer on  PG&E's poles and wires within their county.  $300 million is a bid.  The struggle there is to get PG&E to agree on  evaluation, and there's a lot of steps from there on.  I think that  we're looking at this a few years  out to join the CCA and feeling a little impatient  like we wish it could happen now.  And it's great to get the ball rolling. And ultimately,  it's good to keep in mind that  the future, our energy future should be  completely independent of PG&E. And there are  steps that we can take. And one of those would be  forming some kind of entity  that can join the Northern California Power Agency.  I'd say Google that.  So I would like to make the motion to  adopt the ordinance, which is  of the City Council of the City of Chico  authorizing the implementation of a community choice  aggregation program with Pioneer Energy and amending  Chapter 15.60 of the Chico Municipal Code.  I'll second that.  Thank you.  Okay.  We have a motion and a second to introduce  the ordinance. Council Member Goldstein?  Aye. Council Member  Hawley? Yes. Council Member O'Brien?  Yes. Council Member  Van Overbeek? Yes. Council Member  Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor  Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds?  Aye. Carrie 7-0.  Stormwater Master Plan.  Mr. Brendan  Audubon.  Yes. And  Senior Engineer David Keene will be  taking on the presentation.  All right. Good evening,  Council. Vice Mayor Bennett, Mayor Reynolds.  My name is David Keene with the Public Works  Engineering Department, and tonight I will be discussing  the Stormwater Master Plan.  So tonight we'll be talking about  the purpose and background, the objectives,  the analysis performed, some of the outreach  and collaboration, as well as the next steps in the plan.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  planning for build out of the  city as well as requirements  that go directly into the  municipal code.  The previous storm drain master  plan was developed in 1987 with  an addendum in 2001 and that was  to address the then current  general plan.  In 2011 the city adopted the  2030 general plan which included  an action item to update the  storm drain master plan.  Therefore in 2021 we retained We have Harvey Oslick with Wood Rogers here joining us in case there's any technical questions.  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively is the Fair Street Regional Detention Basin.  and what these detention basins do is they prevent flows from causing peak flood events in the rivers.  So when you have a rain event, you can think of the water coming down from the hills and the water landing on the city.  If those both enter the flood, the waterway at the same time, it can cause high peak events.  Therefore, these detention basins or retention or detention hold back the flow so that those flooding events are reduced.  The analysis was largely geographic information system focused.  That's GIS. We utilized the hydraulic model and updated it.  We did watershed delineations and floodplain mapping.  The image on the left there shows the watersheds that were included in the study, Big Chico Creek, Mud Creek, Little Chico Creek, Butte Creek, all flowing into the city limits.  And then as discussed earlier, the capital improvement project that came out of that, project lists that came out of that.  So what is GIS? Just an overview. A lot of people know, but to be clear, this is a snapshot of our GIS system.  You have lines and circles.  The circles represent manholes or other features.  And within each line is the data included from the AS-built drawings.  That's the power of GIS.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  and a decent level of flooding  downtown. For this we do 100  year, 200 year, 2 year and 10  year. 100 year is largely  related to FEMA regulations. 200  year is related to some senate  bills coming out of the state as  well as what bridges are built  to. And then 2 year events  happens every other year. That'  s how local street collectors  are designed. So to the  recommended capital improvement  project list this is an image  showing the capital improvement  projects that are recommended.  Again it'  s lines and circles with  polygons representing detention  basins. You can see in north  chico there'  s a proposed detention  basin for the north chico  specific plan as well as areas  within the bellmuir area and  parts of town as the areas  develop an infill. So  approximately 13% of the study  area was in butte county the  sphere of influence. So right  off the bat we cooperated with  butte county through a cost  sharing agreement so they did  pitch in financially for this  and they'  ve been both financial and  technical partners throughout.  With regard to the  outreach we made the plan  available online of course. We  released a media release and we  did the secret 30 day public  review. As you can see the story  was picked up by a couple local  news agencies including nsbr  where they did a short bit on  it so that was helpful. With a  little more in person outreach  we conducted a technical  workshop and that was for local  engineers and designers and that  was held in person here at city  hall where we went into the  weeds of how the hydraulic model  was created and the impact to  them and the impact on the  podems effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively And then from there, we will update  From there we will update the  development impact fees through  a nexus study and that will go  for fund 309 which is the storm  drainage facility fund which is  the primary source of funding  for storm drainage within the  city. That concludes my  presentation I' m happy to answer  any questions.  thank you.  questions.  any questions from council?  thank you good job.  I guess the army corps of  engineers has a program to  certify levees and there' s  particular concerns about the  levees in mud creek on the north  end of town. Is that something  that the county is going to  I think the county is going to  pursue that.  the county is the local  maintaining agency that is  something they will pursue. Of  course we' re going to be  partners because we' re directly  impacted but as the local  maintaining agency they' re the  ones that will pursue that  accreditation.  do we have any speakers on  this item?  I' m going to ask the !  good evening mayor vice  mayor council members my name  is Katie and I' m the executive  director of the chico builders  association and I' d like to  thank david and the consultants  from wood rogers and we  participated in the technical  workshop and it was very  technical but it was great with  the engineers that were invited  work and the local engineering  community. I want to say we  appreciate being included in  your good work. Tonight as a  part of the stormwater master  plan the technical memorandum  which is located in appendix e  of the master plan provided by  wood rogers outlines the process  for accreditation and  reaccrediting the state plan of  flood control levees that protect  the state from flooding. !  updated as a part of their flood  insurance study update. I' m here  tonight on behalf of the chico  builders association requesting  that council would provide a  directive to staff to work with  the county and state agencies to  get those levees in question  that are outlined in the  technical memo you' ll find it'  s more than mud creek there'  s three other creeks sycamore  creek big chico creek the ones  that david listed all are in  need of accreditation. In doing  so what would happen is if those  levees were to be accredited  this would result in opportunities  for growth areas that we can  grow that chico can build more  housing and we know that chico  is challenged by a lack of land  to develop but if the levees in  question were accredited it  would provide opportunities for  those people to work with the  state agencies that haven'  t been  able to be considered prior  because of the lack of accreditation  of those levees. We would appreciate  that you would give staff a  directive to go ahead and work with  the county and with the state  agencies that are affiliated to  accredit those levees. Thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  anything else from council?  any other  move to approve the staff  recommendation.  I will second that.  all right.  okay.  council member goldstein?  aye.  council member holly?  yes.  council member o'brien?  yes.  council member vannoverbeck?  yes.  council member winslow?  yes.  council member bernard?  yes.  council member martin?  yes.  thank you.  thank you.  tonight before you is an item  regarding the budget timeline for  the fiscal year 25-26 period.  January marks the beginning of  what we affectionately call in the  finance world budget season.  Which culminates in a hopefully  adopted budget before the beginning  of the fiscal year which is july  1st of every year.  The process begins in january.  It'  s quite a feat to put together a  document that'  s over 1300 pages long and has  over 300 funds in it with  different funding sources,  different expenses and  The process starts in january with  internal dialogues, internal  requests, internal meetings with  departments, department heads of  what the desires are and what the  needs are for the next fiscal  year.  Then the budget team puts together  those requests, crunches numbers,  crunches numbers, again crunches  numbers to come up with what we  can afford.  A lot of that is navigating  information that we get along the  way regarding revenues.  For instance, for our sales tax  which in the general fund is our  major funding source, we don'  t get a lot of that information  until much later into the fiscal  year.  The first two quarters for instance  aren'  t available to us until february  and then after that we don'  t get what is analyzed from our  consultant until march.  We do a lot of educated guessing,  conservative guessing along the  way which culminates in the final  budget document.  What we have done the last couple  years and what we are proposing  tonight dependent on what you all  want is the last few years we have  done a workshop on the second  meeting of the regular council  schedule.  It'  s an all day during the day  session where the departments  present their individual requests  and the current status of their  department budgets.  You'  re provided with a five year  projection of the general fund  and where we'  re expected to go.  That second meeting in may allows  us to have two meetings in june  in case there are any additional  requests from councils or any  further information that'  s requested and that gives us  time so by that second meeting in  june we can adopt the budget.  If we do with that timeline it is  for the first week of may for  your perusal and what we did last  year as well that we have done in  previous years is at the finance  committee level we have done a  budget preview with information  we know and projections and that  sort of thing on an additional  meeting where it'  s an opportunity for  community members to come and talk  and have a discussion there.  With that that'  s what we'  have a budget review and we need  to determine dates so we can work  backwards from there and get a plan  going.  all right.  go ahead.  barbara when will the finance  committee get the first peek at  this?  last year we did a budget  preview at the april meeting that  gives us time to like I said we don'  t get a lot of that information  until later in the spring. A lot  of the information comes from the  state when they do their may  revised budget that comes in May.  we do our best to give you all in  the finance committee information  as we get it. Sales tax as we get  it property tax projections  things like that.  thank you. One of the things a  number of us have talked about is  allowing the council to have some  input on the project and we'  are our priorities a little earlier  in the process. Because it feels  like the way it has been done it'  s so far along that trying to  make a change creates a lot of  trauma on your part which we'  d like to avoid. How can we do  that?  I think that what we'  s based on his  conversations with council and  meetings we have here on every  other tuesday generally meetings  and what he perceives as the  priorities of the council. I  believe it to him to.  we do that all year but we  certainly could however you  wanted to construct if you  wanted to construct a special  meeting to go over the current  budget. Capital aside year over  year operations and operation  budgets don' t change  remarkably.  there are some things I have a  concern about vegetation and  bidwell park and fire related to  that and making sure we' re  allocating more money for  the next few years.  re allocating more money for  we did allocate several  hundred thousand dollars for the  next few years.  I would like to know how the  other council members feel but I  think a meeting like that would  be useful so we had a chance we  could come to you with our two  or three concerns priorities and  you could tell us why we'  re wrong.  not why you'  re wrong but I think most of  those discussions certainly you  could express a desire to  increase operational funding here  but then the question becomes  what'  s going down.  we'  re all capable of doing  fourth grade math we get it.  particularly this year we'  re looking at year over year  flat revenues is what we'  re looking at at this point in  time.  however you would like to  proceed.  when we were down in  sacramento last week there'  e several cities that do  strategic planning sessions in  january and february.  we have a number of cities that  if that'  s something the council is  interested in we could do a day  strategic planning session where  we could priority rank those  items.  if that'  s a desire I could have  probably miss presson reach out  to a couple of people that have  taken us through that in the  past or some new ones that we  got some names up while we'  re down there and we could look  at doing that.  I like that idea.  i agree and I don'  t even know that it needs to  be a strategic planning as a  whole facilitated thing so much  as us having a discussion in  advance of what kind of things  we'  d want to see in the budget  because for one we did have this  place for public input where  there'  d be hearings early on and  that kind of just got nixed out  of that.  I don'  t know if it still is in our  budget policy.  it hasn'  t really been amended.  but that has just been  sidelined and it was right after  we passed the sales tax where  suddenly we had a lot of somewhat  discretionary revenue.  last year just to illustrate it  a little bit more we had council  member ronald mcgurn who was  to ask for requests for funding  that happened at this budget  hearing that we had scheduled.  but at that point there'  already a formed budget and so  what the agreement was which i  think was one council member and  just what we ended up saying I  suppose was we needed to  identify where the funding would  come from which on a line item  by line item thing isn'  t really what our position  on that should be.  like if the city manager says  that we have this need we would  go to a department head and ask  the department head to figure  out where to trim off some funds  in order to accommodate that as  opposed to asking him to  identify those funds.  within their budget where to take the money from so i do think that this needs to happen earlier  in the process in order for there to be more relevance what we were stuck with last year was  if you want to fund anything in addition then it needs to come from the campfire victim stress  settlement which is nominally supposed to be dedicated to roads um which we created kind of  an awkward situation i think when it came to funding priorities and uh you know we did end  up funding a lot of those things but uh i don't think that's the way that should go so i do agree  that earlier in the process like next month or we we should be discussing what us as council  members and have the public involved in the process of determining priorities so uh madam  mayor how do you feel about uh adopting um miss martin's proposal but you call a meeting so that  we can have some input earlier on and however you want to structure that and i don't think it needs  to be super formal yeah so how about we since we have a meeting next week um maybe miss presson  you can look out at a couple of options  and bring that back to the next meeting and we can look at some dates okay i'm in cabal to  everybody and we'll talk about it next tuesday okay but other than that wait do we have speakers  on this before we go any further uh no no okay um is there other comments from council members  i was just going to ask miss martin uh do you have a preference i've this will be my fourth one  with the one day uh before the city council meeting and it seemed to work out pretty well  um  but i think you're one of the most important uh pieces of this particular puzzle so do you have a  preference um not necessarily i mean we've done it a couple different ways where we've we've spread  out the um presentations from the departments over a few meetings um so they're in the evening  and then we've done the all-day work session i think that we are kind of um tied to a very  tight timeline i know it sounds like a long time but it's very tight for the budget team  to produce this formal document by the time that we do so um if we can get to that point where the  actual proposed budget is still in that late may timeline that's ideal for us because that's where  we can really get you the information that is that is uh valid and um um something that you can work  with while also giving us time to put stuff together and and effectively effectively effectively  budget and see where the costs  are and see where we need to  the numbers don'  t always work out well the  first time so we have to come  back and see what else we need  to cut or where we have available  funds other places so it'  s a  process that way.  that sounds like a one day to  me.  that'  s just for the final document  as far as how you want to see  it put before you and how over  what time period that'  s up to you all.  thank you.  my comment on that is I think  the one 2 p.m. meeting on a  Tuesday is less friendly to  public input to come in as  opposed to having a split up as  suggested here in three  different meetings but at  regular meetings we know later  Tuesday is a normal time to  show up to government meetings  and I think that keeps it  consistent for the public to  have a role in it.  we have done this on the  weekend have we not done it on  Saturdays before?  not in the recent past but  it has been done.  at some point I remember a  Saturday spending some time  doing just that.  13 and a half hours.  who'  s fault with that?  I think we have general  direction on keeping it on the  one long meeting.  do we need a motion for that? Information, information. And then let's talk about it again on Tuesday when she comes back for the strategic planning, and then let's see if we wanna do maybe like three presenters  effectively  effectively for the final adoption. For the draft one, you're also saying one day  to do the final draft one you  are also saying one day and  maybe on a Saturday?  I would prefer not to do a  Saturday I would rather do a  longer council meeting if we  have to but I will do whatever.  The final draft one I think you  want the public input for the  information ahead of time.  There is three components  we are talking about adding in  an earlier component before the  budget is all set.  Strategic planning in February.  The final adoption is  non-controversial one simple day  whether we do it split up among  three council meetings the draft  but when it is finalized in late  April May or whether we do one  whole day marathon starting at 2  p.m. I think those are  discussions I am more partial to  splitting it up but not a hill to  die on.  Anybody else?  I think the last  budget meeting needs to be a  single day and probably should be  on a Saturday I need to do that  to people but it is probably the  best day to do that that'  s my  recommendation. I am hearing what  Barbara is saying they are under  the gun at that point and the  longer we stretch those things  out the more difficult it is to  put together that budget as we  will want it so I think one  single day we need to knock that  out and do it on a Saturday.  All right.  approval or the department  presentation.  Exactly I' m talking about the  final one day budget hearing.  That' s the final department  presentations and approval but  then we have that should be one  day I agree but then prior to  that we have a meeting where we  provide.  That' s the long part.  If we do that earlier sooner  rather than later and break that up I' m fine with that. I' m just  I think we will have to get that  budget done the last budget  hearing should be a full day and  probably on a Saturday.  I guess the meeting provide the  input should be one just because  you get your head wrapped around  the budget and I think and also I  don'  t think it'  s going to be that long it  should be another an hour or two  it'  s not going to be five or six.  I think we had dinner at  closed session and came back in at  six.  That last one is the easiest one  because we'  ve done the hard work before.  Maybe at the next meeting would you  like to bring back when we talk about  the strategic planning a couple of  ideas on breaking those up versus  doing one long marathon?  We will decide it next Tuesday.  okay?  can we keep powering through?  you guys okay?  all right 5.6 consideration of  administrative services and human  resources and risk management  department organization.  Mr.  sorenson.  thank you mayor and council  the item before you is the concept  of since we have an opening in the  hr risk management director the  recommendation before you is to  eliminate the hr risk management  director and replace it with a deputy  director that would then report to  miss martin and administrative  services department this would return  us back to where the configuration and  the alignment was just a few years ago  and makes a lot of sense because right  now there'  s quite a bit of  duplication in the hr risk management  department and the administration of  effort in payroll processing and labor  negotiations that make a lot of sense  for them to be in administrative  services plus then they gain the  additional support staff that we have  in finance to help with hr and risk  management functions and then also one  of the three items in the recommendation  is to approve a one time 3%  compensation increase for the  administrative services director just  recognizing the fact that we have a  appreciate the fact that she'  s taking on another set of  functions and I thank her for it.  That concludes my report.  do we have any questions  from council members?  it was unclear and I should  have called you today the seven  staff members that are currently with  risk management are they moving over  to administrative services?  functionally they will report  that way physically they'  re not going to change where  their desks are.  will they be retained?  yes.  I wasn'  t clear I read it a couple of  times I still wasn'  t clear.  actually they'  re pretty happy about the  prospect because it will give them  better support.  if they'  re happy we should do it.  that'  s right.  Mr.  wenzel.  my only thought on it I feel  with all the stuff going on under  administrative services and somebody  like barbara leading it we could come  up with a cooler name for the  department I don'  t know what it should be but I  feel like administrative services  is like all you guys are administrative  services.  think on that.  we'  ll work on that.  m open to recommendations.  we now name you queen  barbara.  yeah.  all right do we have any  speakers on this item?  none.  all right I'  ll entertain a motion.  move to approve.  I'  ll second that.  all right first and second.  Ms.  preston.  okay.  council member goldstein.  aye.  council member holly.  yes.  council member o'brien.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member wenzel.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  mayor reynolds.  aye.  carry 7-0.  all right we'  ll do one more and then we'  ll take a quick  break.  council member wenzel requests  tenant protections.  okay.  thank you.  mayor reynolds.  this was agendized back in october  you know and I kind of punted it  off to future meetings because I  was looking at like how to solve  a problem.  problem effectively how to effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively and people, it's really obvious who reports an issue when they're the one living in the house, right?  the house.  Being a college town a majority  renter town we have a lot of  issues here. Somebody came in  describing some of their issues  being a new resident in chico  and finding that when it came to  protection under a lot of the  variety of laws not just  substandard housing that we have  in the state of california  there'  s no where to go. I  find that to be validated by a  lot of other people'  s experience they  don'  t know what to do always  even calling code enforcement  it'  d be nice if everybody  did know to do that but it'  s not  exactly clear. The puzzle I was  trying to find is understanding  that this is a politicized issue  and not everybody agrees to what  degree we should emphasize the  protection for tenants  understanding that enforcement  programs or new protections like  expanding eviction protections  that comes out the landlord see  that as a loss if tenants have  new protections and I don'  know we have the whole attitude  here to adopt new protections  and I think that'  thank you.  thank you.  thank you. but what then can we do to try to alleviate the situation?  podem  podem  podem  podem but what then can we do to try to alleviate the situation? So looking for like the lowest impact ways to try to somehow support this. And some of my research in cities,  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  I found for one that in order to proactively enforce some of these rules they it involves a  rental registry you can't really get around that because you have to know who's who's renting out  housing in order to have any kind of inspections and businesses have to get a business license  but being being a landlord does not come with that kind of responsibility really you can  landlord without having any kind of license whatsoever we don't have a rental registry so  there's no registration so i see the city of fresno and modesto emulated their ordinance to  they have a rental registry with zero cost to it and so i was looking at some models like that that  could be more amenable here they also rather than having like a schedule for trying to inspect all  the rental housing in the area which would come with a large cost and be practically infeasible  they have like a random sampling formula which they actually then kind of caveat in their ordinance  saying that of course there's exemptions  for new construction anything expected by different agency but they they also give themselves the  the flexibility to determine certain areas that they're going to inspect like because they know  that this particular area has a lot of issues with similar complaints and substandard housing  or this landlord in particular does so they don't they don't really sign themselves up for doing for  for doing any kind of inspection program on any schedule and that  works out for them so i think that's a good point.  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  the rental registry would be  useful overall code enforcement  just needs more resources in  general and it'  s hard to  imagine expanding any kind of  program to enforce these without  just looking at that as an issue.  And then three as far as how  these protections like eviction  protections or anti harassment  stuff are enforced it'  s not  from the state department of real  estate if you go on the county  website you can find it says  it will not help you at all and  they recommend you contact the  state of California department of  consumer affairs 1-800 number.  The bare minimum thing I would  ask for here is we look at the  city of Chico's page which exists  on this and revamp it with the  can get the law enforcement on  because I find people don'  t know  they'  re protected a lot of the time  and other resources around. The  bigger ask would be we look further  into a rental registry and request  staff support and looking into the  costs and benefits and options and  what would fit our community better.  what are you asking  us to vote on now?  there'  re two things.  landlord relations and resources to make sure it'  s up to date and has the proper set of resources that can be most  helpful to people. You google tenant landlord chico and you  find that page. The next would be to have staff look further  into rental registry.  thank you. Any other questions from here before we go to  speakers?  Do we have any speakers?  We do.  We have 10.  I think that gives us three minutes of peace.  James Hutchinson followed by Alicia Ake.  If you could both of you, as I call the names, if you can come  up and go to the middle aisle, that would be helpful.  James Hutchinson and Alicia Ake.  Back at you.  I was a member of the Fair Housing  I worked for a fair housing organization that did  essentially this kind of referral help, fair housing  opportunities.  It was a community-based organization that provided this  kind of service to people that needed more information, they  needed help with their rentals, for landlords.  They also conducted a housing survey where they went door to  door on the housing survey.  We had a survey that was done in the area where we knew apartments  to be.  We conducted these surveys mainly trying to go through where there  is managers, certain places where there are not managers, but going  through them and trying to get the information to know what the  tenants thought of what the area was and also what was there, how  many rooms were actually there, what was the state of the appliances,  what kind of appliances were there, new, old, basic things that we  did.  It was right down in the middle of proposition 13, and it was  really a real battle, a political battle going on for  protege Willie Brown that wanted to get himself a name.  We tried to bring outside organizations in that people  really blew off and said, hey, forget it.  I heard him for a while at least.  But that kind of thing, an ombudsman type thing, why not an  ombudsman type?  Most of what we do here, you folks do.  If a problem is brought before you, you call and you talk to the  manager.  You talk to the owner.  You say, hey, we have a problem here.  Can we work this out?  That's what an ombudsman should do, should be able to balance both  sides of what's going on.  Get volunteers in the community.  Get lawyers that are willing to deal with the more extreme cases  occasionally on a pro bono basis.  Most of these things are settled in small claims court.  They don't go to very few landlords are going to take it to a major  court going to appeal the decision.  They'll go with what the small claims court does.  It's not an expensive process that way.  It's not this big show.  That's what I'm suggesting you move for is this kind of thing.  Set up an ombudsman office or set up a community group.  Try to work with the university to bring people in that can give  advice.  Set up something online that is separate from just the city or the  landlord where people fee same.  I'd say give it a try.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Alicia Ake followed by Adam Fideli.  Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council members.  My name is Alicia Ake.  I am the CEO for Sierra North Valley Realtors.  And I want to express my gratitude to the board of directors for  supporting this initiative.  I want to express our concerns regarding the implementation of a  localized rental registry and its potential to negatively impact our  community's housing market.  While we understand the importance of maintaining safe and equitable  housing for renters, a rental registry may inadvertently discourage  investment in local housing, adding unnecessary costs and administrative  burdens on property owners.  These effects could create a ripple that drives costs and !  Drives up costs for both landlords and tenants, reducing housing  affordability in an already tight market.  We believe this policy risks impeding the buying and selling of homes by  introducing additional regulatory complexity which could detour potential  buyers from entering the market or discourage current owners from selling.  Such outcomes would harm not only our local housing economy, but the  broader community members seeking stability and opportunity.  We believe this policy would be effective in reducing the risk of ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  The city council overwhelmingly in a six to one vote voted against having a space rent stabilization ordinance.  And you want to bring up something about tenant protections and things.  I think sometimes you need to look at that.  And I don't even know if you can bring it up again because it was voted down.  But before we get into tenant protections like this and getting into tenants, I think sometimes you need to look at that population.  I represent 3,000 senior citizens that are on fixed incomes and that nothing is being done at that.  At the point we brought this up, the city council was able to bring this down from a 30% increase down to a 10% increase.  But now it's the highest in the county, $915 a month to live in a senior mobile home park.  It has dropped down.  The price of our homes have now gone dramatically less.  There are six or seven mobile homes.  We can't even sell our homes now.  Before we get into other tenants, I think you should look a little more closely and maybe bring it up again about your senior citizens.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Shane Connery followed by Steve Depa.  Good evening, Mayor, Council Members, and our fellow community members.  My name is Shan Connery, and I'm a local mortgage lender.  I effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively we have 173.5 million Gen Zers,  5 million Gen Zers, Millennials, and half of Gen Xs that are two and a half times the number of  baby boomers. We don't have enough housing for our families. And if you think about having kids  like I do who are in their 20s, early 30s, they don't have the dream that we may have once had  in the ability to purchase a home. And if you're putting more regulations on people's ability  to build generational wealth, it's not going to help us or our children.  With that tsunami coming towards us, it's a crisis and discouraging development and investment  in housing. The council has to must recognize the scale of this challenge and prioritize solutions  that create opportunities for growth, not policies like registries that stifle it.  So you had asked for what is one of the solutions that can be done. We can encourage outside  development to come in and streamline the permitting process within our city to encourage  growth and also provide.  incentives for building in our community. So that would help with the housing crisis.  As Alicia talked about, we have expertise within the Sierra North Valley Realtors Association,  lenders like myself and other affinity partners who can contribute to the council's decision.  The pivotal moment for Chico right now by rejecting rent registries and adopting proactive  solutions can address real changes of habitability and affordability while encouraging investment  in the community.  We have a strong commitment to our community and our community's development. Let's not  squander the opportunity with the policy that has failed in so many other cities.  Instead, let's build a housing framework that supports our growing population and strengthens  our community for years to come. Thank you for your leadership and commitment to thoughtful,  effective solutions.  CHAIR DELLALEE VILLEGAS. Thank you. Steve Depa followed by Greg Whitebrook.  GREG WHITEBROCK.  GREG WHITEBROCK.  GREG WHITEBROCK.  GREG WHITEBROCK. Thank you, council. Steve Deppa, two-time past president of North Valley Property Owners Association, two-time past president of the Sierra North Valley Realtor Association. of the Sierra North Valley Realtor Association. Addison, appreciate you bringing this up. You and I have had multiple discussions. I gave Addison this book, I think it was pre-council, I gave Addison this book, I think it was pre-council, it's Golden Gates. It's a book by Connor Doherty. And I just ordered more copies for the rest of the council and it discusses why the cost of housing in San Francisco has gotten so exorbitant. My daughter lives in San Francisco  lives in San Francisco and her rent is higher than my mortgage payment. So I went through  your packet and I found the Fresno thing, you know, somewhat entertaining in that I  think, you know, I could have put a group of people together that write a better policy  than this. You know, there's things in here that are stunning. Yet one thing I would come  up with is that it talks about an anti-slum enforcement task force. Okay. We already have  code enforcement. You have to fix the situations you have now with the departments you have  now without adding more layers of bureaucracy that will cost more housing. Okay. And Addison,  I'm crazy about you, man. You know, my wife looks at your blue eyes and she's just like,  oh my God, look at this guy. All right. Point of order. We're not supposed to direct  the camera.  He's blushing.  We'll go back to Duffy's and we'll have some cocktails. But what my mother also taught  me was that when you point your finger at somebody, three fingers are pointing back  at you. Okay. And if we want to talk about housing and we want to talk about safety,  okay, I invite you, after the meeting, let's all drive through the West Avenues from Rancheria  to West 4th Avenue down Cedar. Okay. Or better yet, let's just walk it.  Okay. Okay. If we're talking about anti-slum, if we're talking about code enforcement, those  streets are dangerous, hazardous, and you're a bicycle rider. And I admire you for that.  I've thrown your bike in the back of my pickup many times in the cold. Right? And maybe I  should do it today because you'll break a wheel. And we have to fix the infrastructure  so that we could avoid slumps, so that we could encourage owners to put money into their  properties. Because right now—  Right.  why would somebody in that neighborhood put more money when they can't attract tenants because if  a parent comes to this town drives their kid through that neighborhood they are not going to  rent in that neighborhood so it's not necessarily the property owner it's the city first fix our  infrastructure we'll fix our properties and i've been in situations where i've had hoarders  that claim disability and i'm stuck code enforcement couldn't help me out thank you  thank you greg whitebrock followed by jennifer morris  good evening greg actually had to leave uh he asked me to fill in for him i'm a colleague  my name is matt depa i am the current president of the north by property association  greg asked me to read this for you he's the vice president property management the hignall  companies and he says thank you for the opportunity to speak on this  talk  as one of the leading real estate and property management companies in this region we feel it's  important for our voice to be heard on this item we would agree that housing providers have a duty  to provide housing units that align with habitability regulations without threat and  retaliation and i believe a majority of the housing providers in the city of chico do just that  so to suggest that we need to adopt policies like fresno to establish a registration format  and inspection requirements for all rental housing units is another example of political  and government overreach to deal with the incredible small percentage of substandard  housing units penalizing and taxing property owners and investors in this manner may result in  cleaning up a few of the properties in chico however you should also expect a higher number  of properties being removed from the real market due to these regulations that you're able to get  cleaned up lastly we do believe a vehicle already exists within our city to address these issues  mentioned in your letter to the council so if you are truly committed to reducing or eliminating  substandard housing units from the marketplace and i suggest council figure out how to reallocate  resources to our code enforcement division and empower the city to do so we believe that this is  a good idea and we will continue to work with the city to empower them to carry out existing  enforcement options rather than creating a whole new division of government oversight  today i also spoke with mr guanzon he's the chair of the housing department of butte county he would  be exempt from this policy he highly disagrees with it he thinks it'd be bad for everybody  you have to take that for what it's worth there again you know our foundation our city  were built on mom and pop to do this is going to hurt the mom and pops it's going to hurt the  renters let's work together to figure out something else thank you  thank you  thank you jennifer morris followed by annalise ulring  good evening council i'm the executive director of the north valley property owners association  i got my card in a little bit late and everybody's pretty much said what i had planned and drafted  here but i do appreciate you guys bringing this topic up i do think that it would be a good idea  to update the city of chico's website to be able to have some of those resources some of the  solutions that i think that we could do together is have an education center and a community center can be communicating to the community members can be communicating to the community members as to what their rights and responsibilities are. Our association does put out this information to our membership, but we don't have everybody  effectively As for doing the rental registry and the inspection programs, I know that in 2020, there was this topic already brought up.  know that in 2020 there was this topic already brought up it took about a year and a half of  going through that process and the council ultimately voted down to do the rental registries  because they saw that it would be a lot of the expense onto the city and the staff's time to  put that together so i hope we don't go down that track again let's work together and we're here as  a resource if you guys have any questions we're already trying to educate the community just let  us know what you guys need help with thank you thank you and our last speaker is annalise ulrich  like she said pretty much everything was said so i'm going to cut mine in half  i represent a family-owned and operated property management company we have a little under 3 000  residents that we serve under a thousand units and honestly we are pro-tenant protections so i  would love to have this conversation more one-on-one or individually and i think everybody  else here just really wants to be part of the conversation  to help serve renters and landlords.  thank you.  thank you very much further comment from council?  i own some apartments and i don'  t know how other landlords do it i know when i have a tenant that pays me rent every month i want to  keep them in there so they can keep paying rent and when they have a problem i fix it like right  away.  s a great point and every other  landlord that i know has the same attitude.  are there bad landlords out there there are but we have 25 000 rental units dwelling units in  chico the city of chico the idea of switching from right now we have a system where if you have a  problem your landlord doesn'  t fix it you call code enforcement and then they come out and deal with it. Switching to a registry with an active inspection on the property and then  you have to go to the city to fix it.  that would be a huge burden for the city.  the city would be a huge burden for the city and i don'  t know what problem it solves  because i know there are bad landlords are always going to be bad landlords and right now we have plenty of apartments in chico and if you'  re a tenant and you have a bad landlord you should go move to someplace that has a good landlord.  I'  m completely in favor of updating the website so that the city can have a better  people that have problems know where to go i think that'  s a  great idea but i'  m not at all  supportive of the idea of a registry and a proactive inspection.  it might not be the people who live in your apartments but a lot of people live in  apartments and they don'  t have anywhere else to go  there'  s no confidence you'  re going to be able to get  out and get into a new rental with a good decent landlord moving to one of your units just isn'  t on the table for them and that'  s why we have homelessness in town. If we'  it'  it'  except it'  s going to be a fact of life and we  probably should be discussing a managed campground and not just letting it be out there the way it  is. As i was trying to solve the puzzle understanding the political implications of these things  looking at programs that cost nothing to landlords i think the idea it'  s heavy handed to require people to fill out a form saying how many units they have it'  s a little over dramatic. I'  ll say i can google the bookings institution and rental registry and i find a proposal to adopt and enforce rental registries it'  s recommended to me. I'  the city of lincoln and the  national league of cities because  eviction as retaliation is a  common thing around the area so  areas that are majority rental  tend to adopt these kinds of  ordinances. I'  m glad I did  settle on we should have more  discussion because all  stakeholders should be in the  room when we'  re having these  discussions the city never  voted down the recommendation for  the rental registry. We had a  rental registry and the  rental registry died in  committee after covid it was  sent back to internal affairs  they wanted to have more  conversations about it and it  just never came back to the  council. I think it would be  appropriate to pick up these  things because these problems do  persist you can ask people you  just throw it out on the  internet or something or you  walk down the west avenue and  knock doors as I have and you  find that people do have  consistent trouble with  landlords who are not  maintaining things properly who  will not uphold their end of  contracts and bargains and  evictions can happen for no  this process. Most people are  vulnerable to that.  california has ab 1482 which  is the strongest tenant  protection act in the country.  in addition to that in  california there are free legal  services available for people  who feel their landlords aren'  honoring their obligations and  that'  s enough.  it'  s only for low income  people. People come to me all  the time and ask what they should  do about some of these issues. I  always recommend people to legal  services in northern california  because they'  re a great service to have  locally but they serve seniors  and low income people. There'  s a significant amount of  people in chico who do not  qualify for that and I don'  t know what to tell them. The  city of chico website could at  bare minimum have a better  answer than I do maybe for what  services are available but they  just simply aren'  t.  it sounds like maybe we  have some agreement.  I have a couple of comments  responses.  first of all I would like to  thank the board for the  support and the support that  we'  re talking about a  registry that would allow us to  more easily enforce the existing  laws and I understand it'  s normal for  people who are in the business  of making money from a certain  good in this case housing to  reject further regulation on it  but we'  re not talking about more  regulation we'  re talking about more  enforcement just like we enforce  our fire codes and we enforce  safety regulations on products  regulation to keep people safe  and I'  ve seen my friends  live in substandard housing  where they were afraid to talk  to their landlord about whether  it was leaks or electrical  issues or an unsafe staircase to  their back door because eviction  is often used as a threat or  there'  s the implicit  threat because that'  s the roof over  your head and especially after we  lost a lot of housing units in  butte county when there weren'  t places  to move to because we had a 0%  vacancy rate that was a huge  threat we had to just suck it up  if we had housing issues for  renters and we still see a low  vacancy rate even though we'  building new housing it'  s hard to find  somewhere affordable I was just  looking at apartments and I  would have had to have multiple  previous rental history references  to put have to get my credit  score checked have to jump  through a lot of hoops it'  s really hard to find  s hard expensive to move  and there'  s low vacancy and  everything is really expensive  and so people are living in a bit  of fear that if they bring up  issues that they might get  evicted thankfully as council  member van overbeck mentioned we  do have eviction protections for  certain people there are  loopholes a lot of single family  houses there are loopholes or  basically it'  s not covered by  ab 1482 for a lot of single  family house renters and a lot  of people don'  t know about  their rights I have a lot of  people reach out to me and ask  hey can you help me figure out  what I can do about this issue  that I have with my landlord not  fixing my heater for example or  things like that and so I think  that at the very least we can  update our city web page link to  local services resources laws to  help us to get the right  help direct people I think that'  s part of our role as a city  not just enforcing but also  educating our public and I want  to know somebody brought up  mobile home parks I definitely  support the idea of ensuring  that senior citizens can stay  housed in their mobile homes  without the land rent going up  huge amounts every year I think  it'  s a why not both scenario  where we can make sure everybody  in chico can live here safely.  I think we have one more  comment but the gist of it is  let'  s do what we can to educate  our public and I would support a  rental registry I'  m sensing there might not be  support but let'  s consider what we can do to  make sure people stay housed as  a way of preventing homelessness  and increasing safety in our  community.  obviously this is an issue  that we have to address and  I think the affordability is a  supply and demand issue and we  can'  t keep having the mantra of  the need for more housing keep  shouting that we need more  housing and then obstruct that  very thing that'  s contradictory.  We can'  t do that.  I am certainly in favor of  updating our website I'  m also in  favor of having a more in depth  conversation because I think some  of the points you bring up are valid.  address the issues that Steve  really hit upon at locations in  the city that are not nice.  The complexes are very poorly  managed and if you look at our  calls for service I think chief  aldridge would agree with me we  can tell just by those calls for  service which ones are poorly  managed. I think a more in depth  conversation would be appropriate  you mentioned you punted this issue  and I think we can have a more  robust conversation that'  s broader.  m not really in favor of this  registry thing I'  m not going to restrict the  conversation but we can have a more  robust conversation because there'  s a lot of depth to this issue  and I'  m willing to take that on in  internal affairs.  I'  ll make that motion.  The motion is to update the look  at updating the website and then  move this over to internal affairs  for a more robust conversation.  second.  just to clarify you mean to say  direct staff to update the  website and carry this.  that'  s correct.  thanks.  do you have a second?  yes.  council member goldstein.  aye.  council member holly.  yes.  council member o'brien.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  aye.  council member effectively effectively  we'  re going to  go to the next question.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E  have had a very politically  neutral time to discuss the  things that are going to happen  in a few years from now. You  might remember some history of  how our local elections moved  from everybody in the city  being able to elect new city  council members every two years  to going to district elections  were doing the elections in  2019 for the 2020 election  districts have made it so we can  have a more geographically  diverse city council and we can  have people representing  chapman town and student areas  and the north end of town and  there'  s those pros but there  have been some cons like some  other things we can do to  representative in four years and  in some cases six years because  of the way redistricting caused  some areas to overlap. I wanted  to bring forth some ideas and  open a discussion among city  council of ways we can make our  elections not just fair but more  accessible to voters. So I will  go through a little bit of my  write up that hopefully you have  read but I will try not to read  it word for word to save us time.  Basically several cities in  California use an independent  redistricting commission to  remove partisanship from their  districting process after the  2030 census with our new data we  will be redrawing our election  districts again and we saw in  the first and second  districting process in chico two  different political majorities on  the city council who in some  opinion drew the district lines  to favor themselves whether or  not that'  s true it caused a lot of  maybe public distrust in their  elected officials and it caused  people to stay at city council  really late discussing it. A lot  of cities have tried to bypass  this by having members of the  community of the city council  to be appointed to draw maps  with a demographer based on that  census data that then the city  council can approve those maps.  That'  s one option independent  redistricting commission I also  want to bring up direct mayoral  elections. Oroville and many  other cities use this to give  people more of a say in voting  for their representation on city  council usually cities will have  a two-year term for mayors so  that every citizen gets to vote  every two years for somebody.  s a great idea. In our city we  would probably stick with the  mayor being the council mayor  and manager system instead of a  strong mayor. That'  s another item and then rank  choice voting is also something  that I support especially with  district elections because if  three people run in one district  or more it becomes a lot there  can be challenges with split  t know which  person they should vote for to  strategically decide who closest  aligned to them might win so it  makes it easier for voters to  say this is my top candidate this  is my second favorite candidate  this is my third if you have  rank choice voting and some cities  have implemented this and I want  to bring these forward for  discussion the independent  redistricting commission rank  choice voting and direct mayoral  anybody has another election  reform idea they would like to  throw in would love to hear it.  thank you very much. Does  any of the council members have  a question for bryce and then  we will go to speakers and then  we can.  I have some comments.  do you want to hear from  speakers first do we have any  speakers?  okay let's take the speaker and  then.  James hutchinson.  I'm one of those people in your  district bryce that for four years  haven't been able to vote for a  district election but here's what  we got on top of that if you've  taken a look in the area between  humboldt and forest with the  bridge being out the traffic  pattern in there obscene the  number of people going back and  forth we felt like we had no  response to that we couldn't  address because we didn't have an  elected person we didn't have a  person reached out and listen to  what I had to say when I came  here I came to this council  because we didn't get to vote for  a representative I remember when  you talked about the mayor when  you were put up for the  possibility of be filling in for  the mayor and you had large people  that were forced out of office and  you've interviewed brian also  interviewed at the same time and  your opinions on it and you've  developed them very well I don't  agree very much with the rank  choice on a small basis like this  because of the nature of a smaller  town and so far I've seen too much  partisanship way too much in this  town we've got people talking about  their that they're partisan that  they have a certain party that  they're not going to run we have  people step out of the election and  said other members of my party want to  run so I'm not going to run happened in  your district we had Bruce talked about  running and he when he withdrew he said  well there's somebody else in my party  wait a minute city council is not about  party it's not supposed to be especially  in a district election it should be  about the individual district and  people learning with ideas about a  district I'd like you to come out take a  look under dead horse slew sometimes  you'll see a lot of people running  really soon you want to see a pile of  storm what the storm during can do it's  almost damned now at this point there's  so many trees that have fallen just on  the north side by great harvest take a  look under there and see what's there  that's what's happening out here I agree  with most of what you have I agree with  electing the mayor I think that's a  wonderful idea and I think we need that  we need to have something where it's in  there are my case if we had elected a  mayor I wouldn't be in the same  position as I would have been in the  would have at least had somebody to vote  for somebody I could say if they got  elected hey I voted for you and also  recall understands people tried to do a  recall in the former mayor and what  happened they found out that you cannot  recall the mayor unless you're in his  district here's a person who's mostly  representing the whole chico and you  can't recall him unless you're in his  district the only people that recall  him is the council that was stupid it's  a stupid idea  I think we need to get rid of it okay I  appreciate what you've done so I've  heard so far I'm impressed and thank you  very much but I think on the election  thing we need to make more corrections  on the idea of how recall plays a role  thank you thank you and please email me  if you have specific issues in the  district would love to hear them all  right now we can have a conversation  all right  thank you  those are some interesting ideas but  the timing is wrong so the next  redistricting will happen as a result of  data from the 2030 census so that's six  years from now  with five years but then we have to wait  to get the data so we're talking about  six years so maybe four or five years  from now we should have this  conversation but a lot of things can  idea of changing the way we do  redistricting. That'  s problem number one.  Problem number two is voting for  the mayor at large is an  interesting idea but you have to  have an odd number of council  members so assuming it'  s seven and one of  those is an elected mayor at  large then you have six districts  instead of seven so you'  re back to the  a majority of the people who  t think it makes any sense to  have it right now.  I'  m confused about that  because I feel if you wait until  we'  re at that moment and  then you have people in office  who are making their own  calculations for how this can  benefit them and it is the  people who have a majority who  would know they can use it.  It feels like the perfect time  when all of us could not be on  the council for redistricting  all of us could except for the  mayor will be termed out by  then. For us to say we don'  t know who'  re going to be  work in the county it would  have smelled like them and we  would like to avoid that in the  future. I feel this is a great  time to say that because none of  us can feel as personally tied  to the outcome.  think about it this way  right now people like me have a  majority and in five years  people like you might have a  majority. Right now you have no  chance but you might have a  chance in the future.  the one thing I thought  about that is we would want to  do it because we believe there  has been some element of  gerrymandering in the past we  want to prevent that but you  might calculate if we'  re in power we'  ll decide to do an  independent redistricting  commission because we committed  ourselves to that.  you'  re a young man and I'  ve looked at a lot of  redistricting efforts and every  time it happens the people who  are out of power scream that it'  s gerrymandering and it happens  on both sides. When the  progressives did the  districting for the 2018  election I mean it was a  grossly partisan and our side  did the districting for the 2022  election and of course it wasn'  t partisan at all. But I'  m just saying that'  s just sort of how it  works.  they'  re like anonymously submitted  maps every time like they never  pick the tomographer ones it'  s like the help chico vote is  what they come up with.  so doesn'  t that argue in favor of an  independent redistricting  commission? I'  m uncomfortable with the  m not comfortable with a  liberal leaning majority or a  conservative leaning majority  dictating our lines. I think  having an independent commission  is the least partisan way to do  it.  yeah that'  s great in theory but  show me those people. I mean  these are people who must be  people who aren'  t involved in the process  in any way. I don'  t know anybody who'  s not partisan. I don'  t know anybody. I mean and I  have some liberal friends.  I frequently go places and  people don'  t realize that they'  t realize I'  m on city council or what  city council does so I think  they exist but that'  s fair. Most of my  friends are pretty political.  yeah I think my other council  members have responded to some  of your points council member  van overbeck but part of why I  brought this up now is because  it'  s the middle of the  decade and as council member  winslow said it would be harder  for us if we were redistricting  next month than we would be  that would allow us to say let'  s change our process now not  only because waiting until the  last minute would be bad but  even waiting until the last  couple of years it'  s more possible that we  would have political bias or  bias that well I'  m a cartographer I'  d be so good at drawing  maps they should let me do it  but if I'  m in power I don'  t want to be given that  privilege I think that the  voters should be deciding who  they get to vote for or what  geographical area they get to  vote in. I think that would  be a good thing to do but I'  I'  ve seen too many times  people in power picking their  voters. There'  s that but also it'  s part of our  role to determine long-term  policy and planning efforts.  We'  re looking at plans for  improving our roadways for the  next ten years we'  re looking at long-term  budgeting stormwater plans  things like that and so it'  s in our best interest to be  looking out for what we'  re going to do and I think  re going to do in five to  seven years now. Also I'  m happy to open the  conversation and if we do want  to put a pin in it then I  think it'  s okay to come back to it a  little later but I really think  that this is something that  would benefit us.  I don'  t have a motion or do I?  I can make a motion I wanted  to get a pulse on what the  candidates have to say and I'  council thought first because  if there was perhaps one item  or two that people would  support then I'  m not going to try to push  through all three and have it  get shot down. But I can make  the motion first. Also I wanted  to just say in response to one  public commenter who mentioned  ranked choice voting I thought  the example in my race was a  good example where I agreed a  lot with another candidate in  my district who stepped back  because it could have caused a  vote split to have three people  in the same race. I think  s a good example of how  candidates can be run. I think  if we had ranked choice voting  we could have more qualified  candidates per district and that  gives the voters more choice and  that'  s better overall for  everybody. With that comment I  move to direct staff to return  with information regarding the  application of the following  election reforms in the city of  chico. Independent  redistricting commission, ranked  choice voting and direct mayoral  elections.  I'  ll second that.  thank you.  I'  I have a question to fill  in. I thought we might take  these one by one just because  we have comments on maybe a lot  of them. The only one that I'  maybe more interested in there  was a discussion in I believe  2020 about ranked choice voting.  I wonder if maybe the clerk you  were on the council too. I  believe the county clerk came in  and was very against it. I just  wondered if you could if you  remember why what was the  complication there.  I was just wondering if  I was going to ask  Ms. Presson to see if I know  that we have a new clerk over in  Oroville. Did you reach out to  them?  I did.  Did you have any information?  I did. Because council member  winslow is correct and mayor  reynolds remembers it correctly.  At the time the council had  agendized a discussion regarding  ranked choice voting. And at  that time candy grubs came over.  She was the elected county  elections official. And she was  she actually brought Keaton Denley, who is now our elected official in the county, and he made  a presentation. And at that time, Candy and Keaton both indicated that in 2019, Governor Newsom  vetoed SB2112, which was to enact ranked choice voting throughout the whole state for general  law cities and counties. Right now, charter cities can, as a charter city, we can adopt rules that  are more rigorous or more restrictive than the state level. You just can't use your power to  undo something that the state does. So at the time, Candy Grubbs indicated that the county  could not actually implement ranked choice voting. Not only because their equipment couldn't handle  it, they would need upgrades. At that time in 2019, it was over $200,000 to add a component  to the state. So at that time, Candy Grubbs indicated that the county could not actually  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively to have a different voting system  effectively  effectively to have a different voting system  different voting system while you are using the balloting the way it is. And that is one thing  that Candy Grubs and Keaton also indicated in a conversation with him yesterday, that the city  of Chico, if we chose, because we are a charter city, to implement ranked choice voting, we would  need to handle our own elections from here on out. And we would be, and to do that would be onerous.  You would need to create a department. You'd probably need to get me a building. I wouldn't  mind that hall of records or the elections, but I'm just saying, and you would need staff  to handle that because it's not just every two years you do an election. It's, there can be a  referendum. There can be an initiative. There can be a special election. It can all happen.  And the county, if we have ranked choice voting on these issues and ballot measures and everything,  then it would need to always be handled by the city of Chico. And so it was cost  prohibitive. It was cost prohibitive. It was cost prohibitive. And so it was cost prohibitive.  It was cost prohibitive to even consider that. In fact, council didn't ask me to pencil that out.  But that was why that didn't go forward at that time. And it is still the stance of the county  elections officials as of yesterday that they couldn't, they couldn't take it in. It causes a  lot of confusion and as well as the cost just to upgrade the equipment to handle that type of a  different balloting process for just the city of Chico.  I think that's insane that they would tell us they would not  like adhere to election that like guidelines that we put out, like, and like we're some kind of  backwater, like we can't handle the technology. Like it's too complicated for them, but Oakland  can do it. Well, I, I, well, Oakland, I'd like to see their budget, but I think that when you look  at it, um, the county, we can, we,  we can, we can, we can, we can, we can, we can, we can, we can, we can, we can, we can, we can, we can,  we can effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively not just measures are additional,  But that cost is factored in because we're consolidating.  You'll note that when we've held special elections, it's doubled in cost because we're a standalone election.  They're conducting it.  They're paying all their staff to do it.  So it's a courtesy that they allow us to consolidate.  So they don't have to consolidate.  They can say, Chico, do your own.  We're looking to minimize what we're doing.  We have all these other cities or we have all these other agencies.  Because you have to understand the county does, when they conduct their elections every two years, it's actually for all the school board districts.  All of, you know, all the various agencies that are out there.  So they could decline the consolidation.  So it's not just because we're backwards in any way at all.  It has everything to do with their granting as a courtesy by assuming all the cost for all the equipment.  To conduct our elections on our behalf.  Maybe where the discussion needs to go is Chico breaking away from Butte County.  And we'll see how they can maintain that election building.  I will just say, with all the complications that can come with trying to have this, you know, crazy new technology for elections.  I think the two-party system is a creation of our election system.  And I think it's absolute poison to the whole country in the process of democracy and public participation.  And.  I think we see that, like, all over.  And if only as a symbolic gesture in order to encourage wider adoption of rank choice voting or something similar in order to break us out of that logic.  I think that the whole world would benefit for it.  So.  So, Madam Mayor, if we're going to get through this before 10 o'clock, we need to vote.  Yeah, we could vote.  I also, you know, if somebody wants to make a substitute motion, that's also allowable.  All right.  Well, I don't think we have a second.  So I think it was a second.  So, OK.  So I think then we will vote.  OK.  Yes.  Council Member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council Member Hawley.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Timing is everything.  And I appreciate the effort.  But we have too many other priorities.  No.  OK.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  No.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  I think I'll agree with several comments.  I think new ideas.  They're always noteworthy.  And some new ideas are great and some may not be.  But it's just too early for the independent redistricting.  We may not even, none of us would be here.  And I agree with some of the logic of do it early so it is in place.  But I'm not going to support it.  As far as ranked choice voting, I can't support that.  There's only a few cities in California out of the 482 that have implemented it.  And.  And especially given the fact that the Butte County wouldn't support it, can't afford it.  It would be unfeasible.  So I'm going to vote no.  OK.  For those reasons.  OK.  Thank you.  And Mayor Reynolds?  No.  OK.  It fails with a 3-4 vote.  I want to make a follow-up motion.  We can motion to table a discussion on the independent redistricting commission to September  2028.  I don't think we can do a follow-up.  I think we can do a follow-up motion because we already had.  Can we do two motions on one item?  On the item?  I'm going to ask the clerk or the city attorney.  There was no substitute motion or friendly amendment to that, addison.  My position is if it'  s not related to this initial amendment to her initial motion, it wouldn'  be appropriate at this point.  We'  re still on the same item, though.  We haven'  t closed out.  can I make the motion?  I mean, it'  s not.  I would like to make a motion if it'  s about my own item.  your item was you made the motion there was a second and that item failed.  am I not allowed to make multiple motions?  I don'  t really check out.  the item is election reforms.  It'  s not election reforms time bound to doing it this year.  correct.  But your memo agendized that item and that was the motion that was presented.  it was a recommended motion.  I'  m not allowed to make a motion.  I shouldn'  t include recommended motions if I want to discuss things beyond them.  your motion was the motion you made.  this doesn'  t make sense to me in terms of rosenberg'  s rules.  we have to have a two-thirds majority to force an end of discussion.  we'  re still on the topic and still have motions.  if I would have done it as a substitute motion, we would have voted first.  not after the vote.  it'  s done.  it'  s not the vote.  if you want to propose an agenda item to talk about it some more, we can do that.  not these specific things.  that would be my recommendation is to make a council member request on that specific item.  separately agendize election reform in order to fulfill this conversation.  it just doesn'  t make sense to me.  that doesn'  t appear to me what rosenberg'  s rules of order says.  also, are we allowed to bring something back within the next year?  maybe another two years.  I don'  t think we can.  t think we can.  t think we can.  I don'  t think I can.  if we'  re on the failing side of the motion, it would apply to all of us.  now they'  re insisting it'  s a different item even though we'  re on the same topic.  I guess that wouldn'  t cover it.  jim?  again, as I said, this item was discussed and baited.  there was a motion that addresses the memo that was provided by council member goldstein.  the motion failed.  at this point, any subsequent changes, it seems to be an attempt to try to reopen that  discussion on that failed motion.  it'  s a different motion, though.  it'  s a different motion that'  s been created.  I think I'  ve been up here for six years and I don'  t think we'  ve ever had a second motion on an item.  have we?  did I miss pressing?  right.  like a tailoring of a failed motion to attempt to continue that discussion.  that'  s the issue is that the motion failed and now there'  s an attempt to adjust that motion to a different motion.  I think we'  re going to have to re-propose something that'  s different from that original motion.  that'  s the issue.  s a different motion.  we'  re seeking some kind of majority support to move forward on something.  we end discussion when we all agree to move on to the next item.  we'  ve been advised by our attorney and we have our rules of order.  if there'  s something that'  s different that it can be brought back later.  but my understanding is not.  the parliamentarian.  of course, single motion.  if the one motion fails, then we end the item.  we have to re-add it.  effectively, effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Not for a year, unless somebody who... Prevailing side. Support or unless somebody in the opposition agrees to do it. That's the same motion. We're talking about the same item, but a different motion, which I mean, it feels extremely convoluted that there's a small book of those first rules we have. We're gonna get through this agenda. The city attorney has given his opinion  thank you Mr. Chair.  requesting confirmation from the  parliamentarian.  it'  s time for us to move on.  I'  m comfortable moving on for  now but I think this is also a  relevant question for us to learn  about our process and what'  s allowed here for  future items. If we could have  our parliamentarian maybe sort  that out for us for future  reference if we'  re allowed to after a  ask you to give us a second  motion related to the same  topic in the same agenda item  for future reference.  I can quickly address it  and we'  ll try to make it very  succinct. For parliamentary  procedure there has to be some  closure whether it'  s an aye vote or it'  s upheld or there'  s been a denial of a motion.  The parliamentary procedure  does allow someone to change  their vote as long as it'  s done during the meeting  before the meeting and then  after the meeting ends. Other  than that it would have to be  reconsideration of an item and  that would need to be brought  forward by someone voting on the  majority. So that'  s in AP and P  1010 in terms of reconsideration  of a vote or of an item that  was considered by the council.  So there has to be some closure  at some point. There was a  motion and a second and the  council voted and it failed 3-4.  You could have a motion and a  You could have done a friendly  amendment and it could have been  amended or you could have  withdrawn your motion before it  was voted on. Parliamentary  procedure allows that. At some  point there has to be some  closure and that is why those  rules exist.  I just Google it. I swear if  I didn'  t feel like it was this  important to be correct about our rules and it very clearly states this is an AI overview. A new motion can be made on the same subject matter as a failed motion along further discussion.  We agree to  move on because if a motion fails  we'  re at an  impasse and whenever it was just me on the failing side of a motion it'  s pretty obvious but that'  s not necessarily where we'  re at. We had a discussion which indicated that people would be amenable to picking this up at a later time so having a second motion to table the discussion seems reasonable enough.  I appreciate your mad dog  AI skills. I'  m going to go with our city attorney at the moment and if we find out something later I'  ll gladly entertain putting it back on the motion. If we get separate advice maybe we can ask somebody else in the city attorney'  s office. I'  ll gladly make sure we get it on a future agenda.  How about that?  City council just to clarify  again nothing prohibits a council member from bringing that back as a separate council member request. The issue is I think it'  As you said if it'  s the exact same motion, correct. It would need to be a member that was on the voting on the side that sided on the majority. They would need to reopen that. If you bring a separate item at a future council member request item that would be appropriate at another time. To redo it here I think that'  s the issue.  What the city manager and city clerk said was that it never allows for closure on this particular item.  Okay.  Thank you.  re going to move on 5.9.  If we find out something different I promise I'  ll bring it back.  Thank you.  Council member holly' s request for street lighting.  thank you.  I will quickly gloss over some of the main points from the multiple neighborhood improvement plans. This was largely in response to during the campaign I did a lot of door knocking. Of course this is anecdotal. I got a lot of feedback largely from people living in city halls and other  south campus in particular that they did not feel safe once they stepped foot off of campus. As the student population has a very large impact on the economy as we all know that was a huge concern to me. I thought it would introduce too much bias to specifically name that neighborhood as we all live in different parts of the city and hold our own bias.  I thought it would be most useful to use the neighborhood improvement plan recommendations on certain areas of the city. I would like to see that in the future.  I will now turn it over to the city council to discuss street lighting to guide this discussion. That'  s what I have provided for everyone.  But since writing this I have met with Mr.  and Mr.  Gustafson.  Yes.  And they provided a lot of context to my last three recommendations.  So my recommendations were one, a status update of the street lighting recommendations pulled from our multiple neighborhood improvement plans.  If they are completed.  And if improvements not completed are still applicable.  I picked up from our conversation that pretty much all of the newer neighborhoods were up to municipal code 18 our standards.  And that' s great.  So street light master planning would not be applicable in this case I determined.  But that the older neighborhoods largely are not up to code effectively.  implement the road which is a  problem unless there was a major  project improvement that has  happened since then.  Secondly for still applicable  recommendations that have not  been completed an update on to  why law changes budget  constraints of course largely  budget constraints are a huge  factor in this every single  street light to implement is  around $20,000.  That is a huge budget  constraint and then third a  status on the city'  s ability to dictate pg&e  utility owned lighting if future  street lighting planning is  pursued an update on pg&e is  that largely their cost  estimates are enormous even for  minor changes to their street  lighting.  I would like to alter this  discussion a little bit to  surround the city's budget  recommendations.  taking staff time and perhaps  any city councilors if they are  open to it to meeting directly  with the older neighborhoods  that have the most  deficiencies in street lighting  I understand that south campus  specifically third street is up  for major project improvement  in 2029 and that'  s very exciting.  I also understand that there'  s going to be some major tree  trimming happening around there  that should alleviate some of  the street lighting issues but  it would still make me feel  better to know that the city and  the university are proactively  communicating.  Staff time for a meeting with  perhaps a member of the  president'  s office whether it'  s our department head or  another staff member that the  department head sees fit.  I would also like to hear from  other council members to see  if they have other of the older  neighborhoods that are not up to  code that they think we should  start identifying high risk areas.  I talked to Mr. Gustafson and  we had a conversation about your  proposal and I think it'  s a good idea to have a  lighting plan but I think if I  can suggest if we'  re going to  ask staff to come up with a  re going to ask staff to spend  time on this the priority should  be because we can'  t do it all at once  but if we have a list of  projects that we can pick off a  couple at a time and prioritize  them based on safety.  South campus is a big issue and  having the students be safe is  really important and also streets  where there'  s a lot of people  riding bikes that are dark and  can do all these things based on  safety. I don'  t think it needs to be a  plan and please don'  t ask us to hire a  consultant I think it needs to  be a list of prioritized list of  projects.  I do want to say for that  third street improvement project  we did talk about the fact we  need that much time because it'  s such a large project it just  takes so many years to make  it happen.  s not recommended to do  piecemeal improvements it is more  cost-effective to go into the  whole project as a whole but if  there are major safety concerns I  think that some exceptions should  be made.  I want to applaud you  council member holly for taking  this on but most importantly for  seeking out input from our staff  too often we don'  t do that and we don' t understand these issues to the depth that we should so I want to applaud you for taking this on but most importantly for seeking out input from our staff too often we don'  t do that and we don' to vet this, but I think we need to understand this issue a little bit more before I'm ready to jump in  talk to you before I'  m ready to  jump in and say we should go  this direction and this  direction we haven'  t heard from staff  yet or at least I have not.  Mr. Onabani?  there'  s a lot of nuance to  different neighborhoods around  town as council member holly  mentioned all new development  meets our design standards which  have lighting standards  associated with that.  associated with that.  Really the new stock of housing  is not the problem.  We have these older  neighborhoods south campus area  the avenues and  areas.  Strategically the council  adopted the ten-year cip plan  and staff'  s recommendation for  putting some of those older  neighborhoods a little further  out because of the design  elements associated with that.  When we'  re going in and  doing the road rehab projects  A d a compliance in addition to  fixing the roadways.  As part of that lighting is  always on that.  That'  s why we put those  further in that ten-year plan  to allow for more time to design  that.  Any time we'  re doing those  projects we incorporate the  neighborhood improvement plans.  For example several years ago we  did an improvement project on  east tenth street to the  chapman mulberry design  standards.  They have a little reduced  lighting where they have lighting  at the intersections and one mid  block as opposed to our typical  spacing.  So we incorporate that as part  of our design in those road  rehab projects when we do those.  If there is council interest to  focus on specific areas we can  certainly look at that maybe  outside of those identified  neighborhood improvement plans  we have coming in the forthcoming  years.  As you mentioned as council  member holly mentioned we have !  It varies when we get an  economy of scale doing multiple  lights there'  s an economy of  scale.  By the time you purchase the  pole or the foundations hook up  the electrical then you pay pg and  e for your point of connection  it averages probably about $20,000  per light for the install not to  mention the ongoing electrical  costs associated with that.  Something to consider as you  maybe look at different areas to  include.  what a good place to start  maybe just have you bring a  report back to us of the status  and where things are at remind  everybody of that plan because  we have brand new people that  maybe probably haven'  t even read it.  And then even if us could maybe  identify places within our  districts and then maybe direct  further staff time before we  dive too deep.  I don'  t know it'  s just a suggestion.  that'  s what I was going to recommend  looking at it both long term and  short term long term I want to  hear the plan and see the plan  that short term maybe we can  identify as council members in  our district areas that are  extraordinarily poorly lit I  think that'  d be a good place to start to  look at and begin that  conversation.  Ms.  Preston do we have public  comment on this?  we do we have one speaker.  okay.  so go ahead.  let me just throw in just one  more element of the conversation  or it'  s really just a little  background history we had a  conversation on crime prevention  through the state of the  environmental design which is  we'  re talking about the same  thing lighting in particular  areas and where it'  s impact safety and we  had a motion this is I think  february 20'  th meeting to have staff  come back with additional  recommendations on community  design concepts and including  partnership with the university  trying to look at just what  we'  re talking about.  so this is kind of with  that.  I think that was field to the  police department.  I could be wrong but yeah I  haven'  t really followed up with  it.  this is a bit of  conversations we'  ve had that it is bringing it  let'  s take our speaker and then  we can wrap it up.  okay.  jared geyser.  good evening council good  evening staff and everyone else  watching the meeting.  so yeah I want to say thank you  katie for bringing this forward.  I was a student five years ago  and it was a concern among many  people that it was too dark in  those neighborhoods and not safe  to walk around.  I do want to bring up while  we'  re looking at increasing the  lighting for safety we don'  t increase the light pollution  of the city.  we want to make sure we are  there are harmful effects for  human health resulting in  increased light pollution and  harmful effects for migratory  birds flying over and for the  local environment more  generally.  but also critically for human  health.  so I would like to acknowledge  there are cities that are  intentionally reducing light  pollution.  and they do that through dark  sky initiatives.  so I would like to encourage  you all while considering  changes to lighting policy to  be considering these dark sky  policies that would direct light  down and reduce the amount of  pollution.  you all to increase using energy  efficient lighting that use  longer wavelengths so red or  yellow tone of lighting is  longer wavelength it'  s less emitting into the  atmosphere.  and so we can see stars better  if we'  re really intentional with  how we do lighting.  so I just wanted to bring that  element into this discussion.  thank you.  thank you.  all right.  anybody want to make a motion  to direct the motion?  effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively I think that council member O'Brien brought up a good point of let's maybe ask staff to. So my suggestion was to look at it both from the longterm and the short term. Longterm we've got a plan in place. I think we need to all look at that. But short term, I think we as council members,  the district and I think we as  council members since we'  re all in  a district can go in our  district get the pulse of our  district and find out where  maybe some really bad areas are  in regards to lining look at  that from the short-term  perspective as well and then  combine it all together.  have some self-assigned  homework.  that'  s the first  council motion to assign us  homework I think I heard.  I would like to suggest  maybe each of us doing whatever  research you want to do within  our own districts but perhaps  bring it all back to internal  affairs first so we put it into  a cohesive organized package and  then take a look at the.  very well played council  member bennett.  that means non-internal  affairs committee members would  still have homework is what we'  re saying.  are we all allowed to be  at internal affairs and discuss  something together?  you can contribute to an  agenda report.  you can attend the meeting  though.  re not allowed to be at  we'  t want to violate the  brown act.  we'  d want to have a  cohesive package we bring back  to council.  I was hesitant to ship it over  to internal affairs again since  I'  m the chair but I think  probably quite frankly council  member bennett is correct it  probably should go there to sort  out all the details hear from  staff and then bring it back to  the full council.  that will be my friendly  amendment.  thank you.  I will make a motion for this  item to return to internal  affairs where it can be further  discussed.  we can go to sleep soon.  I will second the motion.  we have a motion and a  second.  ms.  preston.  staff is going to provide a  report to ia and then they'  re going to talk about it and  bring it back to the full  council.  correct.  are council members supposed to  be self-assessing their  districts that'  s part of the idea?  can you tell staff?  if it'  s coming to internal affairs  I'  m going to request from my  colleagues that you do provide at  least one area in your district  that you think is exceptionally bad  that we should take a look at.  okay.  and will we get reminded to do  that before internal affairs  please?  direct the clerk to remind  us.  so my only question I would  probably lob this over to our  city attorney is that if the  council members are not there  I think that the committees are  comprised of three council  members and yes, others can go  and sit in the audience but  cannot participate.  and then providing information  for the committee to consider,  why not have it come back to the  full council where you'  re in compliance with the  brown act but that'  s my thought.  I'  ll do whatever the council wants  to do and what the city  attorney thinks that we can do.  I just don'  t know how you talk about what  other council members areas are  when they'  re not there or they shouldn'  t be participating in that  discussion.  so if you want staff report,  you have the staff report at  iac, you bring back  recommendations or you bring the  staff report to the full council  so you guys can discuss it and  still do your homework.  that'  s the thought.  I understand that  concern, miss preston.  is it possible for me to change  my motion?  you can amend it.  or can we make a friendly  amendment to adjust that?  would that be the more  appropriate way to handle that?  well, it was a motion by  council member holly and second  chair.  I think it was a motion by  council member goldstein.  so if you would like to make a  friendly amendment and they accept  it, then we can change and modify.  I feel like you could just change  it, right?  and I would second the change.  no, because once we have a motion  and a second, we have to vote on  it.  so if we do the friendly  amendment, then we can.  you can do a friendly  amendment and I can change it in  the minutes.  then we only have to vote once.  so the friendly amendment would  be what, council member o'brien?  well, you said it just a moment  ago, madam clerk.  so I think that would be the  so staff will present the report  to iac?  to iac and then ioc will be  back and then we'll bring our  individual record.  then we'll assign the  homework, right?  okay.  all right.  okay.  and you guys both accept the  amendment?  all right.  it was accepted.  can you read it again?  it is to direct staff to  bring back a report on the  street lighting and in comparison  to those neighborhood plans.  and the report is being  submitted to the council.  and that report will go to iac  which is comprised of three  council members and they will  make, they will hear it, they  will vet it, they will discuss  it and send possible  recommendations to the council.  the full council will have  homework to check out your own  districts and then you'll have  the full discussion at the  council level.  perfect.  all right.  yeah, seconded.  okay.  all right.  so council member goldstein?  aye.  council member holly?  yes.  council member o'brien?  thank you for keeping us  informed.  effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively All right. Record time. We're down to the go. A status of the ad hoc and growth and community development committee. Mr. Van Overbeek, could you just give us a one minute, ! You each get 30 seconds.  We we co-chair the growth community development ad hoc committee, which was formed in about the started meeting in the middle of last year to deal with how should the city grow and where and all the issues related to that.  So our first phase is a perfect time for you to ask for a report.  It was the discovery phase.  We spent about six months on that, which would be about a dozen meetings.  And we've heard from planners, smart growth people, climate action people, LAFCO, civil engineers, builders, developers, real estate people, our distinguished fire chief, and other land use experts so that we have a set of data on where we think we are.  You want to add something?  Yeah, I heard a lot of complaints about the committee.  I heard a lot of complaints about the committee from other committee members, from members of the public for various things.  The two people who have not really complained are Council Member Van Overbeek and I.  And let's not forget the press back here.  He complained too, yeah, to be sure.  I was including him in there.  And I think that we have some very, very contentious issues that have resulted in a referendum.  And all the people doing the work for a referendum doesn't happen without a lot of contention.  So there was no expectation that we're coming in here with full agreement.  And we've had this lengthy process going through a lot of different information and getting to know one another, the seven people on the committee.  Now six.  We're going to add a seventh again.  And I think that it has gone.  So Mark accepted.  He's joining.  So now we're back to seven.  Mark Wolf, a planning commissioner, is now on the add-out committee too.  Replaced Pam Figge.  They're both professional planners and background.  So serve the same niche.  So I think that we're making good progress.  I think it's going to result in some meaningful reforms that will come back to the council.  You know, Tom says he thinks maybe March and April, I think, just things tend to take a little longer.  And if it's back.  In the summer, I'd be happy.  But we're trying to do the good work to make sure that there is as much consensus as possible on these things.  And looking at not growth in any one particular area, but as looking at the city as a whole and in the different varieties of building that we need in order to satisfy our housing needs.  Yes.  So the first phase was findings.  I'm sorry.  Was discovery.  The next phase is what I call finding.  So we meet and figure out what we heard and try to agree on what we heard.  And then the third is to come back.  Looking at the general.  Plans.  Coming back to.  The council and saying here.  Here are some things we'd like to see as a as a committee.  I think there's two things that have surprised me.  And you can add.  One is.  How well everybody's getting along.  Because, you know, we have people from very different backgrounds.  We have three smart growth people.  We have three people.  Related to the development community in one way or another.  And then.  Pam Figge.  Who's.  A city.  Planner.  Or was a city planner was was sort of tiebreaker.  And now we have another person with a similar background.  But I think it's all been pretty collegial.  And.  The second thing.  A comment I would make is.  The general plan is.  Really good.  You know, the issues we're having are not that the general plan is a problem.  But but.  Why are we having so much trouble implementing what the general plan is saying?  And.  We're having so much trouble implementing it.  Do you.  Want to add something?  I agree.  I mean, it's I think it's been nice to come to that conclusion that actually I think there's less.  Maybe less.  Necessary revamping of the general plan than I thought in the first place.  Like there's there's actions and there's policies that follow that that we're looking at.  But it has been.  Good.  I think we're making good progress.  So we're going to decide when we're going to wrap this up at the next meeting, which is in two weeks.  Just a week.  We have this weird.  Let's try it in a week.  In a week.  Next week.  And then because you asked me when we could wrap it up.  And the answer is we'd all like to get it done sooner than later.  And so.  Okay.  Sounds good.  And then I just have a procedural question for replacing somebody on the committee.  I know if you've been working for six months and you have all this invested and digested information.  And we chose who was going to be on that committee.  In the beginning.  But.  I'm looking for.  E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E  I think the question is that we actually never announced who the committee members were.  It was just two council members, and then we kind of agreed about the number.  So Eric Nielsen, Jim Stevens, Doug Gillen, and Byker Kaufman are the other members on there.  And I don't think that that was ever a council approved thing.  Okay.  I'm just checking.  Right.  It is an ad hoc, so it's a little bit different than like a standing or a formal committee.  But I was just checking to see what we had done.  Okay.  Sounds good.  All right.  So you'll let us know maybe after your next meeting when you anticipate wrapping up.  All right.  We have no items after the posting of the agenda.  Did we have public comment?  There's no.  This was just a status.  Informational.  Oh, he did.  It is a regular item.  Oh, okay.  So.  Okay.  So, Jared Geiser.  Good evening, everyone.  I came down tonight to speak about the status of this committee.  Because.  I attended the committee on January 7th.  And I was personally troubled by what I saw there.  And because the general plan and the planning commission are the entity that really should be guiding growth and development of our community.  Not this developer club.  And I use that term because I did not see an open and unbiased public forum on January 7th.  I did not.  I saw a strong bias towards some special interests.  And I saw a committee member who had a differing opinion.  Be unable.  To even express that opinion.  And that was a member of the committee being unable to express his own opinion.  That differed from that of the majority.  Which was being favored by the bias.  So.  And I will.  I will say that I disagreed with decisions of the city council.  And decisions of the planning commission over the years.  I've been following major land use decisions for probably six or seven years now.  But I have always felt that there has been a relatively open and unbiased forum for that discussion to occur.  And that is not what I witnessed in that room on January 7th.  And I'm concerned.  That this is subverting the planning commission.  The public entity that the city has.  To guide these things to be looking at the general plan.  And the planning commissioners do not have the same financial interests that the.  That the people at this January 7th meeting who were given the most speaking time.  They did have special financial interests.  So quite frankly I would like to see this committee dissolved and.  But given back to the planning commission this is the planning commission's purview.  And it seems improper to have this other committee subverting the planning commission.  Especially in an unopened and unbiased manner.  So thank you for considering my comments.  Can I thank you.  I guess I'm not sure who to ask this question to or if it's more of a thought that I want to pose but.  Previously our boards and commissions would have committees.  And I was thinking about how it would make a lot of sense for the planning commission to be more involved.  Or at least informed of.  What's going on at the growth and development committee.  Or perhaps for this to become a committee of the planning commission.  So I just want to throw that out there to see if there's any interest or thoughts on that.  Just to respond to some of Mr. Geyser's comments there.  Just as a procedural thing in the committee.  Council member Van Overbroeck and I co-chair.  But in practice we just alternate chair at the meetings.  I won't say who is chairing that meeting.  But and it's yeah it differs sometimes.  And I agree.  That sometimes the conversations haven't been as smooth as they could be.  Also on January 7th there were zero planning commissioners on there.  Now we have two because Mark Wolf is a planning commissioner.  And Ann Byker-Kaufman was just appointed to the planning commission tonight.  Also the intention is that before any recommendations come before the council as a whole.  That they would go to the planning commission.  And certainly be happy to see the planning commission holding their own meetings.  And discussing some of these things in addition to participating.  I don't think that was the scope of the work that council approved.  But we can do that.  We can figure that out later.  This was just supposed to be a quick status committee update.  So why don't you guys meet next time.  Let's bring this back again.  And just make sure we're keeping on track with what the original intent of the committee was.  Reports and communications.  City managers report?  No report.  All right.  City clerk's office annual report is on file.  And in the Granicus if anybody would like to read it.  It's amazing as always.  And council member requests.  Does anybody have any council member requests?  I have one.  But if anybody else has.  I have one.  Okay.  So I just came back from a week in Southern California.  And people are really traumatized by the fires down there.  And so in the 10 hours to drive back.  I was thinking about fire scenarios in Chico.  And one of the things that really alarms me is the idea.  We've got homeless camped in Bidwell Park behind Tiger Ponds.  And or at Tiger Ponds.  And in Lindo Channel.  Right now the vegetation is wet.  We had some rain coming in.  But in a few months we're going to have a real fire problem.  Because the homeless people are building warming fires and cooking fires there.  And so I would like the city attorney to look at our code which is 2.68.030.  Which allows the mayor to declare an emergency.  And to and this would happen once the vegetation or just before the vegetation dries out.  To permanently close Bidwell Park, Lindo Channel and Tiger Ponds to people camping.  So if you could explore that and do it in a way that the mayor and I are starting to get along here.  So I don't want to see her go to jail.  So if you could keep that in mind.  So I concur with your concerns.  There was a fire in Lindo Channel by the Gwyn Bridge.  Only by the grace of God in our excellent fire department did that not spread into that neighborhood right there.  And that was a real concern over there.  And part of that is the vegetation we believe that was started by.  So in camping in that area I think this is a very timely issue.  And I think it is an emergency one that we need to get on top of right now and not wait until fire season.  Is that a second?  That's a second.  Okay.  And are you asking for that to come back at the earliest meeting possible?  Yes, thank you.  Thank you.  I would like to waive the rules and bring it back next week.  Okay.  The council agrees to that.  Okay.  That doesn't require a whole like waive the rules vote?  It's part of the motion.  Is that enough or do we need to do a motion to waive our rules?  If you approve it then you are thereby waiving the rules unless the city attorney.  By the nod?  Yes.  That's just form.  You can do either way.  Right.  And the other thing is that we will need a write up on that because the agenda will try to be getting that out tomorrow or Thursday.  So we'll bring it back at the very next meeting.  So let me just get that in there.  All right.  Council member Goldstein.  Although I feel we're already banning camping in these places in general, I'm always happy to discuss.  So I.  Council member Hawley.  Yes.  Council member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Carries 7-0.  And I just have a real quick one.  Given that the fires that we're seeing down in Southern California, I would like to request that the fire chief provide the council an update on Chico's readiness for fire and any concerns that you may have.  I would also request that this come back at the soonest date possible.  I'm not saying the next meeting because that agenda is going out in two days.  But if it's ready in two days, that would be great.  Just whenever possible, just let us know so the community can know and hear where we are at on fire readiness and any concerns from our fire chief.  I think that was brought up in public comment today.  I'll second that.  Okay.  Council member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council member Hawley.  Yes.  Council member O'Brien.  Yes.
