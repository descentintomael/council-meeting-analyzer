Anyone wishing to address the council on any matter listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card that can be found at the back of the chamber on that small table back there. Turn to my left, to your right, to the city clerk, and once speakers have started, no further cards on that particular issue will be taken. So make sure to get in your cards before whatever issue you want to speak on begins. So, and then we will go to our July 9th, 2024 closed session announcement. Do you want to just run there? Pardon? It's item 1.5 from the July 9th closed session. Oh, I'm sorry. Coming off guard there. Yeah, July 9th, the city council recessed in closed session for a special closed session item regarding Warren v. Chico. The city council was briefed, direction was provided, and no final action was taken. All right, and then closed session announcement from July 6th. Thank you, Mayor. This evening, the city council recessed in closed session. All council members were present. Item 2.1, conference with labor negotiators. The only bargaining group that was discussed during closed session was Chico Fire Management employees. The city council was briefed, direction was provided to staff. No final action was taken. Items 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, city council was briefed, direction was provided, no final action was taken on those items. That concludes my report. All right, thank you very much. Consent agenda, all matters listed on the consent agenda can be considered routine in nature and can therefore be enacted in one motion. Do we have any speakers? We do. We have one, Bryce Goldstein. All right, three minutes. Okay, go ahead and come up. Yeah. That was quick. I thought public comment was first. Hi, good evening. I'm Bryce Goldstein. I just want to make one quick comment. There's an agenda item on changing the lease agreement for the Chico Arts Center at the depot. And as somebody who pretty frequently uses Amtrak services, whether that's the thruway buses that connect to rail in Sacramento or occasionally taking the Coast Starlight, I just want to note that there is still a need for a safe place for passengers to wait. And we don't have that right now because since 2020, that waiting room has been closed. So if there's any way for the Chico Arts Center to also include public access to a safe waiting spot and a restroom there that's in the train depot, that would be... That would be great. And this is regarding 2.7. Thank you. All right, thank you. And do you want any... Anyone want to pull an item? Yeah, I want to pull item 2.7. Yeah. I do not be putting on 2.6. That's the SEIU. Okay. And disqualification on 2.6 from Council Member Tanden. Any further? All right. Entertain a motion. Moved. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second.

Second. council member winslow yes vice mayor reynolds mayor coolidge hi carrie 70. all right item 2.7 councilman winslow so ms goldstein introduced this uh this is a proposal to give um a lease agreement to allow the chico arts center which already occupies part of that depot the train depot um to occupy the rest of the building um up until just a few years ago this was a train depot that functioned as such and you would wait there for the train which only really comes in the middle of the night or the buses would come at more regular times through the day it hasn't been available for waiting or for bathroom in a while and so the use of by the chico arts center we can see an improvement but if things go well we will be using this as a transit depot again there are currently buses that pass through there i took one just a saturday for last with about a dozen other people and we we want to make sure people are like safe and comfortable using using the bus and train and so i was concerned that giving them use of the space would preclude us from using it for that function anymore and that some of their activities could potentially conflict with people either leaving their vehicles there to take the train or the bus overnight or something of that so i brought this up to the city manager earlier and we talked about what ways that we could solve this potentially and he suggested that we just include in the lease agreement that either parties would be able to um terminate the clause term terminate the agreement in 30 days so include a clause like that and that way so the chico arts center has an understanding that there are multiple uses here people do wait for the bus there and um and then if we do get to the point of having agreement with amtrak greyhound slash flix bus to use that uh keep it open for passengers then we can pursue that with like collaboratively with chico art center or terminate the lease and pursue it separately so that would be my motion is to approve the lease agreement with the um subject to a 30-day termination clause available to either party on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on Yes, vice mayor Reynolds mayor Coolidge.
