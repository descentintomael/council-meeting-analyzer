 Thank you.  All right, welcome everybody to the regular Chico City Council meeting.  Before we call it to order, some of us are in PV or Chico high colors  because we've got the biggest political contest coming up,  not the election, but rather the Almond Bowl on the 14th.  So if you haven't bought your tickets for the raffle for the car,  do that to support our high schools.  Anyway, welcome everyone, and we'll call it to order  and start with our invocation.  by Ann Mattson from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Yes, come on down to the podium.  Thank you so much for being here.  I pray that my spirit might be with you.  I think that we then have to make the closest decisions  that we make to the people of the East of our country,  for our community.  I pray that God bless those who are in the areas where there's more conflict,  and the peace that might be there.  I pray that God bless those in the Eastern part of the United States  where there are more problems.  I pray that God will bless and strengthen those  who are rescuing the people.  And [inaudible]  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  their  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Okay.  Now we are moving on to the mayor's achievement.  And arts awards, which we're very happy to do these.  And Monica, if you could just tell us a little bit about these and the history of them.  I'd appreciate it.  Sure.  Absolutely.  So the Arts Commission has been an institution in the city of Chico for 30 years.  So tonight as the current chair of the Chico Arts Commission, I stand on the shoulders  of citizens, council members, and former commissioners who have come before me.  October is Arts and Humanities Month.  And so long ago, the commission decided to honor that by having the mayor's achievement.  And so we're going to have the mayor honor some special people in Chico for their achievements.  In the previous years, it was just for outstanding organization or individual artists.  And in recent years, we've added the patron.  Because a patron, people who consume the art, help make a healthy art ecosystem.  So we just really appreciate this award that's being given to this evening and these amazing  people who have earned it.  All right.  And this is definitely one of the more fun things that I get to do.  So if we can have Jess.  Yes.  Jess Mercer come forward.  Congratulations.  You can stand up here in the center and we'll read this in recognition of Jess Mercer's artistic  contributions to the community.  Jess Mercer is tirelessly committed to the art of healing and the youth of our community.  Through her organization, U County Arts on Wheels, and the Balanced Brain Project, Jess  proves to be an advocate for the arts, healing, art, and arts education.  Thank you.  And she's a force in the local art community that should be celebrated and honored.  Congratulations.  So you got a little more work in there.  Okay.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  All right.  Congratulations.  All right.  Next we have the Steele family.  If they could come up and join us.  Come on down.  All right.  All right.  I also have something else to give them too.  All right.  This is in recognition of the Steele family's ongoing support for the arts in Chico.  The Steele family has been long-term art patrons in our community,  with Claudia Steele as a prolific artist and Roger Steele contributing to the arts and education in Chico for many years.  Through being active in the arts and culture community and donating time and funding,  to keep the arts as part of their legacy, the Steele family has contributed greatly to our community  by teaching others about the importance of art.  Thank you so much.  I want to share with you.  Thank you.  All right.  Last but definitely not least, Chico Arts Center.  Woo!  Nice.  Thank you.  In recognition of Chico Arts Center's contributions to the cultural vitality of our community,  Chico Arts Center is a vital part of the Chico art community.  They stayed very active and creative in keeping the Open Studios Art Tour going through the pandemic  and continue to be the go-to organization for local arts.  Chico Arts Center remains a leader in art and art education,  from classes to open studios and exhibits.  Chico Arts Center provides a space for the community to connect with the art and arts.  Thank you so much.  .  All right.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  All right, now at this time,  we will have a presentation  by the Butte County Local Food Network.  And I believe we have a panel, Larry?  Yes.  Welcome.  Thank you.  Let me see if I can get this running.  Hi, and I wanted to thank you so much  for being willing to listen to our presentation  of the Butte County Local Food Network assessment  for local food here.  I'm trying to find the little thingy over here.  I can't find the...  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Thanks for your patience.  I'm not seeing...  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  We got a grant from the North Valley Community Foundation  and Butte Strong Fund last year in 2021  to...  to write this local food assessment,  which is the...  gathers data both...  both...  both through interviews like focus groups  and personal interviews with farmers and producers  and all sorts of different people involved  in all aspects of the food system.  We did focus groups  with different members of the community.  And we also gathered a great deal of data  from online different databases  with the USDA,  California Department of Food and Ag,  the county and other places.  It resulted...  resulted in two documents,  two major documents.  One is the executive summary,  which is about a 14 or 15-page document  because the full report is about 86 pages  and has a lot of information in it  and plus about 17 appendices.  I'm happy to send the links to all of those  and encourage everybody to listen to...  to take a look at them,  whether you're in decision-making positions  like yourselves or just the general public  because it's got a lot of...  a lot of really good information in it.  So, as this thing says,  our food system is very complex.  It's difficult to understand.  A lot of people just...  you know, you go to the grocery store  and you think that's all there is to it,  but there are a whole lot of steps in between there.  And that's the case on a global level,  but also on a local level.  Oh, why is that not working?  I'm not going to read these...  oops, I'm not going to read this stuff  because people can read.  But, you know, we've got a great...  a lot going on here that a lot of other areas  don't have going on.  You know, others may have hurricanes or floods.  We have droughts and fires and all sorts of good stuff,  which impact the ability to grow food here,  but also the fires have a lot to do with...  be able to distribute food.  The important piece on this page...  sorry, I'm having a hard time with this tech...  is to understand that about 33%, a third,  and...  this was from data from 2017 because at the time  when we gathered the data,  USDA had not come out with their most current  agricultural reports.  So at that time, before the fire, before COVID,  before a whole lot of stuff,  we were already at one third of our population  having a difficult time accessing food.  A lot of that having to do just with the breadth  and the span on the size of our community, our county,  and also...  because of...  I'm sorry, population dis...  you know, population disbursement.  Food security, local food security is just one piece  of a very big puzzle in the food system.  This is what the food system looked like before COVID.  It was very, very complicated.  There were all sorts of like just-in-time metrics  that depended on things arriving in time,  having to do with packaging, having to do with fertilizer,  having to do with inputs for the different foods,  for different kinds of like processed foods.  You know, all the different ingredients would have to go  across the world and here and there and get all coordinated.  Different places, the food system that developed over  from about the 50s to now, transformed from local...  like more centralized food and processing and distribution  to a global network where each area was picked  for its own specialty, such as in our area,  rice and almonds and walnuts.  Those are our three main...  And then that was all grown here  and then dispersed throughout the world.  So for instance, people might grow something here,  but they would ship it all the way down maybe to LA  or somewhere in the middle of the company  and then have it shipped back here.  That is a very fragile system because it's very complex  and it wasn't until COVID that all of that got exposed.  We're not really starting to see the effects of COVID until now  because when you're talking about the food system,  impacts that start now, we won't see them for 18,  a month to two years.  So we're really starting to see the issues that are going on  that started in COVID but are very exacerbated now.  And this shows some potential issues that we thought would be happening  in the beginning of the year and that have happened.  Food prices are skyrocketing.  I will report that today I saw a security guard at Raley's  on East Avenue and I'm hearing that many,  many grocery stores are doing that now because there's a whole lot of theft going on.  Things like cheese and meats and formula  and stuff actually have those security things on them now,  literally before people buy them across the country.  I've been hearing food security guards will be in grocery stores more  and more as this situation continues,  which is why we are sounding the alarm because this situation is only going  to get worse as the months go by into next year.  We do have many examples though about around the,  country about different areas that have been looking at this situation  for years now, Vermont being one of them.  They've been devoted to food security  and establishing a strong local food economy and food system.  And then there are other places around the rest of them are from California.  So we have a lot of models in that we can draw on that are really, really great.  So it's like food security and local food system attention and support and investment.  Really does make a great a lot in a community.  I keep looking to the Vermont Farm to Plate because they are,  their population is not that different from our tri-county or five-county region.  They're about 600,000.  And so they were able to really change their food system  by having a statewide effort to do that.  Why have local food?  It's really, really a smart thing to do.  You know, it results in all of these things.  I mean, especially water.  Water is a big deal with us right now.  And also there's economic benefits,  which our area could definitely use in this.  Okay, so funding.  One of the challenges is that USDA and California Department of Food and Ag  have a lot of requests and a lot of pull on them.  We are part of a grant with USDA that,  where they started off with one billion offering  and they got $18.4 billion.  So that's a lot of dollars in proposals.  They have announced their large proposals,  which were five million up to $100 million already.  And then they will announce the smaller ones.  But as you can see, they're very competitive.  They make it very clear that it's really hard to get these things.  And also CDFA, California Department of Food and Ag, is easier.  But still there is a tremendous amount of competition.  I am very excited to be able to report though that CDFA is doubling  their farm to school availability of funds.  It had increased exponentially to 33 million last year and is 66 now.  66 million for 2023.  So my big message to everybody farm wide,  I've presented to the Board of Supervisors  and a number of smaller organizations around the county  to start investing in our food system,  investing in our children's future,  and investing in security here and abroad  because it is the case,  and it's been studied that we are only nine meals away from civil anarchy.  Or as I like to say,  people get very ugly when their children are hungry.  Okay, so I got this thingy.  Okay.  Oops.  Okay.  So what are we doing to address this?  So we had this local food assessment and it was,  then it was like, okay,  we rewrote it with the intention of creating a group of people,  everybody that we could think of that is involved in the food system,  to come together and create a plan together.  The food assessment had,  it has information, challenges and suggestions about whether areas are doing,  but we didn't feel like it was our place to make recommendations,  that that was something the whole community should come together to do.  We didn't really know how it was going to happen.  We did apply for a USDA grant to support it,  but didn't get it because a lot of reasons,  but because we're in Butte County and not the Bay Area basically, but,  um, um, North,  Valley Community Foundation and their lead program stepped forward along with Adventist Health  and is supporting this process.  So it's called the Food Security Collaboratory,  kind of like the Camp Fire folks.  That's based on that structure.  Laura Kutsona and Scott Winter of Brain Friendly Dynamics  are facilitating our county coming together.  We have over 58 organizations that have been participating all the way from United Way  to Red Cross to the Butte County Office of Education.  We have a representative from Assemblyman Gallagher's office that is participating.  Todd Kimmelschuh and Deborah Lucero both have been participating.  We have, we are opening up American African American Cultural Center,  the Hmong Center, someone from the Mechoopta Tribe is with us.  So we are really trying to cast a wide net to get everybody at the table from the beginning  to get their input and buy-in with how do we become more food secure,  and food sovereign here, and not be at the whim of breakdowns in the global food supply.  So out of that process, we've already had four meetings, five now actually,  and we have action teams in place.  We have a tech action team, a policy action team, an education action team,  which is both schools and public education,  and then we have an infrastructure and capacity team.  So those are the broad teams that we came up with after all of our meetings.  So we're moving forward, we're creating concrete and specific plans to move forward,  and we are already collaborating more as individual organizations,  which was, that was one of the biggest gaps that our food assessment showed was  that there was a lot going on in our area,  but that we weren't talking to each other,  so that there was a lot of overlap and siloing and all that kind of stuff,  so that there was a lot of overlap and siloing and all that kind of stuff,  and we're all working together now.  And we're all working together now.  And we're all working together now.  And we're all working together now.  And we're all working together  And we're all working together  And we're all working together  We're setting up meetings to start planning now for next year's grant availability so that we can bring as much of the state money to the area as possible.  So my ask for the council is to become involved for somebody from the city, like we have a representative from the city of Oroville, to join us in this effort to plan a stronger local food system together.  I would also like to ask for more representation and communication about ways that Chico could loosen up its policies and its regulations to as facilitate more local food being grown within the city.  The city of Oroville, you know, I was able to find out, you know, Chico, Paradise, and Oroville to research what their policies are there.  And we found that Oroville is the most sustainable.  It's more supportive of local food than Paradise.  Chico has a lot in place but has a ways to go.  So I thank you so much for listening.  And I look forward to pestering, as I told the board of supervisors, pestering you in the future and coming and visiting you to talk about this topic with you.  And I'm open for any questions that you might have.  All right, question.  I had a question on the farm to school.  Is that more about getting?  Farm food to feeding students or teaching students about farming or both?  Both.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because I know that Chico has the farm that they do and teach out of and have some great programs going.  Yeah.  And CORE also.  CORE has an amazing urban farming sector.  And we're starting to work more with through a project we have called GROWN, Growing Resilient Optimism with Nature.  That's what the acronym is for.  And we are starting to work to get that.  And working.  And working with the different school garden folks and the master gardeners and, you know, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.  You know, to work together to start that happening at a younger age so that kids are more exposed.  But it also part of the CDFA grants are about support for the schools to buy more local food.  So both.  Yeah.  Sure.  Anything else?  All right.  Any other questions?  Comments?  Council Member Brown?  Yeah.  Just a quick comment.  Thank you for being.  Thank you for sharing this work with us.  For members of the public.  I know that obviously larger scale policy change is ideal for creating sustainable local food systems.  But for members of the public who are interested in getting involved in your work, what would you offer to them?  Sure.  I would invite them to visit our website.  Of course.  It's BC.  I should have had a little thing of that.  It's BClocalfood.org for Butte County Local Food Network.  We do a variety of projects to support local food security.  We do a variety of projects to support local food security.  Such as seed saving.  We leave little tiny seed packets in tiny libraries around the county.  We install gardens in people's backyards through our garden blitz, which is in the spring.  They get a garden package.  We have a community garden.  We have a farmer's market mobile is what we call it.  To be kind of like a Batmobile.  That's why we call it the Batmobile.  Good company.  We bring fresh food up to Concow and Megalia.  Fresh local food.  Hyper local, actually.  What else?  Gosh, we do so much.  We have educational programs.  We have one of our newer programs is called 1,000 Acres More.  And it's to encourage people to come together in their communities because we believe food has a way to bridge political divides.  And bring people together because you don't have to argue about politics when you're talking about canning tomatoes.  So, anyway, this program encourages people to transform their yards from grass, which is just a water sucker,  to a garden.  And we have a food forest, which makes it more water-wise and enables people to not have to water as much, but also be able to get food and share it with their neighbors.  Okay.  Any other questions?  BClocalfood.org.  Yeah.  Other questions?  Thanks, Pam.  I appreciate it.  You betcha.  I've been super impressed over the last several years how much BC, Buchanan Local Food Network has grown and evolved.  So, it's pretty amazing to watch.  Thanks.  And we've had 50 gardens and backyards since March 2020.  Yeah.  Cool.  Thank you so much for your time.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  I don't know how to turn this off.  I'm sure you guys can.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Squared away.  All right.  We'll move on to the consent agenda.  All missed matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and hereby enacted in one motion.  Do we have any counsel disqualifications or no votes?  Any speakers?  All right.  Entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  We have a motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  I apologize.  Takes me just a second.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Business from the floor.

The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have four.  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  James Hutchinson followed by Adela Carrillo. I'm sorry.  Unfortunately, because you Unfortunately, because you decided that my district once again. Our people who live in the largest rental complex and    the reason why the people of  Mexico can't vote in the next election for a district representative.  Thank  Thank  Thank  Thank  Many  Many  Many  Proposition H. Why do you vote no? No taxation without representation. Familiar to any of you? That's what's happening here. I'm being asked to vote for a proposition. Several hundred people, 226 people at least have the potential to vote.  Those people are out. The complex next to us, 100 and something people, 300 and something. Add the other places that have been done, you're well over 600 people.  A people who will not be able to vote again for a district representative.  We're being told we should accept the virtual representation of somebody from District 7 that we didn't vote for.  We didn't choose. We didn't want. Period.  That's how it is.  And you think it's okay. That's great of you.  But because I have no representative, I'm going to have to be here a lot more often.  I'm going to have to gather people up to individually represent themselves.  To come here and speak.  It's going to cut the amount of time people speak, but what the heck.  It's what you want, right?  It's what you asked for.  It's called the law of unintended consequences.  It's what you're doing.  Here's the bottom line, though.  The history of this country.  There are three groups of people in the early days of this country that couldn't vote.  Slaves, women, and renters.  If you rent it, you could not vote.  In this country, we overcame that.  Thomas Jefferson famously tried to say with the Louisiana Purchase,  we should give each renter a small parcel of land.  And even if we gave all a small parcel of land, we would be enabling them all to vote.  And there would still be a huge amount of land left over from that.  But here's what happens now.  Justice Hugo Black pointed out something even more ominous about this.  And let me finish with this.  He shared the thought that in Westbury versus Sanders,  that no right is more precious in a free country than that of having a vote in the election of those who make the laws  under which, as good citizens, we must live.  Other rights, even the most basic, are illusionary.  If the right to vote is not the right to vote, then the right to vote is the right to vote.  If the right to vote is undermined.  I thank you for your time, but you're going to see me a lot more, and you're not going to like it.  Thank you.  Adela Carrillo, followed by Nancy Park.  Hello, Council.  My name is Adela Carrillo.  I've come here to speak to you all today about a matter that is very important to me  and to ask for your help in making Chico and student drivers my age safer.  This issue was brought to my attention.  On September 20th of this year, when I was involved in a major car accident  at the intersection of West First Avenue and Arcadian.  I've been passing through this intersection since I started at Chico High,  and I have family who lives just up the road.  My family and all of their neighbors will say that this intersection is notoriously dangerous around school hours.  Even after my accident, I kept using the intersection.  And on September 22nd, there was another very similar accident,  in the same intersection, at the same time of day,  a block away from Chico High, ten minutes after school had ended.  I was heartbroken to see more people suffering from this issue.  My peers and I have stated that this intersection, West First Avenue and Arcadian,  is a danger to us on our route to and from school.  I'm here to ask you all to make this intersection a four-way stop.  This will increase safety before school for the numerous students and parents turning left onto Arcadian Road,  and from West First, and it will help reduce congestion on Arcadian between West Sacramento and West First Avenue,  because the drivers will not have to wait as long for the intersection to clear.  It will help reduce speed at all hours of the day,  and will not interfere with regular traffic when school is not in session.  This is a necessary change due to the high volume of students who are using this intersection,  many of which have gotten their license in the last year and are not experienced or safe drivers by any means.  The two additional stop signs,  will increase safety for the city as a whole.  The waving and inching forward method will stand no longer.  Thank you all for listening, I appreciate your support.  Thank you.  Ms. Carrillo, can I ask a quick question?  Would you mind emailing your comments to the City Council?  Of course, I can do that as well.  Thank you.  Is that an email address that I can find on your website?  Or to the City Clerk?  You can just send it to me and I'll get it to them.  Perfect, okay, I appreciate that.  Thank you, Adele.  Nancy Park, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Hi, if I had known I would have worn my Chico High class of 1972 t-shirt.  Go Panthers!  But I'm here to say it's time to seriously consider the North State Shelter Team's proposal for a managed campground for people who are homeless.  That group of activists has identified vacant land the owner has agreed to provide for the campground.  From years of research,  they have developed a 41-page plan and it's very impressive.  This would be a real campground with porta-potties, dumpsters, 24-hour security.  A place where people could access services.  It would offer a real contrast to the current small strip of pavement and weeds along Eaton Road that the county has told the hundreds of people who are camping throughout our public spaces to go to.  Anyone who wants to go to the campground,  you can go to the city council's website.  You can see that there are not enough shelter spaces left for all the unhoused people living outside.  And there is not enough room at the city's designated campsite for all of them to go.  Other cities have clean, managed campgrounds for unhoused people.  Why not Chico?  At the very least, the North State Shelter Team's plan should be put on a city council agenda.  The team can present its plan.  And the public and the council can make a decision.  And the city can ask questions and learn the details.  I really believe this plan has merit and should at least be considered by the council.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannulli is our last speaker.  Good evening, council.  First up, I would like to echo Ms.  Adela's comments to you guys about the accident that she experienced.  I had an accident at the exact same spot.  My car was completely damaged.  I had to go to the emergency room for that.  The exact same spot.  So I think that's something the city should consider in putting that car away in.  Especially if that's where students are.  I just dropped off my kids at school by the way.  So what I came to say really has to do, again, with our unhoused situation and access to services.  I would like to feel like our city isn't inadvertently or on purpose, who knows,  using our homeless situation as political standing ground on who to vote for, who not to vote for.  Because we're saying on our bed count that we have beds available.  Why aren't people using it?  Those liberals want to have people out there in the parks.  Well, that's not true.  None of us want to have people living in parks.  We want people in housing.  That's what we're asking for.  Housing and in fact safe campgrounds even.  That's been asked for for years.  That would solve a lot of issues right there.  Safe parking as well.  We have RVs.  Nowhere to go except our neighborhoods.  But if the city did something about it and provided some place, officials, safely to go, we would have people out of people's neighborhoods.  And that is something that our city has asked for repeatedly.  When it comes to accessibility, we look at bed count.  We're counting Torres beds.  I don't know if all of you know, but Torres is a great resource for one.  But they do have three stacked beds.  So when you think about who is in the middle of the city,  who are homeless population is, many of them have disabilities.  Many of them are seniors.  And I don't know if any of you can picture yourselves climbing up on a third story bed to sleep at night.  So that's possibly why we still have some open beds over there at Torres.  Just the accessibility factor alone.  When it comes to the pallet shelters, I don't know what is going on with the city in allowing people to get in there.  We should have no open pallets.  None.  We have people begging to get in.  But they can't.  Why is that?  That's something the city has to own accountability for instead of pointing fingers at the people saying they don't want to access it because it's not true.  And the liberals out here, we don't want to have them staying in the parks either.  That creates a fire risk.  People don't belong there.  They're in danger.  We all want people housed.  And open that accessibility up helps solve that.  And we need to do that as a city.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And she was our last speaker.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  We will start with public hearings.  And we have a few.  So hearing under the 4.1, hearing under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which is TEFRA, to consider the issuance of tax exempt revenue bonds for new medical facilities.
