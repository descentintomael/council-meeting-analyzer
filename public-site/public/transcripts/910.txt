 Call to order the regular Chico City Council meeting of July 7th to 2020.  Please join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  And Madam Clerk, may we have the roll call, please? And Madam Clerk may we have the roll call please. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Ory? Here. Council Member Reynolds? Here. Council Member Stone? Here. Vice Mayor Brown? Here. Mayor Schwab? Here.  Vice Mayor Brown? Here.  Mayor Schwab? Here.  Please note that this meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N-2920.  The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or through the Granicus platform,  which can be found on the City's website, with remote public participation allowed in the following ways.  Public participation during the meeting, the Engaged Chico Civic Engagement Program will be available for citizen input on individual agenda items,  both prior to and during the meeting, and that program can be accessed through the City's website.  Public comment will also be accepted by email, which can be sent to the publiccomments at chicoc.gov email address during the meeting,  prior to the close of public comment on an item.  The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item,  and not to comment on numerous items.  In one email.  It is our hope that we will be able to find a location that will enable social distancing,  so that we can bring the public back into our meetings,  so that we can have direct interaction with them.  First item is the Consent Agenda.  The Consent Agenda is for items that are routine in nature,  and can be enacted by one motion.  In the example in the left,  Are there any email comments?  In the Engage platform, we receive 20 comments on the various items.  And when I go to read the names, I'll read them all for the consent agenda.  And are there any civic engagement or Engage Chico?  Is that total?  That's total for Engage.  I don't know if Danny has any for public comments.  Okay.  So we will give five minutes to review the comments.  And if we finish early, that's fine.  And then we'll take action.  Okay.  So the comments in the Engage Chico platform came in from Yvonne Johnson, Juanita Sumner,  on item 13.  And on item 2.1.  And on item 2.2, we received one from Yvonne Johnson and Juanita Sumner.  And on item 2.3, Yvonne Johnson and Juanita Sumner also spoke on that item.  And I believe they did as well on item 2.4.  And then on item 2.5, we received additional comments from Claudette Ritter, Larry Coleman, Yvonne Johnson, Juanita Sumner.  And on item 2.6, we received two.  And those were from Yvonne Johnson and Juanita Sumner.  And on item 2.7, we received comments from Yvonne Johnson, Susan Smead, John Brown, Dave Howell, Juanita Sumner.  And on item 2.8, there was...  There was a comment received from Yvonne Johnson, which were on the minutes.  As well as...  Robin Engle, Yvonne Johnson, Jody Taylor.  Oh, excuse me.  That's business on the floor.  I apologize.  So, Danny, who do you have for the speaker?  Okay.  Okay. !  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Have all council members had an opportunity to read the comments?  Yes.  Okay.  So are there any disqualifications or no votes on the consent agenda?  I'd like to pull 2.1, please.  2.1?  If there are no others, I would entertain a motion to approve the consent agenda.  Move to approve.  There's a motion to approve by Council Member Huber and a second by Vice Mayor Brown.  Call the roll, please.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Horry?  Barred.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Okay.  Item 2.1 from the consent agenda has been pulled by Council Member Huber.  Would you like to address that?  I'd just like to ask Mr. Jarrett to comment on the letter that we received from Californians  for homeownership on this issue.  Okay.  On business from the floor, I believe I received,  five comments in the Engage Chico platform.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  Mr. Huber asked Mr. Jarrett to comment.  I'm sorry.  I was trying to do IT stuff.  That's fine.  So go ahead.  What was that?  We're not quite ready for you yet.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes.  The letter from Matthew Gelfand from Californians for homeownership.  This is the latest.  It is in a series of letters from this organization advising of their objection to the way we  are handling the ADU ordinance.  This ordinance is consistent with state law in our opinion.  We simply have a difference of opinion with Mr. Gelfand.  There are some areas that are, shall we say, gray in the law that we can, that we are,  trying to protect the city's interest the best we can, namely those dealing with the  pathway to the rear of the house.  And I think Mr. Amba can speak to any others that are of issue.  But we do not agree with Mr. Gelfand's assessment to the extent that ultimately an ordinance  is found invalid.  The first step in that would be that this is proposed.  This.  Ordinance once approved is submitted to California Department of Housing and Community  Development, HCD.  They look at this and will say yay or nay to any portion of it.  If after that someone challenged it legally, the remainder would remain in effect as each  portion is severable.  So he mentions litigation here.  We're not concerned based on our understanding of how the process will go down of that happenstance.  I believe we're always concerned about litigation.  We do the most we can to avoid it.  We believe that the ordinance as proposed fully addresses what state law requires and  fully addresses what cities can.  And cities like Chico is a charter city.  It's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization that's an organization  So a motion by Council Member Huber and seconded by Council Member Stone.  Okay.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Sorry, they're not coming up.  Council Member Ory?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  I'm going to have to wing this one.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  We'll go to business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda.  Council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda.  How many engaged Chico comments did we have?  We received five from that platform.  And did we receive any e-mails?  Yes.  Wacking up and third from...  Okay.  Let's take a couple of minutes to review those while you read the names.  Okay.  So we received comments from Robin Engle, Yvonne Johnson, Jody Taylor, Susan Smead, and  Emily Smith.  I'll let them bring up...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Okay.  Peanut.  I like peanut gold and rum.  Dominoes? Dominoes. Has council had enough time to review the comments?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 4.1 is a resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico approving General Plan Safety Element Text Amendment incorporating the local hazard mitigation plan.  Okay.  Okay.  Hello.  State legislation, Assembly Bill 2140,  Council's resolution for other directed staff to receive  with an amendment to the general plan C element  in court voting for local housing application plan  by reference.  This, by doing so, this insurance are eligible  for future staff's or local funding,  which is provided for you tonight.  If the requirements of AB 2140 are not met,  the City will not be allowed to apply for a property  with a 6.2%  of the new person dollars .  The general plan amendment is exactly  from C-flat and is consistent  with the general plan policy framework.  At its May 21st, 2020 meeting,  the City of Chico Planning Commission  forwarded a recommendation to the City Council  to approve the requested general plan amendment.  The Planning Commission and Community Development Director  recommend the City Council hold a public hearing  on the proposed general tax amendment  and adopt the following resolution.  Resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico  approving general plan safety element tax amendment  incorporating the local hazard mitigation plan.  With that, I'm happy to answer any questions.  Does Council have any questions?  Then we will hold a public hearing  on the proposed general plan tax amendment.  How many comments did we receive from engaged chief?  One comment, and that was from Yvonne Johnson.  Did we receive any emails on this item?  No emails.  Just take a few seconds to review that.  Also have enough time to review the comments?  No.  So we will close the public hearing.  Move to approve.  So we have a motion from Council Member Stone,  seconded by Council Member Huber.  Okay.  Let's see.  Council Member Huber.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Orry.  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds.  Aye.  Council Member Stone.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Aye. Carries seven zero. Item 4.2 amendments to title 19 of the chief of municipal code section 19.27.010 and 19.52.100  It's carried 7 0.  It's carried 7 0.  It's carried 7 0.  It's carried 7 0.  It's carried 7 0.  It's carried 7 0.  It's carried 7 0.  It's carried 7 0.  It's carried 7 0.  with our practices for issuing Foothill Development Permits.  Minor projects would continue to be exempt  from the requirement to get a Foothill Development Permit.  We would still have protections in place  for more potentially impactful projects.  The purpose of this is it doesn't modify  the Foothill Overlay Zone or any of the protections  in place for that, but it just comes into more  in alignment with our practices for exempting minor projects.  This substantially simplifies and streamlines  the permitting process and the Planning Commission's  recommended approval list and so does  the Community Development Director.  So it's a brief report, but if you'd be happy  to answer any questions if you have any.  Council have any questions?  Mr. Ambrose, can you characterize  what you mean by minor projects?  For example, the definition of development  is broadly interpreted as triggering  any Foothill Development Permit.  So that could be a fence or a patio cover.  Coincidentally, the fees for like a house,  if a subdivision has already been approved  consistent with those standards, is $4,167 currently.  And if we had a minor project like a wall or a patio cover,  those would normally be exempt because the whole subdivision  has been reviewed and approved.  The fees for that, if we had to go back to the previous slide,  are $2,086.  So you're getting rid of, with these amendments,  we'd eliminate that process and exempt those minor projects.  We'd still have protections in place  for more potentially impactful projects.  Thank you.  Then we will open the hearing to the public.  How many comments did we receive on this item  through Engage Chico?  One item from Yvonne Johnson.  And did we receive any emails from this?  Okay.  So let's just take a moment to review that comment.  Council, okay with moving forward?  So we will close the public hearing and entertain a motion.  Move approval.  And if this is an ordinance, so no?  No.  Go for it.  All right.  All right.  Well, yes.  Where the heck did it go?  There it is.  Okay.  Move approve ordinance of the City Council  of the City of Chico amending sections 19-27010  and 1952-100 regarding foothill development permits  and Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code.  Second.  Okay.  So we have a motion from Council Member Stone  and a second from Vice Mayor Brown.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Horry?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Item 5.1 on our regular agenda is ratification of memorandum  of understanding Chico Public Safety Association, CPSA.  Report from Mark Oren and Jamie Cannon.  Good evening, Mayor and Vice Mayor Council.  The item you have in front of you is the final reading  of the CPSA MOU.  As a reminder, the CPSA unit includes our public safety dispatchers,  animal control records, and community services officers.  This is effectively a two-year term agreement,  or year and a half at this point,  and it is a cost-neutral agreement,  and we're happy to put it in front of you.  And if you have any questions, I'm here to answer.  Are there any questions?  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How many comments did we receive through the civic engagement?  We received two.  They were from Yvonne Johnson and Juanita Sumner.  And did we receive any emails?  No emails.  Okay. Let's take time to review those comments.  It's an emotional 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나 !  It's an emotional 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나  지나  지나  지나 ! ! ! !  지나  지나  지나 !  a two-year agreement? It expires in the middle of 2021. It was effective January 1st of this year,  so a year and a half. But going forward? It will expire in the middle of 2021.  And would you characterize most of the agreements with employees as six-year agreements?  Most of our agreements on average are about two to three years. We always try to obtain a three-year  agreement. It's a bit difficult for our labor groups to commit to that long-term of an agreement  with no money on the table, and that's pretty standard in any sort of labor negotiations.  The city hopes to coerce folks into doing a longer-term agreement with an annual re-opener  to discuss salary and benefits. Some groups are comfortable with that. Others, CPSA as an example,  are not. This is the most we can get.  So I'll make the motion to adopt.  The resolution of the Council of the City of Chico providing for pay benefits and other terms  and conditions of employment for the... Oh, wrong one. Resolution of the Council of the City of  Chico approving memorandum of understanding between the City of Chico and the Chico Public  Safety Association regarding pay hours and other terms and conditions of employment for the period  of January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021. Second. We have a motion from Councilmember Huber and  second from Councilmember Stone.  Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Ory? No. Councilmember Reynolds? Yes.  Councilmember Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 6-1.  Item 5.2 is ratification of memorandum of understanding Chico Battalion Chief CBC.  One more for you. This is actually a new classification.  The fire department had a minor reorganization and they now have a middle management group.  They took away their division chief classification and established the Chico Battalion Chiefs.  Because of their function, they didn't fit in either of the existing bargaining units,  so this becomes its own separate unit with three employees. This agreement is a blend between the  existing IAFF fire agreement and the public safety management agreement, so its terms and conditions  are completely neutral.  Happy to answer any questions.  Are there any questions?  What's the term of the agreement?  I do believe this one is a never-ending term because this is simply a pay and benefits resolution.  My gut check tells me this group will petition to be recognized and then we will go through the formal negotiation process.  Madam Clerk, are there any comments on the Engage Chico platform?  Yes, we received two.  One from Yvonne Johnson.  And another one from Juanita Sumner.  And did we receive any emails on this item?  No, we don't.  Okay, let's take a moment to review those comments.  Okay.  Okay.  Has counsel had enough time to review the comments?  Okay.  Entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Is there a second?  Second.  Second.  Okay.  So we have a motion from Councilman...  Second.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  Second from Councilmember Stone and a second from Councilmember Huber.  I could try it this time.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ory?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Okay.  Item 5.3 is consideration to execute a work order with PG&E Project Proposal Phase 1  under the Sustainable Solutions Turnkey SST Program.  And we have a report from Eric Gustafson, Public Works Director, Operations and Maintenance.  Thank you, Mayor Schwab.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Council tonight.  Do you have a presentation to bring up here?  So, yes, this is the Phase 1 Sustainable Solutions Turnkey Program implementation projects,  or energy conservation measures as we call them in the energy reduction industry.  Okay.  We're going to just kind of do it.  We're going to do a quick program review of the Sustainable Solutions Turnkey Program,  the identified Phase 1 energy conservation measures, a funding outline,  and how we're going to finance these projects,  and then, of course, we'll end on the staff recommendation.  So, if you remember, the Sustainable Solutions Turnkey Program is a partnership with PG&E  and Southland Energy in large-scale internal energy assessments of city facilities and operations.  2019.  We've heard this before, and there was some robust discussion about partnering with PG&E  and kind of optics of that, and we recognize that and are sensitive to that.  But I think it's important to note that this really makes a lot of sense for us.  PG&E is our energy provider at the time.  At the time.  And the Public Utilities Commission mandates that they put forward rebates, incentives,  on-bill financing options to their rate customers.  And so we qualify for those.  So staff feel it makes the most sense to be able to take advantage of some of those programs that they create.  And so we have to offer that the PUC does mandate.  It also allows us to, it presents a turnkey program that allows city staff to take advantage of those solutions,  reducing design costs, admin costs, project management time, capital outlay costs,  versus the traditional project delivery fashion.  And that really helps us out a lot because we just, with a very lean staffing model,  we don't have a whole lot of bandwidth to do project management components and things like that  on all these types of projects all at once as a bundled package deal.  So it really helps us to have a turnkey solution such as this.  And so therefore, in November 5th, 2019, Council authorized a contract with the Sustainable Solutions Turnkey Program  to complete investment-grade audits to identify deep energy savings projects.  And that's where we're at right now in the process.  The whole point, really, of the Sustainable Solutions Turnkey Program is to reduce our energy consumption and costs,  improve facility performance and comfort,  improve infrastructure,  and reduce maintenance demands.  And of course, advance climate action goals with greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 reductions.  And then leverage cost savings to fund the project.  So this is really the component of the SST program that we really like.  It uses savings from reduced energy and maintenance costs to pay the debt service for design and construction and project delivery.  So here is our building-level energy consumption.  You've seen this before.  This is the most recent data.  This is the most recent data that we have.  In 2019, when we approved partnering with the SST program, we looked at 2017-2018 figures.  This is the most recent data we have.  I should note that it does not include street lights.  So this is just building meters, all other meters other than street lights.  You can see that our wastewater treatment plant here,  get a pointer,  is the lion's share of our annual energy use and costs  at, respectively, Little Island.  So that's over 50% of our total energy costs citywide.  And then the city hall facility is in a close second,  at close to $150,000 in total costs for the year.  So those are the two areas that we're focusing primarily on in these Phase I implementation projects.  This is the citywide building energy allocation.  As you can see, the bulk of our electrical usage is for mechanical cooling.  That's our HVAC systems, primarily in the summer months.  And then the fan energy, this is the fan motors that push the air and circulate the air through the systems  in both the summer and winter months for the heat process and the cooling process.  And then of course here's our natural gas allocation,  which the bulk of our natural gas is used for heating hot water for boilers and furnaces and things.  So with that in mind, again, here's our areas of focus in the Phase I projects.  The wastewater pollution control plant, excuse me, otherwise known as the wastewater treatment plant,  aeration system, the blowers and diffusers.  That's the lion's share of the energy costs at the wastewater treatment plant.  And also citywide mechanical, so our HVAC systems and controls.  And that's what we're going to focus on, these three in the Phase I.  However, you do see those other options there.  I'm kind of giving you a little sneak peek of what's to come, Phase II and Phase III.  We're looking at energy optimization at the wastewater treatment plant with solar, added solar,  looking at maybe upsizing and replacing our co-generator that burns the methane gas.  That's a byproduct of the treatment process.  And maybe even some battery storage.  And then we're also looking at citywide solar opportunities,  and then irrigation and water conservation projects.  So those are to come. I just kind of wanted to share that with you.  That's what we're currently working on now.  But tonight we're talking about the Phase I projects that primarily focus on aeration, HVAC, and HVAC controls.  So through this process,  we've identified six energy conservation measures, or projects, if you will.  The first one, and we'll go through these individually real quickly.  The first one is install diffuser pads in Basin 4 at the wastewater treatment plant.  Install new blowers at the wastewater treatment plant in the aeration process.  Upgrade controls, air handling units, and thermostats at City Hall.  Bringing City Hall to really a vast system of a building, automated system,  where we control it from a desktop versus individual analog thermostats in each individual office.  Expand building automation systems to the MSC campus, police department, council chambers, and the old municipal building.  HVAC unit recondition on a number of our existing HVAC units.  And then a brand new condensing unit on top of City Hall.  So this is the first energy conservation measure.  It's installing 2,000 new diffuser pads in Aeration Basin 4 at the wastewater treatment plant.  We use the point here.  As you can see, the influent comes in through here, goes through the solids removal process,  and then ends up here in the aeration basins.  And this is the most critical component in the biological process.  Where we pump air, dissolved oxygen, through all of these diffusers,  and that's where the microorganisms live, and the oxygen helps them break down the material in the process.  So it's critical to have good aeration in the wastewater treatment plant system.  And it's the largest electrical load.  These blowers and aeration diffusers run 24-7.  They never stop.  And so we have four basins here.  And in basins 1 through 3, staff have replaced the diffusers over the last four years.  And we still need to do basin number four.  And it's really critical to have, you know, fine oxygen bubbles, if you will, in the aeration basins and the aeration process.  Over time, again, they're operated 24-7.  The diffusers get impacted.  The bubbles become inconsistent, causing more energy usage because we have to blow more oxygen through the aeration basins.  So it's critical to have new diffusers in the process.  So this is one of the first projects that was identified by the Southland and PG&E engineers that needed to happen right away to save some energy.  So that's the first project.  Second project is a little bit larger.  Here's the aeration basins here again, and here's the blower room.  So we have four existing blowers that blow the oxygen.  And we have a total of about 10 years of life cycle on them before they need to be remanufactured or reconditioned for another 10 years.  We have a 2010 Turplex blower.  This is the primary blower.  And we actually just finished a reconditioning of that blower last year.  So it's really set and ready to go.  It's 10 years old.  They have about a 10-year life cycle on them before they need to be remanufactured or reconditioned for another 10 years.  We have a 1997 Hibon blower and two 2005 Hibon blowers for three total.  We have an existing capital project that was approved in fiscal year 1920.  And we have a new capital project that was approved in fiscal year 20.  We have a new capital project that was approved in fiscal year 20 to replace the 1997 Hibon blower.  It's close to a million dollar project to replace one of those blowers.  That was approved by council in 1920.  And then when we started this SST program, we realized that there's some potential to replace the other blowers.  And so we kind of halted that project.  And now we're able to use that existing funding to package this deal together and to move forward with it.  And we'll talk about the finances a little bit later.  But energy conservation measure number two is to replace not only one,  but we're able to replace the other blowers.  We're able to replace two blowers with new Neuros blowers that will replace all three of these Hibon.  The Neuros blowers are much more energy efficient, much more technically advanced.  And they could do, two of them could do the work of the three existing.  The next project, energy conservation measure number three, is here at City Hall.  And it's upgrades, controls, air handling units, and thermostats at City Hall.  It's going to replace all the air handler dry motors.  So this is an aerial shot on top of the roof at City Hall.  Here's the two 80 ton condenser units.  80 tons each.  And these are the air handler units.  And each of these air handling units, there's 40 horsepower motors, several of them,  that are the intake and exhaust.  They move the air through the building.  So we're going to reconfigure and replace all of those motors and the air handler units.  We're going to replace the variable frequency drives that control the whole system.  The VAV control boxes.  There's about 100 valve boxes within the facility that delegate or determine if it's going to be hot or cold in each individual office.  It's a pretty complex system.  So we're going to replace all of those valves.  All actuators, sensors, thermostats, giving the facility full demand management capabilities.  Energy conservation measure number four and number five are very similar.  We're going to expand those building automation system components for HVAC at the MSC campus,  police department, old municipal building, and here at council chambers.  We'll get rid of the old analog thermostats on either side and there will be a touch screen system that's easily controlled.  So we're really looking forward to that upgrade.  And then we're going to recondition HVAC units within the city that are between four and 14 years old.  We have about 100 HVAC units, air conditioning units, in city facilities.  And that's a lot.  It really takes up a lot of staff time to maintain those.  I could easily employ a full-time staff member in the facilities divisions just to focus on HVAC.  It doesn't make sense to recondition units that are below four years of age because they're new.  They really don't need it.  Or it doesn't make sense to recondition units above 14 years of age because they should really be replaced.  Life cycle on an average HVAC unit is 15 years.  So there's about 40 HVAC units that are candidates for this reconditioning that we will do through this energy conservation measure.  And finally, one of the ones I'm pretty proud of, energy conservation measure number six, is replacing the south side condenser unit here at city hall.  You see this one here.  It looks a little newer.  That was replaced last year.  Unfortunately, it failed in the summer months of 2019 and caused quite a bit of stress throughout the summer because it was very hard to keep the facility cool.  We worked day in and day out to try to keep the facility manageable.  These 80 ton units are several hundred thousand dollars each, so they're not sitting on the shelf.  They're made to order.  So it took us months to get this built and ordered on an emergency basis.  And we finally got it installed towards the end of 2019.  Before this program, I put in a request to replace the south side condenser here.  They're from the early 90s, so they've well outlived their useful life.  But once we realized we could include this south side condenser in this program, we removed that budget request of general fund dollars from the 2021 budget.  So we removed that request to replace this AC condenser because it looks like we're able to keep it in the sustainable solutions turnkey program.  So here's the finances of phase one.  You can see all six of the energy conservation measures here.  Their costs.  There's no rebates or incentives for these particular projects because we're utilizing on-bill financing option.  So there's no incentives here.  So the net cost is the total project cost.  This column here is the utility savings that we will save on an annual basis.  You can see we just carried this out.  We're just carrying the same numbers over to the operating costs.  There's going to be lots of operating cost reductions with new units that we're installing.  They're a little hard to measure.  We want to just be firm and calculate the utility savings, which is engineered.  And we know for a fact that we will save that amount in utility savings.  So this is just what we're focused on.  However, there will be total operational cost reductions, but we just carried that number over.  We're not factoring it into this ROI for this discussion.  Those are annual savings?  Annual savings.  Yes.  So with these measures, we anticipate saving $235,246 on an annual basis.  So our contribution for the Phase 1 projects is $875,500.  What we have existing in the capital project to replace that existing blower at the wastewater treatment plant,  plus $25,500 from wastewater treatment plant improvement projects that we have.  So we're able to contribute that as our cash for the project.  And then the rest will be financed through 0% on-bill financing.  So there's no additional out-of-pocket cash to deliver these projects.  It's on-bill financing.  The utility savings will pay the debt service for the projects.  And we have an ROI of 7.8 years.  So after 7.8 years, our cash flow will really increase because now we will be realizing the full utility savings.  And I think it's important to note that we all know utility costs will continue to rise.  So what's $235,000 today in 7.8 years from now may be $335,000.  So we're going to really realize an aggressive cash flow once we pay the on-bill financing off, again at 0%.  So just to recap, $2.7 million in total project costs for Phase 1.  Our contribution is $875,000 that we have from existing CIPs.  The remaining amount will be financed at 0% on-bill financing.  Okay.  We're going to start with the utility managers at all.  We don't have to do any of the administrative costs.  It just comes out of our utility bill for on-bill financing.  No out-of-pocket costs with a 7.8-year return on investment.  We want to quickly touch on some of the operational and climate action goals that we'll achieve.  The projects enhance aeration at the wastewater treatment plant, improving operations and resiliency,  while reducing energy consumption by 11% and costs by 10% at that particular facility.  Improves mechanical performance and maintenance efficiencies of HVAC systems at various city facilities with a 25% energy savings.  Reduces greenhouse gases by the equivalent of 777 metric tons of CO2 on an annual basis.  And of course, we're able to access the 0% on-bill financing that PG&E has to offer.  Leverage existing city capital and complete more critical infrastructure work.  So it's staff's recommendation that city council authorize the city management to  execute a contract with PG&E to complete project proposal phase one under the sustainable solutions turnkey program utilizing on-bill financing.  Can I answer any questions?  Questions?  Comment.  Nice work.  Very nice work.  I was proud that we had moved forward with this as a city in November of last year.  And it's finally showing results, but especially with the leverage of existing funds to get our condensers in place.  It's really an 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 !  It's really an 지나 지나 지나  지나  지나 !  지나  지나  지나  지나  restricted funds, however, it's going directly to replace those blowers and we're really getting  two for one. So originally we had one blower budgeted for that amount. We're getting two out  of this program. Okay, so it's something we were going to do already. Correct. And this investment  will pay for some general fund improvements. Absolutely. Because of that is what the  requirement is. It allows us to realize the utility savings and energy savings that will  pay the debt service on all the other projects. So no out-of-pocket costs. Double thumbs up.  Additional questions? When do you expect phase two to come in front of us? In the next couple of months  we'll bring phase two, which are pretty exciting larger projects.  Much bigger than what we're seeing today? Yes.  Yeah, large solar projects that we could potentially do to really offset  the remainder of our energy budget.  Some energy costs, some battery storage  capabilities at the wastewater treatment plant.  Larger solar  projects throughout the city and other  facilities, mainly at the  Municipal Services Center,  our campus over there,  the MSC campus.  And then of course  it's funny going through this process  we really realized how many  irrigation systems we  have and irrigation controllers that we have  that are just completely unmanageable at this point.  So we're really trying to bring all of  those onto one control system, which will be really advantageous.  So I'm really excited about that as well.  So yeah, some big projects in the pipeline that we're excited to bring forward in the next couple months.  This is jumping the gun just a bit on the phase two.  I noticed in the Climate Action Committee survey that went out,  a lot of questions and emphasis on  converting gas systems to electric systems.  Will  phase two be able to  help us with  that initiative to reduce our dependence on gas?  Or I guess instead of maybe a question,  it would be nice to see some savings in  natural gas use during this program.  Yeah, Mayor Sharp, great question.  I think that's really looking at the building industry too.  What will be standards for new homes, new residential homes and apartments that are built.  So I think that's really looking at the building industry too. What will be standards for new homes, new residential homes and apartments that are built.  However, phase two will be looking at reducing our natural gas dependency,  especially when it comes to the cogen that burns methane gas currently,  which is a byproduct from the treatment process.  Right now, we have to blend it to a certain degree because the methane gas is pretty dirty.  It's very hard to clean.  So it's inconsistent and the generator is really temperamental at the current time.  So a lot of times we have to blend it with a newer, larger generator.  Technology has advanced. It cleans the gas a lot better.  So our hope is to reduce natural gas consumption.  So our hope is to reduce natural gas consumption.  So our hope is to reduce natural gas consumption.  So we're looking at the  So we're looking at the public comments.  How many did we receive under Engage Chico?  I received one from Yvonne Johnson.  And did we receive any emails?  No emails.  Okay.  Let's take a moment to review that comment.  Okay.  It's an emotional comment that's really hurtful to see that,  you the comment?  Questions,  comments, or motions?  Move to approve.  So we have a motion to approve  by Council Member Stone, seconded  by Vice Mayor Brown.  Council Member Huber? Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member  Ory? Yes. Council Member Reynolds?  Aye. Council Member Stone?  Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye.  Mayor Schwab? Aye.  Carry 7-0.  So item 5.4,  resolution concerning parking  regulations in downtown  Chico, and  item 5.5, discussion regarding  a draft ordinance  regarding the farmer's market.  I need to recuse myself from  both of those items, and  we'll hand the  gavel to Vice  Mayor Brown.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr.  K 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나  지나  지나  지나  지나  지나 !  지나  지나  지나  지나 !  지나  After the governor's implementation of the stay-at-home order, this council passed Resolution 7-20 back towards the end of March,  which proclaimed a local emergency and in assisting businesses, instituted a moratorium on the collection of parking fees in the downtown.  We did that as a measure to assist the downtown businesses to be able to actually continue operating specifically the restaurants.  We also worked to authorize the placement of A-frames in front of businesses to allow DoorDash, Grubhub, and other companies to go directly in front of the businesses  or residents to park right outside the business to be able to have food dropped off at their window instead of going into the business.  Our volume of activity in the downtown, when we looked at mobility data, which is what you're seeing right now in Excel,  dropped to about 4% of what the normal average weekly.  That's a pretty dramatic drop in the downtown, and anybody who drove through downtown or worked downtown could clearly see the dramatic impact.  We worked with the Downtown Chico Business Association to determine when should we reinstitute the parking meters and the parking enforcement process,  and here's the reason why.  The reason we have this program is to encourage circulation in the downtown.  The last thing we want is to fill every spot 100% of the time.  So that when somebody comes downtown and wants to go to a restaurant, Trace, Ombré's, or anywhere else,  that they have no parking within several blocks of that location.  Because that becomes a disincentive to want to go to that business and pushes them to businesses elsewhere in the city.  From a city perspective, they spend their money, but from a downtown perspective, which is our core and our key,  and in between both the university and the campus, it's a dramatic hit to that sector, geographic area,  and increases the risk of a disaster.  And so we're going to have to take a risk that people will shut our businesses and we end up with numerous storefronts that are not open.  It's not the condition that we want.  And so we predicted an approximate 50% of normal amount that would have been reasonable to assume that there's enough activity that we're filling much of the spaces  and not offering enough open spaces to encourage folks to come back in the downtown that DCBA concurred.  And as you can see in this chart, data as of June 23rd showed that the number of people who came to the downtown,  showed that the weekly visits in June were at about 51% the weekly visits in January and February leading up to the March closures of our businesses.  Data, I updated the data, but the chart does not reflect that.  An additional 5.1% is what we've seen increase, so we're now at about almost 57% of traffic in the downtown mobility wise,  that what we were on a normal range.  And you can see it goes as high as 91,000 and drops.  And then we dropped as low as 5,000, so pretty dramatic there.  The resolutions that we passed in March were extended in May.  The first resolution offered a 90-day moratorium.  The resolution in May, resolution 2020, extended that to the end of the first week, beginning of the second week of August, approximately August 7th.  However, recovery of mobility downtown was much faster than predicted.  And we believe, and so does the DCBA,  that it's time to start implementing parking management in the downtown,  of which parking meters and enforcement is one aspect of that.  The revenue that comes from the parking meters is restricted revenue.  There's a municipal code that defines four different elements of what it can be spent on.  The majority of it, conceptually you can think of from the place I park to the front of the business,  and anything that facilitates that movement and infrastructure can be covered by the parking fee.  It can't go, it can't pay for anything else.  And so that's revenue that we rely upon to rehab the garage.  It's revenue that was intended to support the entire parking management function and implementation of the parking management plan.  Fees, so we were looking at approximately a $1 to $1.2 million a year in annual revenue that comes from the fees.  Parking fines, which are fines, mostly $29 fines for overstay at the meters, generated about $530,000 to $650,000.  That fee is $530,000 to $650,000.  And the fine revenue becomes general fund revenue and is distributed across the general fund departments,  of which public safety is more than two-thirds.  So we were asking the City Council to consider adopting the resolution before you  to cease the moratorium on parking, the parking management, both the fees and the enforcement,  and to implement them starting at the beginning of next week, providing five days to the public and businesses and press  to put the message out.  Thank you.  I'm going to let the Council member get up so that nobody is surprised when they hit the meters on Monday.  With that I'll turn it back to the Vice Mayor.  Questions from Council?  Council Member Morgan?  Chris, have you talked to these guys in the last 24 hours  because everything seems to be going back the other way?  Not in the last 24 hours.  The data that we showed, I mean, the data may have shifted.  The data is approximately four days old for mobility.  So I don't know what has happened in the last four days.  We won't know until four days from now to see what happened between the third...  So let me put it another way.  Is this premature, given that most of the restaurants downtown are probably going to close again?  I realize it wasn't premature when you made the report and got ready for this.  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm not going to name them because I don't want to, but a number of those restaurants are closing again.  The governor's getting ready to close Sutter County tomorrow.  We can't be that far off.  So are we going to be back here a week from now or two weeks from now going, gosh, you know what?  We've got to help these people out again.  That's a very good point.  So how do we avoid it?  How do we not flip-flop?  So really we're talking about tradeoffs.  At this point, we're at about 57% of mobility as of the 3rd.  It may have gone down or it may have gone up depending on the traffic in the downtown.  The data, we don't know when and if we will get to the point where we trigger a closure.  But you're right.  If we are going back to a closure, the last thing we want to do is then have this impediment that then we have to reverse and go back.  And so the council does have the ability to revise the resolution and adopt a future date or authorize us or authorize the city manager at any point after the 13th date, which is listed in the resolution, to implement that program.  And then we just wait and pick a more reasonable time to implement it in partnership with the DCBA.  So that we don't have to come back to council or wait two weeks to come back to council to make any type of change.  That's another option for you.  That's a good option.  Other questions or comments from council?  I'm ready to discuss it more, but I don't know if you need to take comments first.  City Manager Arm, did you have a comment you wanted to make?  Sure.  Just, and I think it kind of attributes to what Chris just said and the question that was raised.  Obviously, in this time, you've...  You've authorized me to be the emergency services director.  And so I do have the ability, if I hear that council's okay with that type of approach, to implement that as necessary if we do see that.  So just realize that's still in your back pocket.  Thank you.  How many comments have been submitted through the Engage Chico platform?  One from Yvonne Johnson.  And how many submitted through email?  No email.  Take 30 seconds to review the comments.  Here's a short one.  Sorry.  In addition to Council Member Morgan's comments and concerns,  I also remember that the discussion of allowing restaurants to use up sidewalks and parking spaces  was limited because of parking meters,  that we didn't want to...  We didn't want to start it until 6 because of meters.  And the feedback I'm getting from restaurateurs is,  is that a word?  That they'd like to do this much earlier.  It makes no sense for them to spend the busy dinner time at 6 o'clock setting up outside.  That needs to be done earlier.  So I would have preferred to see something that at least allowed us to,  I think, partial metering, probably,  would be way too awkward.  I'd be more in favor of extending this another 60 days to see how things are going  and to allow us to help restaurants by implementing a outside dining,  if that's allowed, option.  Mr. Constantine, can you actually speak to that?  No, that's a very, very good point.  And revenue doesn't come just between 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock.  It comes throughout the day in seven days a week.  So with the franchise agreement we have with the DCBA,  we can choose to bag meters throughout the downtown at any point in time within which the permit is active.  And so we've been working with the DCBA and given what we believe was the intent of the council,  it's to exert maximum flexibility to assist the downtown businesses to thrive.  I think with the DCBA's partnership, we can determine what are those times, how, when, what streets,  and if we do implement a parking program,  and I think that's a good point,  and while that's the recommendation, we're open to any change from that.  We can make sure we bag those meters as necessary to allow those businesses to thrive in that manner.  And because this was the sidewalk dining was a part of the conversation here,  is there any update on if, when, how that's happening given council direction?  And so we were hoping for June 18th, which the DCBA's very aggressive date,  that didn't come to fruition.  It was pushed out an additional week,  and due to the logistics issues associated with how would cars move through the downtown,  created a risk to folks that would have been on the street.  And so it was pushed out even more.  With the latest data, as Council Member Morgan identified,  where we're seeing restaurants being reverted back to no internal openings,  there was a decision made by DCBA to further extend that an additional two weeks,  so we're probably looking at something in the order of next week before we would see an implementation.  The downtown.  My hope is that the trend doesn't become such that Butte County is forced into a closure situation.  But whether we are or not, if outdoor dining is allowed, then that becomes our saving grace.  With the caveat that we have to allow the flexibility for the delivery and pick up of food to be convenient  to any business that may be in that corridor.  So it may mean that if I'm arrest, if you close down a street,  we would want to ensure that no further than the edge of the street,  the block, is a location where I can go and park, go pick up the food,  get back in the car and go without interrupting any closure, any closed street area.  Where we put tables out on the sidewalks and the parking spaces,  we would still have to take the same protective measures that we would have if we closed the entire street.  And so we would work with the DCBA to make sure, and Public Works to make sure,  whatever configuration we put ensures public safety first,  and the ability to transact that business in the downtown.  Thank you.  We'll move on to the next item, City Manager Orme.  City Manager Orme, regarding your comment, are you, just to clarify,  are you saying that if we were to pass this this evening,  as the Emergency Manager, you could make the decision to rescind that new,  at a moment's notice, I guess?  That is the capability, but in dialoguing a bit here with the City Attorney,  you could actually memorialize that in the modification,  we could make that a new resolution.  I'm just saying we could make a new resolution that we could make it even more clear  in authorizing the City Manager to do just that without just basically making a statement there.  And I don't know if City Attorney Anderger wants to kind of read the statement that you could potentially add tonight,  if you're more comfortable with that.  Yes.  So one approach would be to,  when or if the stay-at-home order or the no-dine-in restaurant order were  imposed in Butte County or the City of Chico, this language would take care of that.  That the city manager is authorized to restrict collection of fees for meter  service within the downtown Chico parking plan area if restaurant dine-in  closure is implemented.  Other questions or comments from Council?  Just to test to see if there's favor for it, I appreciate that mechanism.  I just like to see it extended a little longer. I think it's, when we talk about  revenue, it certainly wasn't the revenue we would have gotten the last two months.  And it's probably not the kind of revenue we're going to see in the next two months.  So I just think it's a,  it's a,  it is helping and it would be the wrong message that just as we're trying to  open up businesses, though that may be thwarted, that we are also discouraging  people from downtown or at least making it more awkward because they're now starting to get  used to the idea they can just pull up anywhere quickly and not worry about  getting a fine. So I wouldn't move that we extend the, that we approve this,  that we extend the deadline from August 15th or whenever in August by 60 days.  Is that a motion?  Yes.  Can I ask a clarifying question?  Absolutely.  So, Mr. Orr, you're saying let's extend it 60 days and then adopt it with Mr. Jarrod's  thought, or no?  I'm thinking that now we're talking in the middle of October, and we'll have plenty of opportunities in the next few months.  We'll have plenty of opportunity to, sorry, August, September, yeah.  We'd have plenty of opportunity to bring this back and talk about it if we're opening up or if we're not opening up and if things are working.  So.  60 days would be September.  They said it was going to end in mid-August.  Oh.  And so now we're talking.  I thought Chris said that we were going to end this in like five days.  Yeah.  I think what Council Member Orr is asking, 60 days from the original expiration date,  which would have been August 7th, correct?  That's correct.  I didn't realize you were looking for an even earlier date.  Yeah.  But yes, that would be my motion.  Motion on the floor from Council Member Orr.  Council Member Adams, did you have a question?  A question or a comment or a process maybe.  I agree with extending and everything that you're saying.  I guess I'm just trying to figure out can we pass this and give the authority to the  City Manager so we don't have to spend more City Council time coming back and talking this.  We have a great City Manager that makes very good decisions and is very good in touch with  what's going on.  I'm just more inclined to, is there a way that we can go ahead and pass this tonight  and pass that authority to him but yet let him know the goal is to have things open for  another 60 days or assess it every 30 days or whatever.  So we don't have to come back and spend another hour talking about something again at another  meeting.  Council Member Hubert.  Yeah, I'd prefer that we stay, that we give ourselves the opportunity to stay more nimble.  I think a blanket time period may end up being more time than we need.  We can always take that much time if we find that we need it.  If we are to pass this and give the City Manager the ability to put it on hold.  Use discretion.  And to me that feels like a better situation for our businesses.  So are we still waiting for a second or?  There's no seconds to the motion.  Okay, then I would make that a replacement motion.  Just make a motion.  If I would just, in the absence of the motion, just let me ask a couple questions.  So what is the effective date?  Mark, does it become a replacement?  Do you think the changes are changes?  If we do not approve this resolution, it would be August 7th it would end.  If we do approve this, it would be Sunday.  So therefore Monday would be the first day of actual meter enforcement.  What date?  It would be the, this would end on the 12th and then the 13th would be the first day of  actual implemented parking meters.  If the desire, I think, you know, we're hearing what the council is saying.  We're hearing what the council is looking at.  And we're looking at trying to be able to address if we do see an uptick and we have  to close down businesses or they're impacted, we need to allow this program to continue.  If it's impacting business as it's transacted and we need to reinstitute it.  The DCBA had written the letter as attachment B that asked us to consider this also.  And so they're seeing daily what's happening to downtown businesses.  And so one option that you could have to accomplish both either an extension of 60 or 90 miles  per day or how many every day is needed or implementation a lot sooner to ensure there's  adequate parking is looking at section three and revising the last portion of it to say  pursuant to section seven B of resolution 2020 is either retained or revoked as determined  by the emergency services director.  And then we just let the city manager ESD decide with the DCBA if you're being negatively  impacted with inadequate spaces, we can re-implement the program with adequate parking.  And we can make a determination to extend it a certain number of days 60 or 90 or whatever  is necessary and then revisit that at that point in time and then issue another extension  or reduction we could do that or we could just place extend it for 60 days from the  date of July 12th.  Is it is the is the implication that we would start and stop this we could just make a  at any given time or that we wouldn't start it until we were,  because I don't want to see us kind of flipping flopping if we can avoid that.  Absolutely.  Right now, since we had not received any word from the DCBA about concerns about removing this,  since they requested this as part of, and we haven't heard them to formally say,  please don't do this, let's extend this.  And so I think the goal would be to not end this moratorium,  to continue working with DCBA knowing that we're looking at now 57%.  We can continue to monitor the data regularly to determine where are we.  We can continue to see what businesses are saying about the number of adequate spaces,  and then hopefully over the next couple of weeks determine that,  okay, now it looks like the trends are flattening,  and we don't look like a county that's going to be reclosed again,  so let's plan on what.  What date do we want to actually activate it?  Council Member Morgan.  So if I take all of that collectively and I listen to Mr. Huber's motion,  I'm pretty sure that's what he was saying.  And I also agree with Mr. Orr.  I think 60 days is a long time.  It may go 60 days depending on what the skipper does,  and Mr. Huber's motion allows that to happen,  and I think that the direction from the council skipper is just please don't stop this  and have it.  I think that's what he was saying.  And I know you're in contact with all those, the DCBA,  and not every business owner downtown is super friendly with the DCBA,  so we have to hear from some other people first.  But if we were talking about undoing it today, I'd say no,  because I think things have changed in the last 24 hours.  Well, I know they've changed in the last 24 hours,  so I'm going to second Mr. Huber's motion,  assuming that everything he said falls into what you meant.  Okay.  Can you repeat the motion?  Yeah.  I don't have it.  I didn't hear one.  I heard a statement, but not a motion.  Do you want to turn that into something?  Thank you.  So the motion is to approve the original resolution  that I presented with the addition of the privilege  provided by Mr. Constantine and his sister.  That's the exact motion I meant to second.  All right.  We've got a motion and a second.  Perfect.  Thank you.  Section 3.  Of the resolution, it says that it is hereby revoked  effective July 12th.  Does that make a change?  Yes.  It's revoked.  Yes, it is revised.  If you're taking the language I presented,  it's revised to read, is either retained or revoked  as determined by the emergency services director,  and there will be no date.  And from the intent of what I'm hearing of the council  is we will not reinstitute this program on the June 12th  for the third.  For the third.  We will continue as is.  We will continue as is for now  and reassess with the downtown businesses.  Council Member Huber, does that work for you?  And Council Member Morgan?  Okay.  We've got a motion and a second on the floor.  We've already reviewed public comments.  So unless there's any other questions or comments.  Oh, is there a second?  And that was by Council Member Morgan?  Correct.  Okay.  Call the question, please.  Okay.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Orrie?  No.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Could we take a break?  That was my plan.  So we'll take a 10-minute break.  Debbie, can I get the computer again?  You're definitely right.  Just a second.  I requested be added after the posting of the agenda.  If we want to discuss that first, given that we're going to be  doing it in the next few minutes, we'll have the action taken on 5.7 may influence 5.5 and vice versa.  We would need a motion in order to do that.  So if that's there, I'll entertain it.  I move we hear 5.7.  Items after the posting of the agenda, Chico Certified Farmers Market, additional discussion.  I'll second the motion.  Okay.  Thank you.  Any questions or comments from council before we call the vote?  All right.  Can we call the question?  Okay.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Orrie?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Carries 5-1 with one recusal.  All right.  So item 5.7.  Chico Certified Farmers Market, additional discussion.  This is listed as my request to include Council Member Orrie's request for further analysis  of the ballot initiative option in more detail and to review the ballot initiative option.  I added this at Council Member Orrie's request.  So Council Member Orrie, I'd like to give you the floor.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm going to try to keep it...well...it's a difficult question.  It, for me, puts longtime friends at odds and it's one of those situations where there  seems to be a simple answer so why make it more difficult?  But for me, from the beginning, and I would hope for the majority of this council, it's  an area where we would defer...  to the initiative process.  We already acknowledged  and accepted the initiative  that had over 9,000  signatures.  We've  in good faith  had the CCFM  operate the market under those  rules for the last six years without  any challenge.  The  three parts of the  initiative,  the way it changed the  existing original  franchise agreement was it gave them  six years directing the city  clerk to place an extension  for eight years on the ballot.  It increased the fees they paid  and it gave them control of the entire lot.  Part of  which they have voluntarily  chosen to keep in parking.  But it does give them  the other lot.  So I said it's  I think  the way that I  see it going forward,  is that there would be an overwhelming  support for the market as there should be  and for food safety and for what  a market represents.  And it would be a great  ongoing discussion about how do we expand  the opportunities of farmers markets.  And that I would hope that every member of this council  would be a co-chair of that and a signer on  on the ballot argument that we should  continue the market under current terms.  For eight years as directed by the voters.  Any questions or comments from council and just to be clear on this item,  this is the kind of opportunity to take  one of the two routes,  which is to place the ballot initiative or the initiative on the ballot as written,  given what council member already filled in.  And so any questions or comments on that council member?  I had a question for the city attorney.  It's my understanding that  if this is put on the ballot  and voted for  successfully, that  we're then on a cycle of  re-voting for the allowance or for the perpetuity,  or for the perpetuity,  for the continuance of the lease every eight years.  Is that correct?  So if it is approved in this November,  put on the ballot and approved this November,  eight years from this November,  it would be on the ballot again to ask the voters  whether or not to again approve a franchise to be granted to CCFM exclusively.  Eight years after that, again, and it would go on in perpetuity that way.  Thank you.  Other questions and comments of council?  Council member Morgan.  I'll ask the city attorney again.  You still think putting on the ballot is,  I don't know how else to say, illegal,  of questionable legality?  Correct.  Nothing has changed in that regard to,  to the legal process.  I think it's my opinion as to it being unlawful  or against the, what the California constitution says.  Thank you.  Can you speak to, there was an alternative legal opinion submitted  around this particular issue.  I'm wondering if you can speak to it,  because obviously that puts those legal arguments at odds with each other a bit.  Well, I mean, there was, I think you're referring to  Kaplan.  Ms. Kaplan provided a,  a legal analysis.  There was nothing in there that changed my opinion about it.  In fact, the case that was cited there is  distinguishable in many regards.  And this is the Albany Concerned Citizens,  I think it's called,  Citizens for Responsible Government versus City of Albany.  Distinguishable in a number of respects, namely that the,  in that case, it was a land use entitlement,  and land use entitlement,  and land use entitlements are routinely,  ballot box zoning is routinely done.  And in fact, the City of Apple Valley case that I noted in the prior  staff report also deals with ballot box zoning.  And in that case, the Apple Valley case even mentions  as the owner of the property, Walmart.  And the court said as essentially when you name an individual entity,  as the land owner,  you are not violating the California Constitution.  In this Albany case,  they actually, it comes about not by the racetrack operator putting themselves on,  or through the city doing it.  It was through an initiative process that established,  the entire mechanism for how the city in the future would amend its zoning code pertaining to that city property.  Actually not city property,  pertaining to that property owned by this developer.  And so the distinction in the case law here is about,  essentially as a land owner and addressing development rights.  And that's not what we have here.  What we have here instead is a piece of city property,  and the right to be on that property being given as an exclusive right by a contract,  by a franchise.  As to whether this applies to charter cities,  the Albany court specifically,  I mean, the court there mentioned that they were not deciding the applicability of this as to charter cities.  And they note that in footnote 11.  They're not going to address that issue because they don't need to,  given the circumstances in that case.  Being the zoning code.  I'm not going to,  you know,  it's a burden I will not take arguing point by point with our city attorney.  I have submitted at my own expense of an expert opinion.  If one of the things that I would like to do is to address this issue,  one way we can just sort of judge whether or not they're of equal merit.  Deborah Kaplan is a leading authority in the state in this particular area of law.  She wrote the section of the lawsuit against Move the Junkyard that prevailed in court.  And if you remember that decision by that council,  to not follow the rules of the referendum,  but instead challenge it in court,  was A, recommended by our city attorney's former law firm when he was deputy attorney,  deputy city attorney.  B, it cost us well over $100,000.  I've never seen in accounting for a lost lawsuit in defending the,  the city attorney's opinion.  And of course they sued me individually too.  Which all they lost on all of those cases in looking at referendum law  and interpreting referendum law and advising the council.  So we're right back there in that situation.  The right thing to do is to follow the initiative.  If somebody doesn't like it out there,  they could go to a court,  and try to change it.  But for us not to follow the high road,  and put it on the ballot as directed by voters,  you know, I know a lot of folks that were involved at the time now have amnesia.  But it was the understanding at the time.  And it shows how strong a position they currently have,  and that it, the way it reads right now every eight years they could,  you know, if the voters so agree,  they can continue it.  And that's what part of understanding of what they're giving up.  If we, what citizens give up,  if we don't go along with that,  with what was adopted by the initiative,  and we give them something weaker.  You know, we're stepping in and  superimposing our will on that of the voters.  Other comments?  Council Member Morgan.  So I've been somewhat indifferent about where this is headed,  other than listening to the city attorney warning against lawsuits,  which I try to avoid, doesn't always work.  And certainly the city attorney and I have been on the opposite sides of some opinions recently.  But that's all I've got.  So I've got the city attorney saying,  maybe this isn't the way to do this.  I understand, Carl,  you have a habit of liking other attorneys' opinions when they don't match yours.  I get that.  I could probably find an attorney that would say any number of things.  But the other thing that I have in resistance to the initiative,  and we're talking about the voters,  is, and I apologize if everybody got this,  I don't think this is a form letter just to me.  It says, Dear Sean,  Respectfully ask your support when the proposed Chico Certified Farmers Market Franchise Agreement comes before you.  Next Tuesday,  Unfortunately, the ballot initiative keeps the Chico Saturday Farmers Market politicized,  basically making a wedge issue that will be fought over every eight years.  We feel the best interest of Chico would be better served by rejecting Mr. Ory's arguments and the ballot initiative.  Chico needs to move beyond made-up divisive issues and start working together.  The proposed franchise agreement is a product of negotiation between our city attorney, Andrew Jarrett,  and Farmers Market attorney, Jeff Brown.  Lots of attorneys.  The CCFM is a product of negotiation between our city attorney, Andrew Jarrett, and Farmers Market attorney, Jeff Brown.  The CCFM is entirely satisfied with it as it achieves our goal of establishing long-term stability for the market,  which I think this is what this whole discussion is about.  And it's respectfully signed the chair of the Chico Certified Farmers Market.  So I've got the city attorney on one side saying, Sean, this is probably a bad idea,  and I've got the chair of the Farmers Market saying, we don't want this anyway.  We're happy with this new agreement that we've reached.  And if the point is stability, this is easy for me.  And I haven't heard an argument outside of that.  I'm not sure if that's the sort of attorney that you hired that I have no idea who that person is.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  You followed the move for general character identification, sir.  Not as closely as you did.  Mr. City Attorney, I have a couple questions.  Is there any question as to whether the initiative itself in that process was legal, legally conducted, certified, et cetera?  The process of?  Issuing the initiative, people gathering signatures, coming back in, and council taking action that it did in June 2014?  Correct.  That's not an issue.  I have no information that would say any of that is illegitimate.  And is there, I want to say equal, you may not be able to measure it by percentage points,  but if we choose to,  not put this on the ballot, a legally conducted initiative on the ballot,  are we subject to suit for not honoring all of the voters?  Equally, if not, I mean, is there any way to compare those things?  I think there is the option for someone to sue for having not placed this on the ballot.  Yes.  If you want to go perfectly bulletproof, no lawsuits whatsoever, you go that route,  and then it goes on the ballot.  It appears whether or not CCFM wants to even have that franchise granted is another question.  CCFM has actually, through this process, in order to get it to where it is tonight,  so that it can be put on the next meeting by a hearing,  not item 5.7, but the other item,  in order to grant a franchise with the evergreen term.  That can't be approved tonight.  That has to be approved at a hearing.  There's a whole process under Chapter 14 of the Cheeky Municipal Code to do that.  And there would be nothing that would prevent the county from doing that.  And there would be nothing that would prevent the council from doing both, frankly.  Putting this on the ballot and also granting the franchise with the eight-year evergreen.  You may have lost me there. Can you explain that?  Yeah.  So there's a process that was undertaken six years ago to put this on the ballot through the initiative process.  At that time, the propriety of that, by granting through the ballot process,  the private right to a corporation was raised.  And the council at that time acknowledged it, but granted a franchise for six years that got us to where we are today.  With the understanding it would be placed on the ballot.  That action of placing it on the ballot takes additional action.  It takes a resolution by the council in this timeframe  to direct the, the,  the city clerk to place, to send a resolution to, or put this item on the ballot with the county clerk.  And so that has not taken place.  And that actually is not on your agenda tonight either.  So if we're going to go the route of placing this on the ballot,  there needs to be a special meeting to hear that resolution.  Um.  It's late.  Um.  It needs to happen before.  The 10th.  May 10th, or July 10th.  And these are, I know, very tight deadlines.  Um.  But the direction at the last council meeting was to negotiate.  It was not to bring back a resolution effectuating that.  And, you know, no one wanting to go rogue here.  Um.  The, the motion was followed to the T.  Um.  The, the Kaplan letter and Mr. Ory's, um.  Email was included in that, um, staff report on the other action item tonight.  But back to this.  Um.  You, you could take the action putting forth, um, a ballot measure.  Um.  And come November, if that were granted, um, then you would have the voters saying,  grant a franchise to, uh, CCFM on these terms.  Um.  But there's nothing, um, requiring CCFM to accept those terms.  Um.  And there's, um, nothing preventing CCFM, as they have done, from requesting a franchise,  um, the other action item, uh, under 1460, uh, to, to receive a franchise directly from  the council.  I, this is some of the most outrageous comments, procedures.  Um.  I, I know from my colleagues that there was an understanding that I was given a chance  to review legal information that we were given at the last minute last time.  And I was given that courtesy.  And I did bring back an expert opinion for you to consider with the full understanding  that this would be an actionable item tonight.  Um.  We got the agenda at 1230 on the final day of any changes.  So.  I think that, um, I think that the council has at least the possibility of looking at  an agenda than ever before, um, because of the holiday.  Uh, should have, agenda should have come out a day earlier.  Um.  It was my understanding after lengthy conversations, including the vice mayor's, uh, intervention,  that this would be an actionable item at this time.  Um.  You know, now to say that the, because the council did two things.  They didn't take an action yet.  They delayed.  It's an 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나  지나  지나  지나  지나  지나 ! !  We have an action item of adding things to the ballot,  and yet that's not on tonight.  To be told now that we can't take,  that what was in front of us two weeks ago  is not in front of us today,  it's totally unfair.  And I don't think the understanding of the council,  and I don't think it's fair to the voters  that we wouldn't get that extra legal information  and wouldn't be able to act on that information  without holding another meeting  It is just a breakdown of staff all the way down the line.  I just hope it isn't, that it's,  it sure feels like it's premeditated.  It sure feels like,  well, I'll see where the votes go on this.  And I'm sorry for the council if we have to have another meeting  in order to carry out what may be the will of this,  the council.  If there's not four votes to do that,  or if, because we have to have a special meeting,  there's not four votes, you know, so be it.  But,  it's,  how can this be fair?  I mean, those who were here two weeks ago,  how can this be fair to be put in this position right now?  Council Member Reynolds, you had the floor.  So, when we,  when we left two weeks ago, Mr. Orry,  we had a vote of, I believe,  five to one to move forward for negotiations with CCFM.  And I have a letter in front of me that says,  from CCFM, that says,  we strongly support the proposed franchise agreement  between the city of Chico and the Chico Certified Market,  which we have in our agenda.  And I'm going to read this only because we can't have speakers here,  so I think that it's fair that...  Your first statement is not true.  That's not the motion.  Okay, can I have the floor?  You interrupted me three times last meeting.  So, I didn't interrupt you.  Council Member Reynolds, could you continue and then...  Okay, so, which you have in your agenda packet listed in Exhibit 1.  The franchise agreement was negotiated by our CCFM attorney, Jeff Brown,  and your city attorney, Andrew Jarrett.  The franchise agreement went through multiple iterations,  was reviewed by many members of the Chico community,  while these community members represent a diverse,  political ideologies.  They all agree that this franchise agreement is good for CCFM and Chico.  So, if we have an agreement between CCFM  and we have an agreement with the vendors that are there actually using the market,  they're getting seven years with an evergreen,  and I think the negotiated cancellation,  God forbid we ever fell into a windfall of money and could ever build something there,  it's like a three-year cancellation,  so I think they've been given, and they're super happy with it.  So, I don't know why we need to spend time, money, energy to go.  So, I'm on to the ballot with this.  So, I'm just confused.  I don't understand.  I think we should move forward with allowing the attorney  to continue the franchise agreement negotiations and save the headache.  You know, when I look at this issue, I don't see it as a question of whether we say, you know,  the farmers market has really, you know,  we do this thing and it looks great, because I agree, it looks great.  I don't believe that's the question in front of us.  In my opinion, it's are we slapping the voters in the face by saying we're going to render this legal initiative  that you could have 9,000 plus voter signs that was legally conducted by saying,  never mind, we're not going to put it on the ballot,  and we're going to do this franchise agreement.  That's the question to me.  It's not, it is a legal and ethical question,  and I don't believe that's the question in front of us,  because I can look at this franchise agreement and say, these are great terms.  I'm all for food security long term, making sure that the farmers market stays here long term.  I don't blame them for supporting this over putting it on the ballot.  But our accountability is to the voters, to the registered 9,000 plus registered Chico voters  who said, this is how we want this done.  This is the language that we want it added to the ballot on.  And the question before me is, is this the language that we want it added to the ballot on?  It's an 지나  It's an 지나  It's an 지나  It's an 지나  It's an 지나  It's an 지나  It's an 지나  It's an 지나 And so in two questions on that. So what happens if the voters say no, which I don't think they don't well, because I think everybody loves the farmers market. But what if they say no and then they don't do the franchise agreement, then we don't have farmers market.  we don't have farmer's market? I don't know.  And two,  again, explain to me  we put it on the ballot,  they vote yes on it,  and you're saying it's not necessarily  a legal way of going about  renting out city property or being  mandated to rent city property  to a private party,  then what happens if somebody comes  back and sues? Do they risk  also being moved? Because I don't want them to be moved.  I want them to stay there.  So, DeCurr...  I want to make sure that we're still talking  about 5.7,  because  dialogue  keeps coming about 5.5  that I would love to counter  whether or not that's valid.  And counter arguments  about how great 5.5 is  from the city attorney  when that's not what we're talking about.  So unless I'm allowed,  I mean,  I just think we need,  we need to stay with the discussion  in front of us. And that's all.  Please.  I was going to clarify  one of the statements you made  and I...  Council Member Reynolds,  in regard to what  my thought is on whether  or not we could rent city property,  that's not the issue.  It's about granting  a right.  It's about granting a right  to an individual.  In this case,  CCFM.  And that's what the constitutional issue  is about.  And that is centered around  5.7  that the  California Constitution  says, as I read it,  and as others  have read it,  that it cannot,  the ballot measure process  cannot be used in that manner.  As I put in a prior staff report,  and as I've alluded to  a few moments ago,  the most conservative approach  to forestall any litigation  on that issue would be to put it on the ballot.  It would be $7,000 to $10,000  depending on how much a question ultimately  asks.  And the voters would then decide whether or not  that initiative  can go forward.  Or whether it passes.  Between now and then,  between  approval and  actual execution,  a lawsuit could be filed by someone,  even the city,  to invalidate  placing it on the ballot  or to  invalidate its approval  as being  violative of  the Constitution,  Section 2,  Article 12.  At the same time,  on December 1st,  the current franchise agreement  that was approved by council action,  although not formally executed in any way,  but approved by council action  and acted upon  by all parties  since June of 2014,  that will expire on December 31st.  So,  if  the ballot measure were to pass,  be placed on and pass  in November,  and  somehow  that ballot measure was invalidated,  come December 31st,  there would be no right  for the farmers market to exist at Lot 1.  And then what?  And then what?  Yeah.  Right now, you also have an application,  and this is the other item,  that,  to consider this application for franchise agreement  under 1460.  And under that process,  the council can issue a franchise agreement  on its own terms,  irrespective of what the ballot measure is about.  And so that's what I was explaining earlier,  how both could exist.  So, just kind of running through this,  say we honor our legal obligation to the voters,  we put this on the ballot,  as the voters have requested,  as has been certified.  Somehow, it gets invalidated by the courts,  or it passes,  and then at a future date,  gets invalidated by the courts.  There is still the opportunity for a council  to grant a franchise agreement?  Yes.  And there's the ability for you to do that now.  So we could do that now,  we could do that later,  we could do that at any time,  according to your opinion,  if this legally done initiative  was somehow invalidated by the legal system.  Right.  And on top of that,  the way that the initiative is being implemented,  the way that the initiative is written,  the city council and CCFM could amend  the terms of the agreement,  if they both agreed to.  As a change?  Yes.  I have a question.  Yes.  I do have a comment.  I just wanted to concur with Mr. Orr's point  Yes.  and Mr. Orr's assessment  of the fact that I was under the impression,  as he believed the rest of the council was,  that this was an actionable item tonight,  this 5.7.  So I was shocked when you said  we couldn't take action on that tonight.  It certainly seems uncomfortable.  I will not be here on the 10th,  if something happened to happen,  if it had to happen on the 10th.  So that would certainly make this a difficult process.  To clarify on that point,  you can take the action tonight.  It's just in and of itself vulnerable.  Someone could challenge it.  And so it was not placed on the agenda to take action,  showing that resolution on what would actually be done.  And so the way to accomplish getting a resolution,  I have a resolution that is 99% there.  But the one important part of that resolution is,  see, the question,  and looking at what the actual question would be.  And if you recall from prior,  this box,  if you remember from resolutions last meeting,  there is this box of the yes, no,  how it actually appears on the ballot.  That's really important.  And you deserve to know exactly what that question is.  And the rest of the community does as well.  So the way this can get on and take that action  and have a resolution that is legally valid  and a process,  we're asking about process,  that is one part of the process here tonight  that would be vulnerable  if you took action right now  to a motion to place this on the ballot.  Well, you don't have the documents in front of you  with that question.  So that would be a vulnerability.  So the way to achieve this is a motion  to hold a special meeting 24 hours from this time,  literally 8.05 tomorrow.  And that would be the minimum amount of time.  And so we would have to notice it,  and we would have to approve it.  And then we would have to approve that meeting  to place it on the ballot.  You could do it any time after that.  But the other deadline we're facing  is when the county has their deadline of July 10th.  And that has to do with their schedule  on not the city's schedule.  So we would have to,  the motion would have to be for a special meeting  to approve the ballot language  between tomorrow at one hour from when we make the,  or 24 hours from when we make the decision  to July 10th.  Is that correct?  Correct.  To July 9th at 11.59 p.m.?  Well, I don't know what the precise timing would be  for when it needs to get to the county.  Maybe the city clerk does.  But typically you would expect a few hours difference  between when they're going to take the action and so forth.  I know that the reason that they set that date  was to get their agenda packet out to the supervisors.  I don't know if that's before 5 o'clock.  They don't have a timeframe cut off for it.  They just said July 10th.  Okay.  Council Member Stone.  Thank you.  I thought I would be important to it,  to address my interpretation of what we were expecting  at this meeting.  And my understanding was that we would move to address  the franchise agreement and continue that process.  However, that didn't preclude,  was the specific language that I used,  it didn't preclude Council Member Ory  from bringing forward additional information  that would curtail that or change that.  Now, I was not clear that there wasn't going to be  an opportunity to execute,  but we were all very clear at the time  that the franchise agreement was absolutely of the essence  and that that window of opportunity  with the Board of Supervisors and the county  was extremely tight.  So, it's uncomfortable to hear that it's in just a couple of days,  but with a 24-hour opportunity.  But again, I have a tough time.  The Vice Mayor encapsulated a lot of my thoughts  and the respect that we must have for the voters.  But we've got an entity, an organization,  that's saying, this is not a contract that we want.  And I don't know how you drag somebody into a contract  that doesn't want to be there.  So, if we can move this to a ballot measure  and let's pretend that it's legal,  if the organization that is involved in that other party,  it's a unilateral decision by the voters  in order to place them in a position to sign a contract  that they're not obligated to sign.  So, the whole thing falls apart  once I get a letter from the President,  from the Chair, yeah, it's the CCFM Chair,  when he says, we don't want to do this,  and the very people that are working on an ovation  of a new agreement  are the very people that were involved in the thing in the first place.  So, again, CCFM Chair Richard Kuhn  is working closely with the City Attorney on this,  as I understand.  It makes sense to me there's regrettable actions to date.  This continues to appear to be illegal.  Appears to be, you know, we can split hairs on that,  but at the end of the day,  I've got a letter from the very entity  that we're trying to contract with  to force them into the ballot,  and I can't move forward.  You're wrong on that it's illegal, really.  You've got Deborah Kaplan's opinion  that counteracts the City Attorney's.  So that's not a great out,  and you're telling me that Richard Kuhn  contacted his 200 farmers  and came up, and vendors,  not let's make sure,  and came up with a consensus that we're hearing now.  Do we even know they had a board meeting?  Well, I appreciate...  You know, Richard never says in any of his three letters  that he has had a board meeting.  He is talking from his own pulpit.  And you're buying it.  And I yet appreciate the spirited discussion,  Councillor Moriwai,  and I know I circulated petitions  alongside you on this matter.  Yeah.  And I appreciate the spirited discussion.  I share the intensity.  What I don't see are a number of farmers  that are writing in to say,  we think what the chair of this organization,  our representative,  is not operating correctly.  I mean, not a single letter.  Not a single email.  This is where we get into the next...  This is a discussion,  if we go on,  if you're going to vote not to put it on the ballot,  you know, we'll get into  who actually had any input  in this piece of paper that we're coming up next.  Do you think even one Hmong family farmer,  which is the majority of the farmers out there,  has even had a worthwhile discussion  about what the terms of their agreements are  and an understanding of what the terms of their agreement are?  We're going with the question of voter apathy,  and I'm not sure I want to ask that,  answer that question.  Well, voter apathy of the people  that placed Richard G. Kuhn, CCFM chair.  I mean, I don't know where he garners that authority,  but I also have seen, you know,  that there's been no resistance,  and we've been talking about this  for at least a few meetings.  So anyway, that's...  I revert back to the vice mayor.  All right.  Let's review comments,  and then we can continue the discussion.  How many comments do we have through the engaged platform?  Okay, so for...  This is item 5.7.  5.7, we received two on this item,  Robin Engle and Juanita Sumner,  and then on the other item, we received four.  All right.  Let's take a minute or two to review the comments,  and then we can get back to discussion.  Has counsel had the opportunity to review  further discussion on this item?  5.7.  Well, Judith, go ahead with your motion.  What did you just say?  I'm directing it to the council member Stone.  Did you say Judith?  Yes.  Thank you.  I'd like to call the question.  There isn't a motion.  I don't know if there's a motion on the floor.  There isn't.  That's a good question.  Is there a motion on the floor?  I'll make a motion that we move past 5.7  and move to 5.5,  the draft ordinance of the franchise agreement  for the Chico Surdine Spied Farms market.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion by Council Member Morgan  and a second by Council Member Huber.  Let's call the question.  Unless there's any further...  To be clear, we're voting to move on to the next agenda item.  That's correct.  So you're not voting against the initiative  that went on the ballot?  I'm not concerned about it, Council Member Ory.  I think your outbursts are silly, if you don't mind.  Let's call the question.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ory?  No.  Council Member Reynolds?  Yes.  Council Member Stone?  Abstain.  Abstain.  Vice Mayor Brown?  No.  Carries 3-2 with one recusal and one abstention.  All right.  We are back to item 5.5,  discussion regarding a draft ordinance granting a franchise  to the Chico Surdine Spied Farmers Market Incorporated  for the use of municipal parking lot number one  as a farmers market.  Mr. Jarrett?  Thank you, Vice Mayor Brown.  So as directed by the council at the last meeting,  or council meeting, I contacted Chico Surdine Spied Farmers Market  the very next day to begin negotiating a franchise agreement.  I used as the basis for that the version that was circulated  to CCFM back in 2014, noting the proposed changes that were made  by the council at the last meeting.  The discussions on that were between myself and first with Mr.  Kuhn, and then Jefferson Brown contacted me and said he would be  taking over the negotiations as their attorney.  As far as negotiations go, on my part, it was not a position of me  taking a position on anything on your behalf other than what you had  articulated as some kind of a contract.  I was also told that the agreement was to be changed to  some points, namely term of years, things of that nature.  There were some items that at CCFM's request were eliminated,  and what you have before you is the version with some red line  indicated that were some key points that they wanted changed.  The agreement would be what's called an eight-year evergreen term,  which means that the agreement would be to have some points  that we could use in terms of terms of terms of terms.  That means that every year that expires on an eight-year term,  one is added.  And it seems like an interesting concept,  but it's the exact same way that the Williamson Act works or the  Mills Act works for agricultural land and for historic homes.  What it effectively does to end the contract without the city having  to pay any compensation, the city would effectively give at least  seven and a half years notice that the city no longer desires to be in the contract. At any time, CCFM could end the contract on 30 days notice. So they have a 30 day window to close the contract, we would have at least seven and a half years. If we do not give seven and a half years notice, then another year is added on and it just continues on that way.  If, to address the issue of the city being able to acquire the property with a shorter amount of notice within that period of time but give just compensation, the amount of $40,000 and three years notice was requested by CCFM, their terms, and that was incorporated in the draft before you.  Thank you.  I have no knowledge.  I have no knowledge about this going before the larger body.  I do know two other individuals were included in the email chain, Mr. Stevenson and I don't recall the other person's name.  And comments from each of them were incorporated into drafts of this as they went on.  And I believe that the discussion ended on...  I believe that was the 20...  I forget the actual date that the discussions ended.  I must also add the version was also circulated with staff internally here, and there were no changes, recommendations for changes made by internal staff.  Questions or comments from Council?  Did the motion...  Do you believe that the motion should be considered?  It's an 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 !  way to provide you the precise version of that other than to show you what it  would look like in a draft version of a franchise agreement. It is not before you  in the manner that you could approve tonight. Like I said, in order to approve  it tonight there would have needed to have been a 10-day notice under your  your city code. And we were prepared to go that route, but with the publishing  deadlines, what they are, we're not able to achieve that. So tonight was not a  first reading of that ordinance. Do you have any knowledge of whether the board itself approved the proposed agreement?  I do not. I actually asked Mr. Coons and he said they did have two board meetings on it.  And after every draft that came out they had a minimum of four members together  to review each draft. But they did have two board meetings on it.  Other comments from councilmembers? Yeah, any... did you have a comment councilmember?  It's a general comment based back to when we went through this before and at one point  they wanted to make it a ballot issue and they were talking about doing all  these things with the farmers market and moving the lot and doing all manner of  other things. At the time I was the council, whatever the representative is,  to the DCBA and there was a lot of consternation  about parking on and on and people talked about that and we'd jump all the way  forward and I never would have thought when this came back again  that I'd be making an argument, and I haven't heard from anybody in the DCBA, I haven't heard from anybody  downtown, but I'd be making an argument to leave the farmer's market right where it is because anything  that brings people downtown right now is a good thing. And I wasn't  prepared to go 20 years or even 10 years. I think this is  a great agreement and I thank whoever all the attorneys  were that made it work. It gives the city  the freedom to make a change if it needs to with a financial penalty, which it should  have. It's not a financial penalty that's insurmountable. If somebody really  wanted to do something, I think that the city would probably work to make the farmer's market find  another spot. I've heard all manner to Mr. Constantine's  report earlier this evening about closing down Main and Broadway to help  the downtown businesses. I've heard some of them  say, you know what, we don't need it closed on Friday or Saturday night. We get good  customers coming in those nights anyway.  Shut it down all Saturday afternoon. Get people down here and move the farmer's market  into the middle of the street. I'm just like, wow, this is not the conversation that we had  eight years ago because the businesses are hurting.  Everybody's hurting. If this helps get people back downtown and deals  with food insecurity and all those things, I sit here and again,  no resistance from the DCBA.  No resistance from the people saying, oh, I need my parking. I need that lot. They're just like,  let's get people down here. The fact that we've come  this far on it is remarkable.  Thank you. How many comments  have we received through the Engage Chico platform? On this item  5.5, we received four. And via email?  One from Jeff Cree. Okay. Let's take a minute  to review the comments.  And the other comments were from Yvonne Johnson, Jody Taylor,  Claudette Ritter, and Juanita Sumner, along with Jeff Cree.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. Bring it. Yeah. Has counsel had the opportunity to review comments?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  me it was always a question of are we rejecting the voters by adopting this? And I will, that's  all I'll say as that other item has passed. Yeah, so do we have a motion? I'll move that we  consider that we approve the terms as laid out with the eight-year evergreen as detailed by  staff and that we continue with the franchise execution. Second. For clarification, that would  then require that we notice this as soon as possible to achieve a 10-day hearing process.  The only clarification that might be needed on that is when you want that first hearing to be.  That can be at a special meeting or it can be at the August. Let's do it at a regular meeting.  They're not pressing us on that issue at this point.  At the time of the introductory meeting, can changes be made?  Yes, it would be introduced as with any ordinance. The franchise is approved as an ordinance with the  first and the second reading and changes could be made and introduced as amended.  And to that end, again, this was not about whether the franchise agreement was appropriate or whether  it was a good thing or not. I'm just very pleased to hear Council Member Morgan repeat comments that  I and others made in the chambers at that time that this is beneficial to downtown and it brings people downtown and it's good for business.  And I, for one, am very pleased to hear Council Member Morgan saying those things today.  So it still is all of those things. It was true eight years ago and, well, we hope that it's going to continue to be for another eight years.  And then some.  All right. We have a motion. Oh my gosh, is it from you?  A motion.  A second from Council Member Stone and a second from Council Member Reynolds, I believe.  Let's call the question.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ory?  Council Member Reynolds?  Yes.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  It carries 5-1 with one recusal.  All right. Let's get the mayor back in here, shall we, as fun as this has been.  It's an 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나 지나  지나 지나 지나 지나  지나 ! !  지나 !  지나  지나  지나  council member and chair of the housing committee. Thank you. So we've talked  about inclusionary zoning in this in this chambers before it keeps coming up  it's something that that we know to be a tool to provide affordable housing a  number of communities a hundred and I'm not gonna remember the number now 109  something along those 142 I think it's the number communities already have in  the state of California of the 482 municipalities have an inclusionary  zoning ordinance that proliferation seems to be expanding with the  significant portion of those inclusionary zoning ordinances occurring  in between 2000 and 2010. Part of the program of the inclusionary zoning for  those that are at home since I know staff and my colleagues are already  familiar with this what inclusionary zoning does  is it allows the housing community to have a more inclusive and inclusive  life that's really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really  my intention that if we are to pass this and move forward with this policy solution, that  staff would be making specific recommendations rather than coming from a council member or  from the housing committee.  Now there were some items of note during the housing committee's discussion and there's  some disagreement from amongst the housing committee members as to what can be adopted  or what should be adopted.  So sticking to what the housing committee's recommendations were that we have a discussion  about inclusionary zoning and again, lost track a little bit there, for the folks at  home, inclusionary zoning requires a developer of a certain size development to set aside  some of those units to be developed for low income residents.  And how do you define low income?  Well the state has pretty specific guidelines through area median income so the details  get technical without going down that road.  And not allowing staff an opportunity to review that.  There usually must be a subsidy of some kind associated with that inclusionary zoning ordinance.  So if you have to set aside, let's say, as an arbitrary number, 10% of those units must  be developed for people of low incomes, there's a gap in how much revenue a developer would  be taking in than what the market will typically provide and what it costs to develop the property.  Which means a subsidy is a little bit more expensive.  So if you have to set aside, let's say, a 10% of those units must be developed for people  Which means a subsidy is almost certainly necessary.  And as the housing committee chose to have this report move forward in our agenda packet,  we recognize that there isn't a perpetual subsidy source.  So let me rewind this.  If you're a developer and let's say you're building just arbitrarily 50 apartment units  and we have a 10% inclusionary zoning ordinance, that means that five of those units must be  developed and held for people of low incomes.  The amount of subsidy will depend on how steeply that lower income resident is permitted to  live in the unit.  So if market rents are $1,000 and you're only charging 10% of that market rate, that's going  to be 90% of the area median income.  It's not even actually true.  But for the folks at home, it gives you an idea of what that subsidy is.  Where I'm going with that is the developer has to either have a 10% inclusionary zoning  ordinance in their own housing, or they have to come out with that money out of their  own pocket, or there must be a subsidy provided.  We have subsidies today.  We're totaling for over a span of 10 years, $334 million.  There's a lot of activity in the affordable housing market, and there has been for years.  Prior to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies, this community was building $6 million  in affordable housing every single year, year in and year out.  We spent our affordable housing set aside.  So, what the housing committee would like to bring forward is, in the next two years,  an inclusionary zoning ordinance for staff to develop and bring back to council with  recommendations as to how they can see an inclusionary zoning ordinance would move forward,  and we recognize that there is not a permanent subsidy to provide for that housing gap.  And, with that, I'm happy to take questions, unless I should probably give an opportunity  for my committee members to make comments.  Can I ask, please?  it's more of like a point of order  I'm happy to have this conversation  I voted to have this conversation  but I didn't vote during this time  to have this conversation  and you know when I saw this  on the agenda  honestly kind of felt like a slap in the face given some other items  that have been rejected to be on the agenda  during this time  and to me I just  I'm struggling with that  I'm struggling to even kind of tune into it  and absorb  the information  so it's really just a point of order  I don't know how it got on the agenda  and I feel lost  sure  well we've been working on  the housing committee has been working on this specific piece of legislation  for over a year and a half  how did it get on an emergency only agenda  there's a committee report  and the housing committee is still  responding and engaging  it's requesting an agenda item  this is not an agendized item yet  this is a housing committee report  and the housing committee is reporting that they recommend staff work on an inclusionary zoning ordinance  oh okay  okay  so perhaps this should have been a council member request or a committee request  no this is a committee report  it's up to council to decide what they want to do with that information  I don't see the housing committee's full report in this item  so I just feel like the way that it is  and like I'm sorry like I'm  I want to have this conversation I just  if we're going to have it I think we need to vote  to suspend whatever our rules are  in order to have it  and this is one item  as you know  I would expect that the entire housing committee report  would be in front of us  if that's what we're going to discuss  so I'm just I'm feeling lost  so I  requested my understanding  we're just hearing a report  exactly  yeah that was my understanding too  is that we were just reporting  it's not a rule of law  that we're going to have to figure out  so I think that's what's been done  we voted to bring the housing committee report  including now  inclusionary zoning back to the council at a future date  and there was a recommendation from the housing committee  that we have a discussion about inclusionary zoning  that's the reason  and the council directed us to come back  so in my thinking  this completes the work of the housing committee  I hereby give up my seat  and I'm going to have to go to the council  and I would  you know if there's any further direction  of a housing committee  the council would have to take it  but I think we just need to wait now  for a meeting  for this to come back  for a full discussion  of all the recommendations  of the housing committee  okay  and mayor  yes  and  I know Mr. Reynolds has  oh I'm sorry  go ahead  no I was just going to say  when it says a report from the ad hoc committee  I was hoping to see  because as you mentioned  there was some  disagreement  with the housing committee  and I think  amongst the people on the committee  as to inclusionary zoning  and this that and the other  so I'd like to  as well as having the inclusionary zoning presentation  have a little bit more information about  well what were the issues  what were the problems  we got an email in late today  from the builders group  that listed off several items  that I could see were  you know needs to discuss  so as much as I want to hear about it  but again we agreed that  to not take up non-essential  until August  so it sounds to me  like we do need to push this off  until  but I look forward to it  I look forward to  reading the presentation  Mr. Morgan  yeah so mine was  what was a  I hear and agree with  what council member Reynolds  and vice mayor Brown are saying  it did to me  it did read this report  I did have to ask the question  I actually called the clerk  this is a report right  because I'm getting all this email  what are you guys doing  I'm like I think we're just listening  and yeah so I get it  and I hear your frustration as well  there's lots of other non-essential items  that we might all think are essential  that especially ones like this  I know you have one in mind in particular  that deserve the  that getting people in here  not just 18 comments against  but let them come in and speak  and I think  except Debbie left  I think there might be a report later  about how that might happen  okay so  I think that's where the confusion actually lies  is that  you've got a committee  that's reporting on action  that it thinks the council should take  and the actual  the council has refused to take action  on anything other than things  that it deems essential  we're in a housing crisis  this is a tool for  so you know it does  it absolutely feels  and should feel like  we should be taking action  but we aren't  and we're continuing to not  so it does become uncomfortable  when the committees continue to do that work  and present to council  and saying here it is  here's your job  is this the only recommendation  coming from the housing committee  this is the only thing  that we authorize to move forward  with presentation tonight  council member Orrick  what was the question  I said is this the only thing  that came forward  for action  requested action  by the housing committee  now the full housing committee report  Randall  has a dozen recommendations in it  many of them  some of them  well  the full committee report  has a dozen recommendations  we received an interim report  on April 1st  right  yes  a memo  and I think we had a  verbal  update  I know there's  at least one community  group of community members  that are meeting  and are concerned about housing  and they've been asking  how do they bring this forward  I said well bringing it forward  when we hear the housing committee  update  would be  perhaps an appropriate time  to do that  except for not  opening that  when we do  have the opportunity  to hear this  we need to  think about  some  some  some  staff's  ability  to move forward  with our recommendations  council  council member  city manager Oram  sent us an email  on the second  really talking about  the affordable housing update  and the  number of projects  that are really in the pipeline  that the planning department  is working on  and this is  money that's coming to us  from the campfire  and the  community  and I would hate to  take their efforts  away from this  this funding opportunity  to move this  in front  but perhaps  when that discussion  comes forward  we'll see how this  could perhaps  work together  with that  I wanted to address  a comment from  or a question  from a community member  regarding the transparency  of us  putting this  on the agenda  tonight  and  just  let us  let the community know that  inclusionary zoning  was discussed  by both the  ad hoc committee  and in  a larger  venue  at the housing conference  so it's been discussed  three or four times  I think  in meetings that were  public  and scheduled  and as a result of that  the committee members  rightly  had a discussion  as far as  what they wanted  to bring forward  and so this is a result  of that  and there's nothing  non-transparent  in this process  we've been transparent  throughout  regarding  our discussions  that included  inclusionary zoning  including  the  housing committee's  most recent presentation  its most recent meeting  has  that agenda packet  I thank  council member Huber  for forwarding  that off to the  clerk  so  everything's been  transferred Just a question to comment. You asked about disagreements. I don't remember too much of a disagreement.  council  council  council  council  council  council  council  council !  It's  It's  It's  It's  are off the table that we wouldn't be able to.  I think that would assuage some of the concerns too,  knowing that of the 6,000 units in the pipeline,  probably very few of them would be able to.  And I don't know that, but I'd like to know that.  And to me, that was the one disagreement,  or at least lack of information.  I didn't find disagreement on that point amongst the three of us,  that we were pretty resolute,  that thinking about requiring a developer  who already has made an application,  is already through the entitlement process,  to tell them to reshift to include this type of ordinance  is not something that the committee welcomed.  All three of us were unanimous in that we recognize  if you already have a project that is already in the application process,  that you wouldn't mandate that down the line  to rechange and retool a project like that.  And the second part was that, it's a long shot,  but I'd love to know whether we could use,  CDBG-DR as a inclusionary zoning incentive  as part of our deliberations of how that funds those.  Only if it's something to the DR.  I don't know at what point this becomes a discussion  rather than just a report.  So I'd prefer that we just stick to what we've said  and talk about agendizing,  the possibility of agendizing an actual discussion of it  at a future date.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Didn't we request that?  I mean, for me, it's like,  I don't want to see it die and not come back.  And so maybe one of the committee members  is going to need to bring it back  when we're allowed to discuss more business.  But so...  Well, so isn't that kind of the point  is that the housing committee can make a report.  We're just, there's no time known  when we might hear that agenda item  because we're not hearing agenda items, right?  Right.  I mean, I would support just throwing this out there.  Somebody would bring it forward  and we approve it to put it in the queue  for when we're, when the public's back, you know,  if that's what we need to do to get it rolling.  I'm happy to do that, but I'm just one person.  I just want to clarify.  We could do that under council member request, perhaps.  We've already done that.  We made a motion.  I was told at the time I didn't need to do it,  but we did it anyway,  asking for the council to agendize  at a future meeting the housing committee report,  which now includes the inclusionary zoning statement.  Okay.  And that's on your,  Danny's pending agenda.  So it's,  I just,  When we get to it.  It's in the queue.  All right.  It's in the queue.  That's all I need to know.  Okay.  We did receive some comments on this,  so let's take,  how many comments did we receive through engaged Chico?  23 comments through engaged  and two comments on public comments.  Let's take about four minutes to review them  as you read the names, please.  Okay.  In engaged, we have Katie Thoma, Lisa Salzman,  Clark Gardner, Chris Giampola, Jody Taylor,  Arwen Funk, Yvonne Johnson, Mike Trollender,  Brandon Slater, Matthew Herman, Bill Broward,  Susan Smead, Mark Christman, Sonia Antone, Joshua Pierce,  Jennifer Morris, Jody Galloway, Joe Hart,  Amy Rohrer, Juanita Sumner, Kate Layden,  Carrie Welch, and Mark Stonkel.  And public comments, Nicole Nava and Addison Winslow.  Thank you.  It's really good to see that,  that's really good to see that,  that's really good to see that,  that's really good to see that,  that's really good to see that,  that's really good to see that, that's really good to see that,  that's really good to see that, that's really good to see that,  that's really good to see that, that's really good to see that,  that's really good to see that, that's really good to see that,  that's really good to see that, that's really good to see that,  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We're taking vehicle miles travel.  Thank you.  Has counsel had enough time to review the comments?  So we will move on.  Reports and communications.  The following reports and communication items are provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken on the items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda.  6.1 is the city manager's report.  City Manager Orme?  Yes, Honorable Mayor, Mayor of the Council, thank you very much.  Just a few different updates that I want to give.  As it relates to some items of import, just so the council's aware, and I know it was a directive of the council,  so I believe you'll be reassured in the fact that as time has gone on with regard to COVID-19,  staff has continued to witness, as council has and members of the community,  a number of the camps that are in the park areas along the pathways in the park within 50 feet  have really created.  Some issues with regard to preserving our natural components of the park, as well as just the public's opportunity to engage in the park fully.  And so we are commencing some level of enforcement to ensure that that 50 foot marker is kept.  We're doing it compassionately and professionally, and I want to make sure that the public's aware of that as well.  I know the council's already aware of it because I've informed you of that.  In addition to that, I wanted to just let you know, and I was going to hand it over to the city clerk for her.  to give this update, but the city clerk was successful in gaining approval from Grace Community Church  to authorize utilization of their facility in order to accommodate our August 4th City Council meeting.  She's negotiating that. It looks like we could be to the tune of about three months worth of utilization for that, the twice a month  meetings. And as we get closer to finalizing that agreement with them, more information will be out to the public as to how that's going to look.  At this point in time, we anticipate a  approximately 80 people of members of the public would be able to be facilitated in that.  Obviously, we can't do that here. And so that was a directive of the city council, and so that is there.  And so we're really excited about that. I want to thank Grace Community Church for their willingness  to allow for that type of use, but they're still working through the details.  Another thing I wanted to do is just just highlight.  You know, oftentimes we look at a lot of the things that need to be fixed, and  in the midst of that we neglect to take the opportunity to really pat ourselves on the back as a city. And  one of the things that I just want to do is highlight again the fact that the city achieved a huge, huge  project,  $22 million grant  for the  for to increase our level of low-income housing and make huge improvements to that Bruce corridor.  Just so you know, it was that grant program consisted of only  80-some million dollars. So the city of Chico received over 25% of the funding available  for that grant program. This is the largest grant that I'm aware that the city's ever received.  Tremendous kudos to our city team  for doing the legwork, for being prepared.  I will tell you this all stemmed from the preparedness of staff from the campfire through today.  We wouldn't have received it if staff wouldn't have had the due diligence necessary to carry it through.  I could name everybody in here.  I know Director Otto Bones,  he's been riding the horse the past few months and he's been riding that horse hard and we've gotten past that finish line.  Director Veiga, I mean I could go down the list of everybody that's contributed to making this happen,  but the team did an amazing job.  And I just wanted to commend them once again because that's unheard of, a  $22 million grant for a city and the benefits that the city will reap from that are huge.  And I know that there may be other questions or updates that you would request of me, but if not,  I wanted to at least share those first.  So for now, if there's any other question, I'd be happy to answer them.  Questions?  Thank you for that report.  I have a quick question.  Back in March, we had taken action to request, you know, some level of, a high level of urgency around addressing,  particularly sheltering,  legal campgrounds,  tiny home villages, whatever we need to do to implement some housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness.  And haven't heard,  have heard some things about that, but haven't heard a full update.  So I'm just curious if you have any information and if we need to maybe add it to  future agenda to dive in a little deeper.  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, one of the things that has been tremendous in our effort to try to determine how best to manage  solutions on that front is to have that  homeless solutions coordinator on board and Joy's been working diligently.  I've been very impressed. Unfortunately, after looking at and evaluating  property after property after property,  we haven't reached that point where we could come back with a firm recommendation.  However, I will say that we are so close to bringing something forward. We have a temporary solution hot on the stove,  but we are looking for the long-term solution, which I know this City Council desires to have. And so,  I was actually going to be asking for it here in a little bit,  but I was going to ask that the Council add an item to closed session because I did receive some information within the past 24 hours that  necessitates me to add that request adding it to closed session.  But there are a lot of things in the works,  I hope, and it's my goal that staff will be able to achieve bringing something forward before the end of this calendar year.  And that continues to be my goal. I hope it's a lot sooner than that,  but before the end of the calendar year is our goal. And we believe that there are some  mechanics underway that will get us there because, as the Council very well knows,  this is not the most optimal situation of having folks  in the parks. This was out of the need to ensure and protect those individuals during this COVID-19.  Ultimately, we need a place where they can go that's more safe, more secure, and  just more respectful for them to be able to get back on their feet again.  So I will be requesting that here in a little bit when it's appropriate.  But we've evaluated a tremendous number. We've even evaluated  drainage systems.  We've looked at a tremendous  number of properties and nothing has panned out quite yet, but we're getting there. Yeah, thank you.  I just want to thank staff for the effort on that $22 million. It's been a long haul and it demonstrates  how important housing and that infrastructure need in that area is. Again,  they gave us $22 million to make sure that we were going to be addressing our housing needs,  which is still in crisis, which is still what we keep talking about but not agendizing.  Thank you.  Additional questions or comments?  We received the monthly financial report and budget monitoring reports.  Advanced life support services provision feasibility study for the Chico Fire Department was  posted, so we're receiving it and filing it.  Council member requests pursuant to AP and P-1010, council members may verbally request an item to be submitted.  The item is to be agendized at the future meeting.  After stating what the item would be, a majority voted. The council is needed in order for staff to agendize.  Council members may also submit request in writing.  Mr. Morgan.  Thank you, Madam Mayor. So I would like to make a motion or rather a plea  fully acknowledging that we are  only dealing with emergency actions.  There is ample evidence,  and I think that the needle distribution is horrible for Chico.  If the needle that are found throughout the city, particularly the parks, isn't enough,  the pictures of the various encampments overflowing with needle filth should be, and what I believe should be the last straw.  One of our younger and newer police officers was stuck with a dirty needle over the weekend.  I received a number of semi-frantic emails from a former student of mine who was engaged to that young officer.  By allowing the needle distribution program to be  continued and by not denouncing it and the North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition that sponsors it,  I believe we are putting the lives and livelihoods of our police officers at increased and unnecessary risk  to say nothing of the families and the children the parks should be geared to.  So I am pleading for this body to direct the city attorney  to find any means necessary to rid our city of this program and the needle filth and destruction it is raining on us before another  officer or child has their future and their health.  And that is why we are putting the needle distribution program to death, jeopardized.  Realizing that that would require a vote by you guys to have that discussion at another meeting so we could direct the city attorney to find  some measure.  Where we head?  I'll second the motion to move forward. However, I do have a question for the city attorney.  Is this  on February 18th,  I believe  direction was given for you to bring  a report back to us to let us know what our legal abilities were, if anything, to be able to  ban and or alter the needle  distribution program. So and we've never gotten that report back. So  Yeah, I don't recall the exact date or the  exact scope,  but we have done research.  We are ready to bring back  an update.  Certainly.  But we ran into the essential items only  Directive.  I believe at that meeting we also requested to have a report from the North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition  to talk about their  their operation  their goals, their  record keeping, all, a report.  And they were ready to bring it back to us at the time that we closed down.  The timing sounds right because my recollection on that was that it'd be brought back within 30 days.  Yes.  And then it was mid-March when everything shut down.  So perhaps that's already in the pipeline?  If the pipeline is that is on a planning agenda, I don't believe that is.  I think it is on a slotted in for an actual date.  Perhaps if you could direct us to bring it back on some date certain, we'll hit that goal.  Okay.  Well, we can't do that until we're actually doing business.  Okay.  So there is a motion and a second.  I think I need clarity on the motion.  Yes.  What are you, what's being requested and when?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  So I would request that we ask the city attorney who is coming forward with a report at some point.  I believe particularly, I believed it before, but particularly after the officer got stuck with what we know to be a dirty needle,  that that is considered emergency business, putting our police officers in danger.  And at the earliest possible time, we get a report from the city attorney on possible methods of banning said activities.  Okay.  So Council Member Morgan, are you specifically requesting that we suspend our...  Not at all.  I believe this falls under the emergency ordinance.  I believe that...  I'm sorry, Ms. Brown, to be clear, I'm not asking that we talk about it tonight.  I'm not asking...  I know.  Okay.  You're saying your argument is that we don't need to do anything to suspend our agreement and our rules under the emergency ordinance,  because your argument is that it is an emergency business.  Correct.  Okay. Thank you.  And I also recall at our last meeting in May, I can't remember what date that would have been,  we had a discussion to be able to bring back non-emergency items or non-essential items,  but the council voted that they wanted to move forward with that.  But not until we had a venue that allowed the public to interchange, to participate fully in that discussion.  So in my mind, that we, with the Grace Baptist Church opening up their...  Grace meeting.  Grace meeting. I'm sorry. Okay.  Okay.  With the promise of a facility...  With the promise of a facility, we would be able to bring back those types of items,  the needle exchange, the cannabis initiative, things that are pressing in our community  that have gone too far without us taking action on, and so much unsettledness,  that I interpret that as being able to bring non-essential items back.  Mr. Orme looks like he's shaking his head.  Mr. Sure. That was staff's impression as well.  You know, from housing to cannabis to...  I mean, I could go down a list and everybody's got items of import,  and it was my impression from council's prior direction is that as soon as we had public engagement,  that we would bring those items forward.  That was my understanding as well.  Mr. I would agree that that's true.  And it sounds like perhaps the first meeting in August.  Is that our next meeting?  August 4th.  Mr. August 4th.  Mr. So it takes care of itself.  Are we having another meeting, Jillian?  It's not scheduled.  So it would be a special meeting if we had one in July.  Mr. Okay. I'm not asking for a special meeting.  But so given the time-sensitive nature, it's going to be...  So emergency, no emergency, whatever, my motion is that this come back to us quickly.  And I appreciate the housing discussion.  I appreciate the marijuana discussion.  I appreciate all of those discussions.  But every week we don't deal with this,  tens of thousands of needles are being dumped in our parks.  Every single week.  Mr. So this is a different motion than the motion that we already came to some conclusion on  that was supposed to be scheduled but never got scheduled because the timing got thrown off with COVID.  So I'm still supportive of having what we originally agreed on, that discussion.  Um...  We're still waiting on that.  Mr. I don't know how I'm going to vote on your proposal, Sean.  Um...  You specifically say bring it back so you ban it.  That's different than hearing the attorney talk about what our options are.  So you're precluding our, our, what we're going to do.  Um...  From what I've read, and I've several times tonight have mentioned I'm not an attorney,  that both the city attorney and the county council, I read in the newspaper,  believe that a ban is illegal, that that's not how you overturn a government agency's directive.  But it's a feel-good thing.  Everyone feels then that the needles are going to be gone.  In truth, looking at what I read in the paper,  the CEQA problem with the government directive,  is really the way that you would restrict needle distribution.  And that is in the courts, I understand, as I read the newspaper.  So what I would be looking for from the city attorney  is an update on that legal action that could well meet your needs  more effectively rather than a feel-good thing  that is not going to be enforceable.  So I don't understand.  You put us in a position where you only want us to take one action.  Is there a substitute motion?  Not on a request from a council member to agenda.  Okay, thank you.  Okay, so there is a motion on the floor.  Any additional comments?  I would like us to talk about this item  in context of our original discussion.  So I am supportive of that.  Council Member Heber?  No.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ory?  No.  Council Member Reynolds?  Yes.  Council Member Stone?  Nay.  No emergency.  Vice Mayor Brown?  No.  Mayor Schwab?  No.  Fails 5-2.  Any other council member requests?  I would like us to open up our agendas,  but I don't think I will get a second.  I would like to open up our agendas,  but I won't get a second.  I would like to request that,  at the August meeting,  we end the prohibition of whatever we want to bring up  and discuss and start opening it up to all the items  that are in front of us.  And so I would ask at that meeting  that the city attorney's report on dealer distribution,  cannabis issue, would both be scheduled for that meeting.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Sooner if possible.  Would you also include the North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition's report at that meeting?  Because I believe they were supposed to come up with it.  Whatever the regional proposal was.  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  I second it on the basis that whatever's in the queue.  I don't want to jump ahead that we agreed that we would have things in the queue.  Well, it was at the meeting where we decided to not continue this,  so I would say it's top of the queue.  Okay.  So is that based on the premise that we will be,  at a different venue that allows us to do that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, sure.  Yes.  Would you accept that as a yes?  Right.  Sorry?  No.  I think we're just confirming it.  We're just finalizing the agreement.  I think the intention is there, but until the ink is on the paper,  I don't think we can say for sure that we will be meeting there.  Okay.  So there is a motion.  So I'm sorry to clarify.  So if we're not meeting there, we're still going to open everything up.  We're going to open up the agenda.  Do you want to clarify what your motion is?  I'll go with that.  If at the August meeting we're still closed down,  I will at that time request that at the following meeting we go ahead and hear it anyway.  You know, certainly hearing a report can be done with everyone getting the information.  And I want to remind folks how far that the cannabis issue was,  and how far that the cannabis issue was finalized.  We went through the final couple items that we needed to clarify with council votes  and directed the city attorney to bring it back for an initial reading.  And so what we would have, we would have an initial reading,  and then we would have two weeks to a month to get public feedback before we take final action.  So it just seems to me we can move on those two fairly quickly.  I'll withdraw my second on the mandate.  Just that we're, it's only if we're at Grace Community Church.  I encourage somebody else to pop in on the second.  But I'd like to see us continue opening things up, the agendas up. The agenda is up. I'm sorry. Let's keep my mask so I can't hear it.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really  I can vote for that because that's what we'll be doing anyway.  We're just like reaffirming it.  Okay.  Yes.  Okay.  Any further discussion?  Comments?  Okay.  Ms. Rogers, are you ready for a vote?  Yes.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ory?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Awesome.  Okay.  Additional?  Okay.  Before we adjourn to closed session, as you heard, City Manager Orym has requested that  an additional item be added to closed session, which arose after the posting of the agenda.  Any details?  Yes.  So that we can-  Yes.  We can make that vote?  It would be a property negotiation item.  And the property owner is Life Touch and Life Touch National School Studios Incorporated.  Assessor's parcel's number is 040310070 and 040310071.  So with that, we would need to have a motion in order to add that to our closed session agenda.  So moved.  The motion would need to make the finding that this came up after the posting of the agenda and requires action prior to the next session.  Yes.  Council meeting.  As we've been instructed by City Manager Orym.  So moved.  Do I have a motion?  Second.  And a second.  So the motion was by Council Member Stone and the second was by Council Member Huber.  For the government code, this would require a two-thirds vote.  Two-thirds vote.  So seven.  That would be five votes.  Five votes.  Is that correct?  Correct.  Okay.  We'll never get that.  Okay.  Are we ready?  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Council Member Ory?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  And Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Okay.  Before we go into closed session, we need to review any public comments and ask for council disqualifications.  Any public comments?  Okay.  Thank you.  Ms. Rogers, were there any comments submitted through Engage Chico on closed session?  It doesn't.  There's none on our report.  No.  Okay.  And no emails.  Okay.  Any council disqualifications?  So we will adjourn to closed session.  Thank you.  Thank you. So we'll adjourn to closed session.  So we'll adjourn to closed session.  So we'll adjourn to closed session. Okay. So we'll adjourn to closed session.
