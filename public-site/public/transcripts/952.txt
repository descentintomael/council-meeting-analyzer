 Hi. Hiya. Come on. . All right. We're ready. Everybody. All right. We will call the regular city council meeting. Chico on April 6th to order and we will start with our invocation from police chaplain Chaplain Chauvin. Welcome. Thank you. All right. You can stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. All right. Madam Clerk, can you do roll call, please? Council Member Brown? Council Member Denley? Council Member Huber? Here we go. Okay. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Tandon? Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here. And Mayor Colage? Present. All right. So we're going to start with noting that Item 5.2 has been moved to a future meeting at request of staff. And then also that Item 5.6, or sorry, not Item 5.6.alen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen'salen be lacking in terms of exactly what was presented. Is the Native Health Department here? They are. And we're gonna table their item. You wanna address it, we can address it, but they're probably gonna have to come back after. Did they request to have the item pushed? No, I just felt the items were. So a lot of the budget items, the actuals show zeros. I will do this. And what I think is a new found sense of stewardship and compatibility and working together like I've never seen, I would hate to ask the staff from Behavioral Health to go back after they've shown up. My guess would be that anything that is lacking, they'd be willing to bring back if we needed to, but especially given some of the things the County has offered to the City of late, it'd be pretty bad faith to send them away. I know if that happened to me, I'd be unhappy. Well, I was thinking about it the other way, but your way is fine. So that we'd spare them the time and then they could just come back with the rest. Unless they're sitting here really hoping that we don't talk about it, they can all leave. In which case I've said the entirely wrong thing. I think they're all right either way. I can't read their faces, they're all masked. Yes. Okay, we can pursue with the item, that's fine. Okay. All right. So. So. Public participation. This meeting is being conducted in accordance with executive order N-2920. The public may view the meeting on Comcast channel 11 or via streaming video, which can be found on the city's website. Public participation prior to the meeting, the engaged Chico civic engagement program was available for input on individual agenda items prior to the meeting with comments closing at 4.30 today. Public participation during the meeting via Zoom. The public can participate during the meeting by accessing the Zoom meeting information found on in the agenda. To speak on an item in Zoom, each item is announced and staff will begin staff report. Click on the raise hand icon if you'd like to speak on that item as soon as it's being heard. The city clerk will call your name when it's your turn to speak. When your name is called, you will be prompted to unmute yourself. When your time is up, you will be muted. You will repeat the process for each item you wanna speak on. So at this time, please raise your hand. If you have any questions, please raise your hand. If you wish to speak on the consent agenda. Item two, consent agenda. The consent agendas for those items routine in nature and can be acted on in one motion. Are there any council disqualifications or no votes? No. All right. Any citizens wishing to address the consent agenda? Well, I just wanna make sure their hands have been up for quite some time. So I have Grace Marvin and Julian Zenner. And if you are both wanting to speak on the consent agenda, please go ahead and leave your hand up. If not, if you could please remove your hand or move it down. Okay, so the hands are still up, although they did move in position. So I'm gonna go ahead and call Grace Marvin and see if she would like to speak on the consent agenda, which would be the Sue and Lou resolutions and the approval of the minutes. Actually, she's no longer there. So Julian Zenner. I have a motion to approve the consent agenda. Pertaining to the consent agenda? Thank you. And I also have nothing on the agenda. Okay, so thank you. So we have 14 attendees in the waiting room. And if you would raise your hand, when you hear, the item called that you would like to speak on, otherwise your hand remains up and we think that you want to speak on all the items, which you're more than free to do that, if you would like. So there are no speakers for the consent agenda. All right. We have a motion. Move approval of consent. Second. First and second. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Just waiting for my computer. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the number of speakers. The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? The hands are continuing to be raised, but right now I have six with their hands up, so I'll start. Nicole Nava is our first speaker. Hello, can you hear me okay? Yes, go ahead, Nicole. Thank you, Dean Council. I just want to first start out by thanking you for the ongoing cleanups that are occurring. I do understand that it is difficult and a challenging topic for many, but by speaking as a neighbor who is most appreciative, I've been able to actually go on. For the first time in a long time, to ride my bike and enjoy all those things. I've also had an eye out for a lot of the people that are on the wind chime area, and they all expressed how nice it's been. It's just been a lot more calm. There's been still some clearing out happening, and I know that there's neighbors in their other areas that are anxious to have that happen as well. And Ms. Debbie, I'm just wondering if there's some reason, that's defaulted to my own picture versus you guys, so I don't see a countdown. So just interject when you need to. And so I did want to just say that I appreciate that it takes teleports and all other people coordinating the rangers, the police, etc. I do especially appreciate the excessive lead up time to the movement in parks to notify people who are staying. There are resources and things available. And I also very much appreciate that some of the service providers have stepped up to start verbalizing their openings more transparently more often. And I think that's been a positive step for this community. I look forward to people partnering even more like that, so that we can get people quickly to services. And I do hope we hit our all presents tonight, because I did an awful lot of reading, and I'm going to be interested to hear a lot about that topic, because it plays a big role in what's going on in this community. So again, I wanted to express my thanks on this and say I know there's a lot of work to be done that's going to take time, and we're in your department with you, so thank you. Thank you, Nicole. Our next speaker is David Peterson. Can you hear me okay? Yes, go ahead. Thank you, Council and staff. I appreciate the time to speak to you guys. I'm your most favorite cannabis applicant. Probably what I mean is most annoying, and I apologize about that. Anyway, I'm trying to continue to keep the ball rolling here with the application process. I really appreciate everything you guys have done so far on getting the ball continuously moving forward. I know that there's a staff report due back, sometime hopefully this month. But I'm wondering if maybe there's a possibility that some additional clarification can come back on the motion itself, or maybe some guidance can be given on addressing the application process restarting and separate that from the other portions of the motion on bringing back what the community benefits fee versus the cost. So that we can see what the developmental agreement would look like and the additional tax information. I think the way that I heard the motion from last March was that that was a separate item. And it sounds like the staff thinks or heard that that was a complete request altogether. So I'm just wondering if maybe you would help staff to pack those items separately. It would lessen that workload, I think, in the long run. and additionally support some of the applicants on the front end of the thing. It's all well and good in the right direction for us. Just a reminder that we're going on just about six months from the start of the application process. And like I said, I am the only applicant with an application still sitting there and paying my leases and just kind of wasting money at this time. Anything you guys can do, I appreciate it. All in all, you guys are doing a great job. Keep moving forward. Thanks. Thank you, David. And I would like to just make a clarification that those two items are separated out. The city attorney will be addressing the community benefits agreement versus a development agreement context that was requested by council, and he'll be doing that at the next meeting April 20th. And then the internal finance committee discussed the potential sales tax for the cannabis, and that conversation has just begun. So those are not married. Together, they are running separate circuits. Just wanted to let you know that. Next speaker is Julian Zenner. If you'd be kind enough, I would appreciate it if you could smarten up my floor right now. Once I call your name, I just need you to go ahead and go. Julian, I'm sorry. I have you in the system. Okay. I'm speaking in tandem with Grace Martin's comments that we thought might come first. This has to do with recommendations that CC4J has in their contract negotiations with the Police Officers Association. One, we would like you to require all officers to receive a minimum of 40 hours of service. 24 hours of training sufficient to prepare them for crisis situation in the field with funding to be provided. Two, require that mental health professionals be available to partner with chief of police officers at all times, not just during business hours, but 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, we'd like you to establish a right along program from mental health professionals to company officers on their beat, to model calming and de-escalation approaches to interactions with the public with funding to be provided. Three, officers responding to potentially lethal crisis situations must be equipped and well trained to apply non-lethal alternatives to lethal force whenever possible. To that end, the chief of PD will purchase an adequate supply of less than lethal weapons, such as feedback shotguns, and bullet wraps. All officers must be fully trained in their use and required beginning of their shift to make sure these items are readily accessible with funding to be provided. Four, presently the City of Chico pays 100% of legal fees and fines for defending Chico police against civil lawsuits. Thus, they have no financial incentive to avoid the danger of a criminal case. We urge the City of Chico to require police to pay 20% of such legal fees from their own budget. CC4J's ultimate goal is to create a culture within the Chico Police Department that values the dignity of all citizens and works to preserve human life. We acknowledge that the responsibility for police actions ultimately rests with the community itself. We urge the Council to join us in accepting that responsibility. Together, we can save lives. Thank you for considering these thoughts. Thank you, Julian. Grace Marvin? If you can unmute yourself. Thank you. Okay, so I'm going to go to Emily Alma first then. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We are a volunteer coalition in Chico and Butte County, founded in 2017 in response to the officer-involved shooting death of a young man who at the time of his death was in the throes of a mental health crisis. Since then, local police officers have killed two more young men suffering from mental health crises. We believe these men will be alive today having officers called to the scene and employ de-escalation techniques now being used by law enforcement agencies across our country. In the current police policy manual, there is no requirement for a specific number of training hours. Moreover, it is unclear whether or how much training our officers receive. Even though, quote, quote, unquote, unquote, unquote, unquote, unquote, unquote, unquote, unquote, unquote, unquote, unquote, unquote, contract recommendations in light of the concerns that CC4J has expressed in this last meeting. Thank you very much. Thank you, Grace. Emily, Alma? You can unmute yourself. Thank you. Alright, well, I'm also involved in the! There's a background case. They didn't have time to finish what they had to say. But I do want to urge the city council to consider the response that Julian and Grace have expressed. We are not anti-police. I have to be very clear about that. We feel that the police, Kikopedi are part of our community, and they hold an important role. And what we want is a cultural change that will help prepare the loss of lives. And other communities all over the country are presently changing their policies to make sure that loss of life is the very, very last possibility in action. So, I just want to say that we sent this letter with the same information to each of the council members. And we hope very much that you'll take this seriously in your negotiations and in your views, knowing that our intention is not to oppose the police, but to work with them to make changes for the city and all in our community, including us. So, thank you. Thank you, Emily. Jessica Giannola? Go ahead. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead, Jessica. Oh, gosh. I'm outside the building, and I can tell you it's really frustrating that every time I see someone opening the door and knocking it, it's so symbolic about how we're being locked out like the capers. We should be there at this point, even if we're not. We should be there. So, anyway, there's a lot of people out here, again, and I spoke about the loss of conflict, but it's really a problem. We're out here because we're asking for help for the human beings that are being referred to as trash. We have elected officials who are putting effort into cleaning parks, and putting money into police, and all kinds of stuff, but forgetting about the people that are being pushed around. You have 141 people at a cop street who are about ready to be pushed again, their items thrown away again, and there's no care for our city council of those minus two, maybe three, that are actually showing concerned care about what happens to these people. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Absolutely. Ashamed. I see people, they're thinking of you, good job Chico, good job city council, good job for what? You have people here, you have citizens here, who are being ignored, traumatized, and I see these words like they're garbage, cleaning up the filth. People are talking about people when they're saying that. And I'm not seeing anything in the council as a whole of, hey, let's do something for these people. Because Demby, last time, he says, I don't see the point in discussing more shelter options. He says the point is completely clueless as to what's going on here. We don't have personal attacks on council members from anybody to anybody. Yeah, Jessica, you can make comments in general, but we ask you to refrain from attacks on individual council members, please. Okay, well, I was quoting her, so I don't have to quote her. You did add some negative words in there about her as well, so. If you could reframe from that, we'd appreciate it. Okay. I just wish you guys would do that job about school goals and really hear and care about all the people. The poor people, too. The people who can't afford to rent somewhere are being mad. They have nobody sticking up for them. We have a few people out here. That's all we can ask. It's your guys' job. Just do what you guys please. I'm done. Okay, thank you, Jessica. Our last speaker is Lisa Currier. Hello. Hi, Lisa. Yes, go ahead. Okay. I'm Lisa Currier. I'm the I just want to say, I wrote a letter in earlier yesterday, and I think we have a lot of people out here doing outreach and helping people give a hand up and a handout. I'm just so tired of the classification of different groups saying, you're not helping because you're giving a hand up or a handout or all these different things. All I know is that there's not one solution for anything. There's multiple people who have to be involved because all the different outreach groups, like I said in my letter to you, do different things. I go to court every week and advocate for people and help families and tomorrow I'm taking one line of fishing. You know what I mean? There's different ways of building the relationships and trust of our homeless population. I think there's something that's louder, and I've been thinking about it for a long time, and actually, I think I should speak it out loud, that the de-escalation training is critical for our officers and our first responders. But what if we set up an annual training for anybody who wanted to come, such as street outreach people, homeless people, any type of person. So that way, we can understand the baseline of folks. So if I know that Scott is acting a little bit different that day, that person on the street, or a business owner, or an outreach person, can actually be called and go de-escalate the situation before it escalates to police violence. And not everything ends up in police violence. You know, I just I'm really concerned about that. And, you know, a lot of people don't realize that when you have children who are mentally ill, and they are off their medications, and have a mishap that happens in your neighborhood, or your landlord doesn't want you to live there anymore because of that, that there's a mishap from your child who is off their medications, and now you have an eviction. And you have somebody who's out now with their children, mentally ill children, and, um, you know, out of housing. There's a lot more people, the unseen people, the people that we don't see, there's over a thousand children in this tiny age of 12 without homes. We just need to be a little bit more compassionate, if you will. We need to help them. And I'm not saying that we're Thank you. Lisa's time was up, and so it shut off. She was our last speaker. Okay. Thank you very much. All right. We will move on to public hearings. Item 4.1, hearing in accordance with Civil Code Section 817.2 on dissolution of Turning into an equity housing cooperative. So at this time, if you wish to speak on this item, please raise your hand. And there is no staff presentation or report being provided. So at this point in time, we'd open the public hearing to receive comments and identify any written comments as well. Oh, do we have a report? Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't have the information for that person. I apologize. That's okay. No worries. Sorry about that. No problem. Honorable Mayor, members of council, my name is Shawna O'Shaughnessy, and I'm the President and CEO of Community Housing Improvement Program, CHIP. And the staff report that you have in your packet is very complete. It gives background on the project, why it's coming to the council, and what the goals are. But I thought I'd provide a little bit of context. So Turning Point Commons was the first project that CHIP built in the city of Chico. And it was never owned by CHIP. It was always a co-op. And it operated for decades as a co-op, effectively providing really quality, affordable housing. It's a lovely area. It's beautiful back there. We were no longer the property manager kind of in the teens, the 2000 teens, and it had some ups and downs during that period, and one of the buildings burned. But they stabilized and they were looking for funding to try to do the repairs. CHIP became involved again. And the board and the membership of the co-op did a lot of thinking about what they wanted. And they've decided that they would like us to take on the property to dissolve the co-op, and then we would commit to applying for low income housing tax credits to do a full rehab. It is an older property. It was built in the early 80s. And so we are completely committed to this project. We want to maintain quality, affordable housing, well integrated into the community. And we're excited about this opportunity. Because it is a co-op, a limited equity co-op, it is required that we host we host you, host a public hearing, and that you basically certify the process. So I'm here to answer any questions. Is Karen on the line? And the attorney that is an expert in co-op law is on the line if you ask a question that I cannot answer. Alright. Do we have any questions? I have one question. Go ahead. I was just curious, when I was reading through, a lot of it was honestly kind of over my head, the way the switch would work. And I noticed it said that Turning Point residents would receive their membership value upon transfer. What does that look like? Is that chip paying them out? Like is there a sale of the property? Or how is that working? So there has the requirement for the limited equity co-op and its designation for permanent affordable housing. There's no profit that members can make. But they are entitled to their membership, which the way that it's calculated is approximately their deposit amount. So we would pay out that to them upon the transfer of the property. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you for changing the wording a little bit. I appreciate it. Alright. Any other questions? So at this time we'll open the public hearing to receive any further comments and identify any written comments. We do not have any speakers. No? Alright. And so we'll close the hearing and entertain a motion to adopt the resolution. And I'll make the motion of resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico approving the dissolution of the Turning Point Commons Limited Equity Housing Cooperative and make certain findings as required by Civil Code Section 817 dot 2. Second. I'll motion and second. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. Alright. Item 4.2. Hearing Ordering Formation of Maintenance Assessment District A30 Tatro Parcel Map 17-02. Mr. Ottoboni? Yes. Good evening Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council Members. A condition of approval of a final subdivision map requires the property owner, in this instance Chuck Tatro Construction, to provide a means for funding the future replacement and annual operations and maintenance costs of certain public improvements which are of special benefit to the subdivision. So item 4.2 is requesting formation of maintenance district A30 to cover those future costs. That concludes my report. I'm available for any questions. Thank you, Mr. Ottoboni. Any questions? Alright. Seeing no questions, we will at this time open the public hearing. Anyone wishing to address this item? No. Alright. So we will close the public hearing. And I will make a motion that we adopt the resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico ordering formation of a maintenance assessment district and approving a declaration of conditions, covenants, and restrictions relating thereto. City of Chico Maintenance Assessment District Number A30 Tatro Parcel Map 17-02. Second. A motion and a second. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll, please? Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. Alright. Item 4.3, amendments to exempt governmental signs in Chapter 19.74 of Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Sign Code. So we will open the hearing to the public on proposed amendments of the Title 19 Municipal Code. Any speakers at this time? Do we have a report as well? Well, we do. I'm sorry. That's okay. No problem. I guess there wasn't any. I apologize, Bruce. Your name wasn't on there. Fire away. These are simple and focused amendments to the sign ordinance that involve four key changes. The first are new definitions that include the definition of an informational sign kiosk and a governmental sign. The second change includes the creation of an exemption for governmental signs, which would be any sign that's approved by the council to be located on city property. The third change is modification of the definition of electronic read award sign to exempt an informational sign kiosk, which is part of our newly created definition. And lastly, we're adding, we would like to recommend adding provisions in the PQ public, public zone that give the director the ability to review sign and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and write up and All right. So now we'll open the public hearing for speakers. There are none. No speakers. We'll close the public hearing. And then is there a motion to introduce the ordinance to amend Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code? Move to approve. I'll second. And that's an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Chapter 19.74 of the Chico Municipal Code to exempt governmental signs. Madam Clerk, could you take the roll? Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Cooley? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Item 4.4, Vegetative Fields Management Plan and Program Environmental Impact Report. And I believe it's Linda, not Eric. Yes. Yes. By the way. Mayor and Council. Hello. I do have a presentation if I could. It's coming. There, I pushed the button. I'll be brief. Since this is the first time that you probably have seen some of this information, I wanted to just kind of go briefly over it. So, the Vegetative Fuels Management, can you hear me okay? Okay. The Vegetative Fuels Management Plan and EIR. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. today. I also have a representative from the RCD here in case you have more detailed questions that I can't answer. So we received a grant from CAL FIRE, Community Wildfire Protection Grant, and the goal is, I won't go through each of these, but basically is to reduce wildfire risk, to reverse the effects of the fire suppression, be more resilient to fire and climate change, to streamline CEQA, and then also this fulfills an outstanding goal of the Bidwell Park Master Management Plan, which is to develop a fuels management program. So what we looked at is all city-owned parks, green creek-sized preserves, as well as open spaces, such even vacant parcels. You see all those little light green ones. Amazing how many property we actually have in town and the right-of-way. It encompasses about 6,400 acres. We actually think that's probably a little higher now, and as new development comes on, we generally have more open space be added as part of that development. So we might be seeing more acreage. As far as preserves come on board that we would have to manage. So what the team did was look at four different LIDAR flights to try to determine and characterize the wildfire hazard of all those properties that we just described. It's kind of amazing how you can get this 3D image out of the LIDAR. And from there, they determined and looked at all the city properties and determined where the fire risk and simulations were. The red you see there is what we call torching and crown fire. Torching is literally like it sounds. It starts and flares up like a torch. Surface fire is going to be the green that you see, which is typically grasslands and that's kind of meanders. The easiest fire to probably put out. But the torching is a crown fire, just as it says. It hits the crowns and goes up the tree, burns up, hits the crowns and can jump from crown to crown to crown. That's the most destructive and hardest to put out. So out of those, we divided all that land and divided all that vegetation, into five different major categories. Grasslands, as I mentioned, valley oaks, riparian areas, blue oak, grapevine, and what we call upland mix. And that's primarily in the upper part area where we have all kinds of different vegetation. And then from there, we looked at what do we do, how do we treat this vegetation. And so we again lumped those into what the typical categories are. Manual hand labor, which are string trimmers or chainsaws. Mechanical removal, such as string trimmers, which are chippers, mowers, or masticators. Chemicals, such as herbicides. Biological grazing. I should have put that goat picture in here. And insects. And then we want to bring back fire to what was naturally occurring in our wildlands and what a lot of species depend upon having. So we're talking about doing pile burning, cultural burning. We're doing more smaller type burns, maybe in lower park. You've probably heard of biochar. And then control burns, which the, this is actually the ecological reserve who has been doing hundreds of acres just east of us and with much success. So we'd like to try to introduce that back into our management practices for our vegetation that we now have to manage. We also tried to identify key projects, implementation projects. And I want to make a point that these are possible. They aren't part of, they don't, may not happen. They may not. We wanted to kind of get the environmental review done on some of these projects that could happen. Ten mile house road fuel break. The upper park, um, bulldozer lines from the Stony Fire. We would like to go and do some work on those because what we're finding is Cal Fire, as well as our own fire department, wants to have those access points. They want to know where they can come and enter. For instance, the Stony Fire, they entered down Ten mile house road but it was way over by bare hole. So they had to follow and drive all that way to get to that, to that fire. And then also it allows the fuel breaks, actually as it is, where once we clear the vegetation and get it to the point of being a true fuel break, it will stop the fire hopefully at that point as well. Lindo Channel is one that we're looking at. Also, I actually have a FEMA grant application in process for defensible space along Lindo Channel, so we're hoping to get that funded. My understanding is it's going through environmental review, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. And then maybe doing some star thistle burns in Neva Park. And then the giant reed, like the bamboo around those, is a big problem on Little Chico Creek. And then all these lower Bib Park always needs thinning and pruning. So we wanted to try to look at those projects. It doesn't mean, like I said, we have the funding for them, nor does it mean we may implement them, but we wanted to at least list them as examples of what the city may contemplate doing in the future. So that's all projects we would need to do environmental review. So we could have done a lesser document, like a mitigation. But we wanted to do a programmatic EIR, primarily because we want to be able to tear off of it for all these activities, so we don't have to do individual EIR for each of the projects that we may do. So as typical EIRs, we analyze the impacts of what could happen if we were to implement these projects, or sometimes just activities, not necessarily projects, just activities. And then what are the standard requirements or similar best management? So we have a standard best management practice that we can incorporate to protect the wildlife and the diversity and species while we're doing these activities that's needed for fire reduction as well as biodiversity. And then future projects may need further environmental review if they're larger and weren't necessarily completely covered under the EIR, and we plan on still doing that further SQL effort in the future for those particular projects. But the whole idea was to try to streamline some of the smaller projects that we do, and we're going to do that in the parks and our green lands, but go through the proper process of having SQL review and having a plan on how we manage those. And so the public knows also what types to expect, what type of activities to expect when we're out there in the field doing the work. So I won't go much on the EIR, pretty much what I said. It does have a mitigation monitoring reporting program, and the big one is this project consistency checklist. So this is going to be a checklist that staff is going to go through, to check all those boxes that see whether there's any impacts, whether it is included in the PIR and can be tiered off the PIR, or whether it just needs further environmental review to continue. There's also maps and some tables in there to support the information in there. And also the EIR also has comments that we receive through the public, through the whole public process. So finally, as in conclusion, both the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission has unanimously approved, approved the approval of the certifying of the EIR, approval of the Vegetation Fuels Management Plan. And so as staff, so we ask that you conduct the public hearing and approve the two resolutions that are before you. And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer. All right, any questions at this time? Thank you. I think it's an excellent report. I'm actually going to ask that we take a recess at this time. We've got some loud audible noise outside that's just interfering with our ability, and it's very high up here, I think, a little bit. And we're going to ask the sergeant at arms to check on what's causing the disturbance. So at this time, we're going to take a short recess and we'll come back and finish this item. Thank you.

We've had 217 people that have successfully transitioned to permanent or transitional housing from Project Roomkey, and we've served 502 since the program began. Sorry, it's a little funky because we're on a PDF, so bear with me. Um, so as I mentioned, we did create the home branch last August of 2019, and we started from the ground up, and I was fortunate to hire Don Taylor, who had experience working with the homeless population and in the behavioral health realm, and so he came over, and then he was successful in hiring his full team by February of last year. So we've been in existence for literally just over a year, and since that entire time, they have been managing Project Roomkey in addition to all the other milestones that we set forward with the Board of Supervisors, and I'm very pleased to report every one of our milestones that we proposed, they have successfully achieved in their first year, in addition to unforeseen things such as Project Roomkey and the COVID pandemic. So what does the home branch do? So it's an organization known as the housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and housing and And of course, as I mentioned, we're managing Project Roomkey. In addition to a variety of other things, most importantly, and when we were developing the idea of Home Branch, was the idea that like many counties in California, that the county could be the lead agency for the COC. We were approached by the COC team, executive team at the time, about the possibility of this. And we received approval from our board to assume that responsibility. And I will tell you, the timing was impeccable because the previous lead entity had been a local nonprofit who just was very clear they did not have bandwidth to take on what they saw coming down, kind of a tsunami of services and monies that needed to be managed, needed to have RFPs developed, needed to have contracts written and monitored. And we were fortunate that the county had that infrastructure in order to take on that very heavy lift. So Don and his team have been successful in that transition, have, in my opinion, brought the COC to a whole new level. They have worked tirelessly to create policies, work on new governance structure with the members of the COC, and have really, in my opinion, done a bang-up job in bringing some cohesiveness to the COC. And for that, I'm very appreciative of. So the COC, for those in the community who are not familiar, was developed out of the McKinney-Vento Act back in 2009 and has since then become a requirement for many, if not all, federal and state dollars. You must have a regional COC in order to be a recipient of many grants. In our county, we... We are the region, which our region happens to be just Butte County. Some of our counties around us are more regional in their approach. They have multiple counties, but in Butte, we have just our own. So the continuum of care operates the regional COC, and we designate the HMIS system for the COC, which is a database that collects all of the data on those individuals experiencing homelessness. And we do the planning. We do the planning for the continuum's geographic area. So one thing I want to be really clear on is the COC does not have a bank account. They don't have a means to accept monies. That's why we are identified as administrative entities. So we are a fancy secretary and treasurer, is what the county's role is. The board does not make decisions on the COC. They have a representative on the COC, but they are not... They are not the decision makers. The contracts that we write out of my department for the COC are funneled through our board just as a signer, but they don't get to make decisions on that. And whether a contract that the COC has approved is approved by the board or not. They're literally just a signatory, so that the funds can be released through our auditor. So as the administrative entity, we are responsible for grant applications for funding. We... The team develops the RFPs to release those funds to the COC and the community. And they're responsible for the grant monitoring and reporting back to the state or the federal government. We act as the COC lead agency and collaborative applicant. Again, those are fiduciary responsibilities that are required. And then we also, as I said, are the lead agency for the HMIS system and the coordinated entry system. That's the end of my quick presentation. And Dr. Connelly is here. I'm happy to take any questions specific to my department. If you have any. I do. Thank you for that. You're welcome. Going back to your first slide, I had just a couple of questions... Sure. ...about the emergency declaration. So we seem to get asked all the time, we're told all the time, that if the city declares, this is an emergency, then the county would have to step in and help the city with homelessness issues. Can you please explain and clarify what the emergency declaration process is, what the steps are, and how those steps could or could not benefit the city in funding some solutions? That's number one. Okay. Number two is, the city's declared a housing crisis. Mm-hmm. What does that mean, and how does it differ from an emergency proclamation? Right. So emergency proclamations... I'll take the second question first. Emergency proclamations have to meet criteria of an identified disaster. So homelessness would not meet criteria for Cal OES or FEMA to get involved. So there's no funding connected to that resolution or declaration. It's different than an emergency declaration. Homelessness by itself does not meet the criteria for that, to open up those pots of funding. That make sense? Okay, I'm going to try and remember your first question. Sure. First question. I'll go over it again. Yes. Explain why, explain and clarify what the emergency declaration process is, what the steps are, and how that could or could not benefit the city in funding some solutions. Yeah, so kind of back to my last answer. There are, the steps are laid out so that the city can, so the first step, a serious, unexpected, or dangerous situation arises which requires action. So, I mean, one could argue homelessness would maybe meet that criteria. The city attempts to resolve the emergency but realizes it does not have the resources to do so. So that's the point when, like in my example of a train derailment, it's too big of a disaster for just the city of Chico's fire personnel and emergency personnel to handle, so then you would tap the county and say, we need help, right? So then the city would proclaim a local emergency citing the reasons and that it's unable to resolve and then that's at the point that the county's office of emergency management would step in and say, yes, we agree and then we would start to respond with and support the emergency and then at that point, we would submit, the county would submit the application to Cal OES. If it met criteria for Cal OES and I'll share with you, I mean, there's some things we've gone to Cal OES and they're like, yeah, that doesn't really meet criteria. It's typically windy vents, flood events, fires, earthquakes, natural disasters or very large, like a train derailment. I keep going back to that because that's what they train you about train derailments. It's always the example that they use for whatever reason. If the Cal OES and the state determine, it meets criteria, then it would open up a pot of money from the state and we'd have support and response from the state. So we'd have mutual aid available to us like we saw in the Camp Fire or in the North Complex Fire. Reimbursement would be then opened up and available if it meets criteria. If it doesn't meet criteria, then there would be no funding there. And then if it's larger than the state can handle and it meets the financial thresholds, at that point, then FEMA, we can, the state then requests for FEMA to respond. So it's very different than what we did in order to get the funding that was made available to us by a shelter declaration. Great. That provides a lot of clarity, I believe. I think what I'm hearing you say is there are a number of reasons that it's unlikely that even though our contention may be that our homelessness issue here in Chico is too big for us to handle, there are many steps that we probably wouldn't qualify for to get that money to come to us from the county. Well, the county doesn't have money to assist that. Funneled to us? But it wouldn't meet criteria from Cal OES's perspective. Homelessness is not an eligible criteria. Great. Thank you very much. You're very welcome. Any other questions? I did have two quick questions. You said 217 have successfully transferred out of the project room key, which is amazing. Is case management still, because I'm guessing these are people that are probably recently housed for the first time and they've been stabilized in a hotel and now they're going into some sort of shared living or whatever. Does case management continue when they leave project room key? If they go into a living situation where there's case management available, so we don't have funding to continue case management once they leave project room key. Okay. So once they're into permanent housing or semi-transitional housing, then that part's done. And then you mentioned a regional COC scenario that happens in some areas. Can you describe what the difference and where somewhere like that would work better and or is that something you feel like we should be doing regionally here or is that in smaller, bigger? It's usually in smaller, smaller jurisdictions like farther northern, northern counties. They do it. I would not be a proponent of it. You are splitting a pot of money even farther and there's less pie for the main county, you know. Gotcha. That's what I assumed. I just wanted to clarify that. Yeah. Thank you. I have a quick question. Yes. Thank you for the very thorough presentation. Just to expound on something that Vice Mayor Reynolds just said, when people are transitioning, out of the project room key, are you just simply, are the folks working with those people through DES and Buchanan Behavioral Health just collaborating with other service providers to identify more permanent housing options? If they're identified, if so, I won't speak for Director Connelly, but if they, but I will. So if they have an open behavioral health case, then they're already connected, then they're going to still have that case manager through behavioral health. Got it. If they don't, then DES does not have a case management program set up specifically for project room key. So our housing navigator, though, is able to connect them not only to housing resources, but if there are other programs that they think that they could be a fit for, then they would make that referral and assist them there. But our current contracts with our service providers do not provide for post-project room key case management. It is not an allowable expense from FEMA. And project room key is 100% reimbursable, from FEMA. But FEMA is the payer of last resort. And so we have to expend all of the funds that we've received, and we've received various pots through COVID relief and through state funds. Those must be spent first. Then whatever is left, FEMA will pick up. And that's a process. The money takes a while to get it into the coffers, back to the county. And we anticipate that we will have costs that will go to FEMA and seek reimbursement on at the end of the program. Great. And I, again, appreciate the overview of the programs that you're supporting. It seems like you're doing valuable intervention work, but a lot of the work that you're doing is actually preventing people from ending up on the streets. Is that accurate to say? You know, I don't have, at the tip of my tongue, the split between prevention versus direct intervention. All of the programs, though, are set up to provide prevention and intervention when someone has found themselves homeless. That's not data I brought with me. No problem. Thank you. I had a few questions about the HMIS system area of what you do. It's my understanding that HMIS would be self-reported, basically. Is that correct? Like people would call in and they're self-reporting their conditions, right? So Don Taylor is my HMIS expert, so if you wouldn't mind, Don, answering questions about HMIS. Thanks, Don. Okay, not a problem. Good evening, Council Members. Good evening. Yeah, with HMIS, there is specific HUD data that is required if you can get the information. Some of it is self-reported. It depends upon the individual or the household that you're talking to. So you may be doing, for example, outreach in the street and you have a household saying, here's me, my spouse, my three children. They may not have all the documentation. They may have lost it in a fire. So they may not be able to produce, they may not be able to produce a social security number. So it is going to be self-reported, you know, in that kind of example. Yeah. Do you guys follow up later in the process? Like if they were going to get connected with services, do you then verify and go through that process at some point? It's a process. So after the initial entry, or we call it an HMIS intake, if we're able to get additional supporting documentation, then we will, you know, get that as it comes in. Okay, perfect. And then do you have any idea, I know we might be putting you on the spot with this, but what percentage of the people who are in the HMIS system are from the Chico area specifically in the county versus outside of the Chico area? No, the HMIS data is countywide. It's for the entire continuum. Is there a way to pull, like if we wanted to find out, could we go through the system, or you guys go through the system and figure out what the percentage looks like? We don't currently have a manner in our system, the way to set up right now to say specifically these individuals are Chico versus county. It's a countywide, through the continuum. You can explore looking at it jurisdictionally. Okay. But it's something that can be explored. Yeah, I'd be interested to see just what the shakeout looks like. So I'd be interested to see that maybe in the future. But the point in time study does provide that data once the report is completed. But again, we've, the point in time's been delayed this year because of COVID. So we do get that detail by jurisdiction in that report. All right. Any other questions? Okay. So I have a couple. Before we move on to the other part. So the milestones that you mentioned, would you mind getting a copy to our city manager so we can actually look at what those milestones are? Absolutely. I'm glad you guys checked them off, but I don't know what they are. Sure. And again, this presentation was really developed. Yeah. And I understand we're just scratching the surface. And obviously we have a lot of questions as a council, and our community has a lot of questions too. So you mentioned the case management funding. And I think, obviously, as we move through this, a lot of the blame maybe extends to the state and federal government as, obviously, they don't necessarily provide monies past a certain point or to further along certain things. So I don't necessarily want blame to fall on our county because I know you're limited a lot of times by the state and federal government in terms of what the grants and different programs are. That being said, so when someone finishes Project Room Key, there's no case management whatsoever? Not through Project Room Key. So they could be connected to another program or a funding source, and there'd be potentially case management there. Do you know how often that happens? We'd have to weed through some of the data to see where some of the funding comes from. If we have additional funding, for example, cash, California Emergency Solutions to housing dollars, if we use that for rehousing, then we can support the, We have some of the funding Subsidies for up to 12 months, maybe up to 18 months. And with that comes some case management to do some follow-up. So it depends upon the type of funding that you tie into the exit from Project Room Key. Okay. So do you have that data specifically that you can provide or? It would take some digging through to get it. Okay. And I think what, well what I'm searching for is data. obviously. So that's why actually tracking individual contacts and where they are has a huge value to us. I mean we see that obviously in our other departments within the county and city, you know PD, fire, whatever it might be, you can assume where risk is, you can assume where services are needed, you can identify. So you know location is paramount sometimes to solving these issues and also determining you know an example for our city whether or not we have a larger issue than say other cities within our county. So I think we're just kind of starving for that information to find out actual numbers but you know you guys don't keep those but will we approach the supervisors for possibly making that something that they could incorporate or would that be a department decision? Well what I can let you know is because all the different funding has different reporting requirements and use different software, a lot of that's not compatible so you can't cross reference. It's really you're doing a hand dive into paperwork. And I think it's important to know to really get clear on what we mean by case management. Case management differs by what the program is. So for a family that may have been in project like we have an individual with a child in Project Roomkey who transitions out and their CalWORKs eligible, they're gonna have a different level of case management than an individual elder person who comes out of Project Roomkey and we connect them with our homeless services through our adult services. So I think that's a really important thing to pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and what the expectation is around case management. Gotcha. Okay. I think that's my questions for now. Does anyone else have one? Okay. If you guys want to continue. I would like to offer up one thing, Mr. Mayor, and that is the state, through the Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council, is trying to implement a statewide homeless data integration system. So it'll take all the data from all the different HIMS systems, integrate it together so you can cross-reference across all the CCCs, effectively all the counties. So it's in the process of beta testing. They're just beginning. But the state's looking at trying to do that. And so in the future, we will have access to some data that I think is really going to help us in our needs. Well, and I think maybe you understand, obviously, why that data is king when you go to make decisions. It's obviously very helpful if you actually know numbers and specifics and things along those lines. So I'm not sure the state will rush that system through. Let's hope they make it. That's our priority. We live in a data-driven world. Yes, we do. Well, it does help to make decisions. All right. And then you guys have another part, correct? Director Cannelli is going to come up next. I think Debbie is going to probably have to. Is it connected to this one? I think I'll let you drive. All right. So we're going to go to the full screen, the full? It's expanded on this computer. Okay. Yeah, I mean, just because we're getting the tags, it's not full screen. But that's fine. I'm Scott Cannelli. I think it's on the view if you look. There you go. No, up at the top on file edit view, if you go to view. It's probably play slideshow or something. Page display. Full screen mode or zoom? Full screen mode. All right. That was wonderful. Full screen mode right there. There you go. Thank you. Thank you. I apologize for the delay. I was in my office ready to zoom, and our alarm went off and would not shut off. So my ears have been ringing for a while, but I think I'm back. So good evening. I'm Scott Cannelli. I'm the director for behavior health. Thank you for having me. Thank you for having me tonight. I wanted to talk to you a little bit about our services. I received all the questions that you had sent previously, and I hope this overview gives you some answers to a number of those questions. We'll be talking about our services, our funding, and who we serve, and how it crosses over with the homeless population. So who are we? There's a lot of misconceptions about behavior health in general, but generally behavior health, the county behavior health and any other county behavior health system is a treatment provider. That is our number one mandate, is to provide mental health services to the seriously mentally ill, as well as substance use disorder services to those in Butte County. The serious mental illness term is very important to understand, and I'll explain. It's defined as a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with one's life or limits one's major life activities. That means you're having great difficulty in socialization, you're struggling academically, it could be any of these. You can't maintain a job due to your mental health condition. You're homeless. You're losing your housing, or you're at risk of losing housing due to the serious nature of your mental illness. And that piece is important because behavior health is tasked with the serious mental illness in the community, not the mild to moderate. And I'll tell you a little bit more about that in a sec. Our services are mostly voluntary in nature, and we have a continuum of care from prevention or early intervention services where we do education and early outreach to youth and adults. Then we do outreach. patient specialty mental health services. We do substance use disorder treatment. And then on the tail end of our services, we do what we call wellness services. For those who've gone through our system, been very successful, and it's more of a peer support, peer mentoring programming. And we're wellness centers, as we call them. Bay River Health also operates inpatient services, and those are both voluntary and involuntary, meaning hospitalization, psychiatric hospitalization. We have a 16-bed facility called our PUFF, psychiatric health facility. So the word PUFF is used interchangeably. And that's in Butte County. And we contract with a number of providers out of county to provide inpatient services as well. We're primarily governed by two entities, CMS, which is the federal government, and DHCS, the Department of Health Care Services, which is the state government. Bay River Health and the health care system is a complex system of care. Residents who want to seek services have to navigate three different systems of care. The physical health realm, if they have Medi-Cal, there's two different health plans called Anthem Blue Cross and California Health and Wellness that provide the health plans. And then on the mental health side, we have the serious mental illness, and as I mentioned earlier, the mild to moderate population, or people who are mildly impacted by their depression, or it's a moderate depression, or anxiety, or phobia, those are the responsibility of California Health and Wellness and Anthem Blue Cross. So you have a split system of mental health where clients sometimes can go from being mild to severe mental illness, or get better and then go back into another system. So the navigation between those two systems can be challenging. And then, of course, there's substance use disorder services, which we provide to anyone who has Butte County Medi-Cal, and there's a pretty comprehensive array of services with the exception of detox services, which is where someone wants to come off a significant drug and they need to get it out of their system, and they need a medical detox because they're potentially at risk of overdosing or dying from their heroin use or alcohol use. That is actually the responsibility of acute care hospitals. It is not a behavioral health responsibility. It is often mistakenly attributed to us, but it's a health service. So a couple characteristics about Butte County. As I said, we serve the Butte County Medi-Cal clientele and the indigent. Those are people who have no resources. They're typically living in extreme poverty and don't have any kind of benefits. We fund or have historically funded Department of Social Services eligibility workers and embedded them in our buildings to make sure that when someone comes in who's homeless or who has no money, they have no resources, we connect them to services and get them connected to Medi-Cal. Our primary service reimbursement is from Medi-Cal, so it's very important to get people qualified so they have insurance and they can get not only mental health care, dental care, physical health care. By state and federal mandate, behavioral health is not responsible to provide treatment to out-of-county clients. There's a lot of rumors that we serve out-of-county clients. The two exceptions are someone who is a foster youth who's placed in Butte County at a group home or a foster placement or someone who goes into crisis while they're in Butte County. We're responsible to make sure that we stabilize a crisis and then discharge appropriately and triage to the county of origin. A little bit about Butte County. The unemployment rates and Medi-Cal beneficiary enrollments exceed statewide standards. We're considered a very poor county. We have 1.4 times the rate of poverty in California and 1.5 times the rate of the United States. And as you've probably heard in other presentations, we have some of the highest adverse childhood experiences in the state, which are negative experiences that you have in childhood. There's a lot of divorce, domestic violence, abuse, molest, neglect that have a significant impact on your development over time. And there's a very high correlation between high ACE scores and alcoholism, mental health issues, geriatric concerns, GI distress, you name it. So we have a lot of front-loading of people to potentially be at risk for eating our services. So this data is for 19-20. It's how many people we serve during the fiscal year 19-20. We serve 9,353 total people in services throughout our continuum of care. You can see the breakdown between adult and youth. And then it's broken down between the total number of mental health people, people who are in mental health services versus the total number served in our substance use disorder program. Someone can be in mental health and get what they call dual diagnosis services where they receive mental health and drug and alcohol services together. And those are called dual diagnosis treatment services. In inpatient, we served or hospitalized 563 people. In 19-20, mostly adults, but some youth. And total admissions were 777, meaning some people came back and got hospitalized multiple times. Some of our highest utilizers are hospitalized 6, 7, 8 times a year. Our PUFF, as I talked about, the 16-bed unit, served 302 people. And we sent 475 people out of county to inpatient hospitals and paid for those services there. Oops, sorry. In crisis, total number served 2,104. And the total number of crisis, 6,175. And those calls and the people coming into crisis, we serve regardless of their insurance status or eligibility. Sometimes we actually get calls from other counties because people aren't comfortable or happy with their crisis services. So as far as our budget goes, there's six major budget pockets for us. The two largest are realignment, which is 27 percent of our budget, and Medi-Cal, which is 44 percent of our budget. And the third one is MHSA, or the Mental Health Services Act. I'll get into that in a minute. I'll talk a little bit of detail in a bit. We do get some grant funds. We collect 1 percent of our funding from client insurance, and then the county gives us a maintenance of that for about $285,000 a year. Of our $73 million budget, we spend $14.5 million, or we did in 1920, on housing and treatment for our clients. That's including emergency housing, alcohol and drug-free housing, residential program for drug and alcohol and mental health, crisis residential, hospitalizations, skilled nursing facilities, and the like. The list goes on and on. So about 18 percent of our budget goes towards, or went towards, placement and funding of housing. And then the remaining part of our budget, $59 million, funded all of our mental health and substance use disorder program, both operated by the county and by our contractors. A little bit of a deeper dive into our funding. There's two types of realignment funding, which is the first one I mentioned, 1991 and 2011 realignment funding. If I can take a second to explain this. In the 60s, when the states looked at, you know, the state's, you know, the state's, you know, the state's hospitalizations, there are no, hundreds of thousands of people hospitalized, and you could get into a hospital for almost any reason and stay there, and their deuces were pretty bad. The state said, this has to stop. We need to send all these people back to the counties of origin. We think they can do it better. We think they can do it cheaper. And we're going to fully fund, through realignment, counties to provide the services to this population. This was one of the worst decisions the state made, because basically you shifted people who were institutionalized and turned a lot of them into homeless people. Who had no means or mechanisms, and you did not give the counties enough money to fund it. The realignment funding is primarily funded by state sales tax, a percentage of that, and vehicle license fees. So when people buy cars, people, you know, purchase things, there's some money coming into the system. But the ironic thing about that is when the state goes into decline, and people stop buying cars, and people stop paying for new things and new TVs and taxes happen, our funding goes down. And inversely, more people want services at that time. So it's kind of this cool joke that, this funding is inconsistent depending on the economy. There's a lot of mandated services that come with this realignment funding. There's some things I don't have any choice as a director of funding. I have to fund all youth EPSDT services, which is early periodic diagnosis and treatment of youth. So any youth who's coming in with Medi-Cal gets services, regardless of if I had enough funding or not. I have to provide drug Medi-Cal services to anyone who comes in for services. I have to fund my drug court treatment team. And I have to have a perinatal program to serve pregnant parenting and substance using moms. And then I have to fund crisis services and any inpatient placements for hospitalization. And then lastly, one of my biggest contracts with Aegis or NTP, a narcotic treatment provider, Methadone for short. I have to fund Methadone services. That is non-negotiable. If someone wants Methadone, they get in for Methadone. They get funded. Housing the homeless is not mandated for any behavioral health system. But there are, and there's not a dedicated ongoing funding stream to establish housing. But we do get sometimes one-time funds to help establish housing, which I'll talk about in a little bit. And the funding, as I said, is dependent on the economy with regards to costs, and regardless of whether there's a high demand of services or not. The other Medi-Cal, or the other funding that we're talking about is Medi-Cal FFP, or Federal Financial Participation. So as we project our budget, we project the number of people served and the number, the amount of revenue we can generate from that. So we put up realignment funding to draw down match from the federal government. So if we provide a service, we bill for it, they then match us, a certain amount, and we get that back. It requires, there's a lot of restrictions on what services we can provide. And this is another thing that people mistake a lot is, why can't behavioral health do all their services out in the field? Why can't they provide drug treatment services in the field? It's not reimbursable. For me to provide drug and Medi-Cal services to someone, drug groups, drug treatment, MAT, medication assisted therapy, they have to come into a building that's been certified by the state, and then after they sign a piece of paperwork, and consent to treatment, and sign a release, and do all those things, I can start billing. All the services I do before that, unbillable. So all the outreach to people in the community pre-opening is unbillable or unreimbursable to the counties. It's a very antiquated system of funding. Mental Health Services Act funding is often called the millionaire's tax. It's a 1% tax on anyone earning over a million dollars. It's highly regulated. It's tied to five different funding categories, and there's an annual planning process with a lot of stakeholder involvement. We have to go out to the community and ask them how we're doing on our services, what they'd like to see, get their input, and then establish what kind of treatment gets involved. The funds are subject to reversion if they're not spent in a timely manner. However, the MHSOAC, which oversees Mental Health Services Act, is notorious for denying new plans and new treatment opportunities for counties, and that's why counties have been in a bind, if you've heard in the news, about not spending all their MHSA. It's not for lack of trying. It's from the state denying new plans. It's a chance that the community has said this is what we want. To add to that, a cruel joke that happened a couple years ago is no place like home. Counties received MHSA funding, and the state decided, well, we need to fund more housing because there's a homeless crisis. Let's take 7% of the MHSA off the top from all counties and make counties compete for that money. And so we don't have to fund fully all that amount for counties. It's now Butte County's going to compete with Shasta County, compete with LA to try and get funding to build housing. Well, the better your grant writing process, the better your funding. The better your team's, the better opportunity you have to get those housing grants. Butte's been successful in obtaining housing. You'll hear Creekside Place, for example, in Chico being built, the Pacific West Apartments in Oroville recently, and several other projects we have been successful in obtaining that funding for. But it's one-time funding. It's highly competitive, and it's not guaranteed, and it requires behavioral health services are provided for 20 years at least to those projects, which we do. We do get grants. They're time limited and specific for specific purposes. They're really nice. I call them feast or famine. When we have the grants, they're fabulous, and then the money dries up and there's no sustainability. So you have to budget that accordingly, particularly around how you hire staff and do programming. And then as I said, client reimbursement from insurance, 1% of our budget, and usually that's privately insured people coming in for crisis services who need to be hospitalized. Insurance companies are notorious for underpaying and refusing to pay and denying us funding. So we have to pay for what we get served. So that's, as far as I'm concerned, a loss for us. We get $500,000 a year, but we probably bill $2 million a year in services, and the insurance companies just say no. There is some legislation to try to address that that's moving forward, and I'm looking forward to having that passed. As far as the services we provide, this graphic shows some of the places that we have services, but not all of them. The circles represent network adequacy circles, or what they call time and distance standards. We're required by the state to have a certain number of services within a certain proximity to any client who lives in Butte County. So we have clinics in four major areas, Chico, Orville, Paradise, and Gridley, and then we provide youth mental health services to any school that wants it in Butte County. And right now that number is over 85, I think 85 schools that have behavioral health or contractors providing youth services to students in need who have Medi-Cal. This is just a list of some of the contractors that we have that partner with us. It's not the only one. It's not the complete list, but it ranges from treatment, housing, employment services, inpatient facilities, and such. Here are some of the services Butte County Bay Rd provides. There's a robust continuum in crisis services that include, we respond to all the emergency rooms for 5150s when someone's brought in against their will to be placed on a hold who is gravely disabled, danger to themselves, danger to others. We have a crisis residential program, which is a 10-bed partial. We have a 10-bed. We have an acute crisis place for people to stay for approximately 45 days. We have mobile crisis co-response teams that work with law enforcement in Chico and in Oroville and the Sheriff. We do pre and post hospitalization coordination because one of the big things that we realized was when people get hospitalized, they get discharged in the middle of the night sometimes, and they don't have any follow-up care. So we have teams that actually follow up all of our clients being released from the hospital to have the continuation care plans. We have walk-in services seven days a week. And we have an inpatient psychiatric clinic. And we have an inpatient psychiatric clinic. And then in our youth and adult services, we do outpatient individual counseling, group counseling, dual-diagnosed counseling. We help with homeless engagement for those in need. We do a lot of prevention services. As I mentioned, we're in the schools. We do housing assistance. We coordinate closely with the housing authority around Section 8 housing and getting people into treatment or places to live. We put people in board and carers, which are places that manage medication for our clients, have a place to live. And then we also have a number of other programs in substance use service. Thank you. Such as our medication-assisted treatment program, which is we medicate people for opioid addiction and alcohol addiction issues and those medications are used to help them with side effects, withdrawals and to help them come down off the drugs and to be successful. Then we partner with Aegis, I mentioned. Stepping Stones, our perinatal provider for pregnant and parenting women. It's in Chico and Orville and we partner for drug court services. This is not a total list of all the services but just a general overview. So now into the homeless piece. Fourth of the high. Out of housing and urban development data, estimated 25% of those experiencing homelessness are living with a serious mental illness, and 17% with a substance use disorder, according to the 2019 Point and Tank data. This data is pretty close to what the Butte County data is. It's in the next slide. They're not too far off, but I think this data is wrong, and I'll say that for a reason. You're going out and you're interviewing a homeless person who doesn't know who you are, doesn't trust you, and you're asking them, are you a drug addict? Do you use drugs? Do you have a mental health condition? Most of them are not going to admit that. So the realistic data for us, based on what happens when we actually get people off the street and get them into treatment, is it's more like 80%. Eighty percent have a substance use issue. Anywhere you see, depending on the county and the analysis, 60 to 80% have a comorbid mental health issue. Some of them have a mild to moderate mental health issue. Not our responsibility. Those are the health plans. Serious mental illness, our responsibility. And the data. This shows that the vast majority of people are not experiencing a behavioral health issue when they first become homeless, but yet the longer they remain homeless, the higher the chance for them to get traumatized from something to develop a mental illness or an addiction. So the longer people stay homeless, the more at risk they are to need our services. Primary risk factor for homelessness is not mental illness or addiction, but rather old age in California. According to a recent UC San Francisco study, they highlighted that over half the homeless people today are over 50. And the number of those are 65 and over. It's expensive. It's a triple by 2030. That's not too far away. In California, 72% of the homeless population reported being unsheltered. And those people living in unsheltered situations that are out there have harsh conditions and tend to report poor health conditions and chronic geriatric conditions that mimic people in their 70s and 80s. So by the time they're coming in for medical treatment, they are a complete mess typically, physically, mentally, and with substance issues. The UC San Francisco study highlighted that homelessness, and primarily in the issue of poverty and housing affordability, and with regards to drug issues and access, particularly in Butte County, fentanyl has become a huge issue for our homeless population. It's a highly addictive drug. It's extremely potent, and there's a lot of overdoses happening. Recently, if you've been watching the news, those numbers have doubled in the last year. A lot of access coming from the Internet in China where people are blending up these drugs and pretending that there's something else, and people are overdosing on them. So Butte County Homeless Stats. Our point-in-time survey highlighted 23% disclosed they had mental illness. It was 25% in the national one. 12% said they had substance use disorder. It was 70% in the national, or statewide, point-in-time survey. As I said, I believe those numbers are much higher based on our experience working with this population. 23% disclosed they were homeless for the first time and campfire survivors. 820 said they had health insurance of some kind. Could be Medi-Cal. Could be private insurance. 188 reported they had income from Social Security SSI, which shall be as referenced as a disability income that's really hard to qualify for. And the primary cause of homelessness cited was a natural disaster as number one. Interestingly enough, substance use was the fifth cause, and they didn't report mental health or physical health issues until number eight. Again, this is a voluntary survey. It's only as good as people are honest. Okay, so what we have learned in working with the homeless population in Butte, is these tend to be the buckets they fall in. They're not inclusive, but those are the majority of the people. A critical life event we talked about, loss of job, natural disaster. There's a number of foster youth who are exiting the foster system who don't have a place to go or have been kicked out of where they live or don't want to be part of any system. A lot of people fleeing domestic violence, which is part of the ACEs we talked about that Butte County is so notorious for. The LGBTQI population also typically kicked out of homes, family conflict. They want to escape something that's not the home. They want to be positive in their life. Runaways in general. A lot of criminal justice population, people coming out of the prisons or jails. There is definitely a subset of people who it's a lifestyle choice. They're anti-government. You're not going to put them in a shelter. They're not going to follow a rule. Leave us alone. And what's not talked about a lot is the traumatic brain injury or developmental disability population. There's a lot of far northern clients or people who've been traumatized, have head injuries, cognitively are delayed or have processing problems, and they are part of that homeless population. And then, of course, there's the homeless population. And then, of course, the mentally ill and substance use population, the moderate to moderate, which are the health plans, and the severe, which are our responsibilities. But most importantly, the homeless, mentally ill are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators. And oftentimes people think that they're the ones perpetrating. Actually, the numbers are really low. But when they do do it, they get front page paper attention. So how do we address homelessness? Our programming touches on homelessness in almost all of our programs because our clientele, by the nature of their mental illness, are at risk of being homeless. Our homeless tend to have unstable housing. Some of these programs in the wheel represent programs that we work closely with the homeless. For example, our search teams, they serve the most severely mentally ill people in the county. The people who are hospitalized most frequently. The people who lose their housing due to their mental illness due to their psychosis due to the regression. The Sixth Street Providence Center we fund. It's a half million dollar program through Youth for Change. That's downtown in Chico. You're familiar with it. On Sixth Street serves homeless youth. We have an intensive outreach team that we included. We started recently where we have people who are dedicated to North and South County that target people who are highlighted as non-engaged, problematic, frequently highly utilized with law enforcement or with people who say, hey, that guy's always out there yelling at people. Could you please go help him? So they do a lot of outreach and work with them. We fund employment programs, housing programs. We also have a runaway and homeless youth program for literally kids who are runaways. We fund peer partners in the 20s. We have a temporary shelter to help engage the homeless. We have a continuum of care coordinator that we help fund. We also help fund the homeless census count, the PIT count. We have an internal housing team. Their whole job is to try and find housing. Finding housing for our population is very challenging because there's a great deal of stigma and discrimination. People do not want to rent to the mentally ill or they do not want to rent to people who have substance use issues. So we're constantly trying to develop relationships with landlords to have them rent to our population. But, for example, one of the pieces of data that I think is important is that we're trying to find housing for homeless youth. And that is troubling. There's 300 people right now in Butte County with Section 8 housing who cannot find housing anywhere in the county. Landlords don't want to rent to them. They just turn their doors and say no. So if you want to solve homelessness, you can take 300 people right now off the streets if someone's willing to rent to them. What is used, unfortunately, by unscrupulous landlords, they do credit checks. And most of our population does not have good credit. And that's the way they get barred from getting into housing. And they get around that discrimination piece. A number of our clients also have Section 8 housing and cannot get in. So, U of K and behavioral health funds, out of our $14.5 million, they talk about 131 facilities. I have that PowerPoint for you. There's a tremendous amount of funding that flows out of the county to fund housing of people in hospitals, in IMDs, in board and carers, in all sorts of places outside of the county. If I had my way, I'd get more housing in our county so that we kept the money locally. We hired the people and helped create jobs. The average cost for some of these things is $1,000. If I was to send someone to Napa State Hospital, that would be one of my most severely mentally ill people who's constantly in trouble, can't seem to stay stable. I spent $352,000 a year per person to put someone in Napa State Hospital. That eats into your budget really quickly. My IMD costs or longer-term hospitalizations are $115,000 per person per year. And if I put someone in a board and care, or not a board and care, a residential treatment center for their addiction or for housing, that's about $3,500 to $4,000 a month. So, that's a lot of money. Housing which is attached to treatment is not cheap. So, some of the common challenges to addressing homelessness in these last couple slides are the most important. People frequently forget behavioral health services are primarily voluntary. We cannot scoop people off the street. People constantly ask us, why can't we build more hospitals, take the homeless off the streets, and force them into treatment? Well, they have laws that protect them. Many of the people that are severely addicted to substances are scared to death of getting off those substances. They've been using them for a long time. The longer they've been using, the more addicted they are. And it is a very painful process to get off the street and to give up drugs. People feel it's a moral failing. It's an ethical issue. If they just find God, things will happen. Not necessarily. It's a biological brain-based disease. It hijacks your prefrontal cortex and it makes it really difficult for you to get off those substances. As I mentioned, detox services are important to get people off those drugs. They're only available at acute care hospitals. And they are very hard to get into because there's an antiquated state requirement for preauthorization to get in. They have to fill forms out. The addict has to sit there until they develop certain number of symptoms to qualify. Tell an addict you're going to sit in an ER for eight hours and come off that substance. And after the first one doesn't get approved, they tell all their friends, no one's going to detox. Lack of insight into their condition. Anasognosia is a huge problem for the severely mentally ill. People screaming at people who aren't there. People who believe the FBI are tracking them. People who believe there are microchips in them. Truly believe they are sane and we're all not. So getting someone to voluntarily consent to come in and take medication and get counseling who doesn't believe they're mentally ill is a major problem for some of these people. Another issue that is a barrier is Prop 47 which was passed in 2014. Which addressed people who had property crimes or substance use addiction crimes. And in the past, pre-2014, as a condition of coming out early, they were required to get into drug treatment. They partnered with behavioral health. They partnered with health and probation. We had a great program. Then someone in the legislature decided that's not appropriate. We should make that voluntary. So all of a sudden, all these people coming out were told, you're coming out? Do you want drug and alcohol services? It's not mandated. Our numbers plummeted. Every county has had the same problem. Numerous people just saying, no, I don't. And they disappear and they become homeless and they recommit or they reuse. When we do get specific funding for housing, NIMBY rears its ugly head. Not in my backyard. How dare you. I'm a person who's done something horrible. My property values are going to go down. You can't build it. I tried to put a crisis residential program with my former director, Dorian, several years ago. It took us a year and a half to get any place to not come out with pitchforks and knives saying, not in my backyard. We finally had to transition one of our treatment facilities into that program and it was successful. There's a lack of affordable housing. That's not a joke. People know that. There's a real lack of low barrier access points into treatment. Abstinence models that say you have to come in when you're not using anything don't work for the homeless. You can't go from using daily to just cold turkey. You've got to take a harm reduction model, which Behavioral Health believes in, which says as long as you keep reducing your use, we're going to try and get you to the place where you don't use anymore. But we realize you're going to relapse. We realize you're going to have oops moments. You're going to come home drunk and we're going to work with you. Since the 60s, only 6% of the inpatient beds were closed. The 50s are in existence. They closed most of the hospitals. So you have 6% capacity right now from a population in the 60s. You have a population that's grown dramatically since then. At any given time, there are thousands of people on 5150s waiting for hospitalization parked in emergency rooms with emergency room doctors screaming at us to get your people out and no hospital beds to take them. So it becomes a game of hospital shopping. I present a package on Joe while your county presents a package on Scott and your package on someone else. And then it becomes a game of hospital shopping. And then it becomes, well, which one's the easiest one? And hospitals cherry pick the ones that they think will be most successful, that aren't violent. And if I have a client with a violent history or criminal history, they usually don't get placed or it's very difficult. LPS law. This is very important. This is the Lanterman-Petras-Short Act, which was part of the 60s realignment that said you can only put someone on a 5150 to hospitalize them for up to 72 hours for treatment and observation if they're a danger to themself, a danger to their health, and a danger to their health. And it's not just a danger to others or gravely disabled. Danger to yourself and others are pretty easy to prove. Grave disability is an extremely limited, narrow definition. And it's horribly outdated. When they created this law, they didn't think there was a homeless population. They didn't have a problem with hospitals not being willing to take people into beds. And they didn't talk about people who are using drugs or on the street and deteriorating, like I talked about, with all these geriatric issues and on their way to dying, but not acutely so disabled that they can't get out of the hospital. They can't find their next meal. And after I've hospitalized someone once, they know the language because they all talk. If I tell a judge, oh, I know where the shelter is. Oh, I know how to get food. I'll go down to the Jesus Center. I've got a plan. Out I go. There was a case recently where a woman was found eating a rat raw on the streets, and she was not determined gravely disabled. She was psychotic. She believed it was her food from God. So the judge determined, well, that rat was a substance of some kind. That must be okay. So that's how I equate that lawism. And the law is about, I sent him to the hospital, and you guys released him one day later. Three hours later. It's not because we want to. We want to hold people. We want to treat them. The law protects people. They have patients' rights as well. And then when we say, we can't talk to you about that person's care, that's because HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 42 CFR, which is around drug and alcohol services, block you from sharing data on many places. So a great example is I have a mobile crisis team, the partners of law enforcement. We go out. And the law enforcement says, hey, is that one of your people? We should probably talk to him. And I go, I can't acknowledge we've ever even seen him. That's ridiculous. I'm on part of the same team. But the law prevents it. So that's one of the areas that makes it difficult for behavioral health. There's also no funding or reimbursement to support outreach activities. So all those services we do before someone finally says I'm willing to come in, unreimbursable, cross the board. It's completely on our dime. There's a lack of in-person psychiatrists and a turnover psychiatrist in Butte County. We're a health shortage area. If I really was putting a team together, I'd have a psychiatrist who was doing street outreach. I would be going out there and actually prescribing on the spot with the medication so that someone's got a brief window. They're willing to take the medication. There is a shortage in the North State for that matter of psychiatrists in general. And then the mission to solve homelessness in general is misleading. We don't believe you can solve homelessness. You can have an impact. You can reduce it. But you can never solve it. So some of the opportunities that we have to compel people into treatment. We talked about the 5150 process where they are dangerous, self-dangerous, and others are gravely disabled. We have a drug court partnership where people are sent to drug court because they get arrested for drug and alcohol possession, certain charges. In exchange for not having jail time, they commit to treatment with our substance use teams in partnership with the patient. That's a very successful program. There's a mental health program. We have a court that was started a little over a year ago where someone's arrested on the street for a criminal violation that's related to their mental health. If they believe that that's due to the mental health issue and they meet certain criteria, they can go into the diversion program and get treatment in exchange for not going to jail. Some clients get arrested and are found what they call in confident to stand trial. They don't understand what a jury is. They don't understand the judge. They're too mentally ill. They can be court ordered into mental health treatment to be restored. We do that for the county as well. There's two types of conservatorships, an LPS conservatorship and a Murphy conservatorship where you actually have someone's rights taken away. It's an extremely difficult process to get in place. There's plenty of rights and protections for people because you're taking away the right to consent to treatment, the decision on where to live, and the public guardian then becomes the person over those people. We do partner with the public guardian on that and behavioral health funds to public guardians ourselves out of our own pocket because we realize there's not enough public guardians in the community. We're not going to be able to get in place in the county and their case loads are too high. And the 80109 program is a partnership with probation for people coming out of the jails or out of prison that they partner with probation behavioral health to provide mental health and drug and alcohol treatment. At the state level, our recommendation is that LPS act that governs grave disability and hospitalization as well as HIPAA and 42 CFR which talks about who you can talk to and when has to get updated. They have to come into the 21st century and talk about this is important and there isn't enough information. And we have to get in place to make sure that we have a new definition of gravely disabled. There's been repeated attempts to update LPS law but there's two major obstacles to it. If tomorrow I updated the LPS law and I said all those homeless people out there who are mentally ill who aren't going to get treatment can now be hospitalized, I'd never put them. The state has not funded any hospitals to put them in and there's not enough public guardians to manage them. So it's kind of like they won't do one thing until you fund another thing and you have to then fund the public guardians. And right now there's advocates on both sides around that. I'm going to give you a little bit of a summary. I'm going to give you some glimmers of hope. CalAIM is coming which stands for California Advancing and Innovating of Medi-Cal. As of January of next year, the health plans are responsible for contracting or providing services that are outreach and engagement for high-end people that we're all talking about. The homeless, the people who are not engaged in treatment, the people who are going to the ER frequently. This is the first time in the history of California that we could potentially have teams of people on the streets getting paid and reimbursed to do what we want to do the most. We're in negotiations with the two health plans right now, early negotiations to talk about potentially being subcontractors with them to do that. The state needs to also provide funding to increase the number of public guardians. I mentioned earlier the caseloads are too high. You have to advocate with the legislative bodies to strengthen laws to compel treatment and provide more housing. And you have to require both. You can't just get mentally ill people off the street and put them in housing. The Housing First model has repeatedly failed. Seattle has shown us that. San Francisco has shown us that. If you're untreated and you're using or you're mentally ill, you destroy the apartments. And what you end up doing is you destroy your relationships with landlords and those landlords won't rent you anymore. So it's got to be paired with treatment. So a lot of our housing complexes have our teams going out in partnership with the housing developer and they're providing treatment to keep people secure and safe. Integrated medical detox services. As I mentioned, there's a lot of obstacles to get someone into detox services. They can only be provided to hospitals. There's too many barriers. They've got to make that more flexible and allow more people to come off when they're ready. Because the window of an addict who wants to get off drugs is so short and so small. You tell them they're going to have to wait several hours to get approved, they're gone. Another piece of good news, the governor's current budget, and the mayor might change it, includes $750 million to support the increased continuum of care and housing resources. So it's one-time funding for brick and mortar to potentially build more services. We are going to add a regional youth psychiatric health facility if we can get the funding. And we're going to try and add some board and carers to Butte County to add more housing resources. And then locally, our recommendation is reducing silos countywide and building or leasing buildings that have integrated services. The picture on the right shows the ribbon cutting in 2020 for the Butte County Community Services Center. That is a program up in Paradise that has been in place for a long time. We have public health, behavioral health, pharmaceutical services, and several contract agencies that were hurt through doing a one-stop shop. It was very successful for COVID for red residents to come and get everything in one place. Got to shift the focus from reducing blaming and increasing collaboration as well as blending funding. And I think some recent meetings that we've had between the city and the county and behavioral health and DES have been very hopeful. We're talking about how can we do this together. Talking about partnering with Turning Point. Talking about not duplicating services. And I'm very hopeful to see that happen. You've got to incentivize the building more low-income housing options. And you can't just go for one thing. You can't go for a shelter. You've got to have an array of options because the homeless have different preferences. Some want to see space camp. They want to live in their car. Some want to be in tents. Some want to be in campgrounds. Some want to be in tiny homes. Some want single residency occupancy facilities or apartments. And you've got to expand Section 8 capacity. There's not enough landlords in Butte to accept Section 8. We've got to address that. AB 1976 is Laura's Law. Very controversial. It's court-ordered mental health treatment. It's something that the county has to choose. The Board of Supervisors has to opt in or out of Laura's Law by the end of this fiscal year. People believe it's the end-all, be-all. And you can compel people by just getting them in front of a judge. The black robe effect will just take over. That's not necessarily true. And it also does not allow forced medication. Assertive community treatment. Treatment teams or ACT teams that are trained in outreach and engagement have been just as successful as Laura's Law in some ways. And it's something that the county and myself are looking at right now before we present to the Board with our recommendations. We're also pursuing a rural residency program, which would mean we take third and fourth year psychiatric residents who are ready to graduate. And we have them do their residency program in Butte. Research has shown 50% of those people tend to stay and put down roots. That will be a way to get doctors. And then the managed care plans need to increase outreach and engagement of their homeless members. There are no homeless outreach teams for the mild to moderate population. Only behavioral health. CalAIM, I think, will change that. Collaboration is key. If anyone wants to learn more about behavioral health and what we do, we have a Behavioral Health Advisory Board that meets the third Wednesday of every month. We get talked about frequently at the Board of Supervisors twice a month. Our Mental Health Services Act funding has two different committees that meet monthly. And we have a Quality Improvement Committee that looks at all of our data. Number of people served. Timeliness of services. Diagnosis. Anything you ever wanted to know about what we did that we track, they review. Our website's here and available if anyone wants any more information. And if you or anyone you know needs help or needs some mental health access, we have an access line that's operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for anyone wanting to ask questions about where do I go to get this? How do I get my kid connected to this? What services do you offer? We have staff that do referral as well as they do crisis management. If someone calls that line too and says, I'm in crisis, they're treated to do that. And that concludes my presentation. Anyone have any questions, please ask. I'd like to start by thanking you. Your frankness was appreciated as well. I was not expecting that. And I'm glad you actually brought that to the presentation. I think it helps. You know, seeing your frustration with a lot of these issues is the same frustration that we share too. So, yeah, it was very informative. Questions? Anyone? I'll throw one quick one out there. When you said detox being done in the high-end facilities, we have the program over in Oroville. I'm drawing a blank on their name right at the moment. And I know they were looking at expanding and going up to Paradise, I think it was. So, the detox can be in two different ways. There's a social detox program, which is not medical. They work with you to detox slowly. It's not considered for the high-end people who are like, you stop drinking, you're going to die. And then there's medical detox. That's the one that only the acute care hospitals can do. And the Oroville Orchard Hospital, et cetera. And that's the one that the state says, fill out this form, check these boxes, send it in, and we'll give you a preauthorization if they meet the criteria. And historically, there's more denials than acceptances. Okay. ERs get frustrated. They have people sitting in their ERs waiting. We've been advocating to the state to say you've got to streamline that process. This is one of those few areas where you shouldn't be being too cautious. You should be getting everyone in and then asking questions later. And then on the public guardians, you said you guys are funding two of them. And about what is their caseload? That's a good question. I wish I could have your responses here. I'm just curious how many. I don't have any. A lot, I'm sure. They have more than they can handle and typically every public guardian office that way. They don't have a dedicated funding stream for public guardians that they can see grow annually. It's usually part of their budget. And it's something that if you're going to have more people under care, you've got to have more people to manage them. Okay. Thank you. And I know you guys asked about case management earlier. Our definition of case management is we work with you to navigate wherever you need to go. If you need housing, if you need connected to primary care, if you need to get Section 8, if you need to just get into an appointment, that's what our workers do. They do both therapy and case management for the seriously mentally ill because they tend to have difficulty with organization, remembering things, showing up for appointments. So we drive a lot of our people to appointments, to and from appointments, and sometimes we'll take them out of county if they have some specialty service they need. So that is part of what we do. It is reimbursed by Medi-Cal under certain circumstances, but again, only for open and consenting to treatment. So we have a lot of case management for people who are open. Those 9,000 people that we serve, about those thousand people out there that are not willing, they won't accept it. Absolutely. I think what I was referring to on that is the 217 that have had some time to stabilize in Project Roomkey, and we've gotten them somewhere. I hate to just get them where they're at and not have anything to hopefully maintain them there so they can be successful in that program. So that's what I was wondering. And we do. Just last week, we got a referral from the Department of Health. Don Taylor saying this individual is off all their medication. We found some place for them to stay, but if they don't get on medication and see a psychiatrist, they're going to decompensate. They're going to lose their housing. Can you help? We got them in the same day, got them in front of a psychiatrist, got their medication, and connected them to a caseworker who is now following them for their mental health care. So we do when we can. I get it. Thank you. Some of the challenges with Project Roomkey is people have been in that program and have not been brought to our attention. And then deteriorated to a point where it's like by the time they come to our attention, they've blown out and they've destroyed the room. So we partner with Project Roomkey staff to say, hey, let's meet regularly and talk about some of these people. Refer them to us early. We'll go out and screen them and assess them if they're willing. But there are people in Project Roomkey, too, that are like, I don't want the service. Okay. I had some questions. Tell us one more, then. I specifically wanted to better understand the process for the psychiatric inpatient program. So I'm not sure if you're familiar with the psychiatric inpatient programs and how that works. My current understanding is, like, say someone was going to show up at the door of Behavioral Health at 1 a.m. Is it most of the time they would basically get sent straight to the hospital for an evaluation, correct? Right. And thank you for asking. So in order to get into a psychiatric inpatient facility, you have to be what they consider medically cleared. They have to go through a physical evaluation. So they go to the ER to do that. And that's where they start. Once they're physically cleared, then we can initiate hospitalization. I would love it if I could just take someone off the street and put them in my inpatient. But the state has come down and said, you didn't do a full workup? Denied. You can't do it. So everyone has to go through that process. We've talked to the health providers about, can we find an alternative? Can we use prompt care, maybe? Because clogging up your ERs and some of these hospitalizations take hours or days or, in more outlying cases, weeks. If you are mentally ill, you have a history of violence, and you have a comorbid medical issue, like you can't ambulate, you're on a walker, you're on dialysis, or you've got a cloth me bag, good luck getting into a hospital. There's only three med psych hospitals that accept those patients. And they're all competing with 58 counties for those beds. So there's a real shortage. And then the pressure then becomes on behavioral health. Get them out. But, well, they're on a 72-hour hold. What happens after 72 hours? Then you get into a fight. So the hospital is about what they call stacked holds. And we've talked to our county council and our lawyers about that and said, I'm not going to release someone who's acutely endangered themselves just because 72 hours is up and I can't get them into a hospital. What happens if they go out and they kill someone? So we will reassess every day and continue to uphold the hold. Or we'll try our best to do a safety plan and put them in our crisis residential program or put them in board and care, put them somewhere else if they're appropriate. Yeah. And that kind of leads into my follow-up, because that was my understanding. Is there any other questions? I would pick up on the security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security and security Is there a plan to change that? Whenever possible, we try to partner with ENLO or Orville, and if we have a staff to help sit and be with that patient, particularly someone they know that will keep their agitation down, we try to do that. But that is one of the unfortunate realities is the ERs cannot physically restrain people who are on hold who want to leave. And so oftentimes these people, if they're coherent enough, not too psychotic or too depressed, we'll say, I'm out of here. I'm not waiting. I've been here for eight hours. This is crazy. And then law enforcement's called, and the game of bringing them back to the ER happens, and then the ER gets frustrated because they have to readmit them. Yes, they can use what they call 1799 to detain someone for up to 24 hours, but they don't use it often, and it takes a lot of work to get that designation in place. So that's been something we've talked to the state about. It's like you need to incentivize. I'm not a fan of hospitalizing people. We do it only when we have to. But there are not enough hospitals in any way, shape, or form for the people who need them. So that's why that $750 million the governor's put forth to help expand hospital beds and for us to add a youth inpatient bed potentially is very promising, and we're really excited. It requires a 25% match up front from us to draw down money, but I think it's worth it, and we're going to try our best to make it happen. Could that some money coming in possibly help with expanding the mobile crisis to around the clock? I mean, I just imagine if we had, beyond those office hours, most psychiatric breakdowns are not during office hours. They're usually at the hospital 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m. Could expanding that help, or is there a plan to expand beyond office hours? Well, we look at that data, and ironically, the 5150s, people who get hospitalized between midnight and 8 a.m. in the morning, tend to be one type of population, people overdosing on something. They're high. They're way off the charts on meth. They're becoming aggressive. Those tend to be the cases. And actually, as much as... I hate to say it, going to the hospital and coming down off that substance is probably the best thing for them, because usually when we assess them after that, they're like, oh, my God, I used way too much drug, way too many drugs. I'm not in the place I was. I'm so sorry I hit whoever I hit. But what we've done is we've expanded our ability to do 5150 assessments. COVID has given us one opportunity where we can do them now remotely. So we do 5150 assessments 24 hours a day now in the hospital. So we can safety plan and assess and triage. We do want to expand. We want to expand our mobile crisis team with law enforcement. Everyone knows those teams are doing a great job. Law enforcement loves them. Again, no new funding coming down to help add more people. We've asked the Board of Supervisors for one-time funding to add to that team. The sheriff is requesting an additional two staff to expand the hours. And that's an ask right now for the board, using some of the campfire funds, because more people are in crisis post-campfire. It's directly connected to that. So that would allow us to go from currently 8 a.m. to 6.30 p.m., seven hours a day. We're trying to go 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven hours a day. But if I had funding and I could do it, I would fund mobile crisis 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Well, thank you. That information is really good. Thank you. I appreciate it. You're welcome. All right. Any other questions? Mr. Huber, I think we have some. Yeah, thank you very much. Great presentation. So I understand how the drug court works, how it incentivizes. And getting assistance to get off of a drug in exchange for, you know, a lessening of jail time or whatever. But how does a mental health court work? Can you explain how that process works? Because I can't see how it could work the same as a drug court. So if I'm downtown Chico and I'm delusional that someone in burdened hand is out to get me, and I throw a rock at the window to break that, to tell them off, and I get arrested for vandalism, and through the court process it's clear I'm not operating to my full capacity, the DA and the public defender can say, this person really did this activity while they were under the influence of their mental health condition. Are they amenable to getting mental health treatment? Would them getting on medication perhaps change that behavior and help them be a better staying citizen? Not everyone applies for that, but there are people like that that they do refer to mental health court, and those people then have to come in and be reserved by us, see a psychiatrist, take medication, come to their groups or individual counseling, and we work with them on whatever the mental health issue was that led to them breaking the law in exchange for those charges being dropped. So it's a relatively new program and it's pretty successful. Now, do people run away sometimes and not participate? Yes. Not everyone is a good fit. But if they have a severe mental health, it doesn't sound like we've really got a place for them to go other than, I mean, we can give them services up to a point, but... As far as what we can do internally, if they need an additional placement and they're willing, I can put them in what they call MHRC, a mental health rehabilitation center, which is a place that has treatment in the building, and they live there. And that's where they go, and they go to group every day, and they see their doctor. Is that local or is that out of the area? Those are ones that we basically fund. There's several of them in the Bay Area. We have a couple in Sutter Yuba. Willow Glen is one of the contractors we use for that. They're very expensive, but we know they're important and they provide a critical service. If the person doesn't follow the rules and runs away, that's more of an issue. If you get a seriously mentally ill person who will not stay put, will not follow rules, and continues to cycle through hospitals and get hospitalized, that's when I recommend conservatorship. That's when the public guardian and behavioral health assess them together, determine that a judge says, you've been hospitalized too many times, you can't take care of yourself. Public guardian is not taking all control and responsibility for you. Public guardian becomes essentially their parent, and we partner and do all the treatment. Sometimes those people have to go into an inpatient hospital for months to years, and we have people who are literally living in an IMD or an inpatient for mental disease because they're so severely mentally ill, they're not able to function in the community. We work with those people monthly at least to try and see if they're progressing in treatment. We try and step people down to the least restrictive options, but I'll be honest, there are people like in Napa State, I've got people who've done some very serious things that there's no way I'm going to put them in the community until they can show progress. So different levels of care based on the severity. What sort of numbers are we talking about with drug court and mental health court these days? What's the volume that they're doing? The numbers are down because of COVID. The courts kind of went into hibernation for a period. Pre-COVID, what were they? Pre-COVID, the numbers were pretty good. I think we had, I'm going from memory, I think we had 80 people in drug court between North and South County, and mental health court was closer to 20. It was a newer program. There are people that get referred that the judge looks at that and says no or yes. So not everyone that gets referred gets approved for the program. They have to go through a screening criteria. But there's capacity in both those programs to accept more people. Thank you very much. A lot of people who are in the drug court, we place in. We place in what they call residential treatment or sober living environments where they're getting, they're living in an environment where they're away from the drugs. Because I don't care how much, how good your treatment is, if you go back to the place that you use, you use. So we try and get them out of that element, keep them clean and sober long enough, give them the skills, and then bring them back. Thank you very much. Sure. All right, Mr. Morgan. Mr. Kennelly, I want to thank you. That was the most thorough presentation on that I've ever seen. Thank you. Paul says it was too long. You know what? It needed to be long because I won't speak for myself, but I'm inundated with why aren't you doing this? Why aren't you adding more housing? Why aren't you doing this? You dumb idiot loser. This is your, and those are from my friends, right? Mm-hmm. And some other council members. And you saw, I can't wait to take this section of your present, of this whole meeting, your presentation, and get the link and just reply back to everybody. There's not a silver bullet. I'm not going to go through all my highlights, but, you know, the whole housing first model doesn't work. I mean, that's all that I hear from one side now. More houses, more houses, more houses. That's the problem. That's the problem. It's not. First time. First time. First time. No, but I get it. But we're being tasked with this is a silver bullet. Why aren't you doing more? I just want to say for everybody on both sides, wherever they're coming from, this is so dynamic and so egregious, and part of it is a government problem, and government doesn't generally fix government problems. It makes things worse. But at least we now have a government problem. We now have a pretty good understanding of what's going on, and I don't think anybody really had that before. And I think the talent, what we just saw was somebody, you in this case, taking something really, really, really complicated and laying it out as simply as it could be seen. So on behalf of everybody that will watch this presentation, if they've got the guts to believe it, thank you. You're welcome. And if there's anything about a specific program that you want a deeper dive, and I know, Mayor Koolidge, you had some questions about the funding. You almost. That's a deep, deep dive, and we're happy to have that with you. Specific questions, absolutely, we can help you with that. Yeah, and I definitely want that. Do we have any other councilmember questions? Councilmember Kahn. Thank you so very much, Scott. It was a very informative presentation. And I do want to know a little bit more about the public audience. I know you mentioned that. Could you please tell me how, what are their duties and responsibilities, and if any volunteer would like to do, become a volunteer, become a public guardian? What are the qualifications for that? Director Boston would be the person to ask that question. But the public guardians that work for our conserve clients, their responsibility is oversight of that person's care and treatment and housing. So they approve and help find housing resources for people, connect them to treatment, make decisions for them financially as well. There's a probate conservatorship and there's an LPS conservatorship. Probate's typically about $1,000.00. It's about money and funding and real estate. LPS is about treatment and your mental health care. Sometimes it has medical power of attorney attached to it where you can approve the medical treatment. Sometimes it doesn't. And the odd part is sometimes clients have no say over their mental health treatment, but they have say over their medical treatment, depending on what the court decides. And I'm sorry I can't speak to the training of the public guardian, but we value our partnership with them. The nice part about County Behavioral Health, and some of our partners is we're braiding funding, we're blending funding, Department of Social Services, public health probation. We're doing everything we can. We're all underfunded in some way. And I don't like to just bash the state of the feds. There's a lot of good people up there, but there are some laws that really need to change because we're all fighting about things that are due to decisions that were made at that level. And I think the more we can partner and understand what we're all doing, I think the better we will be to pursue legislation. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. items that you mentioned and obviously on a variety of items as well. So and I and I share that frustration. You mentioned a number 80% in terms of either having mental health or drug addiction problems that are on the street currently. Very controversial. People get very mad at me for saying that. Well and you know I think generally I would concur with you but of course I don't have the factual basis that you do and and it is something that is controversial. You know in looking at Laura's law it sounded like that was going to be approached through the county and whether it'll be a what was the other the ACT. Yeah so Laura's law is at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors. Okay. It passed this year. It used to be a pilot project the county could do. Now it's a requirement the counties opt in or out of Laura's law. Here's I'm just gonna highlight a Berlin legislative passage AB 1976 Laura's law said counties can opt in or out but you may not reduce any mental health programming that you have in the county in order to establish the Laura's law. Team while Laura's law team is a very intensive team very low caseloads you're talking about a 1 to 10 ratio you're talking about a street psychiatrist you're talking about peer support specialists and therapists nurses it's an expensive program and that's just behavioral health and you have a court the public defender the judge all the people involved in that process you have a petition process and of requirements to get people actually to court order treatment it's not cheap so most counties when they first opted into Laura's law many years ago were new to to Mental Health Services Act money was coming, it was new, they were still building programs, they had funding for it. Counties now, looking at Laura's law, are going, where's all this extra money that I'm going to put a team, in my case that's up to a million dollars a year, to truly do all that service out in the community? I don't have that. I might have one-time funding and reserves, but I cannot sustain that team year after year. And I'm giving you a little preview at the board meeting. So they're going to ultimately make a recommendation. The counties that tend to have Laura's law, at this point, or are opting in, are getting general fund from the board. A route doesn't get general fund, historically hasn't. That's a board decision if they want to fund that team ongoing. However, I've got one ace in the hole. My Mental Health Services Act funding includes innovation funding, which is specific funding for innovative projects that aren't things that have been done before. You're trying to answer a question. What new dynamic thing could you do? I've got tiny homes in Everhart Village coming online this fall. I'm proposing to bring an innovation team that is a Laura's law-like team to the county, that it does everything that Laura's law does on steroids with housing readily available for these people, on-site pharmacy, on-site medical support, on-site crisis services, all on the same campus, and reaching this hard-to-reach population with a team on steroids, that that's all they do, day in, day out. I might be able to get that approved through the state's implementation. I've got a lot of information on the state's implementation funding. It's never been done in any other county, which makes it an opportunity. It's at the discretion of the MHSOAC, the board, or the state entity that governs how we get funded. That could be the way behavioral health gets most of Laura's law. Because if you look at the data for Laura's law, out of every 100,000 people, three to four qualify for Laura's law. When you go through all that process, they have to have a certain number of hospitalizations. They have to have a certain number of times they were violent. They have to have been, you know, all these, shown all these things. Most people get referred to Laura's law don't qualify. It's too restrictive. It's a fabulous program, but it's very restrictive. If I eliminate that requirement and I open that capacity to serve, and it doesn't have to be just these people, I could have a team that could serve all these people and do all those things with funding for housing, which I don't get, funding for flexible funds where I can buy a coffee and get a burritos and build that relationship and get them off the street. That's my alternative to Laura's law if I can't get Laura's law funded with the money I have. And that would be a five-year program that potentially I could fund through innovation, and with CalAIM coming on board, they will allow us to do that outreach and engagement and I can sustain it through billing. It's a little preview of what is going to be discussed, but I'm not saying we're not going for Laura's law. It's got a lot of pros and cons to it, but, and most County Directors say if I had the funding, I'd do it, and the ones who are doing it say, yeah, it does for those two or three people. They're really, really difficult to get, and we'll listen to a judge. It's been effective. I like it, but it's extremely expensive. Okay, great. Well, thank you for that, and again, thank you for coming. I do have more questions. Most of those are budget-related, so I'll just reserve those for later. The one thing, and I know we, you know, you talked about the realignment, and I continually hear people say, you know, look, the state did away with mental health facilities, hospitals, and I hear state representatives say that, and it doesn't seem like there's any progress backwards, so if it's something that was so bad that we did away with it, has the legislature just simply not realized that they should bring it back and re-journey down that pathway, or, I mean, because you're having... Our governor is doing the first time that I've seen in the 21 years I've been in Butte, and the 30 years I've been in the county system, of funding and incentivizing building inpatient facilities. He's finally heard it. He's done it. He's done it. He's done it. There's been enough people screaming about this homeless population that needs to get off the streets, and poor people who are sitting in ERs. That's $750 million amongst 58 counties. It's not going to go a long way, which is why you need to be as attractive as possible for this grant. And for us, in the North State, there are no inpatient psychiatric facilities for youth. We send them in by ambulance, sometimes restrained in gurneys down the Bay Area. That's horrible. It's horrible for the kids. It's horrible for their families, but if they're violent and they need to be restrained, that's what happens. I have a facility in Butte County. I've been in discussion with both Paradise and Gridley about facilities there, retrofitting them to put them in place. With that funding, we could put an inpatient facility and hire a workforce, which is additional economic development in Butte. I'm sending millions of dollars out of county. It could be channeled in county. We definitely support that aspect, I think. The other question, which ties into that. So, I mean, in terms of mental health beds, 16, correct? For our youth, our adult office, 16 beds, yes. And is that, my understanding, is that the same in every single county in the state? No. No, so it does vary. A little bit more statewide education. Part of the agreement in the 60s when they took people out of the inpatients is they said, we know you counties. You're just going to build a whole bunch of inpatient facilities and just re-hospitalize them. We're going to punish you for building big complexes. So, we are only going to allow you to have a facility, which we feel is reasonable, and you can build MediCal for those people. But any time you get beyond 16 beds, unbillable, all those services. So, the difference between me paying $1,400 a day to a 17-bed unit is just my realignment going out the window. But if I pay it to a 16-bed unit, I can draw down MediCal and offset that cost by sometimes 50%. So, it's called the IMD exclusion. They do not, they did not want counties to expand. So, it's not a national issue. It's not a national issue. It's not a national issue. So, it's not a national issue. So, it's not a national issue. So, it's not a national issue. They actually disincentivized counties from doing that, so there were fewer and fewer inpatient beds. The governor has also agreed to look at that to allow counties like ourselves, even if we didn't add another puff, to expand beds in our existing puff, add some more bedrooms, and not fall into that IMD exclusion that then doesn't allow us to build any Medi-Cal. So it's really this push-pull where the counties are given so much money, which is not enough to operate, and the toll, well, you can draw it on all this Medi-Cal, but you can't serve the substance use clients in the community. And you can't build a puff that's bigger than 16 beds. It makes it very hard in some cases. So we're doing our best to be flexible and to find ways in which we can draw down revenue. And like I said, CalAIM is a game changer. If it happens as we hope, they're going to allow us to do things and provide the treatment in the community that people need, build those relationships, and bring them in. Again, it's voluntary. There are still going to be people out there who tell us to go away and leave us alone. But we keep coming back and keep trying. All right. Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate your time. I know we all do. I know our community does as well. And maybe we'll torch you not so long next time, but I'd love to see you back here maybe next year. Just give us an update on where things are, because we definitely want to continue this conversation forward, both in front of Chico as well as Butte County. So thank you so much for your time. Thank you for your time. I appreciate it. All right. And with that, we're going to take a short break. Thank you very much. So, Andrew, Andrew, I apologize, but we did have two speakers. Oh, sorry. Sorry. So we'll stay and do our two public speakers. My apologies. And then let's roll through those, and then we'll take a break after that. Actually, it ended up being four. Okay. But we will stop at four. Ken Mollison. My apologies to those folks in the public waiting room. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Yes. I've got a question on the Manchurian. I want to know who's responsible for letting this. I'm not going to call it home. It's a problem because it's not homeless. It's a bunch of genetics and everything else that's going on there. So I need to know the responsible party. That is why water rights that are going to there. Who's testing the water so they're dumping their shoes there, dumping their trash, it's going into the creek. It's coming down to my property. I have a farming animal. People do recreation. We get a point of order for this. Point of order. Just sit out there. Sir, if you could hold on one second, please. I'll allow because someone related. There's a pretty gray area there. So go ahead and proceed for us. And then we're adjusting your time to be appropriate, too. So who's going to pay for restitution? This is all kinds of testing that's going to be happening here. These people are polluting the water there. They're polluting the lane. That is my water. It's coming down. They're going to be who's going to pay for the medical costs. Somebody gets sick, hepatitis, E. coli, all that kind of stuff. You can throw it down that way. So they break the law. I can't break the law. So I've got a lot of questions. This is a problem. I sent this. I sent this email to the city council. They can kill my family. They can kill my business. They can kill the farm. What if it gets polluted? Who's going to do the restitution? Who's going to do the removal of all that toxic waste? There are trailers out there dumping sewage. The trash. There's three outhouses for hundreds of people there right now. I know I called in. I called the police. I called everybody. You know what? I found a big game. I put things in there. So I would just give you one more response, please. Okay. Our next speaker is Kelsey Ogle. Kelsey, go ahead. I just had a question. The one thing from that spoke, what was her name? It's an audio program. What's her name? Go ahead. Shelby Boston. Thank you. Our next speaker is Jessica Gianola. Jessica, go ahead. That's not. Jessica, we can't hear you. Yeah. I mean, very light. Very light. So whatever your microphone is. And we did turn the volume all the way up, and we're still not hearing her. But the other speakers we could hear. Yeah. Go ahead and try one more time, please. Yes. A little bit better. That'll work. Thank you. So what I was just saying is that people talk. And we're talking a little bit where we are. My mind is thinking about your laughing and coughing. And it's part of our safety, you guys. So with the presenter, I just really appreciate his ability to present this incredibly important information to you guys in a way that made an impact. I can tell you that I previously felt about unhoused and not seeing people on the street. Probably similar to many before this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, that person at home you see now is, she's a state professor in the grades. And she's doing a decent job of showing us, the community, what's happening around us. So that we can be a better part of fixing that. Not fixing the homeless, but being proactive in providing schools that need these services that are lacking. You can use providing a lot of services. The one thing I heard was missing was housing. And housing, sure, it is not exalt, but without it, how can we expect someone to come out of depression or stop using the substance abuse? They are facing the stream again when they go back. So that's where the city can play a role in this. How they can help. You guys can help the situation by playing a part in tapping your shoulders. And sectioning is a big one. Especially post-vampire. You have so many people who are out of the area. They're in a difference. They even, because they couldn't find housing here. And some have the structures. But we have people who aren't taking them. So this is the part where you guys can get the best picture. And understand a little bit more about what's happening. And see where you lay your part. And where you can support the other people. Who you can't even state. And pressure them even. For areas that can be better. So I just wanted to support you guys. And I'm going to pull out the questions in here. It shows that you're. You heard. What Scott was saying. And this is for Scott. And this time. I'm going to ask. With his teaching and practice. It's also hard. It's a lot. And we're going to work the rest of the night. Thank you very much. And our last speaker is Lisa Currier. And as I call her. I just want to let you know that I am getting text messages. Indicating that they couldn't hear Jessica Giannola. Some of the others can be heard. So just wanted to let our TV audience know that. You know. We hear that. It also does depend on the type of system. That the person is using. Whether they're in their car. Or on a cell phone. Or in their home. And it does sound like. They could hear everyone else but Jessica. Correct. So Lisa Currier. Lisa Currier. Okay. Now I have to tell you. I've been doing meetings. For a very long time. And I attend all the. And you know. Challenge. The mental health aspect. And like I said earlier. When I was speaking. That if we keep people in the baseline. We can help. Before it escalates. Tonight I got to tell you that. Shelby and Scott talked it. And it's the first time in a very long time. Where I think that everybody actually. Heard. Mostly Scott. Because. You know usually. You have to be politically correct. And he wasn't. I'm not saying that. But usually you get on the spectrum of. You know just saying what. You see people want to hear. And Scott made it out. Beautifully. Being able to help. Helps us. They didn't have a chance there. We have many people. Whatever he said. All of those things. Are so true. And that's where our whole level is. Getting people into services. And into help. So and. There are laws. That allow somebody. To get on the whole. To get a leave once they get to the hospital. Because they have rights. So like Scott also mentioned. Legislation needs to make sure. That some of these laws change. And maybe public guardian. Doesn't take away. As many. Rights. As. They do. And more people. And go under. Hurt. And should. Be. So I don't always. Like. I was being late. And I don't push. In the morning. Because I have to get. Early. So I just want to say. They rocked. Tonight. And I'm glad. And I hope all of you. Really really. Did the part. That Scott has said. Thank you. Thank you Lisa. Last one. Correct. And that is our last speaker. So we're good. We're going to take a break. At this point. We'll be back shortly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Outboard picture. Details. Double bottom. How's that going, Scott? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? How's that going? this process with a reading of the ordinance by title only. Happy to answer any questions. Questions? All right, no questions. Public comment? No? No. Entertain a motion? Move approval. I have a motion. Do we have a second? Madam Clerk, could you take the roll, please? Yes, there's a motion by Council Member Brown, seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds to adopt the following ordinance by reading of title only. An ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico authorizing an amendment to the contract between the City Council of the City of Chico and the Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement System. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right, moving on to item 5.4, discussion of a card room in the downtown. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Thank you very much. So this is just an item that is being carried forward from former Council Member Ori. And so my request was to have us, well, John's here tonight to give us a little brief, I guess he gets three minutes. But it's up to you to pick up your presentation and then we can ask any questions that we may have and decide what we want to do from here. I promise I'll be brief. I thank you, every one of you, for listening to this. Long story short, I've been in this business on and off for nearly 40 years and I'm currently open where Quackers is. I think most people here know where Quackers is located here in Chico. We've been there a couple of years now and it's up to you to pick up your questions and years. We've had zero problems and we've done very, very well. I've lived in Chico since 1978 and I've never, in the years I've been here, I've never seen the downtown and really in such a state of distress. And really it's the whole city. You put together the economic woes, the COVID explosion and everything else and we're in trouble. And from an economic standpoint, I think that the troubles really haven't even begun because for the last year we've had huge amounts of money from various stimulus programs that have been very effective at keeping all of us alive, if you will, until this is over. But the bill's going to come due and we see it with all the empty storefronts and what have you. And I believe that I can generate a significant amount of jobs and a significant or at least a reasonable amount of money for the downtown area. And, you know, it's hard, as you probably know, to get new sources of revenue, particularly with taxes that have to be voted on. So my proposal comes with a self-imposed tax, no vote needed. With that, I'm going to go ahead and close the meeting. Thank you. Thank you. And see what our clientele are. Our clientele are not, generally speaking, youthful people that are into the sport of drinking. Most of our clientele are, they look kind of like this room. Just, you know, we're all ages and we're competing to see who's the best at playing cards on a particular night. I've run out of time. I did email all of you kind of an outline of the proposal. I did email all of you kind of an outline of the proposal. I did email all of you kind of an outline of the proposal. And it's the same that I sent back in August. So I hope most have had a chance to look at it. And with that, I just used three minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. And I'm available for questions. Thank you. All right. Do we have any questions? Do we want to ask Mr. Scott while he's here? Anyone? Anyone? I'll comment. Yeah. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Take any public comment that we have and then we can talk about it and see where we want to move forward with it. Sounds good. All right. So we have, I believe, one speaker, Ken Mollison. Ken, we got you there? Just unmute. Ken, unmute if you can for us, please. There you go. We can hear you now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. I don't want to be a problem like this. I mean, that's a great idea. The problem is that there's too many other issues that are causing people to flee from the area. And also, you know, it's a dangerous place. I would love to see you guys go out to the Peninsula Creek Greenbelt and take a walk through there. I'd love to be able to walk through downtown cheaper than that at 12 o'clock. I, you know, it's not a safe place to go. I went to school there. I got to go to school there. You know, graduate, keep a state of office, et cetera. And it's a, it's become a scary place. And I don't want any of you that walk downtown, right? Don't take a stroll. But I totally agree with what he's saying. If we need to revitalize that area, we have to also fix the problem first. Thank you, Ken. All right. So discussion. I was just going to say, go ahead. I was just going to say, my initial thought is, I think this was talked about several years ago in doing, and I think I remember there being quite a bit of uproar about it and having some very heated discussions and debate and whatnot. So my initial thought is to have it go to internal affairs, have our city attorney review the, the legality of doing a fee agreement of sorts, and then kind of, you know, give DCBA a chance to come in and talk and some of the other states and downtown business owners and stuff like that and go from there. So that was my initial request and kind of where I was thinking to go with it, but I'm open to. I think that's an appropriate location for further discussion and seeking more input. So I'll support it. Was that a motion? Sure, I'll make a motion that we move this to internal affairs so we can further discuss and review. Council Member Brown, was that a second? Sure. All right. So my, just quick comment. I opposed, I think I opposed this the first time it came up. You did. Sort of. Sort of. And partly was the location of the time. Partly was the condition of the downtown at the time. Partly was. And I think that's a lack of knowledge on my part about the clientele. And I don't know if that was before or after you had started what you're doing over by Quackers. And I don't know where Quackers is unless I follow Andrew over there. But I think internal affairs is the right place to go. Vince is the right person to look it over. I look at the area where you want to put that thing. Almost anything would be good. I know the argument against it is, oh, you know, we only want certain types of things. We want certain types of businesses downtown. I know what the DCBA is likely to say because I've heard it before. This is the kind of business we want downtown. We want this. We want that. We want that. If we don't have some kind of business downtown and get people down here some way, there's not going to be anything left. So I'm, my position's changed a little bit and I'm willing to risk it. I know it's going to go to IA first, but that's why I'll support the motion. All right. Anyone else? Councilman Stanton. All right. Madam Clerk. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Aye. Council Member Huber. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. I'm open to the discussion. Aye. Kate Carey, 7-0. All right. Moving on to Item 5.5, Council Member Brown requests outdoor sheltering opportunity. Council Member Brown. Yeah, thank you. And I think it's fitting given the kind of 10,000-foot. I think it's fitting given the kind of overview that we received from Behavioral Health and Desk a little bit earlier. So thank you for hearing this item. Just to give you some overview, obviously put a lot in the written report, but for the sake of the public. At a previous meeting, there was a proposal for an outdoor sheltering environment. And in that case, it was a legal tent, Cape Ground safe car parking area with 24-hour services available or supervision available. And it was listed as a possibility for our community pending the relocation of the BMX. Site to its new location. However, as you'll note in my report, additional dialogue has shown that there's four-fifths of an acre of a lot in the BMX site that's unutilized and therefore seems to be a viable location for some sheltering solution in an outdoor environment. So previously, Council was presented with an over $800,000 budget to successfully run a program like this, including everything from site preparation to staffing to office supplies. And while I do appreciate the thoughtfulness and thoroughness of the proposal, I do appreciate the fact that the Council has been able to revisit this item after having more discussions with service providers, volunteers, and the BMX site we see because of the new availability of that land and then because of new grants by the CoC and collaborative partnerships that would inevitably reduce the cost with making something like this possible. Among them is a grant funding from the CoC for Haven of Hope on Wheels, which provides showers and laundry services that would have otherwise been included in the budget. And then, of course, the!! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. is that we move on this partial project and that does not require the relocation of the BMX site in order to come to fruition. The project guidelines would obviously need to be established by experts in this case, but I do have some recommendations. And there are a few things that Council can do tonight to make this come to fruition. Based on my research and consultation with local experts, a site of this size could host approximately 30 tents or pallet shelters of some sort, micro-shelters. Because of funding allocated through the COC, costs for laundry and showers, as I mentioned, could be covered. There's also the opportunity for partnership with other service providers to cover costs of things like rental subsidies and applications listed in the previously proposed budget. Obviously, those resources would be used to move people from an outdoor sheltering environment into more permanent housing services. If we decide to go the way of a sanctioned tent campground versus a pallet shelter program, cost per structure would be significantly reduced. And so that's kind of up to us. It's interesting because I read earlier that Reading is considering a proposal tonight to declare a shelter crisis. They may have already heard it. And implement a temporary sheltering environment in the form of portable cabins in their area. So it's very clear that we're not alone in our region and certainly not in our state. I'm also not naive to the fact that this will inevitably require investment of resources on our part. And I genuinely believe that investment will benefit both the community at large and the people living on our streets and public spaces. We can't do that without the support of our local government. We can make a very visible and very essential impact by removing the barrier of no land available and collaborating to make this come to life. And hopefully in shorter order than some of the other sheltering opportunities that are becoming available within the next year or two. So like I said, I have some more specific recommendations, but I would love to take questions. I also understand there may be some other issues that staff may need to address. So questions for Council Member Brown? I have a couple. Sure. So you're talking about the, and just for clarification, of course. So you're talking about the area at the end of the BMX track. So BMX track could continue to operate. So one of my chief concerns with that would be, you know, BMX obviously will be restarting races at some point in the very near future. So would we require the organization to make sure that there's nobody who's, you know, of a concern, let's say, to the... The youthful activities that take place? Sure, yeah. So I think one of the things, one of the kind of conditions of utilizing this unutilized space on the BMX property is to build a fence around the property so that the program could operate in kind of its own environment. And then the program requirements for an operator to operate the program could include, and I think in the previous budget included, things like security and obviously on-site staff to kind of manage the environment. And it did. So in addition to that, it is common practice that people entering an environment like that would have some sort of screening process associated with them. Obviously, again, that would be up to the experts, but it's not uncommon for those things to exist, and I would certainly support program requirements that include that. And then would you see us reaching out to a service provider to actually provide that or the city itself? No, I would not say that the city should provide it. I think our kind of mandate is if we had the land available and the ability to... We have some resources in the way of financial resources. I think that's a commitment we're going to need to make because the money is just not there. But the previous nonprofit that made a proposal for that site, I believe, was some sort of collaboration between North State Shelter Team and Caring Choices. And I would imagine that reengaging that Caring Choices as a partner would be a viable option. Okay. And then I know the problem has been with tent camping is that a lot of the state and federal dollars don't necessarily support it. In terms of like funding? The development of those sites? I think that's accurate. Yeah. And the COVID dollars too. So I know that's been a hindrance at some point. And a lot of people just say, hey, just get a piece of land and throw some tents on it. It's obviously not that simple. There'd have to be some preparation, obviously, of the land and then a group to run it. And then we have this conversation about meals and security and all those other things go with it. And we end up getting a pretty hefty price tag. Okay. Yeah, I was just trying to get a full understanding. And I think one of the things that I'm asking for tonight is I don't know those exact numbers. I have ballpark figures. And it is an investment. A lot of the investment is one-time costs to establish, to do those preparations and to establish the environment itself. Those costs can be higher if we decide to choose something more sustainable, like a pallet sheltering environment, which would allow probably more people over time to be through those types of services. Or if we use some sort of tent site camping. And again, I'm not naive to the fact that we may be considering some sort of funding allocation. But I think it really is worth our due diligence to consider what that could look like in an abbreviated format than what we previously thought. Okay. And I guess my last question. Sure. Is what was your time table? Do you have a period of time or an open-ended time? The amount of time that something like this would be in operation. Yeah. I think using increments like six months to a year are good increments. Yeah. For any type of program to kind of demonstrate its success and to be able to report on what's been accomplished. So that would be, I would love to see a budget for six months and a budget for a year to kind of look at what that investment would look like. Okay. Any other questions? I have a question. Sure. Just kind of absorbing everything we just heard in the super awesome presentation from Behavioral Health, which was, I mean, so much I learned from that. We heard that, by his estimates, that 80% of the homeless population, which is an estimate. But the 80% of them are having mental health or drug addiction problems. And 20% of them are more the type who would benefit from just somewhere to stay, kind of get on their feet, and they don't necessarily need intensive treatment of any kind. We have open beds for those 20%. So what would a tent offer for those 80% that need mental health treatment or drug services? How is a tent going to be compassionate towards those issues? And how would that not cause further trauma? So the figure that I heard from Mr. Cannelli was that the people passing through their programs, which are behavioral health and substance use programs, they're only eligible for those populations. 80% was the figure that was estimated. Obviously, there was specific data provided to that. I do trust the expertise of service providers who are having those experiences. That said, a lot of the reason why people experiencing homelessness that maybe struggle with mental health or substance use, don't find congregate sheltering environments as accessible, is because some of the ways in which those traumas or those experiences might be triggered in those environments. And so creating a non-congregate sheltering environment where somebody has a place or a space to call their own, actually, kind of on its own, can reduce some of those symptoms or trauma reactions to a congregate sheltering environment. There's lots of other reasons why it might be beneficial. I'd be happy to share those with you. But I would never propose something like this that didn't include wraparound services. And case management from qualified experts in serving this population. Which is why I think some of the non-profits that have stepped up, particularly Caring Choices, who's made this proposal originally, really could build something that would be effective in moving people along that continuum. The reality is congregate shelters aren't as accessible as maybe we want them to be for many people experiencing homelessness. Not just because of substance abuse and behavioral health or mental health concerns, but because of kind of the nature and operation of those types of environments. This really is creating a place on that continuum that is an access point. A place for people to go who are not able to legally exist in public spaces currently. And a service provider who's ready to step up and help move those people along. Thank you for your question. I have a question. Mr. Huber. So you mentioned palliatives. And palliative shelters as possibly as an alternative if, I guess, if funding was difficult because it was a tent, just tent environment, then palliatives might make it more available for funding. Can you just sort of describe your thoughts on what a palliative shelter village would look like? And kind of what's involved in the structure and that sort of thing? Sure. You know, this is not something. I've dug into as immersively as I could. But I did look up kind of on the internet what a palliative shelter could look like. There's lots of different types of models. My understanding is some estimates come around 6,000 per structure. Those structures can house more than one people. They have accessibility of heating and cooling if that ends up being an option that is available to folks in those spaces. So kind of the longevity. It's more of like a housing type environment, although it is not considered a house. And so it's a structure. Rather than being a tent, has heating and cooling capabilities. And just from kind of an operational perspective, can withstand the test of time a little bit more easily and are more easily to clean and prepare for future residents. So you're looking at a larger investment initially for a longer term viability of that particular type of shelter. Conestoga had something like that. Any other questions? All right. Any other questions? I'll just turn around so you have a question. Council Member Cahill. Yeah, I do want to check in. Do we know how are we funding this? So as I mentioned, this would have to be a funding mechanism would have to be explored. And my feeling is that the council would have to make some sort of significant investment in this. We'd have to explore whether COVID-19 dollars could be utilized for a project like this. And I think it's a worthy discussion to be having. And a lot of the costs would be reduced because of funding that's already been made available to other service providers. But I think we would have to look at funding mechanisms and where that would come from in order to make this investment to get a subset of the population off the street and into a more managed environment. Sure. But you know, somehow it seems like we have another service coming into District 7. And I think that's a good point. I did request a discussion down the line. So at this point, I don't think I would be supporting like I would not be supporting it at the BMX location for sure. You'd not be supporting what? I'm sorry. I would not be supporting an outdoor shelter at the BMX site. Because of its location in your district? Because of its location in my district. Because it seems like there is a disproportionate abundance of services in District 7. So. Okay. So at this point, I would not support this. I do appreciate your comments and your concerns, Councilmember Tandon. I think there's kind of an implicit benefit in having an outdoor sheltering environment in that particular location because of its proximity to other services on the continuum of care. But I absolutely understand where you're coming down on it. All right. Any other questions, Councilmember Brown? All right. Let's move to public comment. So we have three comments. Chris Nelson is our first speaker. Hi. Good evening. I just wanted to comment about this. I think it's a wonderful thing to do. The retention isn't nearly enough. You have spent such a huge amount of money on police suites. And they have human-mediated mental illness. I am so bracked by anxiety. And I think that's a great thing. I think that's a great thing to do right now because I know these people. I know where they suffer. And I see how damaging it is to them to be looked around like this. And I think what's happening now with the huge amount of people who need to be fed to the police lodge, people from where they are, could be so much better spent in programs like what Alice is talking about, and Washington, and it's north of town. So it wouldn't be a neat place. It's a very dangerous area. I hope they will vote yes on this. It is not nearly enough. But I'll just leave it at that. I just can't condemn you enough for what you've done to the police in this town. Their pain is so acute. And now, command-genere, all of this is going to come back on a cheap roll. It's going to end up more policing, more hospitalizations, more deaths. And it's because of you guys. So could you please give us this phone? Thank you. Jessica Giannola. Go ahead and unmute. Can I still get an answer this time? Perfectly. Yay. Gosh. Well, earlier in this presentation, we did help a lot of people understand. Okay. And then more of a need for this service, this dedicated place where people can go campsite. I really appreciate how all this runs. Presenting, we accompanied with it with case management, different type of housing styles. We're open. Everybody's open to making it work. I'm in District 7. And I fully support this location. It always seems to come down to location whenever we have something presented to the council that can help our unhoused, help give resources to people. And it will always be that there's something wrong with the location presented. So we have to get past that. And we're a city. We're a city as a unit, as a whole. And we have a resource that we need. And we have a place that we can use. And we just need to go for it. It doesn't mean that that's the place forever. It means that's the place for now. Because now is the need. And for us, we should be moving forward having better resources, having more Section 8 available, having whatever it might be to better our housing crisis that we have that is everywhere. And it's also in Chico. And in Chico, we're together. We should be working together. And not my area, not my district, that's so sad to lose, so sad to hear. I just think that we should be better and have this option. The people being moved from the encampments. I watched the news and the people, what they're asking, they really are asking is where can we go? And they're asking the officers, citizens are being moved. They're asking people, helping them pack up. They don't know where to go. They're just in the other, the next spot. But we can provide a spot. We can provide an employee so that they'll not just exist, but a place where they have resources available and a promise and hope. I think that we owe it to them. We owe it to ourselves. We're all affected by this crisis. And we just need to do it. We need to just look our big role and put money in it and go for it. So I support it. I'm just your son and I support it. We need it. That's all. Thank you, Jessica. Ken Molison. So there's always a spot that something's choosing and they have to look at the consequences. Who is it affecting? Is it polluting the area? Is it causing crime? Is it causing drug problems? You know, get the drug. There's always going to be a problem in all these locations. But the problem is when you're affecting somebody else's livelihood and then it's the detriment of others, you have to take that into account. How about they go into your property? How about they include your law? How about they come in and trash your property and make it unhabitable? You don't take that into account. You're missing the point. And what happens if a kid gets somehow, something happens? Because these people have mental problems. We have to take all of these issues into account. And you have to look at it from not a, a slowly, but there's a, oh, they're homeless. You know what? There's a lot of people that have had hard times. You know what? Get it. You know, they got to go into the illnesses. Most of all that, what are the problems? They're all problems. Get them help for that. Get them 20% help in the institutions and whatever is necessary. But don't put it on somebody else's property. And don't affect somebody else's life. I am having a really hard time with this. And again, I'm going to go back to, get out to the Comanche Creek Green Hill. See what's happening out there. Hundreds of people, two outhouses and trash bins filled to the top with trash floating over and trash dumping toxic waste onto the ground that's going to go into my waterway. You know, you always think it's, oh, we got to help them. You know what? Somebody has to help the people that are paying taxes. So that's my approach. Thank you, Ken. And we do have one last speaker. And it was Nicole Navo. Good evening again, Council. How are you? I also live in District 7. And I am aware that not all District 7 residents can fully appreciate what some of us have been through. Because they may be in areas that are not impacted. And they may think they know. And they may also be in different areas. have their empathy more with people who are choosing that service-resistant lifestyle. And I just want to be a voice once again for the neighbors that are experiencing the trauma of the mentally fires, the propane tanks exploding. We had one recently here at my house, and this is after another one that I recorded on by the way. And we've had criminal activity. I've had neighbors that have had the pee-pee trunks literally pressing against their bedroom window, scaring the elderly, kids seeing the place, telling them, I see how this, this, and this, doesn't that look great? It's intimidating. It's scary. And some people don't have the wherewithal to defend themselves. And so I am in some way thinking that a non-convergent campground in this district is a solution. And what I would like to point out is that once again, we're talking about service-resistant individuals. We're not talking about the people that are kind of willing to do services. These are people who have been offered options and declined them time and again. And now you're throwing out something else hoping that they'll go. Well, what they want is to be able to just be and to not have to connect to services. And so they go initially, and then it's quickly going to get out of control again. And so it is frustrating to me to see that. And so it is frustrating to me that for whatever reason, the, some in the community believe that District 7 is the place for this to be nonstop. And we're dissident. We all have been extremely supportive. We've given money for addiction and mental health type treatment things. We've advocated for that at the state and federal levels. We're still willing to do that. But there has got to, there's got to be some dip here. This is just not right. And it's actually, it's not right. And so we're not going to be able to do that. And so we're not going to be able to do that. The victims are neighborhood people. And this is not acceptable anymore. And so I would really like to see, I'm excited about going to contact Chico, doing the work that they're doing. Because I truly believe we're going to get some good data that is going to show us who's willing to do the work and who isn't. And what we need to start a conversation about is the ones who won't. Because what is the answer to that? And so I'm looking forward to more conversations on this. But I would encourage you all to say resoundingly no. We can't afford it. We can't afford it financially. And we can't afford any more trauma inflicted on this district and to Georgia. So thank you for your time. Thank you. That is our last speaker. Thank you, Madam Clerk. All right. So will counsel further discussion? So as I mentioned, I do have a list of recommendations. I wanted to bring something tangible to you to help continue down this path and move it forward. With hopes that you'll consider it. And it's a little bit of a long list. So City Clerk, I'm not expecting you to copy this down. You'll send it. As is habit, I will send the exact wording to this. I also printed copies for the Council should you want access to the verbiage. So here's what I'm asking Council to take actions on for further review to prepare and hopefully approve at an upcoming meeting. To authorize City Council to take actions on for further review to prepare and hopefully approve at an upcoming meeting. To direct staff to utilize the four-fifths of an acre in question of the BMX property as an outdoor sheltering environment. To direct staff to create an estimated cost for installing a fence around the four-fifths of an acre in order to make it a viable opportunity. To direct staff to identify a service provider. As I've mentioned, Caring Choices and their shelter team originally stepped up and I imagine we can likely reengage them on this matter. To deliver a minimum budget for establishing and operating this environment. That would be a minimum budget. To direct staff to identify funding that would be requested of the City or other funding sources for six months and for one year. So those are the two timelines that seem reasonable. To find one-time costs and operational budget for the-for two different types of projects. A sanctioned campground with tents, which I know the dollar amount would be a little bit lower. And a pallet shelter environment. And then finally, to direct staff to identify funding from the City that could support this effort, including COVID-19 dollars, where relevant, coming into the City. And then finally, to direct staff to identify funding from the City that could support this effort, including COVID-19 dollars, where relevant, coming into the City. That's my motion. I would second that. I have a motion and a second. Further discussion? I'd like to request a quick question from maybe Ms. Cushums or Mr. Orm. Are there any glaring things that have been missed or any new information that's come about that should maybe be brought to our attention before we move forward on voting on these things? I don't know that any has. I'm just asking. I know we've talked easement problems in the past and in different things, so is there anything else that we need to know about or any numbers or anything like that? Yeah, I think you mentioned one of those, and that was that access to easement issue. That still hasn't been fully resolved, but there's no easement into it where the people currently are anyway right now. So, Susie, if you want to, I can speak to any other issues, or if there's not, you can just say no, there's not. I don't really know of anything that stands out at this point. Yeah. And if we want to add anything about the easement, we could direct staff to bring down a set of recommendations for addressing any easement issues and if there's ways that the shelter crisis declaration may allow us to confront or address those issues, some options. All right, so you're just after information, not the easement? Not necessarily approving any particular plan? You know, obviously, my end goal, and I think what I would hope our end goal would be, would be to approve something that's viable, but obviously we're going to need to see figures in front of us. What I don't want to do is dangle something in front of a service provider that has no likelihood of moving forward if the pieces fit. And I think the opportunity that we have is to advise and work with if we are willing to put some version of city dollars toward this project, to advise on how a program like this could be operated so that the supportive services are offered and that, you know, it's safe and productive for the service providers, for the people who are accessing that service. So ultimately, my goal would be to establish something, not just to continue talking about it, but I know that more conversation needs to happen so that something viable could be presented to us. I have one more. I have one more question. I know that the, COC released their fundings last week, I believe it was. And from what I can tell on the distribution, there was $3.6 million released in Butte County, a good majority of that in Chico, for non-conjugate sheltering that has to be used up by January 31st, I believe, 2022. That could be extended, of course, which comes down to around $400,000 a month that's available for non-conjugate shelters. So I don't know what the key is. I'd be really interested to see, I mean, that's a lot of sheltering that we can provide that's non-conjugate that seems like, and we have some great service providers that were given money, you know, United Way and Catalyst and stuff like that to be able to do that. So I'm not sure why we're not maybe at least waiting a little bit to see what is coming out of that non-conjugate sheltering, $3.6 million. I don't know what the key is. Yes, so I have consulted with some of the service providers, who received some funding about whether that type of funding could be utilized or how that type of funding could be utilized. It's a little bit restrictive as it relates to certain types of sheltering environment. My understanding is some of those funds are going to be utilized to keep Project Room Key in process or to continue housing, to house additional folks in hotels for a certain period of time, right? So we are going to come to this place where those who have not transitioned in support of housing or other types of services maybe don't have somewhere to go. That's kind of the nature of it. But we could obviously look into that and see if some of those dollars or how those dollars might intersect with a program like this because I think there are some ways, particularly those rental subsidies and helping people with rental applications as they're moving through these different parts of the continuum could be really, really helpful. I would just think that they would go a lot better through a system being in a hotel, a hotel room or a more stabilized environment than a tent environment. And then maybe we look at doing tents when this $3.6 million is gone, but that's just my initial thoughts. Yeah, I'd be interested in kind of getting a better understanding of the types of projects being funded. And I think that the hotel sheltering environment is a great program. It's also an incredibly expensive program. And so if there are ways that there could be a more sustainable model, I think it's really to our benefit. So I would look at that option. I have quite a bit of thoughts. If I can have the mic. Council Member Dentley. As you can imagine, I've prepared quite a bit for this item. So I have a lot of thoughts. If you guys can bear with me, I feel like what I'm going to present will be very meaningful to the discussion. So I made it as brief as I possibly could. So my initial thought is why aren't service providers who currently sit on large chunks of the service providers doing this on their own and pursuing funding on their own like you, Council Member Reynolds, Vice Mayor Reynolds, said about COC funding? Why isn't this already being done on their own? I just don't understand why it's at our doorstep. But since it is at our doorstep, these are my thoughts. So emergency campgrounds like a tent or a pallet shelter are intermediate and superficial. Meaningful solutions should address the larger problems of housing availability, and affordability, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, the list goes on. A campground does not give people the tools that will set them on a path to self-sufficiency. In addition, a campground poses concerning potential living and health conditions. In my opinion, a tent shelter would not make an individual with safety or trust issues with sheltering feel more safe than being given a structured room at a shelter with full-time staff available. I understand some will argue that a tent would be more comforting to some. However, I feel personally in my gut that it is simply another way we continue to fail those in the system who need legitimate medical treatment, detox, or mental health treatment. You simply cannot appropriately treat mental health crisis or substance abuse crisis from tents. That is not compassionate and in fact is toxic compassion. I feel the more I evaluate whether or not a campground would be an efficient use of resources, it becomes clear that a tent site clearly does not equate to secure permanent housing, mental health treatment, drug rehabilitation, or vocational opportunities. So, why would we invest in this? An investment into a sanctioned campground would surely distract and stop energy from longer-term solutions. And long-term permanent housing accompanied with supportive services is truthfully the only way to help manage homelessness if that's actually what you desire to accomplish. The reason most communities choose to pursue sanctioned campgrounds, tents, or pallets is because their shelters are at capacity. They need a temporary gap fill until they can free up shelter space. That is not the case in Chico. I know this is where a lot will start to get very frustrated with me, probably much earlier than that sentence, but here we are. As I previously have mentioned about bed numbers, and that didn't fit nicely into the we don't have enough beds narrative. I listened to that pushback and I did look farther into what it would mean to have enough beds. What does that even look like for our community? As we evaluate solutions like campgrounds, we're making the assumption that there are not enough beds. And the counter-argument is we have enough beds. What is the definition of enough beds? We all understand it to mean beds for all individuals experiencing homelessness in Chico. So, we don't have enough beds but it's simply one bed for every one homeless person. That is not the correct definition of enough beds. And it's time we change that. Enough beds actually means one bed per individual seeking shelter. If folks are not seeking shelter, we don't account for a bed. To put it really simply, if you send out 200 wedding invitations and you only get 140 RSVPs, you would not pay a caterer for all 200 people. You'd pay for those who want to eat the meal. If we have a bed for every single individual seeking shelter, that's enough beds. Just like if the bride or groom had 140 meals paid for, they have enough meals. So, with this more accurate definition of enough beds, do we have enough? If we don't, then is a campground appropriate? In the past several months, outreach programs are seeing an average of at most one out of every 10 contacts being interested in entering a shelter. So, 10% of homeless individuals are actually seeking shelter. Therefore, enough beds would be 10% of the homeless population because only 10% surveyed actually want a shelter bed, RSVPing, if you will. To be gracious, because things shift and change and there's crises, maybe we round up to 20%. The California homeless per capita averaged in 2020, based on reports that were just released last week by the federal government, that are basically the most efficient things available right now, is that California has a homeless per population of 40.9 homeless for every 10,000 population. That puts Chico at an estimated 494,500, just to make it simple, homeless individuals. I think our 2019 pitch showed more, but that's because it was immediately campfire. Most of those folks have moved on. If these 2020 estimates from the state are accurate and we round up to two out of 10 people actually want shelter, that's only 98 homeless individuals statistically interested in any kind of shelter in our community. That would answer the always curious question of how are we averaging 50 to 60 open beds a night, even with COVID capacity restrictions, when the hysterical narrative is always, there's not enough beds. Night after night, we see there are, in fact, beds and sheltering. It's because Chico already has far more shelter beds available than individuals actually seeking shelter. What we're lacking is mental health, drug rehab, and vocational training programs for those who are seeking or needing more than your standard shelter bed. I'm almost done. In light of the discovery that we have more shelter beds than those statistically seeking shelter and have open beds regularly that support that conclusion, I would say no. There is no need for an emergency sanctioned campground or non-emergency, however you want to clarify it. In addition, there's actually not even a shelter crisis anymore, based on there being, way more than enough shelter beds regularly, which is probably the only time a sanctioned campground should actually ever be entertained. Again, enough beds is not one bed for homeless individual, it's one bed per individual seeking shelter. We have that already. We need to move on to other unresolved issues that have yet to be thoroughly addressed, such as roads, public safety, environmental protections, big bad pension liabilities, and more. So I would be interested in making a substitute motion to direct staff to stop working on the BMX shelter concept, revisit other uses, and make a substitute motion for the CDBG-CV funds, and rescind our shelter crisis declaration in light of these discoveries. I'm really hoping for a second on this motion, as I feel it would be in the best interest of our community to take these steps to move our city forward. Thank you for listening to all of that. All right. You're right, that was a lot. I will second the substitute motion. Could I get that substitute motion again? I apologize. Yeah. No, no, no. Let's go all the way through it again. No, I know. I'm so sorry. There was so much I felt was important. So the substitute motion was to direct staff to stop working on the BMX shelter concept, revisit other uses for the CDBG-CV funds, and rescind our shelter crisis declaration. Can I just have a clarification? What CDBG funds are you speaking about? The $282,000 that are mentioned in the staff report that we have been receiving. Okay. The ones that we technically sent to townhouses, that were, I know, I know, because they actually didn't do that. Okay. Because all I heard is child, child, child, and it's out of the agency. So there is another use for those funds. Mr. Orr, would you like to tell them about the email you're using? Mary, are you okay with me? Yeah, go ahead. Okay. So I did receive an email, I think today, with regard to a potential chat project. It sounds like this alternative motion is seeking alternative uses of funding. And so staff was anticipating coming back at the next meeting in April with a comprehensive overview of where things are currently at to identify a number of meetings that are underway. That item was going to be coming back with that after I've had a chance to look at it. I haven't had a chance to look at it. I don't even know what it is. But I just heard there's a concept out there. So that meeting is being scheduled within the next week, so I can get my hands around what that is so we can see if we can bring it back at an upcoming meeting. But it does coincide with the request. To seek alternative uses of those funds, because right now the townhouse is not moving forward. All right. Council Member Moore. So in a better explanation of my second, without reiterating anything Ms. Denley said, and something I said to some reporter that asked this today, our poor homeless solutions coordinator and also staff and the entire city and the newspaper and most of the rest of the media has a very unclear idea of what this council is doing. And I am not pointing any fingers at any of the council members because what we have is a moving target. You know, we had COVID hit. We had a fire. Then we had COVID. And then we said camp everywhere. That created a problem. Then we started enforcement. And we wanted to make sure that there was places for people to go. So the BMX track came back up because that was originally talked about years ago with wraparound services. Different service providers decided to do different things as different service providers tend to do. Few of them follow through on everything. Now I forget where I was going. Oh, so why is everybody confused? I understand I'm speaking a little bit for Suzy right now. It's like, are we doing this? Are we doing this? Are we doing this? We don't know. And it's not because we don't know. The target keeps moving. I think Ms. Denley did a very, very good job, particularly following Mr. Kennelly, of saying more beds are coming online. More beds are continuing to come online. I was originally a proponent of that. I was a proponent of the BMX site. I went to Marysville to see how their site was working and their pallet shelters and those things. I was willing to do those things when there were not available beds. There are available beds. They're getting bigger. We heard from Behavioral Health, 20 years of experience, these people won't go to these places. That's number one. Number two, and we've seen this happen. We move forward with the original motion and we might as well put a Camp Here sign up, whether it's for six months or a year. How are you going to shut that thing down? You're not. Not politically. Never. We've seen what they do to the parks. We've seen what happens at Comanche Creek. We've seen Project Roomkey. It doesn't matter. I support the service providers to the extent they do what they say they're going to do. I realize that they work within a lot of constraints as well. I appreciate what they're doing and the program that's coming, but I am not willing to turn any more areas of the city over and have them look like the park did. There are other solutions that are coming online. I think that's what we need to do and steer away from the strategies that led to the scenarios you can see in Seattle, LA, San Francisco, and Portland, which is throw more money and more housing at people that don't want it. So that's why I support the motion. All right. I have a question. So the COC funds, and in case maybe you know this, if not, maybe someone on staff. So the COC funds that are supposedly coming if we withdraw the shelter crisis, does that affect that at all? Let me see if I've got this accurate. So the funding that's coming through the COC, we've evaluated to a large extent, and there's a lot of different pools, and they haven't necessarily been eligible for tent camping and things of that nature. So Susie could probably best speak to that if you wouldn't mind coming up. I'm generally interested in the shelter crisis part of that question. Well, whether it's a shelter crisis or not, the funding is identified for certain services. So obviously COVID funding has to have an access to COVID. So when you're talking about pallet shelters and putting one person in a pallet shelter where they can quarantine or shelter in place, then COVID money could be used for that. When you're talking about tent camping and out camping, outdoor sheltering, there is no federal or state funding that I'm aware of at this time that would pay for that type of environment. But the dollars coming in to the city could be utilized to develop... So yeah, so the American Rescue Plan funding, this new stimulus money, it has new regulations. I haven't seen them yet. I'm not sure if they're available. That was the regulation? I'm sorry? The previous money that was the... There's always an access to COVID with any of that funding. Of course. So... So in my 25 years of doing this, I've never seen federal or state money being available for outdoor sheltering for COVID or not. Thank you. All right. Were you speaking to the Rescue Plan funding? No. I was talking about the shelter crisis. Got it. If it has any effect on that $3.6 million that Vice Mayor Reynolds mentioned. Or future. Or future funding. Yes. Or anything not that we're aware of. No. Okay. So while we're talking about it, well, let me finish my comment. I'll turn this one on to my second. Okay. But let me finish my comment here if I can. Okay. Are you done? No. No. So currently right now, we have a survey taking place that the county is doing. I just think, no offense to my colleagues here, but I think, you know, I'd really like just the results of that survey before we actually move forward on either of these items. So not that I would actually offer a substitute to a substitute. I'm not going to go that route. But I think it would be helpful if we just, you know, waited for that particular group that the county is going to be engaged to bring back information to us. And then we can actually make a decision based, again, on facts. Just to be clear, part of the information I have on those one in ten is I did contact that organization and get their current numbers of outreach that was part of my stuff. Well, we're not all privy to that, though. Mayor Coolidge? Yeah. If the results of whatever survey I haven't seen it, don't know what the questions are, don't know how it was developed, but if the results indicated that an outdoor sheltering environment as opposed to an overnight shelter where people go in at a certain time or kicked out at a certain time and have to find a place to exist all the time in between were to be something that people would access, is that a program that you would be willing to discuss? Well, I'd be willing to discuss anything. Support, maybe not. You know, it depends on, you know, it doesn't necessarily to me mean that just because people want something they shouldn't necessarily get it. That it's, you know, I do have to say that I have concerns that giving anyone everything they want to make sure that they don't actually go towards services that can connect them with help and wraparound. And, you know, the reason why the state and federal governments don't consider camping, you know, something that they'll fund is there's obvious reasons behind that, too. Sure. That's why I'm proposing the possibility. I mean, I have a multitude of concerns, but I mean, I realize that there's always some type of middle ground, but... Sure. But that's why I'm proposing the possibility of a pallet sheltering environment, which sounds like there's a possibility that funding could be allocated not outside of the general fund to support. And despite what some of my colleagues have shared, those types of environments are an entry point to access services on the continuum of care. And all of the years that I've been working on the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force, paying attention to the continuum of care meetings, I've never once heard that that was not an important part of it. In fact, I've heard a lot of encouragement to establish something like that because it creates an access point. This would not be an unmanaged environment. This would not be an environment that was managed by a nonprofit that is unaware of the needs and challenges facing people experiencing homelessness. This would create wraparound services and case management in a controlled environment with rules and regulations. And so I see it as incredibly essential to getting those folks for whom a congregate sheltering environment, like I just described, is not a viable option because of barriers, whether that be personal property, pets, not being able to be with family, mental health, trauma, et cetera. The list goes on and on. This could be an opportunity for an access point, and it's a small project that we could see come to fruition with a credible service provider. I just don't understand why we wouldn't explore that as an option, especially if COVID dollars could be used to pay for it. All right. So, Ms. Warren, so let's do... Okay. Mr. Huber, he's yielded to you. Thank you. Yeah, Councilmember Denley's assessment ignores some realities about a percentage of the unhoused people in the community, and that is that they aren't going to come inside. And there's lots of reasons for that. There's not just a single reason. It's not just drug use or mental health. It's a variety of reasons. It could be PTSD. It could be a mental health issue. It could be agoraphobia. It could be that they don't want to be without their pets, and there's no place that they can go in that's allowing their pets. There's numerous reasons that people are resistant to go inside. What we do by continuing to kick people out of the places that they're in without providing an alternative is we send them to a place that they're not going to be able to go in. And we send them either deeper into places within our own community, or we send them into other communities. And some may think that that's a perfectly viable thing to do is to send them elsewhere. But remember, when we're sending them elsewhere, if other communities are practicing the same thing, they're just sending their people to us. It has to stop somewhere. Somewhere has to... Someplace has to solve it for this percentage of the people that is growing all the time that is not going to come inside. And a sanctioned campground, a managed campground, a regulated campground, is... which can be extended into pallet shelters or Quonset huts or whatever, is a solution that gets to that percentage of the population that we can't get to any other way. It also allows a first point of contact. It's not a do-all and end-all as far as getting them off of drugs. And if that's even the problem, you know, clearly, that is a problem for a percentage. There are mental health problems. But it gives a point of contact. It's transitional. If it can get service providers, if it can get providers working with them in tents or Quonset huts or pallets, and they can be helped to the next step, it's incremental. They can be helped to the next step. Maybe the next step is, you know, a $300 apartment. Maybe it's a motel room. Whatever it is, it provides that contact, that opportunity. We know that a percentage of the people and many of these... the people that we're talking about in this case are service-resistant, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to get them to enlist in services. It just means it's harder. So I think this is our opportunity, this sanctioned campground. And I think, you know, doing away with the shelter crisis and asking staff to no longer look at any sort of sanctioned camping opportunities ignores a huge problem that we could be part of the solution to. If I could respond to your concerns to the motion. I appreciate your experience and your views on why it would be beneficial and how it could reach people. My main question when I say that is perhaps one view is right, perhaps the other's right, and most likely it's going to sit that way on each side of the fence. However, if you're correct and this is beneficial and this is a solution or a big part of it that's really worth investing in, there are so many local... private citizens who literally throw money at projects like this, like the Jesus Center Torres. They are so excited to throw money at legacy projects. Why aren't these service providers utilizing their land, like the land owned by Ripperia LLC by Comanche Creek, which is CHAT. If anybody was curious, they have tons of land. What is preventing them from pursuing private donors, reaching out to other entities, and funding this on their own, using their own land? Why is it that we have to do it? I'm not understanding the disconnect there of why this is showing up on our doorstep. We are not the service provider. They are. We are not behavioral health. Behavioral health is. We are not experts in the homeless solutions. I'd love to help where we can. However, I need to see that you are incapable of doing this on your own before you come ask for general fund dollars that should be going towards far many other things that benefit a greater population of our citizens. So whether or not we agree on what's the most beneficial, I still stop at that point, which is why I still stand by my motion and the concept behind it. And just so we're aware. All right. I believe Council Member Morgan had a statement as well. I was going to make a friendly amendment, but I don't actually see the point. It had to do with possibly removing the part about rescinding the shelter crisis. But the shelter crisis that we declared is going to terminate all by itself in the next two and a half months. So I don't know that it makes that big a difference. Can you explain that? Yeah. When we declared it was for a certain period of time, and it ends in June or July, I forget which one, automatically. June 30th. June 30th, yeah. So it's only good for another couple months anyway. So I don't know if it's going to make a difference. So I'm not going to ask for the friendly amendment. All right. But I will call the question. You have questions on the floor. I know. And I have a question for our city attorney real quick too. Can we rescind the shelter crisis through a motion on an issue that's separate from discussion point from that? You can. And also, you have to, the question was called, so you need to act on that. Yeah, I know. I just want to make sure that we're legally making a correct motion. Absolutely. You can undo what you did. That's it. No, no, I understand that. But I just, okay. It just seems. As what you're asking, Mayor Coolidge, can this be done tonight? We take the vote, suddenly the shelter crisis is no longer. No, actually I'm asking about the legality of whether it can be placed in a motion that wasn't actually about this. The item. The item itself. . Yeah. No, that's why I asked. I was explaining why I asked the question. Okay. Ms. Preston, can you repeat the motion, please? . The substitute motion, and I'm going to probably mess it up, but it's to direct staff to immediately stop working on the BMX project and start to work on other solutions. There was something about the CDBG funds. Undo the shelter crisis. Seek alternative uses for those funds. There was a friendly amendment, but then Council Member Morgan didn't actually get to make it before the conversation continued. Now he's not making that. It wasn't a friendly amendment, but the mayor asked or suggested that we wait to see the results first from the county survey before making a decision. But that's the motion that I have, and I will go back and get it. Thank you. Can I ask a point of clarification of Council Member Denley? When you said that you were going to make a decision, you said that you were going So, you say look at alternative uses for the funding in question. Will sheltering, housing, or anything related to confronting homelessness be a part of? Yeah, I would love to see all the options on the table so that doesn't exclude any other possible sheltering. I mean, we can hear it. Aside from an outdoor sheltering environment? At the BMX site. So, an outdoor sheltering environment at another site would be a viable option? We could hear about it. I don't see why not. Why is the BMX site not on the BMX site? Why is the BMX site not on that list? All right. We had the question called. We have to go ahead and take a vote. Just legally. Okay. Council Member Brown? Absolutely not. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? So, I'm going to actually use this moment to say something real quick. The shelter crisis is expiring anyway. So, I don't have a problem with that. I've never been a fan of the BMX track because I think it's the wrong location without moving the BMX track. And if we can hear future information on CDBG funds. So, I think it's easy to say yes on this. Aye. Okay. I'd like to make another motion. So, this one carried 5-2. And go ahead. I'd like to move to direct staff to explore additional proposed sites for outdoor sheltering environments. Particularly the site located in North Chico offered by Ed McLaughlin for the plausibility of a sanctioned campground pellet sheltering environment or tiny home village environment in collaboration with the local service providers who have offered proposals to that and to bring these proposals back for our consideration. Second. All right. We have a motion and a second. Okay. Let me get that in. All right. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Thank you you Thank Thank Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank No. Fails two to five. All right. I'd actually like to make an additional motion, too, is that staff report back to us on the results of the survey from the county as soon as they have it. I'd second. All right. I thought that was already coming. We've received some communications that that was already on its way. Well, let's make it official. Would you accept a friendly amendment that we get to see the survey instrument utilized? Sure. Thank you. I seconded it. You're okay with the amendment? Yep. Sorry. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Aye. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. Okay. We're not taking a break because we're past 10, so we're going to, I'm assuming, yes, we are. So we will push item 5.6 off because we can't take a new item after 10 o'clock, and I'm fine with that anyway. And then reports and communications. City Manager's report has quite a few things. I usually skip through after 10 o'clock. But I know that if you bear with me, and if you tell me to stop, I'll stop. But I've got four items that I just wanted to plow through. Update on allowing public attendance at future meetings. I'd love some direction from council. If you'd like to see folks back up here to be able to speak. Obviously, our restrictions with regard to the six-feet distancing doesn't allow really much in the way of people sitting in the room, but at least we can allow them back in to speak, and we can get rid of this audio issue that we potentially come up with against oftentimes. So if I can receive some direction. I'd love that from council. Make a motion accordingly. Well, I've got even more specific than that. Fire away. I sent an email to the, sorry, I always call her Master Chief, the City Clerk today. And my request would have been with the Governor's order to move Chico out to the orange tier. I believe discussion is necessary how to allow the public back in the City Council meetings. So here are my first thoughts. Like a movie theater put in the City Council chambers, the main chamber, is at 50% every other seat unless people are from the same household. Just going to have to trust them. I don't want to get into the whole mask thing, but people are going to be more comfortable if they're required. It's just easier to do that for the attendees. Make conference room one available for overflow also at 50% capacity, which is going to necessitate, necessitate? Necessitate. That word. Necessitate. Wait, too many syllables. Staff coming back into the council chambers as they cross. They're currently watching, well, they're supposed to be watching the meetings in conference room one. I would be open to thoughts and advice for partitions between the council members because the staff is going to have to come back over there. Partitions between them to make everybody comfortable because it would be a little closer than six feet apart. And then we're matching what we're asking our businesses and others to do. The weather is also getting better, so for the people that couldn't get in, the 50% capacity here, the 50% capacity over there, they could line up outside like they did before. I think that would be a good starting point. I will second that. Thank you, sir. Just a point of clarification. Is this in line with the order? I'm hearing from Council Member Morgan that it is, but does that, does it align? Yeah, every time we ask for clarity from the authorities, they're like, really, it's up to you with regard to public meetings as to what you believe would be the safest and best approach. And so, you know, we can give this a shot if that's council direction to move forward with this, and it sounds like we've got a motion and a second. And just out of curiosity to add, is this, are other municipalities, is there a county moving in this direction? Are we the lone? I haven't conducted polling. I haven't researched that, candidly, so I wouldn't be able to speak directly to that. I know that there is a lot of, and I don't know any specific entities, discussions surrounding this of what that capacity should be. And being that Butte County is one of the top counties in vaccinations and doing a lot of really things well, it wouldn't surprise me if you start to see cities doing this, but I don't have any examples at this time. But Ms. Brown, to be clear, that wasn't a motion to, like, do that next time. It was a motion to look at how this is packaged. Would that work here and bring it back to us? Okay. Because they may come back two weeks from now and be like, no, that's not going to work. Thank you. I appreciate the clarification because I wasn't sure what that was. No, I wasn't saying too. I mean, I'd love to get people in here two weeks from now, but I think it's going to take at least two meetings. Of course. And then can we just. Maybe would you accept a friendly amendment to that motion to just temperature check other communities in our area about what they're doing? No, I think that's part of it. But yes, yes to the amendment because I expect that that's what Skipper and his staff will do. I know. Go ahead, Kim. Just on that topic, the Chico School Board is taking public tomorrow, so maybe staff can check that out because they are open to the public tomorrow night. Yeah. What I would. What I would say is I would ask for an amendment which would say that we move at least to in-person testimony at the next meeting regardless. Sure. Well. I think we need to check with Ms. Presson to see because I think there's some stuff that you have to go through to make that happen. Well, we, you know, we did it last August. And we were able to partition it off. We had, you know, the sanitation areas, all of that. And we were able to pull that off. That would mean that they would come in. And we tried the podium at the back of the room. That was not effective. But the podium here, we could put another, we had a protect, you know, plastic protectant thing up there. We can put that back on. I would be needing to bring in the audio video people again to put the speakers outside because often people will sit outside and listen and then decide to turn their card in and bring it in. It was effective. It did work. It was just cumbersome at first. But once we mark off the six-foot areas, which, you know, obviously it's a huge effort and the only reason I can pull it off is because Public Works helps me as well as all the other departments. And as long as we get it all set up, we could pull that part off for the next meeting. I feel very confident in that. And then we can, I can work with the city manager on developing a program. We can work with the city manager on developing a plan to get everything set up in here to move the council up there so our department heads can be in this actual room and then look at that capacity level. Can I ask a question? Sure. Would it be easier to do it all in one fell swoop as opposed to two weeks from now, have them line up the way you did before and no one's in here and then two weeks after that we've got 50% capacity and we're doing it kind of like we did it before? It just seems like you're creating something. Yeah. Which if you think that helps, I'm fine with. But I'm also fine with saying two weeks from now it's our last meeting, it looks like this, Zoom's over. If we hadn't already implemented that process, I would be saying let's just do it in one fell swoop. But I feel very confident in how we worked out the kinks in that and we actually had a process that did work. So I feel comfortable doing it in baby steps and we can allow them to come in. We'll cut the Zoom. We'll do it in person. We'll do it in Zoom in order for people to be here and make their comments public and in person and then we'll still develop our plan. I mean if the city manager is in agreement with that, we were able with the help of a local business to really pull that off and I know that that business probably has zero work right now and would be grateful to make it happen. Council Member Morgan, I'm happy to support further discussion on that. I think Council Chamber's public meetings are an enigma and that we're doing this from 6 to 10 or after. And so keeping people in an indoor environment for that extended period of time when, you know, I have some concerns about people choosing not to wear masks or refusing to wear masks and things like that. So I'm treading lightly but I'm happy to have the conversation and look at what that could look like. I agree. I'm very sensitive. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So we have a motion and a second. And part of that, the criteria for them to actually come into this building was that the participants did have to wear their mask. I think we had maybe two times when the mayor had to ask for that, for them to put their masks back on. But they were pretty compliant with that because they wanted to be here in person. Okay. Let's do it. Okay. So we have a motion and a second. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Aye. Council Member Huber. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Aye. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. That was firm. That was firm direction. Thank you for that. Another item I wanted to just share with you is I know that the mayor's had conversations with President Hutchinson over at Chico State. One of the initiatives that was instrumental in allowing him to come into the building was the! I just wanted to make sure that you and the community were aware of that. Another item that I wanted to make sure you're aware of is the school district and the city had been working diligently on an SRO grant program. It's been in place for a few years. And unfortunately this last round went down. And the state did not approve that funding to continue. I just want to reassure the city council that our city team is working on an application with the state. It's been told to us that it's likely that if the city were to apply for that, we would have a more optimal option to receiving those funds. So just so you know, that's in the works as well. And that would obviously come back to council. And then finally, I think it's important that I have Mr. Gustafson step up really quick with a really short presentation on Chico's spring clean day. This is the first time we've had to organize one of these as a city. The council authorized it. And so I just want to encourage the community to listen real quick as to where it's going. And I want to make sure that we're not going to be out on the status because it's coming up on April 24th. Eric, if you could do it quickly. Thank you. City Manager Orme. Yeah, real quickly. April 24th from 9 to noon is our Chico's spring clean day that was initiated by council I think about two months ago. We've been working pretty hard on it the last month or so with if I could have the desktop. I did give it to you. I'm not sure why it's not. It's not showing up. But at any rate, I can just give a quick rundown on it. We've been collaborating a lot. My staff have been working hard on it. We've been working on it internally. Public information officer Linda Gizzi has done an excellent job assisting and putting a lot of things together on the website that have really helped out. A lot of collaboration with CARD, Chico Unified, the waste haulers, Butte County. And we're putting this together for April 24th. I intend on bringing up the website. It's live on the website. It's been live for several weeks. It's on our homepage. And if you click on it on the homepage, it will take you to its dedicated sign-up page. And there's three different options to sign up. You could sign up as an individual. If you don't want to participate in a large sanctioned volunteer effort, you could just do some cleaning in your own neighborhood and hashtag some of the photos so we could log those and see those. You could sign up in one of the dedicated identified locations to volunteer. I think we have close to 30 locations that are filling up pretty quick. We have several hundred applicants or volunteers that have already signed up. So it's pretty exciting. Or you could sign up as a business to kind of designate an area as a volunteer. So if a council member that owned a business wished to sign up and support it through their business, they could do that as well. So it's pretty exciting. Several hundred folks have already signed up. You're going to really start seeing some information be pushed out through our social media outlets and some press releases coming here pretty quickly. So April 24th, 9 to noon. If you have a minute, look at our site. There's a really cool interactive map that I wanted to show you, but I think you could look at it for yourselves. That shows the different areas where some of the job sites are for roll-offs and things like that. So it's coming together quite nicely. We're proud of it, and thanks for all the support and help from the communities. Thank you. Any questions? Well, I would just like to say, having been involved in this a little bit, that staff's just dedication to this has been overwhelming to the council's vision on us approving it. I'd hope every council member embraced this. We have organizations from across the aisle, from back to the school district. You know, Chico State, you name it, they're getting involved in this. So I'd just like to encourage my fellow council members to be front and center on this as well, because it's a huge impact to our community in terms of cleaning up our town in a very general fashion. Every single neighborhood, almost every single bike path, every single park. You know, it's going to be a tremendous effort. And I can't thank our staff enough. And, you know, we have a fantastic team working on this. And I really appreciate their efforts. It's been amazing. Thank you. All right. So there are no items posted. Let's see. Sunshining of negotiation proposals. CPSA. Information only. And then monthly financial reports are informational only. Council member requests. Any? So at this time, pursuant to APMP 1010, council member may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting. After stating what the item would be, a majority vote of the council is needed. In order for staff to agendize, council members may also submit requests in writing. So I have a request. And my request was I submitted a request to agendize a discussion to send a letter in support of AB 36 design bill contracting, Town of Paradise. And requested that we waive our rules and hear this item tonight. And it goes obviously along the lines of what we've already worked to do in the past. So in. Challenge means if you. Right. It's after 10. Rules that says we can talk about breaking the rules that says we don't take new items after 10 o'clock. Which we could also remove that rule as well. So that won't be. Can we? Mr. City Attorney. I don't care. The 10 o'clock rule is a new one to me. But I mean, essentially, the council can, you know, you can set your rules and decide what you all want to do in this forum. You can waive your rules. Now the votes required to do that generally needs to be usually it's a super majority. But you may have majority requirement. All right. Well, I do think this is incredibly important. You know, we have our legislature working on this as well. So, I mean, I think it makes sense. Mr. Warren, do you have anything that you could add in terms of. Well, we probably have to make the motion actually discuss it first. So I'd make the motion actually just waive our rules and discuss it at this point. Okay. Yes. What's the date? It's very time sensitive. What's the date that opinion from the city would be required? Prior to the next meeting. Okay. You made a motion? Yes. I second it. All right. So we have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Brown? Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-2. All right. And Mr. Orme, do you, I don't, I can't find my summary on it. Do you have something on AB 36 that you can. Yeah. It should be in the agenda packet. I think it is. It's right there. I can. We have it. I'll put it right here. Okay. So it basically, it's something that Assemblyman Gallagher is pushing. It's in relation to design-build contracting for the Town of Paradise. And I, yeah. Do you want to take a letter of support? Yes, absolutely. Do you need to agree? Yeah. There we go. I'll wait for a second if there is one. I'll second it. All right. Just an FYI that I'm going to be moving, I'm going to be voting no on this. I was already skeptical about the original conversation being brought to us about the sewer connection to Paradise. And I think this is a massive, massive request with way more questions than answers. So I just can't, I can't represent legislation understanding that this could have severe impacts to the residents of Chico and the people that I represent. So I will not be voting yes. All right. And do we have a second? Yes. Okay. So, and I would just say the, probably the exact opposite as Council Member Brown, sorry, is I think it's important for us to support our efforts. You know, we're already moving forward on this issue. And I think it's important that we support our neighbors after the disaster. Well, not only support our neighbors after the disaster, but in the details of this it's actually supporting the refilling of our groundwater by-pass. tapping into other levels of water, which also goes along with some of the long-term goals of keeping our groundwater levels higher. That's why I will be a yes on this. Do we have anyone willing to comment on this issue? Council Member Brown? Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-2. Alright, I believe Council Member Tandon had a request. I believe Council Member Tandon had a request as well. It has been brought to my attention, and I've received numerous complaints from the residents and business owners on Meijer Street regarding thefts, destruction of tools and equipment, vandalism, and above all, insecurity to employees and customers. I believe that I have a duty that I represent the business owners and the other residents of District 7 as well. So I would like to make a request to see to avoid the disproportionate concentration of services in District 7. And I believe that the services that we have already are already there. But I would like to request to see that in the future, if we could use the tools like land use, planning, or zoning to distribute the services all over the town instead of concentrating them in one district. So there is easy access of services to the people who need them, and the responsibility is shared, and the burden is not on the and not just on District 7, which I'm representing right now. And I get to hear, I got a chance to visit Comanche Creek a few times last month, and the amount of trash and the amount of resistance from service, for service, is huge. I get to speak with at least 40 people there, and there is no desire to have a service to the people who need them. But it's up to the individual to decide and to pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and pick up and or they will have to fix the fences, get the power lines, mail yards stolen. I mean, you name it, and it had happened there. I would like to see that discussion happen in a future meeting. So if I could, I totally hear and support that you want to look into the concentration of services in District 7. I would be interested in extending that discussion that would be agendized to include evaluating where they're concentrated, just looking at the whole city as a whole and really seeing the big picture, which obviously would include District 7. So I would make a motion to agendize your request to look into the disproportionate concentration of services in District 7, as well as looking at the overall city concentration of services. Second. Did she ask to amend? No, she's not making a motion. Did you make a motion yet? No. We did have a first motion. Madam Clerk, when you're ready. Okay. Just waiting. There's a little bit of a lag time. No worries. Of course, it's really lagging. So, well, I'm going to be the first to vote. So I just want to say respectfully, Council Member Tandon, that I'm going to vote no on this item. Part of the reason being that we have witnessed how difficult it is for service providers to identify locations, land, buildings, to provide the services and the continuum of services that they provide. I would hate to see us put more restrictions on the ability for people to do what they do best and to work on this problem. So I'm going to vote no, respectfully. All right. Madam Clerk, you're ready. And I'd like to take an opportunity to comment, if I may. Well, we're supposed to wait until we actually have the discussion to comment on. It's about agendizing. Okay. Fire away, sir. Sorry. Yeah. And I'm going to vote yes on this, because I really feel like it's a valid question of overloading one part of town with, you know, with a certain type of services. I think you have a point. And I think that making progress toward distributing that more equally is a worthwhile conversation to have. All right. Okay. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Any other verbal council member requests? All right. This time we'll adjourn to closed session. And we will reconvene back here with an announcement from closed session. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
