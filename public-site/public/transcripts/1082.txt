 Okay, good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council members. I'll do my best to get through this in a timely, a short, timely manner, since we're all getting tired here in the evening. But as Mayor Coolidge said, I'm going to be giving you an update on the pavement management program. Last year, the city's engineering department contracted with the California Pavement Preservation Center at CSU Chico to update the condition assessment of the roads. A report was provided last year in 2021 at September 2021 Council. And in February, Mayor Coolidge asked for an update on the condition of the roads. So I'll be including that update in the presentation. Tonight, and when I just wanted to go through real quick, last year when they updated the roads condition assessment, they manually inspected the road segments and developed a pavement condition index for each segment. And they also developed the deferred maintenance work that was needed on each segment and added that up system wide. And I'm going to go through that data in a minute. And to remind everybody what pavement condition index is, it's a surface condition rating, where when they go out and look at the road, they're going to get a payment condition index. And when they go out and look at the streets, they look at all the distresses on the street, which include cracking, weathering, and base failure. And then they come up with a score based on those distresses. And the score can range from zero to 100. 100 being a new road or new paving, and zero being a failed road. And those PCI scores can be grouped into categories, condition categories, from very poor to excellent. And to show you some examples of what these are, what these different condition categories look like, this is an example of an excellent condition road. It's new paving. The PCI is 100. This is an example of very good condition. You can see one linear crack forming on the road. This is an example of good condition, believe it or not. Some surface cracking is forming, but this is still maintainable. And this is an example of poor condition, serious linear cracking. And paving and pothole repairs on this road. This is, I just want to stop here real quick. Our average PCI is now 46, which is in this category right here. So the average condition of our roads is approximately what you're seeing right here in this picture. And very poor condition looks like this with a lot of alligator cracking. And this is a pretty much failed road. It's a PCI of two, which is close to zero. And you can see the chunks on the side of the road. The road is crumbling. The road is crumbling apart. To summarize the findings from the road condition assessment that was updated last year, we have 568 miles of road. The road value is about $400 million. If we were to replace the whole system, it would cost us around $500 million today. We have a deferred maintenance backlog right now of about $132 million. And that increased slightly from last year, where it was reported as $117. And as I mentioned, our average overall PCI for all the roads in the entire system right now is 46, which is in the poor category. Last year it was reported as 49. And because we are underfunding the road needs annually, our PCI is currently going down. So if you look at the condition of our roads in terms of miles, 53 percent or 301 miles is in good or very good condition. 47 percent or 267 miles is in poor or very poor condition. Comparing the City of Chico to other agencies in the state, statewide average was 66. County average was 61. And other cities in the State of California their average was 68. All three of those scores are in the good category, good average category. And Chico is in 4.3. 49 last year and I'm leaving it at 49 because that report was completed last year and I'm comparing apples to apples from last year. So as I mentioned, our average PCI right now is at 46 and this curve shows a typical life cycle of a roadway. And as you can see, the first 75% of the pavement's life, so the first 15 years or so, you only drop about 40% in PCI. But after the roads age by about 15 years or so, the road condition, the PCI starts to decline at a faster rate. That's called accelerated deterioration. And as you can see, we plotted our average PCI on the curve and it's in the accelerated deterioration range of the curve. And that means our PCI is dropping faster now. And that doesn't mean all roads are in advanced deterioration. It means acceleration. But on average, our roads are in advanced deterioration. So if you look at the data from 2015 to 2021, our PCI was at average 61 in 2015, which is average good condition. And then it dropped pretty significantly to today, to 46, which is average poor. And looking at the reasons for that, there's a couple of contributing factors. In addition to just the roads receiving neglect, traffic impacts, and weathering, the campfire impacts from 2018, when I went back and looked at the data on that, I found that our traffic volume data showed that we had an average increase of 28% on many of our roadways right after the campfire, which was an increase of 115,000 daily trips on our roads. That impact is equivalent to over a decade. So that's a decade of growth or more. Another contributing factor to our PCI decline is annexing county roads into the city that were not built to city standards. Typically, county roads are built with paving on top of native soil with no backfill or compaction underneath them. So they don't, the curve that I showed you a few slides ago showing the life cycle of a roadway, county roads don't really follow that life cycle curve. So these contributing factors are important. So these contributing factors, along with the age, are causing the roads to deteriorate at a faster rate right now, resulting in the need for more expensive pavement treatments. And so, for example, if you have a road in good condition and you want to maintain that road to good condition, you could spend $200,000 per mile to seal the road. But if the road is allowed to reach very poor condition, you would have to reconstruct the road at a cost of $2 million per mile. Which is approximately ten times the cost of maintaining a good road. So how much do we need to spend to keep our roads in good condition? Well, just to keep our roads at the condition they're at now, PCI 46, the data shows that we need about $9 million per year in pavement rehab projects. And for example, if we wanted to reach a PCI target of 65, which is good, we would have to spend $10 million per year to maintain a good road. Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine good condition. More roads would be in good condition, but not all. Okay, so our current pavement management program, we are spending about $2.6 million per year on a road rehab project that is two to four miles per year out of the gas tax funding and out of the public infrastructure replacement fund. And we're spending about $3 million for three miles per year, and that is less than the $9 million that's needed to maintain the PCI at 46. So that's why the PCI is continuing to go down right now. So I wanted to highlight some of the maintenance funds that are expended in the effort to maintain the roads in safe condition, because thanks to them, you know, we're able to drive on roads. They're keeping the roads together in safe condition. They complete about 450 roads. And we're also able to do a lot of repairs per year, which includes 500 tons of asphalt and 11,000 pounds of crack sealer. So thank you to maintenance. And the maintenance funding required for that effort is $2.4 million per year out of general fund, gas tax fund, and public infrastructure replacement fund. And it's also important to note really quickly that this isn't all the funding that goes to the streets. There's other funding like street cleaning, street trees, and other things. But this slide is just highlighting what is going towards maintaining the PCI of the pavement or increasing the PCI of the pavement. And so we have delineated out our current funding level of $2.6 million per year for a pavement rehab, for pavement rehab projects. And this is on the city's website. If you Google City of Chico Pavement Management Program, you can see this list. This is a list of projects that are programmed out for the next two years. We're working on the top two projects on the list here, Pine, Mulberry, Cypress Streets, and East Avenue. Those are in planning or design as we speak. So this graph, this shows graphically what I mentioned from the chart a couple slides ago. But it's also charted with our current funding levels. So what it's showing is that, yes, we would need more money than we're currently spending. So we're not really spending to bring the PCI up to good or very good condition. But if we continue at the $3 million per year, our PCI is going to drop to 36 in 10 years. That's what the data is showing us. And to sum it up, our current need for a PCI target of 65 to 80 over 10 years is $16 to $24 million per year for the next 10 years. After the 10-year plan. Imagine. If we achieve a PCI target of 80, our ongoing funding need will be about 12.5 to 25 million per year. And our current funding is about $3 million per year. So if we subtract the $3 million per year from the 16 to 24 that's needed for the 10-year plan, our funding gap is 13 to 21 million per year for roads. And that concludes my presentation. All right. Well, that was great. A lot of information, but very concise. Thank you. Do we have a question? I think Vice Mayor Reynolds has a couple of questions. I might have one. On page 10, or slide, I guess, 10, the city average, is that every city in the state of California? Cities are sized, cities in Northern California. So that is based on the California statewide local streets and roads needs assessment. And so that's put on by the California League of Cities. And what they do is reach out to all the cities and capture as much data as they can. So it's all the cities that decided to participate in providing data. And of those cities, their average across the state is 68. Okay. Thank you. So obviously six years ago, we were in a much better, better position, you know, going, going forward. And obviously the campfire was a huge impact on that too, but it's also obviously our lack of funding for this particular. And it seems like a pretty huge bite too. I think everybody up here would like roads that were 80%. To get there. Can you go back to that slide where you had the costs for five years and, and actually not that one, the one prior. Yeah. So if we wanted to get to 80 within five years, it would cost $36.7 million a year. And that's in today's money. And it's important to understand with a five-year plan that at the end of the five-year plan, we would have a significant deferred maintenance backlog, and you probably have to turn around and do another five-year plan. Because if we're looking at the data, a lot of the roads are going to hit the end of their useful life and years five to 10. Right. So. Okay. Not a lot of good things here, but I think news that we need the community to hear. So, all right. Any other questions from council? It's just informational only. We're not doing speakers, correct? Actually, it's a regular agenda item. So we do have three speakers. Oh, okay. So are you ready for them? Yeah. Thank you very much. So our first speaker is Nicole Noviff. Followed by Mike Trollander. Long night. You guys must be tired. I know I am. Um, so I really feel for our public sports department and for our community and for you guys on this one. I think everybody's equally frustrated no matter where you land. Um, it's a whole lot of bad that takes a whole lot of money to resolve. Um, it is very disappointing that many years ago, as expressed that we're, um, you know, at such a low PCI. And then even in 2021, we're at 49, then it came down even worse than that. And that we were needed to be at four mil just to be at what I call crappy. And so I in polite company won't say what I think happens when you take it down by a million annually, because then it's less than crappy, which is very crappy. And so here we are. We're not evil, even able to maintain very crappy. Like this is wrong. So we need to find a way through this. And unfortunately due to other things going on, we have an erosion of trust from the community to look favorably upon the sales tax that is proposed. I wish there was some way you guys could sign in blood or something that the money is going to go to the roads, because I feel like no matter what side of the aisle people fall on, they could get behind that. Because we are so woefully behind the eight ball on this. And I know a lot of you have been up there before going, we need this, we need this. We've had you guys up there and your staff before, you know, just spouting about where we are and we all get it. Like you, I was joking that I have my little cup over there. I literally cannot take a drink without like spilling pretty much anywhere in town. It's that ridiculous. You have to wait for a dead stop. It's like, when are we going to have this? When can we feel proud of our streets again, that you look down and it looks awesome. You got the app. Alligator ring, all this stuff. They come do the hot patches and I'm literally thinking outside the box going, well, can we call the city and go, can we get together as neighborhoods and do better hot patching that's going to last longer and things like this? Because we've just got to do something. And the fact that we're looking at 25 million to get us on track like that is mind blowing and scary. I just, I feel for you guys having to do this, but you got to find a way to connect with people. And get us to pivot somewhere because this is not working. And what, what are we left with? We're left with the other option, which was not selected of don't try to just get a majority. It would be what the two thirds to get people to engage on going. We're locking it in. It cannot come out of this. You cannot touch it for anything other than that, which I think people maybe would have gone for. But I know two thirds is almost impossible, right? Like do something, find a funding stream, figure this out. We've got to do this. We've got to do it. Thank you. Mike Trelander followed by Jeff Creed. Hello, good and counsel. I'm very tired, so try not to mumble my way through this. Brendan had a concept of a mosaic that that the general plan talks about in building patterns. So the mosaic is, you know, residential commercial types of development. And if we look at the mosaics that we have now, we have huge tracks of single family development. Generally in the city of Chico, those are net negative when it comes to repairing their maintaining their infrastructure. When you look at Marion Park, which is a different kind of development, it's 18 times the property tax. Value of, let's say, Sycamore Creek with one tenth of the public infrastructure. So Marion Park is a broken slot machine for you. It is paying huge amounts of roadway repair where the other developments are sucking you dry. And so the idea isn't to eliminate single family to attack single family neighborhoods. The idea is to introduce a. Mosaic that makes you healthy, that keeps your roads maintained. What does that mosaic look like? Your general plan talks about the mosaic a little bit. Your zoning codes do not reinforce that. And and every time a project comes up in front of council and we're boating it in late at night, we're never talking about the math that it takes in order for that project to contribute to the health of the city. We're only talking about the developer making money. And that the public is able to and if they can sell them and selling them is that is the key to everything. But at the same time, we are we are going broke in that process. So the idea is, is neighborhood single family streets and neighborhoods not. We don't have to give up single family. We need to get our mosaic. So it's working very well. And so the idea of we don't need Marion Park spread across the whole the whole city. We don't need single family spread across the whole city. We need that mosaic. That mosaic needs to work for you, for us, for maintaining our streets. And so the conversation really is, is when are we going to have that conversation? When are we going to talk about developments being net positive for the city? So there's my. Thank you. Jeff Creed is our last speaker. So this is a great topic for me. I've actually done a little homework on this. And let's listen to the mayor. This is a play. I'm not going to play. Potential solutions were not explored in 2019 and 2020. The cost to fully bring our streets up to the state average is now over $100 million, with some estimates as high as $130 million and rising. And that's just to be at the state average. And let me tell you, the state average is certainly. Right. So that's that's the state of the city this year. Right. So what's this in the plan? Again, by year 2020, based on the different funding alternatives, what our overall PCI would be looking at by the year 2020. So, again, if we do absolutely nothing, our PCI would be projected to be a 50 by year 2020. If we stay the course with $1 million towards roadway improvements, we are looking at pretty close. 51. Okay. So what Brandon was saying there in 2016, right here, was that in 2016, they predicted the PCI to be exactly what it is today. And so when I talk about doing things differently, right, we've been talking about this issue since 2016. There's been no plan to sustain the roads. And then we put up this slide that says PCI decline contributing factors. Campfire. Okay. So we increase it 20 percent. Eight percent. Average. Over how much time? How much time was that 20 percent active? And then 115,000 more trips. 115,000 more than what? What was the standard before and what is it reduced to now? What this doesn't say for that I just took doesn't say about contributing factors is you've underfunded as a city, you've underfunded maintenance for a long time, longer than I can even research. Right. This. This is a big issue. The sustainment maintenance has been up here. You've been as a city. I'm not saying you individuals, but as a city, they've been underfunding it here. And the issue is, is the conversation. You're not addressing the elephant in the room. You can blame all these people. The mayor went on to blame people who in the state of the city went on to blame people who come and visit Chico for damaging our goods and not paying their fair share. What's their fair share when they come visit? Do you charge your guests, you know, an entrance fee to your house to pay for the sidewalks?

Every department in the city is understaffed, underfunded, and undermaintained. Your roads are, and then you're going to go to the airport. It's like, how are you going to do an airport when you can't even drive to the mall? Doesn't make sense. He was our last speaker. All right, thank you, and no actions needed. I think it was very helpful, and I'd love to see us package it some way, so when we get some of these questions, we can send it out. All right, let me find my agenda here. Let's see what's next. Apologies, apologies. All right, so item 5.4, no items posted after posting the agenda. Item 6, reports and communications. The following reports and communications are provided for council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. And 6.1, city manager's report, two days in. Two days in. I really don't have a whole lot to report, other than I just again want to thank the staff. They have all come together, given me briefings, given me briefing papers. Chief Madden has spent enormous amounts of time with me, trying to get me up to speed. You have a heck of a staff here, and the professionalism has been impressive in my two days, and I'm looking forward to working with them. Looking forward to working with them. Looking forward to working with you and Chief Madden. I don't know if there's anything you want to report as your last city manager report. Welcome. All right. Thank you very much, and welcome. All right, item 6.2, council member request pursuant to AP and P 1010. Council members may verbally request item be agendized at a future meeting after stating that the item would be a majority of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. Do we have time? Do we have any council member requests? All right, seeing none, we'll move into closed session. Do we have any public comments on closed session or council disqualifications? All right, three minutes. Marathon. All right, here I am again. Guess what I'm going to talk about? Warren v. Chico. So let's figure out how to get this one done too. We have the pallet site. Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine Imagine with having to operate in the boundaries of a civil society. We should have legal services of Northern California sitting up at attention and thanking their lucky stars that they were able to negotiate such a sweet, all-inclusive resort that is free, all-inclusive resort. And for some reason, we're banging our head against the wall about rules. Like one can only posit that is it, that we need to be able to allow people to leave 24-7 from their pallet home that we all pay for? Is it that they have an issue with guests coming past a certain hour? Like what is going on? But guess what? Even though it's non-congregate shelter living, these are pretty close together. They deserve to be kept safe, just like we deserve to be kept safe. There are rules like that for a reason. If I'm in my neighborhood and someone's going around that doesn't look like they're coming right back for work, you can bet your bottom dollar my eyes look at the security camera going, that person doesn't belong in my neighborhood. What's going on? The same could be said of a homeless person and their pallet site being worried that they're hearing stuff going on. What is going on with legal services that we cannot get on board and open this place already? I'm hopeful that the city is locking down the social workers that we need for the O&E piece. That is vital, right? We can't get out there and do the outreach, do the appropriate, noticing if we don't have the people in place that are supposed to make the decision that they're allowed to enter said pallet site. So this community is like literally dying for this, figuratively dying. Hopefully nobody will die, but we need them to get into this shelter. We need cooperation. We've been patient. We are now at, I believe now finally over a year that we have patiently waited. We did not get what we hoped out of this, but when you look at the data, you look at it with sunny side up, there are services there. There's case management. It's a clean place to be right now. It is theirs to keep as it is now. It can only go downhill from them and they would be the ones to bring it downhill because the city has bent over backwards to ensure that they will have staff there. It will be clean. They will have garbage. They will have food. They will have wifi. They have everything that many others do not. They just have to agree to some rules. And so I would really hope that you guys, you can sway the plaintiff's attorneys to get on board and really do the humane thing so that, do we want them outside through another storm? Like let's get them in. Thank you. All right. Any council disqualifications? Seeing none, we'll move into closed session. Thank you.
