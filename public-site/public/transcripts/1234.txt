And I was thrilled when I saw her application in the stack of 98 applicants for the position.  After calling through people, interviewing people, she really rose to the top.  And we're thrilled to have her.  She's done an incredible job so far, and I'm very excited to watch her grow in the position.

Saturday September 6.  okay.  then I will correct that on the  application part on my end.  thank you.  does it on the white paper?  am I on the one?  I'  m in the  palm of your palm palm palm palm I have a question. Is this going to be one lap or  palm palm palm palm palm palm palm  palm palm palm palm palm palm palm  palm palm palm palm palm palm palm  palm palm palm palm palm palm palm  palm palm palm palm palm palm palm  palm palm palm palm palm palm palm  palm palm palm palm palm palm palm  palm palm palm palm palm palm palm  the first group will be at the  half mile mark and then when it  comes back around they can go  from the half mile to the mile  mark and so forth.  you'  re only on peterson?  we'  re not going all the way  around.  you'  re coming back since it'  s a one way street you'  re coming back against the  .  bicycles and foot traffic have  two way on peterson.  re going to the  peterson drive now.  okay.  but you'  re not going to be  roller derby smashing?  no this will not be a  contact event.  no contact.  it'  s just skating and everybody  will be wearing full protective  gear.  are you going to  use cones to delineate?  we can we'  re also very  adept so normally when we'  re practicing we'  re good about  indicating to people we'  re good about  moving around people as well as  also indicating to people how we'  re passing so it would function  like a bike rider does just  passing on the right or passing  on the left so we'  re moving  a little bit quicker than walking speed and  not faster than bike speed.  well there'  s people that walk there with dogs and  dogs off the leash I'  d like them to  know ahead of time okay this is a  lane that the event is going to be as  opposed to coming in and out when you  have.  we can do that we can because we  were going to be using chalk to mark  where chalk and cones in order to mark  where the half mile marker is going to  be at and so we could also just do  chalk and cones and we could also do  chalk and make lines going down so  that way we can have that and we  will also have people stationed at  those half mile markers so that way  the public if they have questions or  comments they would be able to let us  know.  if you'  re going to have six segments and  you'  re indicating 30 people  so you'  re expecting five teams?  yes we'  re working on getting team  members we have I think about  50 active skaters right at the moment  and so we'  ll have skaters who are going to  be volunteering as well as participating  so we should we haven'  t divided up teams yet but we'  ll have teams of players going out  there.  okay.  commission alba.  when you'  re doing your event trying to  visualize it and have the teams going  that'  s okay and you'  re doing fine answering questions so  coming up do you anticipate using the  whole width of the roadway when you  need to have a passing situation?  no.  even teammates or no so you think  you guys can contain it within say  half or two-thirds of it?  yes very easily we'  re used to moving around people  it'  s one of the things about roller  derby you learn how to navigate through  crowds very easily and the main thing  will just be we will have our skaters  s really cool  because I don'  t want pedestrians to feel to  have a roller derby player come up from  behind them and be scared by them or  go over a leash or things like that so  we won'  t need the whole way to get through  all of us are used to skating on a  ten-foot wide track and skating around  many many other people.  I love the thing conceptually I'  m just thinking of the kids who are  unstable on their bikes that I see  Unfortunately the child that caused the incident, but it's erratic right they they're not real great at panicky situations  So I just want to raise that no and that is that is a good concern to raise because on wheels  It's very difficult to  To be able to change directions rapidly  Fortunately one of the things that one of the first things you learn in roller derby is to change direction rapidly  or to fall safely or to  Get around people. Thank you  I have two actually if that's okay. Yeah  Thank you for this. This sounds like fun  So one thing I want to clarify and I know the answer to this but I want to make sure this is that this is clarified  so  Typically when there are events and relays and races in the park the general public can sign up to participate in these and I'm from  What I'm hearing from you  Can I assume that it's only people who are part of the club and so are trained  And it's only people who are  Part of the team because that's the way our insurance is working  Okay  So it can only be skaters that actually have women's flat-track derby  Association insurance that we're going to be having to the fundraiser if the public wants to cheer us on they are welcome to  but and that's why we'll also have those people at those markers too so people can find out what's going on and learn more about roller derby and  So thank you and that was actually my second question great segue  is do you plan to have  portions of  a lot of  track  Designated for spectators to stand there and cheer you on and how much of the road will that take up?  You know because it's a fundraiser you want visibility. Yeah, will that how will that kind of spectator area be managed I?  Have not gotten that far  But we can we can definitely have spectators if the spectators want to bring chairs and sit along Peterson Drive and that way keeping the main  part of the drive open for  for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for both for  the week from Saturday so yes um I wouldn't commit too much here um but I I don't think that  I mean in my opinion you don't need a designated pedestrian or uh viewing area there quite a few  of those built into the park so um will you all be wearing your jerseys so that you're easy to spot  too and are they brightly colored um these are our jerseys our team colors are blue um  and blue and white and so we'll be uh we'll have jerseys or shirts or a sponsor shirt so  one of those will happen it might be good if they were all I guess it just depends how you're  going to structure the race but so that you're you're easily identified so somebody goes oh  you know here here comes another racer yeah what I mean it'll also be  um  the gear is usually pretty evident because we're also all going to be wearing helmet elbow pads  wrist guards pads and skates so but we could also make it themed and also do blue as the color of  the shirt that we wear for our sponsors as well okay well i mean other people do roller blade  roller skate in the park so um it probably would be good if there were some way uh if you all were  had your jerseys on yeah i it used to be my primary form of exercise in the park roller  blade i left it and then it got too bumpy but now um yeah that was that was one of the things i was  really looking at was the opportunity it's it looks beautiful for skating on and so i was like  this will be perfect i'm gonna be jealous yeah i have meniscal tears in both my knees so um once  those are settled i'll go test it out too but um okay so i guess those were my only questions and  um sounds like fun and we will also have a banner up too we have a team banner so we'll put that at  the  the !  beginning so that that way people can also and like i said we're also having people volunteer to be  able to be out there to answer questions too okay thank you thanks  one more thank you a couple of questions there's a fundraising event correct this is just from  sponsors you're not going to be asking for donations or charging admission no charging on  admission um and we will uh we will be recruiting sponsors beforehand okay  pardon me for being old but when somebody says roller derby i visualize people going around in a  circle knocking each other down i assume that's not involved here no we're not actually having  a roller derby bout although if you do get a chance to catch one we do have about to cal skate  also too as roller derby has been around for a really long time the current version is is not  the same as what it used to be like back in the 70s they used to do stage fighting and things  like that it was much more like uh uh  much more like wrestling what wrestling turned into and nowadays it's more about the gameplay  where it's still very physical but it's much faster pay it's fast paced and it's more focused  on the gameplay and changing strategies so you will be you will be blocking each other no we  won't be we will no shoulder checks or hip checks during this event i just want to clarify the  delineation how we're going to do that i'm not worried about you folks i know you're  somewhat  professional i'm worried about the person that's got earbuds in or looking at their cell phone  how are we going to delineate your course from from those individuals  we can use chalk to actually make make lanes within the center of peterson drive and that way  will um and then i've also considered the idea of having people having volunteers on bike so that  that way they can be in front of the relay and in order to like help  their  in for all of their !  for all of their are competing in order for time so that was another idea I had is we could have a bike a cyclist in front of us so that cyclist in front of us so that way people will be aware as we' re coming through as well.  in for all of their  in for all of their  in for all of their  in for all of their  in for all of their  in for all of their  in for all of their !  I think we'  the bay bombers.  I might point out we have lots  of races in the park and you  have people running in the same  pedestrian inattention. Any  other questions?  second.  second.  it has been regularly moved  and seconded that the program be  allowed the race be allowed to  go on.  commissioner nava?  aye.  commissioner nichols?  aye.  commissioner piva?  aye.  thank you so much.  hopefully it will be a safe  and successful event and we will  see you back here next year.  thank you so much.  thank you for your time.  you won'  t be out there with your  children.  what do we have left?  permit to hold forest day  programs at the five mile east  picnic area from september 10  through april 29.  are you miss lattery?  I sure am.  haven'  t you been doing this for a  number of years?  for wildflower it'  s two years now.  this is our second year.  brian kehoe has been doing it for  a number of years.  he'  s with us now.  the program has been going on  at the five mile picnic area for  a lot of years hasn'  t it?  yes since 2015 if I'  m not mistaken.  brian is with us now.  he'  s helping us grow it before he  goes off and does the rest of  his life.  which we'  re really grateful for.  you want me to tell you about  it?  we have a special permit for  the location of the  the location where our tk kids  are doing school.  that'  s already been approved and  brian is our teacher there.  that'  s 14 little ones that meet  monday through friday from 830  to noon.  that'  s our base foundation program  and to weave that into our  upper grades I'  m the teacher who  takes our other tk program and  then grades one through eight  and then grades two through  special permit that goes  particularly to nature to learn  to explore to do unstructured  play and that sort of thing.  this permit isn'  t a special permit.  we'  re asking to pay for the  space the five mile east picnic  area to bring our first through  it'  s k sorry we just had a grade  change at our school too I'  m trying to get my head  on the  and second grade and third grade  so it'  s four different classes that  would be out there and so it'  s about 15 times on wednesdays  and five times on tuesdays and  it would essentially cover we  would start not next week but  the week after and we would end  in may and we would be out there  at least once a week through the  year.  so we'  re hoping you approve.  thank you.  I do it'  s more directed to shane  though is this one that can be  like I was looking at the  recommendation since it is like  an ongoing thing is this something  where we can do one of those  termed things going forward or  I don'  t know if the commission  prefers to have it be a yearly  thing but I think some of those  where we know and expect them it'  preferred that would be my  preference right now wildflower  they'  ve been holding a very similar  class on the north side of  file mile the difference being  that'  s nonreservable so they don'  t have exclusive use over there  they'  re just okay we'  re here and then the general  public pops up and this is a  little bit different because it  is exclusive use in a  reservable area. It would be nice  to have a lot of  year however I think we would  need to bring it back to  commission each year just so it  keeps the area available for the  general public and doesn'  t lock it up for multiple years.  thank you.  commissioner mcginney.  it'  s Tuesdays or  Wednesdays you can'  t get out on  Wednesdays.  we do have a whole entire list  of exactly the dates that have  been requested. We couldn'  t fit every single teacher in to  get out five times just on  Wednesday so I had to add five  Tuesdays.  it'  s a lot of work and a lot of  paperwork.  commissioner nickens.  you said exclusive use I'  m confused will the public be  allowed to swim at five mile or use that facility at all while this program is in a  facility at all while this program is in a  is this an operation?  yes but this is in a  reserveable area.  it'  s just a portion of the  area is reserved not the whole facility.  correct.  thank you.  any other questions?  this is the first year you'  re doing this program correct?  last year we started  January and I brought all of our  kids grades one through six and  with horseshoe lake and we'  re going to continue to and  that'  s nonreservable.  we'  re going to continue with our  four or fives there as we did last  year but the reason I'  m choosing the five mile east  picnic area for the younger grades  is it'  s shadier and grass and sand and  it'  s more friendly for the little  ones.  this isn'  s a little bit  different from the other  I'  m going to be a  little bit nitpicky here on the  application because honestly it  confused me one thing confused me a  little bit and that was the term  would like to host summer day camp.  I don'  t know where the summer came from.  just a little bit nitpicky here.  that was my mistake.  I saw that too I went I'  m not working this summer.  I am just kind of listening to you  you'  re saying it'  s four specific grades but the  application here says for children  aged five to nine and I just and I'  m wondering if in future we can be  specific to the grade if that'  s how we'  re presenting it.  I just want to make sure that we'  re just being specific on what we'  re talking about because there are  children in those grades who are not  those ages.  fourth grade sometimes they turn ten midyear. I don'  t know if that'  s a nitpicky thing.  thank you for that feedback.  you were also talking about tk  and I was like wait a minute here.  that'  s what I'  sorry.  the grades were really taken to that  location is just one through fourth.  okay great thank you.  too much information.  this is just from my own knowledge  and I'  m not familiar with your school.  I'  m a junior in the class and  m a junior in the class and  you hold your teachings outside.  yes, sir.  we are a public charter school so  we'  re free to public but as a  charter we have a little bit more leniency  in how we run our programs because we'  re a single entity.  we don'  t have to communicate and  coordinate with multiple schools within a district.  the director says yes and we get teacher support then we can  really run something that'  need especially when there'  s so much parent support as well.  we couldn'  t do it without the parents driving the kids there.  you'  re part of chico unified school district.  sort of.  the charter is under chico unified but we don'  t get any services from them.  it'  s confusing.  I don'  t understand everything about it if I'  m being honest.  thank you.  any more questions?  we have a question from the  board.  ll entertain a motion.  I'  ll make the motion that it'  s approved.  I' m trying to do a second.  again.  second.  thank you.  it'  s been regularly moved and  seconded that the application from wildflower open classroom be approved under the conditions stated.  very good.  commissioner nava.  aye.  commissioner nichols.  aye.  commissioner piva.  abstain.  commissioner thomas petty.  yes.  commissioner blashly.  aye.  and commissioner willis.  aye.  motion passes 6-0.  5-0-1.  abstain.  that'  s fine.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  now comes the fun part.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  the  do that in the next five years  or so. Also our benches our  donation benches in the park they  can be considered a facility  that policy has been our bench  donation policy has been in a  moratorium for over a decade and  that'  s a discussion  that we need to have also to  update that donation policy and  see where we want to go from  about that and what I would like  to agenda for the next meeting.  In the meantime please shoot me  any e-mail suggestions of things  that pop out to you in the master  management plan and we'  ll start compiling a  list and start chunking away at  this thing.  we will agenda that for talk  about that more next month.  this is a huge document we all  know they spent hundreds of  thousands of dollars to compile  this. It took years I was  involved because I was  advocating for the disc golf  people the outsider group. I  think that shane if you don'  t mind you need to be really  clear with us otherwise we'  re going to get lost in this  thing and bogged down I think we  need to be systematic in the way  we do this.  if you want us to go through  facilities I would like to have  a list of sections in this to  prepare to study before each  meeting. I don'  t know if that'  s too much work for you but we  cannot agenda anything we can  make suggestions to you. I would  like this to be as organized and  as little work for you as  possible. The council tasked us  with this project I understand  we have to go through you.  understood.  I would like for the next  meeting review 2.4 review this  section review this section  review this section. You know  what I'  m saying so we have clear  guidelines and we can really do  our homework. I think telling us  to just familiarize ourselves  with this entire document is not  that we want to look at it but  we will do it. We will  do it but we will not all do it.  We need a little bit at a time  is more manageable.  understood. At the last  meeting I would mention take the  document and go through it and  make some mental notes and then  we would be more specific on  things to work on. The  recommendation for next meeting  is to look at section 2.4  specifically.  that'  s it just 2.4.  thank you.  I'  m going to  go to section 2.4.  2.4 to what?  2.4 is the section of  management plan.  I'  m there right now.  that addresses facilities.  only 2.4 but that'  s 2.4 and then you want us to go  to what to 2.5?  all the way to 2.5?  you see what I'  m saying there'  s 2.4 then 2.41 2.41.  I'  m not trying to be nitpicky  the entire section that  addresses facilities and there  is what will be on the agenda.  that'  s only one page 2.4 and  then there'  s recreational facility.  I'  m a lawyer I'  got to have sections then  there'  s section 2.42 that'  s recreational facilities.  noted.  in the future I will be very  specific.  I'  m not trying to be nitpicky  then that'  s what I'  will be.  I almost feel like you should  treat us like we'  re back in school.  review page 2-100 to 2-115.  thank you.  that direction is helpful to me.  that'  s the feedback I'  m looking for.  this is a huge undertaking that  we'  ve been requested.  I'  m trying to wrap my head around  it.  going through the master management  s so outdated there'  s a lot of things that need to  be addressed.  I was speaking with vice chair  blashly earlier.  I'  ve looked at this document  many, many times.  I'  m looking at it with different  eyes right now.  it'  s a different experience.  this is a huge undertaking.  we'  ll take our time.  we'  ll talk a lot about it.  communication will be key on  this.  I appreciate your feedback.  thank you.  security so I could be more  specific.  we'  ll chunk this thing out and  talk about it and start coming  up with plans for the next 20  years.  we'  ll take baby steps on this  thing.  I don'  t think that.  I want to make sure we do a good  job.  I want to make sure we do what  we'  ve been asked to do.  ve been instructed to familiarize  ourselves with the document.  hopefully we'  ve all done that.  now we'  re going to start attacking it.  for next meeting each meeting  you can say for the next meeting  let'  s go through this section and  this section.  it doesn'  t have to be contiguous either.  you know what I'  m saying?  yes.  critical reading is one thing  I can do very well.  I want to be able to really focus in and then talk to people.  in the interim when we'  re not here we'  re not going to be able to do  this ourselves.  I want to be able to talk to people that  maybe know more than I do about  whatever it is we'  re reviewing.  facilities so that you want us to  just.  specifically where I would like  to start there because the benches  in my mind that'  s part of our facilities.  that bench donation policy that  is something that has needed to  be addressed for a  way long time.  at our next commission meeting  I would like to look at that and  come up with a solution  whether whatever it is.  specifically the bench policy is  at the very end of the master  management plan.  my request to the commission is  to look at the bench donation  policy at the end of the master  management plan and then  master management plan and that'  s something that will be on the  agenda to speak about next month.  section 2.4 and then the bench  donation policy and maybe by the  end of our question period here  I'  ll be able to find the page and  section and we can throw that out  there too.  I noticed on the bench policy  there'  s a dollar figure there.  that'  s probably out of date too isn'  s probably out of date.  re looking at more of a  $5,000 price tag now and I  think back then it'  s $1,500 or something like  this.  I had a question on that.  did you have a question nicole?  thank you because I got your  e-mail and it said 2.4 and so I  jumped ahead and then went back  because I had started from the  beginning again because I read  this back in the day.  one thing though backing out of  collaboration and questions is  to me I'  m looking at some of this  going man if the park rangers  have so much knowledge of things  and they'  re everywhere.  There may be things where we'  re not using some of the  amenities and so we'  re not sure what their status  is and maybe it does need to be  prioritized higher than things we  might recommend.  Just a thought I don'  t know if they'  re willing or if you guys want  to entertain them being here or  just on their own saying hey you  m going to stab at these sections  that are more relevant to where  you would be dealing with  something and maybe you have  some input for it because I give  a lot of credence to what they  do and they love that work and  so I think to be inclusive that  might be a great thing to do but  I'  ll defer to your expertise on  that.  noted.  do you have a problem with it?  I do project management and I'  ll keep adding to it but if what  I have is too detailed for you  you can let me know but I tried  to structure it in an easily  digestible way for my thoughts  about recommendations and I pulled  out and extracted issues I'  m seeing too that this might be a  consideration given what we all  know is going on places such as  the situation at sycamore pool  testing and that'  s in other areas.  I'  m digesting it is that problematic  for you?  no not at all that'  s great I appreciate that.  Mr. Chairman?  Mr. Nichols?  at our next meeting you'  re going to go through this  section by section and we'  re going to talk about the  rod and glen come and talk about  the observatory and talk about  the restrooms sequentially through  this document is that the kind of  meeting we'  re going to have?  it will be as commissioner  thomas petty it will be more  specific it won'  t be that broad because it'  s too much.  my intention next commission  meeting is to focus on very  specific facilities and parts of  the management plan that between  now and our next meeting I'  communicate with you so you  can provide feedback as I'  preparing the agenda so it will be very clear what we'  Mr. Chair?  the areas you think we need to  focus on?  yes.  what will you be wanting us to  do to approve the policy to approve  changes to this document?  to provide recommendations as  far as understanding this is kind  of a two pronged process we'  ve been asked to come up with a  plan of priorities for the next  five 10 15 20 years.  also within doing that look at the  master management plan for updates.  it'  s going to be an ongoing  conversation to develop this  priority list is where my mind is  at with this right now.  we'  ll take all of the items  that are in 2.4 and put them in  some sort of priority order?  not necessarily.  I know I'  m not giving you a specific  answer right now.  I'  m just trying to anticipate  what you expect to be.  I'  m going to  read it and say is this section  still valid?  is there something here that needs  to be updated?  is there something here that is no  longer relevant?  is there something here that'  s a moot point?  is there an area that'  s missing here now 20 years later?  that'  s the way I'  m going to read it.  if that'  s wrong I don'  t know.  that'  s what I think needs to be done.  is it still current?  if not why isn'  t it current?  I'  m going to go through each  section and make comments.  here'  s why this section needs to be  changed or here'  s why we need to hire a  consultant in my opinion on this.  this section could be taken out.  that'  s the way I'  m going to read that.  that'  s the way I'  m going to apply my expertise  and background to the assignment.  does that sound okay?  I  think that'  I love it.  was that helpful commissioner  Nichols?  commissioner thomas petty'  s ideas on how she'  I understand what you'  re saying yes.  is this going to be the only item in the agenda?  this could be a pretty long effort.  we'  re going to take it in small bites.  small bites.  this is going to probably be on the agenda for the next who knows how many meetings.  this is going to be a process.  we may not get through 2.4 all of it the next meeting?  we may or may not.  this is going to be hors d'  erre not the main course.  yeah.  commissioner blashley.  I see where each of us will go through each of these items and where we have our quote maybe expertise or knowledge of the area.  that'  s where we'  re going to be able to get some more information like the pier there at horseshoe lake.  I'  ve taken a lot of cases in that area.  s a good idea to have kids there to go fishing.  that'  s an important item to me.  I think each of us will have those areas that we have our I won'  t say expertise but our general knowledge.  we'  ll probably add to that.  that'  s a great example.  speaking about horseshoe lake and that pier.  that would be something that you have knowledge of and would like to bring that up.  then I could add some things that I'  ve been bouncing around that I'  d love to see.  some type of aeration in horseshoe lake.  it'  s something that'  s really needed.  that would be a facility project that we could plan out five years from now.  actually that one might.  I have some surprises for you guys.  that one I'  m really excited about.  that'  s not a surprise because ranger james was talking to me out there.  he stole my thunder.  he stole my thunder.  I think it'  s a good idea.  I think his wife was pushing it.  I was talking to them about hey wouldn'  it be this is what I would like to see happen in horseshoe lake and what if we partner in xyz.  that'  s where that'  s coming from.  I'  m not going to give you any more than that right now.  that was one of my inputs was going to be for that.  but you beat me to it.  any more questions on this particular can of worms?  okay.  we'  ll move on to  I guess you'  re still up shane for parks division report or is lindsey going to do it?  not yet.  we'  re going to break her in slowly.  okay.  excuse me.  as you know the pearson drive repavement that was completed.  we'  we'  re going to be doing it in the next couple of weeks.  it'  s a testament to how successful that was.  this roller derby relay is fantastic.  it shows it was done properly.  it'  s nice and smooth.  I think that'  s going to be a great event to highlight that effort.  moving forward with most recently if you didn'  t see the council direction on the decision to repave south park drive rather than close it to tripple.  the traffic so that'  s going to be in the  works also.  what'  s on the table currently for both of those areas if you remember we'  re under a trial period of vehicle closures on weekends and holidays that was put into effect back in march by council direction for a six month trial period.  that'  s going to be expiring about mid-september.  so we'  re going to be  s going to appear from what I understand on the council agenda that was being talked about today.  we'  ll see what kind of direction and decision is made there.  either to continue that closure on weekends and holidays or go back to the way it was.  we'  to be determined what the council decides on that.  but just wanted to give you a heads up that that six month trial period is ending next month.  and we'  if you have any input for council you can send them an email, letter, phone call, show up at the meeting.  i'  ve got a question.  in the trial period have they had any feedback from the ada community?  i don'  t know the answer to that.  all i know is the feedback that our office has received.  there may have been feedback through the city clerk'  s office that i'  m not aware of.  and you have gotten feedback from your office?  a handful of commentary.  maybe a dozen people or so opposed.  i'  ve heard unofficially.  there'  s been people that have really enjoyed it.  but mostly it hasn'  t been a huge outcry either way to our office.  thank you.  moving on to the next item.  re going to move on to where we are with the sycamore pool and the big chico creek water quality.  the center for disease control or the cdc we sent the samples that were taken by butte county public health.  they did the testing on that and the presence of the 0157 e coli was confirmed.  so the creek continues to be under the no swim advisory.  and the preliminary findings suggest that the creek is still under the no swim advisory.  the contamination likely came from grazing animals or birds.  though we don'  t have an exact species identified yet.  as far as i understand more testing is going to take place so we can maybe find a point source.  but it looks like the creek is going to remain under that advisory for the rest of the swim season.  i'  ll provide updates to the commission as i get them.  yes.  thank you.  i know that whole watershed because i'  m on it quite a bit.  and there'  s no grazing animals past big bear lake.  i don' t know what they'  re other than wildlife.  there'  s no.  deer are grazing animals.  deer?  yes.  and there'  s large concentrations of deer in the golf course area.  so this ongoing testing is going to be interesting.  how the water quality is going to be.  and how the water quality is going to be.  testing goes and if we can actually pinpoint a source.  lindsey and i have been doing quite a bit of research on this.  and there'  s factors that have come into play from increased nitrogen levels and burn scar.  sediment runoff and atmospheric rivers that trigger certain.  there'  s all these different things that have happened that possibly could have created a perfect start.  form for this variant.  we just don'  t know enough yet.  yes.  commissioner thompson.  you said additional testing may take place.  so you don'  t know if you'  re all going to try and nail down the source of this.  i actually think it'  s pretty important because if you get on any of these online chats people are still asking  i think we need to be adamant that it'  s the homeless population in the park.  i think if that'  s not the case we need to dispel that rumor and squash that information definitively if you can.  and more testing may not even change people'  s minds about that i understand.  but i think that if it'  s possible that'  s really something in my opinion that you should push for the community needs.  i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i think for all of the community in the park i  get to know each other better  and give us a little further  clarity.  absolutely we'  re looking into  different testing options right  now from what I understood the  cdc is the place that could test  for the 0157 in discussions with  public health constantly to get  updates and this is a new  phenomenon for us and no one is  happy about it for sure.  to address the part about the  unhoused community in the e.r.  today there is hits and misses  and they mentioned that exact  same thing and reiterated the  findings from the cdc and public  health and public health has  done I think a very good job in  their news release and I think  releases saying that is highly  unlikely this is a human  generated type of a thing that  is more likely from grazing  animals or types of birds.  We'  ll continue pushing out  that information and as we get  the information we'  ll share with the public  it'  s our community has been  reeked with so much tragedy from  fires to bidwell mansion burning  and the  we'  re being very  diligent to get past this thing.  that was my question.  upstream.  we have hopscotch of the  drainage up to alligator hole.  There hasn'  t been any testing beyond  alligator hole that I know of.  As public health continues  testing they may expand their  testing area but I don'  t have that information  yet.  commissioner peva.  they tested up at alligator  hole was it positive for  bacteria at alligator hole or is  it? I guess I'  m trying to ask the same question.  How far up the watershed does  it go that we had positive tests?  I can'  t recall exactly  which locations tested positive  but out of an abundance of caution I  do remember butte county public  health issuing a no swim advisory  for the entire watershed the entire creek.  thank you.  Mr. Chairman.  is this a unique experience if we  had this contamination before? I'  m  sorry I didn'  t hear the first.  is this unique or has this  occurred in prior years?  this is unique.  this is a little rewind here  appendix m is where the memorial  bench section is for next time 2.4  and then appendix m.  thank you.  moving on iron canyon last week  we went to symbolic groundbreaking  ceremony up at iron canyon it was  incredible there was people from  cow trout there machuta big chico  creek ecological reserve media u.s.  fish and wildlife service  california department of fish and  wildlife.  we had a lot of people from  and the county department of fish and  this project is very exciting  it'  s slated to start moving  forward with road work on the  second so next tuesday.  if there'  s a couple permits that are  pending if those are all solid by  thursday that'  s the second is the start date  to get the road work done in  order to get the crane up there.  and it will be a huge benefit to  the whole big chico creek  watershed of course the salmon  and other native fishes but the  end results of these fish being  able to make the passage and get  higher up is going to have  incredible effect on the whole  ecosystem.  we'  re very excited about the  project and like i said i will  give you updates as i receive them.  update on the park transfers to  card.  discussions have been ongoing at  the last city council meeting.  there'  s a powerpoint presentation  just outlining where we are.  there'  s been some financial analysis  and discussion back and forth  between the city of chico and  card and right now legality of  lease agreements are being  land transfer  things that have come up in  bidwell'  s deed for children'  s playground if we can do that.  this is an ongoing conversation.  there hasn'  t been any significant progress  yet.  a lot of discussion still.  a lot of information being gathered.  again i will keep the commission  updated as that whole thing  progresses.  i don'  t know.  skyler did some work on that  whole thing if you want to chime  in on anything about the card  transfer or was that covered?  no shayne i think you covered  it pretty well.  this goes back to the march 18  meeting where council directed  staff to work with card and  engage them on a handful of parks  they named some parks specifically.  there was i recall there was a  friendly amendment proposed to  bring it to the park commission  however that did not pass.  it was decided that they were  going to hone the scope a little  bit further at the council level  and then potentially at that  time recommend that the park  commission hear it.  so more to come.  very good.  maybe.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  over at five mile there'  s camera installations that  with the department of water  resources and the county they'  re going to do two different  cameras from what i understand  but the goal of those cameras  being installed up there is to  be able to monitor the gates at  the five mile dam more closely.  that is in the works we did some  time ago.  i think it will be exciting to  get more eyes on that area up  there especially with the  discussion of the sediment  removal project and how to  progress on that.  i think right now with the  addition of the cameras and  hopefully some flow gauges that  there will be more information  there to glean from when this  project starts rolling and it  will be more effective on how to  divert the water and exactly what'  so that is the real time type of  impacts.  then finally coming up beginning  of october after we get some bird  surveys done if you'  re familiar with the  entrance of bidwell park at east  eighth street and forest avenue  there'  s a grove of eucalyptus trees  there.  if you'  re not familiar eucalyptus  trees are not native to  they are highly flammable.  we'  re able to secure some  donations through friends of  bidwell park and very generous  donation from a private donor to  go through there and remove  those eucalyptus trees.  part of our vegetation fuels  management plan calls for  thinning in lower bidwell park.  this project is very significant  because if those eucalyptus  trees did happen to catch on  fire they'  re going to torch like  re going to throw embers  for a long way.  we'  re excited to get this  project done.  it'  s going to be a visual impact  but after the project is done  our intention is we have a big  volunteer day make a difference  day coming up on october the end  of october and do some replanting  in that area with some native  species like richie and i were  talking about maybe some  sycamores and lindsey  brought up today some oregon  ash which i think is a great  idea.  it will be a restoration project  and a fuels reduction project  all in one it'  s just when those  eucalyptus are gone it'  s going to be a little bit of  a visual shock.  it'  s going to be my team'  s job to make sure we are  getting that information out to  the public very clearly so  there'  s an understanding of why  we'  re doing it and what the end  of the project is.  that concludes the park  division report unless there'  s any  questions i'  ll hand it over to richie.  on that last one i'  m sorry i thought i heard  you say the word forest avenue  but i don'  t know where was the location  on the eucalyptus?  east 8th street and forest.  thank you.  i missed the start date for  that project.  we need to the nesting season  ends at the end of this month.  we will have the bird surveys  done hopefully by mid september  we want to do our due diligence  to make sure we'  re not disrupting any  raptors or anything like that in  there.  once we get the bird survey  done depending on the schedule  of the contractor is when we'  ll get the project started.  it'  s my hope it will be early  october so we can get it done  before rains come.  you can see in this area too there was a  lot of stumps.  from what i understand at one point  there was a freeze and a bunch of  eucalyptus died so it was a  standing dead that we actually cut  down before.  a lot of the growth in there is  stump growth that'  s been there for several  days.  that'  s going to be a challenge with  this project we'  re going to have to stay on  top of the cuts and make sure they'  re treated so we don'  t have the same type of problem.  brooklyn hills fire i think that  was in the 70'  s or 80'  s that was all eucalyptus.  i remember it well i was  at a fire safe council meeting  last spring with linda herman  actually and part of their film  they were showing was a  eucalyptus that had torched  it'  s crazy because of the  amount of oils in there it'  s just so volatile.  and i look forward to getting it  done.  it'  s going to enhance the deer  pen area with native planning and  getting it back to a good spot.  along the same lines speaking  of the  eucalyptus fuels are there any plans to address the  sky  brook in sycamore creek?  lindsay and i were talking about  that today in sycamore creek  that'  s incredible the amount of  broom that'  s in sycamore.  we'  ve been for years maintaining it in the big chico creek watershed and lindo channel as much as we can so it'  s definitely on the radar but i would love for the county to pick it up in sycamore creek because it'  s full of it.  i'  m walking.  does anybody else have any questions for shane?  moving on to richie.  thank you.  thank you chair wallace.  yeah a lot to report from tree division  been super busy over the last couple of months.  some of the projects that have been completed  i'  ll go through the list.  west eaton road was fully pruned from  esplanade all the way to the end.  approximately 350 trees.  we had a lot of homeowners calling in  very happy to have those sycamore  branches trimmed that were encroaching  on the tree.  very happy to have those sycamore branches trimmed that were encroaching on the tree.  they were quite deep into their backyards in some places.  so we didn'  t remove them just robotically to the fence line so we removed approximately about 25% of the total branch length so they still grow into the backyards in places and provide shade but they'  re just less likely to break because sycamores are notorious for summer limb drop and we'  ve been slammed this year with the  the  wyll wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll  wyll and the voicemail is slammed with reports of summer limb drop. And you may have seen in the news  The large heritage oak, the valley oak on Heritage Oak Drive, named after the tree,  dropped a branch that is basically the size of a large tree.  Unfortunately, pretty much totaled vehicle that was parked underneath.  Thankfully, no injuries, but that vehicle will be a total loss.  The tree crew have done a great job cleaning up the debris, and there was a lot.  It really was a huge debris.  So we're currently assessing that tree.  We think it's still viable.  Sometimes when that happens, really removal is the best option.  But I think with a little bit of work, that tree can be saved.  So, yeah, that was one of the projects.  Also, Grafton Park Drive and Cromwell Drive.  And...  Another hotspot, if you will.  We always get a lot of complaints from homeowners that live there  that they really want to see those trees pruned.  So we've...  The last time we did it, I think it was 2017.  So it's been overdue.  So I'm happy that we've now given those trees a cycle prune.  And going forward, we'll keep on top of that location  and aim for at least a five-year cycle.  If not...  More.  One or two problem trees may get additional pruning  and may even be removed as well.  So that neighbourhood has been the subject of a lot of debate, actually,  in previous commission meetings going back over a decade.  And at some point, we may bring that to the commission  and decide, do we actually pull the trigger  and start removing more of those sycamores?  Because I know that...  Just anecdotally, through speaking to the homeowners that live there,  it's about 50-50.  You know, half of them love them, half of them hate them, those trees,  because they are getting quite large.  And some of the sidewalk damage is becoming evident.  Now, we can repair that.  You know, that's what we do in public works.  But it's...  You know, at some point, we do need to take a look that...  Is it most...  Is it cost-effective to continue?  Is it more cost-effective to continue repairing the damage?  Or do we just pull the trigger and start again with another tree  that might be more suitable?  So that...  Watch this space.  That may be coming to a gender item in the near future.  The other big project that we completed this summer, South Campus,  the two contractors did a great job about trees in North Valley,  split the work between them,  and pruned all of the...  The Chico streets.  Am I going to remember offhand what they are?  So, Chestnut, Hazel, Ivy...  Cherry Orange.  Cherry Orange.  And we started on the numbered streets as well.  So, we did Second Street.  We didn't...  We completed that, but the rest of it from Third down to Seventh,  so just before Highway 32, which is East 8th Street,  we'll go back.  We'll get those in the winter.  Just to take advantage of when the students leave town again temporarily.  So, it just makes it a lot easier when there's just no...  There's just less traffic, parked vehicles,  and traffic cones disappearing overnight,  which is just part of the landscape.  The other thing we've finished recently,  we did round three of park fire damage removals.  So, we just finished...  We just finished...  45 more trees were removed along Upper Park Drive  in partnership with Butte County Resource Conservation District.  Their professional foresters did a full survey of the fire damage trees,  because we have them all geotagged now,  so we have a good inventory of what we have.  And I was happy to see that we only had another 45 trees  that are clearly not...  not going to make it,  you know, from the injuries that they got from the fire.  So, we'll keep on doing that at regular intervals  until we're comfortable that there really is no more  fire damage assessment needing to be done,  you know, that we're out of the woods,  for want of a better word.  So, Upper Park Road and also 10 Mile House,  that's another location that we have,  that we will...  you know, monitor at regular intervals.  So, the next time that we do 10 Mile  will probably be after the winter,  so, you know, spring 2026.  So, those projects are coming up.  The contract has also been super busy  tackling our tree removal list.  So, we do have a list of trees,  you know, random places,  citywide,  that have just come to the end of their life.  Currently, there's 200 trees on that list  and we've got through half of it.  So, we have 100 left.  In the last two or three months,  we've removed...  let's see my notes...  65 large trees that will then be stump ground  and then put on the work order list for planting.  So, that will...  will be coming up in the fall and spring of next year.  So, then for the future, as Shane mentioned,  we have the eucalyptus removals,  but also as part of that,  I would like that contractor to also prune  the entire length of South Park Drive,  similar to what they did for...  sorry, for Peterson Memorial Way  before the road was resurfaced.  So, they did a really good job tackling that.  Because of all of the palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm  drive, then five mile and back to Volombrosa, back to one mile and just go around.  You know, just every year we have a big project.  So in that way, we slowly, you know, bring everything back into management and hopefully,  you know, less limb drop that we see in the park.  We can't eliminate it completely, but, you know, if we do prune back branches, you know,  we can help, you know, reduce the chance of it happening.  So, yeah, we've been super busy.  One exciting outreach project that we're working on, we did reach out with Enloe.  As you know, we have a ongoing tree for baby partnership.  So we will be making a little movie about that.  So we've been, like I say movie, a little, you know, two minute infomercial trailer thing.  So we've started, you know, gathering the, you know, the script, if you like.  And we're, you know, fielding, you know, parents that would like to, you know, go on camera  with some of them will have their kids will be walking and talking and picking fruit from  their tree that was planted when they were born.  So a really good feel good project and is attracting a good amount of attention actually  from, you know, my peers in other cities.  You know, they want to know how we do it.  So, you know, this will be an interesting little, you know, kind of.  How to do it, you know, they can watch the videos, you know, we'll put it on YouTube.  So, yeah, a lot of exciting things happening.  Administratively, we've, from my office, we've been super busy with development reviews and  a lot of high profile reviews.  You know, we've all heard of, you know, the Aquatic Center and the bike park across from  Marsh Junior.  You know, being part of the development review team.  You know, I review the parks review commentary along with Linda Shepherd.  So we've been super busy this summer.  You know, it's exciting looking at all the development that's happening and is in the works.  So it's good to be on that team.  We also have a recruitment.  We have a maintenance worker in the tree division.  So that is currently out for internal promotion or lateral transfer.  And if there's no successful candidates, then it will go out to, you know, open recruitment.  So it's exciting to see what happens with that position.  So that concludes my report.  I'll be happy to answer any questions.  Question to Rich.  Richie, which, did you say all those big sycamores are in that I just wanted to go by and take  a look at?  Yeah.  Cromwell Drive, Grafton Park Drive.  It's all, it's one big circular, like a, it's not a cul-de-sac, but a full loop, if you will.  Off, gosh, Holly Avenue, up that way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, refresh me.  I know the street tree crew was small and we're doing a recruitment.  What are we at right now?  Is it?  So, currently, we do have, we have enough equipment for three tree crews.  So that's three senior workers with two maintenance workers.  So three teams of three.  So currently we have one vacancy and we do have another staff member out on long-term  sick leave.  So the third tree crew is kind of, you know, in the middle.  So, it's not incapacitated at the moment.  You know, it doesn't function as a fully stand-alone third tree crew.  So we do, you know, merge crews, you know, as needed.  You know, for example, that large heritage tree, that was all hands on deck.  You know, everybody was on that job.  So yeah, we have, you know, 12 staff.  And then there's the parks, the street tree supervisor.  And then myself.  So yeah, we're pretty much back to the levels pre-2012 when, you know, the big budget cycle  hit the, you know, everybody.  And you know, we had to make some deep cuts.  So we're, I'm happy to say we're back.  Do you feel like though with the wonderful job you're doing on the program of the replants  and the new.  Are you what you would call?  Yeah.  Optimally, I know you're playing catch up with, you know, maintenance that needed to  happen.  Do you feel like you are adequately staffed?  I mean, as we review stuff and prioritize things throughout the.  Short answer, yes.  Because also, you know, bear in mind that we do operate a hybrid model.  So we have our in-house crews, but we also have contractual contracts as well.  And we, you know, we're so blessed.  We have North Valley.  Arbor.  Arbor Management, which is North Valley Tree Service, About Trees, and also Firestorm.  So they're actually three companies.  And then our backup contractor, T&S Tree Service, that won the award.  They're from Bakersfield and they are the ones that have done most of the work in Bidwell  Park.  So yeah, they come up from Bakersfield and they love Chico.  Yeah.  So they do.  Yeah.  They're very happy to come up here.  So yeah.  We're happy to be here.  And between those, you know, some days I was, you know, in the summer at some point  we had seven tree crews working on any one day, you know, between in-house and the contractual  staff.  So a lot to keep track of.  But you know, thankfully.  So we don't need to beg for more people in that area then?  We're good right now.  Yeah.  You know, I don't want to, I wouldn't want to be a peer greedy and say, no, we need more.  No, we're, no.  We're.  I think that's a good way to put it.  I think we are optimal.  Yeah, we are playing a catch up game, but we do have, you know, the means to, you know,  get to a point where, you know, we can really bring back Chico's urban forest into, you  know, active, you know, sustained management where it doesn't seem like, you know, a never  ending, you know, battle where, you know, you just, you wonder if you've made any difference,  you know.  But.  But we're starting to see, you know, neighborhood by neighborhood, you know, we are, you know,  we can see the, you know, the benefits of the work that's being done.  And a lot of the public are starting to notice as well, which, you know, the tree crew likes  to hear, you know, the attaboys, you know, when, you know, the public are happy to see  the trees being trimmed, especially when they've been waiting for, you know, decades sometimes.  So, yeah.  It's an exciting time.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  Any other questions for Richie?  I don't know if anybody knows this, but Richie is still a hero in our neighborhood.  He came and gave a presentation at the same time that they were testing out their new  track vehicle that would go up.  And Richie, they're still talking about you.  So, anyway, I just wanted to thank you.  You're welcome.  And give you some kudos.  Thank you.  You are a hero somewhere.  Thank you.  Okay.  And you had one other question, I believe.  For Shane.  Shane, where are we on the third ranger position?  So, we, Eric, Director Gustafson and myself, we need to set a meeting with the  police department to discuss about that third position.  Right now it's not even in recruitment.  There's quite a bit of items on the ranger program that need to be talked about.  And I'll provide updates as they come.  Okay.  Any other, anything else to come before the commission?  Then we will be adjourned until September 29th at 6 o'clock here.  Thank you all for coming.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Thank you.  Thank you.
