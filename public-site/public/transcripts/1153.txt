 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Entertain the motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Vice Mayor Reynolds, seconded by Council Member Morgan.  Okay.  And that includes the ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico approving Development Agreement 23-01 between the City of Chico and the Casino Chico Cardroom Scott.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Just one.  Those are noted for the record.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Item 2.3.  Side letter agreement between the City of Chico and the Chico Police Officers Association.  I don't believe we have anyone here.  I don't believe we have anyone here to report.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  What this is is a continuation of an MOU we set a little over a year ago when I was first sworn into council,  giving signing bonuses of $40,000 and employee referral bonuses of $1,500 for new recruits in the Police Officers Association.  Since then, we passed a sales tax, and the only ongoing expenses that we have out of that was a 20% pay raise that we gave last summer.  I think that this...  MOU is part of the creative solutions we are exploring to trying to, like, address a lack of applicants to open positions.  And since we went the much simpler but more effective route of giving a 20% pay raise,  I think we should reconsider giving the sign-in bonuses or at least the employee referral bonuses.  All right.  Questions or comments from staff?  To staff.  Hi, everyone.  Chief, what do you think?  First off, I'd like to say thank you for the contract that was approved.  I think that that has made a tremendous impact on our ability to both recruit and retain.  This side letter, what I feel this does for us is allows us to still get those lateral officers that we need.  Thank you.  I think the problem that we have is that we, as we grow back, what we've been able to recruit is brand-new police officers.  And we're trying our best now to kind of balance out the organization in terms of experience.  And in order to do that, we have to bring in laterals.  And so, yeah, the contract did have a significant pay raise in it.  But when you start talking about taking people away from their seniority, moving them from another area of the state,  potentially, you know, you're not going to be able to get them back.  But when you start talking about taking people away from their seniority, moving them from another area of the state,  potentially, you know, you're not going to be able to get them back.  But I think that essentially there has to be a little more of an incentive.  And I think that this incentive will help bring those laterals to help balance out the organization.  So I support this and worked with Director Phoebus to get this to council.  All right.  Further questions or comments?  Yeah, one.  Chief, have we had any laterals since this was approved?  Since this, this being the MOU, which was in December of 2019?  2022.  So since December of 2022, we've had, you catch me off guard here now.  How many total laterals?  I think it was three.  Those were all after the, in last was June or July, we approved the 20% pay increase.  All those hires were after that.  Correct.  Did anybody cite specifically the, you know, $40,000 bonus being the reason that they moved to Chico for the job?  I can't speak intelligently to that.  So I don't know specifically.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yep.  Is that because they just weren't asked?  They don't normally tell me exactly those details.  I get it.  The recruiting team knows all about it.  That's why I'm trying to get to you.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Mr. Bennett.  I firmly, is this working?  It is. .             Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  until such time as the chief of police advises us  that perhaps it's time to reconsider this  rather than us making a decision  that we maybe are not qualified to make.  So that's my strong feeling.  All right, further comment, entertain a motion.  Yeah, I respectfully disagree.  I think that it is our obligation  to maintain some kind of balance  and that's not what I'm seeing through this.  And especially with the situation  where we're not sure that Measure H,  which we paid for the effective pay increase,  we're not sure that that's going to survive  the next election.  And so we're making kind of contingency plans  and I think we need to be more responsible about our pay.  So that's why I pulled this and thanks for listening.  All right, entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds,  second from Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right, moving on to public comment.  Members of the public may address the council  at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda  within the jurisdiction's authority.  The council cannot take any action at this meeting  on requests made under this section of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have six.  All right, three minutes.  Okay, I'll call the first.  Two names, and if you could line up in the middle aisle.  Stephen Hazel, followed by Yamo Hakla.  Okay.  Stephen Hazel, resident of Jarvis Gardens.  That's a true gardener.  Not the gardener beat.  That's a total fraud.  You tell me what happened in the gardener.  Is it the echoing of all the sin and all the cancers?  No.  It's the devil, yeah.  We're living right now.  Like he's born a baby, born a man.  We're both here.  Every's here.  God, the devil, and you.  You're extras.  You're pawns in something.  Who's the other guy?  What?  Let's say 2-6.  What's the count up?  The 26th.  31st anniversary of Tower World getting hit.  What's the count up?  2-6. . . . . .  2-6. . . . . . .  Your birthday defines you.  He's 6'12".  He's 6'6".  He's the 44th president.  You missed it.  April Fool's.  And his son, like the little scorpion, worse than his other one, beats him.  3'6", can't handle a poker.  4'6".  Again, sir, yeah, keep your comments relative to the city of Chico.  It is.  It's effective.  You take it off.  To defend the Constitution.  Sir.  What happened on 9-11?  It isn't.  Sir, we're not here to discuss 9-11.  We're here to discuss the city of Chico.  Keep your comments relative.  You take it off.  To defend the Constitution.  All right, sir.  All enemies foreign and domestic.  You're disrupting our meeting at this point.  No, no, I'm not disrupting the meeting.  And we're going to have to ask you to stop speaking.  Thank you.  All I'm saying is 46 minutes, 46 seconds.  George H.W.  All right.  George H.W.  No, no.  Thank you, sir.  Your mic's been halted.  Thank you very much for your comments.  We have a duty to.  We do not.  We have a duty to discuss city business.  Thank you.  All right.  To defend the Constitution.  From enemies foreign and domestic.  It doesn't matter.  Sir.  We're going to have to ask you to be removed from the meeting if you continue.  Thank you very much for your comments.  All right.  We're going to take a short recess.  Thank you.  Well, I'd like to speak.  All right.  Not that I need to say this, but this meeting is for discussing items relative to the city  of Chico directly.  So can you please keep public comments that way?  We'd appreciate it.  Moving on to our next speaker.  Okay.  So Yama Hakwa followed by Rita Smith.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How's it going? I like to be supportive of.  People that come for me, so I just want to say that the lizard overlords are longest, the feminazi sequence and all that. You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no, you don't want me to talk about it's about the purview of the city. You guys have some very special, unique rules to your city council that other city councils don't have.  Which is your rules on the purview and I want to talk about how it actually affects people within your purview.  An example, you know, what are we planning on doing when all the McDonald's on East Avenue.  McDonald's on Notre Dame and Starbucks and Foot Locker and Nike and all these companies get shut down and we lose all these jobs.  And all that tax money that goes to you guys all of a sudden dries up and you have a whole bunch more homeless people, right?  Because there's a huge global protest going on about what this country is doing.  That's what that means. All of a sudden it matters, right?  Well, hundreds of jobs, all that tax money come in, all of a sudden it's within your purview what happens outside.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of Chico, right?  You know, you got like 20,000 people that move here from paradise and increased your tax revenue like incredibly.  And you've squandered it on stupid things like ice rinks where people sleep out in the cold freezing out here.  And that's within your purview, making the statements about paradise because you're sure grateful for all that money that's coming.  But when it's a 16 year old little Palestinian girl trying to talk to you about her family not being able to  even make a phone call or talk to them on their internet because they're under complete isolation.  All of a sudden that's not within your purview when you're talking about your citizens that happen to be brown, Palestinian, Muslims.  You have people that are Pakistani Indian in here telling you the racism that they're experiencing out here.  And you didn't have time for it.  You shut it down.  It was like a real disgrace.  It was like shameful.  Lots of that happened because the only people we have to discuss this about is the congressman.  And he does not care.  And a statesman that does not care.  And you're our last line of defense.  And what you're telling the Muslim Arab people of your citizenry is that you're not here and you don't care.  And it's not within your purview to care about what affects them.  But if it's the gasoline prices, you know what I mean?  If it's the economy imploding and all that state and federal money that stops coming to you because the United States is pulling us into World War III,  all of a sudden that's all within your purview.  So.  You got 20 different city councils that have said that the ceasefire in Gaza is within their purview within the United States,  including Davis, San Francisco, Richmond, and Oakland.  So you're on a unique scenario where you don't have to represent your own people with your silly little rules and you need to repeal them.  All right.  That's time.  Thank you.  Rita Smith followed by Jessica Giannola.  Hi there.  I'm Rita Smith.  I've lived here for 30 years.  I graduated from Chico State.  My daughter graduated from Chico State.  And I love this town.  And the two other times I've been here speaking about other things, I always say that because it's true.  And I know you guys do too.  You want to do your job.  I mean, it's not like it's a whole heck of a lot of fun up there.  Anyway, I have two main points I want to make tonight.  And in no way do I want to sound like I'm putting down our town because, as I said, I love it and I do.  So.  But our city.  Our city has been through a lot.  The people have been through a lot.  And our city is looking tired.  It's looking neglected.  Just the city as a whole as you drive around here and there.  Building.  There's empty buildings everywhere.  Empty little complexes.  Empty big complexes.  There are areas where the property is not being kept up.  And I know big money owns that somewhere.  They need to be keeping it up whether it's occupied or not.  And then there's places that are occupied.  And are not being kept up.  And there's weeds like everywhere.  Like you're driving all over town.  There's weeds coming up in the parkways that might be city, might not be.  I don't know whose responsibility it is.  But it makes the town look awful.  And it looks like we don't care.  And I know we do.  And so it needs to be addressed.  People need to be held accountable.  Whomever it is.  Outside money.  Inside money.  They come here.  Our wonderful city.  The way it is.  It's uniqueness.  It's wonderful points.  And in many cases I feel like we're being milked for all we can.  And then it's like ha ha.  And then we're left with this derelict tired town.  Buildings are unkept.  The overall city just isn't looking very shiny.  And it just doesn't appear to be.  Any accountability.  Everybody's being milked dry.  While other people laugh on the way to the bank.  Our downtown.  There's a lot of vacant buildings down there.  I think there needs to be some kind of code or something.  Where vacant buildings need to be looked or held in state kind.  In a certain way so it looks like respectable.  Not like run down.  And because I know buildings are going to be vacant.  Be remodeled.  But at least have them look presentable.  While they're getting their makeover.  Inside, outside, whatever.  Overflowing trash is a lot I see downtown.  Let's see.  And then we come to college town.  And I know Chico State.  Oh god.  Ten seconds.  Chico State is saying their enrollment is down.  All around college town.  It's messy.  The alleys.  The yards.  Everything.  I wouldn't want my kids to go here.  I'm going to go to college town.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola followed by Ann Harrison.  Hi, council.  I wanted to kind of address the affordable housing terminology.  That is confusing for the public at large.  We have a lot of housing that's going up now.  Which we need.  It's critical.  And what I see advertised is affordable housing.  Which is also critical.  And I think the affordable housing and affordability.  How they differ.  Because affordable housing in the terminology.  Is based on the area of median income.  And ours is I think around 66,000.  So someone would have to make around 5,000 a month.  To afford the affordable housing.  And for affordability.  Your housing and utilities.  Need to cost less than 30% of your income.  For people on the SSI.  That's around $300 a month.  For a senior.  For a single wage family.  That's around $500 to $800 a month.  And we don't have those units.  My daughter.  She just lost her house in this storm.  The tree fell on their single wife.  That's all they could afford.  But there's going to be six of them in the summer time.  She's pregnant.  So they're going to have four kids.  And they're in a motel six right now.  Because they can't afford to get into Chico housing.  They make $75 too much.  And they're going to have to pay for it.  For the 50% AMI.  In the low income housing here.  There is not enough housing.  Because we just don't have it.  It's two to five years wait.  For their turn to come up.  And if we.  And you don't make housing.  I know that.  This city doesn't make housing.  But you can advocate with Gallagher.  And LaMalfa.  And above.  For how do we increase the income based properties.  For the community we serve.  A fifth of Chico.  Makes below the poverty line.  Below.  So one out of five people.  This is impacting.  That's a lot of our residents here.  That's a lot of our children.  That's a lot of our people working at the wall.  And servicing you at Dutch Brothers.  Those folks are below poverty.  And that's the housing need to increase.  So I'm just encouraging you.  To take those steps.  To use your voice.  Your platform.  And to support here.  I just want to acknowledge.  Recently.  There was somebody I met.  While working at safe space.  Who was set on fire for being homeless.  And previous to that.  A person I knew.  Jason.  Died on the streets.  I also met him while working at safe space.  I became heavily involved with advocacy.  And talking to you guys.  Because of the people I met at safe space.  And I was scared the first night.  I was scared.  I was afraid of all of the rumors.  That were said.  And how I was going to be hurt.  But I learned by talking to them.  Their stories.  And how to fight for them.  Which is fine for us.  Thank you.  Ann Harrison.  Followed by IOS Savage.  I'm here once again.  Because time and time again.  You have tried to shut down the voices.  Of certain members of our community.  Saying their concerns are not within your purview.  I've put together another list.  Of some items which are absolutely within your purview.  You can publicly address concerns of Islamophobia.  Within the community.  And share a plan to take action.  You can establish a way to report incidents.  Of Islamophobia anonymously.  So there may be data generated on the serious issue.  Without putting the burden.  On an already marginalized group.  To engage with police.  You can speak with educational leaders.  And publicize a plan of support.  For students in our community.  Who are affected by the ongoing genocide.  This can include increased mental health support.  As well as plans of action.  By school administrations.  To address racially motivated bullying.  You can show support for community based organizations.  Who are trying to help those affected by the genocide.  And all other causes of oppression.  Continually targeting organizations.  Who are trying to help the unhoused.  Like Safe Space.  Makes all oppressed people less safe here.  You can publicize health and mental health resources.  Which are available to people in this community.  And share a plan to increase their access.  Our community deserves the opportunity.  To take care of ourselves.  During this difficult time.  You can make a statement in solidarity.  With the local Arab community.  You keep talking about what is within your purview.  And what is not.  But it is not within your purview.  To decide how to interpret democracy.  When it is in opposition to the way.  So many other cities in this country have done it.  Including San Francisco, Richmond, Oakland and Davis.  And I want to say.  I would once again like to present a copy of our ceasefire resolution.  Thank you.  And our last speaker is Io Savage.  Hello.  Okay.  So we are a people.  We are a community.  A town.  A college town no less.  With an estate in the United States.  And last I checked.  The people are not the same.  The people not the council are the voices.  And they are supposed to be amplified.  By the servants that sit on the council.  Which are you guys.  Let me repeat.  The servants elected.  Are to amplify the voices of the citizens.  Within the city.  For many months now.  We have seen countless people die.  Starve.  Freeze.  Lose loved ones.  Worsen mental health.  Worsening mental health within our community.  And we are in this time Chico.  Is falling behind.  Falling behind and taking a stand.  To make a statement.  To protect one of our most vulnerable community members right now.  Our Palestinian Arab and Muslim community members.  So much.  So much so.  Some of our.  Some of our community members.  Do not feel safe.  Nor heard.  Talking to you guys today.  We are asking you to add a ceasefire resolution.  To the city.  To your agenda.  So that we can have an open dialogue.  Of how this could.  Positively.  Help some of our community members.  To be seen.  Heard.  And feel safer.  As we have seen multiple hate crimes.  And murders within our own country transpired.  Let's have it be known.  That we will not tolerate it here.  Let's show the greater public.  That we believe in humanity.  And believe in life.  And we stand for.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  This.  from our esteemed Chief of Police, Billy Aldridge.  Welcome, Chief.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor,  members of City Council and city staff.  I am sitting in or standing in tonight  for the Human Resources Director, as she's unavailable.  I came to you tonight with a request  to enter into a contract with a new animal services manager.  Her name is Gina Catalo-Cocoletzos.  She's been with the Animal Services Division  for over 10 years and has been a very productive member  and, in my opinion, worthy of the position.  I come tonight to ask that you approve  the city manager's proposal in entering  into an employment agreement  with Gina Catalo-Cocoletzos.  As the animal services manager  and the city manager is proposing to appoint  Gina Catalo-Cocoletzos with an annual salary of $104,000.  I'm sorry, what was her name?  No, no, just go ahead.  And 40 cents.  And that's all I have for you, if you have any questions.  All right, questions for the Chief?  All right.  Thank you very much.  Public comment?  None.  All right. Discussion?  Any discussion?  I'll entertain a motion.  Move to approve as long as that's a period  at the 8b4.40, and we're not giving her a million for that.  Yeah, it looks like a comma.  It's 104 million, no, no.  But anyways, move to approve.  All right, we have a motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds,  second from Council Member Tandon.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Number 6, reports and communications.  The following reports and communication items are provided for the Council's information.  No action can be taken on these items under this section unless the Council agrees to  include it on a subsequent agenda.  6.1, City Manager's Report.  No report.  City Manager, no report.  6.2 are available on the record for financial and information only.  6.3, Council Member Request Pursuant to AP&P 1010.  Council Members may verbally request that item to be agendized at a future meeting after  stating what the item would be of the majority vote of the Council as needed for staff to  agendize.  Do we have any Council Member requests?  All right.  Seeing none, we will adjourn back into closed session.  Thank you for being at one of the shortest meetings ever.  Thank you.  Thank you.
