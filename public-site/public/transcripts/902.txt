 Chris? [inaudible]  I don't know.  Thank you.  Are you ready to go?  Do we have a go-ahead, a green light to start?  Scott is on.  Ann was very clear, so let's go.  He can hear us, Council Member Huber.  Okay.  We are reconvening from our closed session.  And...  And we will start with the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.  Please rise and join me in the pledge.  Salute and pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Madam Clerk, will you please call the roll?  Thank you.  Council Member Huber.  I know he can hear, so I'm going to check him as present.  Council Member Morgan.  Here.  Council Member Ory.  Here.  Council Member Reynolds.  Here.  Council Member Stone.  Here.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Here.  Mayor Schwab.  Here.  So tonight we have a special agenda, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic,  the public shall have an opportunity to address the council  by email and or engage Chico on any item described in the agenda  before or during consideration of that item.  As per Government Code 54954.3, Item A,  the City Council is prohibited by law from considering any other business  at this meeting.  This meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order  in 2920.  As such, Council Member Huber is attending remotely.  The public may view the meeting live on Comcast Channel 11 or by streaming video via the City's  website, Minutes and Agendas, View Meetings Online.  Public participation during the meeting.  The Chico Civic Engagement Program will be available for citizen input on individual  agenda items.  Both prior and post-agenda.  The public will be able to access the public comments that have been made  prior to and during the meeting.  Additionally, public comment will also be accepted by email via publiccomments  at chicoc.gov during the meeting prior to the close of public comment on an item.  We certainly want to hear from the public on items that we are discussing.  Before we make our decisions, it's important to us, we are working through some  technicalities to see how we can further open the meetings to the public.  As you could see tonight, those can be challenging, but we are continuing to explore all those  possibilities so that until we're able to engage more people in person, we will continue  to find ways that we can engage with you electronically.  Item 2.1 is the Sewer Debt Request.  This is a refinancing presentation.  A report from Scott Dowell, Administrative Services Director.  This is an item for information only and no counsel action is required from this item.  Good evening everyone and I've got good news.  We actually have an opportunity to save some money by refinancing.  Don't we have some good news?  And so I want to present that we have an opportunity here to refinance some of our debt and other  debt issues.  We have a new loan that was issued in 2008 that is held in our sewer fund.  And so we want to give you a brief presentation tonight, kind of letting you know and if everyone's  okay with the agreement, we want to go forward with that.  But we want to let you be aware of this and if you've got any questions or concerns, we'll  address that.  So we do have a presentation virtually from Mark Northcross, who's from NHA Advisors.  They counseled us about three years ago when we did our refinancing with the NHA Advisors.  And so we're going to give you a brief presentation of the RDA Successor Balls.  So with that, we're going to try to switch over to Mark and he's got a presentation for  us and he's got copies of the PowerPoint.  But Mark, are you good to go?  He is muted.  Can you unmute your...  Mark?  Can you hear me now?  Yes, we can.  Excellent.  Okay.  And is my PowerPoint up on the screen?  Mark, hold on a second.  Can you turn up your volume at all?  I can turn up my volume.  How's that sound?  I can also talk louder.  You can also talk louder.  Or I will give the presentation tonight.  Maybe we should just put this off.  No, we're not.  We're not.  We're not.  We're not.  So...  That's the best thing they can do.  Is that acceptable or not acceptable?  We can't...  Unless they can hold that microphone up to wherever he's going into the booth.  So there's no action required by council.  I can tell you in 30 seconds.  We've got...  Okay.  We basically want to go out for a refinancing of the bonds.  It would save us $90,000 to $120,000 a year.  And Mark is going to go through a lot of the details on that.  But from the finance perspective, as finance director, I don't see any downside to doing this going forward.  The rate we looked at doing this back in March, before this COVID-19 thing hit, and then it changed the bond rates accordingly.  Now Mark reached out to us and said, hey, this is an opportunity again to do this.  And so we're reaching out to do that.  It'll probably take about two to three months to complete the process from that aspect.  And we would result in those savings.  Tonight was an informational-only item.  And we were trying to use the technology as well, but obviously we've got some hurdles to go through.  From that standpoint...  From that standpoint, all I need is just kind of, if there's no...  I'm seeing some positives or answering questions that you might have.  Okay.  Over about $25,000, why do we have to pay that amount?  That's quite a substantial fee.  Right.  Right.  Do we have a good credit rating?  We do, but it's...  Mark, I don't know if you've heard that question or not.  He would have...  The question, if the council member can hear me, you have a good credit rating, but it's not on your sewer fund.  And the state revolving fund does their financings without a rating from Standard & Poor's.  They, and for the record, SRF does not do refis.  It's all about new money.  Building new projects.  So to refinance the SRF loan, you need to get a credit rating on the sewer fund.  And Standard & Poor's does not work on a contingent basis.  So this is the unavoidable risk associated with going ahead with this particular idea.  Can you repeat that, Scott?  Sure.  So Standard...  So the sewer fund does not have a credit rate as the overall city...  Yes.  So this is not a refinance...  I'm calling it a refinance because in layman's terms, that's what makes sense to me.  And what we have to do is go back and basically reissue this debt.  And as such, Standard & Poor's requires a credit rating on the sewer fund itself, which is an enterprise fund of the city.  Separate enterprise.  So as such, we're required to pay that fee.  And how soon would we recoup the $25,000 fee with the new interest rates?  It would be part of that refunding.  It would be pulled out of that refund.  So it would all be taken care of right there at that point.  So it's like a refinance fee that's pulled out of the proceeds.  Okay.  Okay.  Other questions from council?  Does Council Member Huber have any questions?  No, he doesn't have any.  I believe we received some...  Other comment on that?  What are numbers of people that commented on Engage Chico?  We had two of those.  Two.  And did we have any emails, Mrs. Cooley?  No.  Okay.  So let's just take a quick half minute and look at those comments before we move on.  I don't think I have any more comments.  I don't think I have any more comments.  I don't think I have any more comments.  Seeing none, we will move to the next item on the agenda.  2.2, update on proposed Carmichael low-barrier emergency shelter.  Report from Mark Baum, city manager.  Yes, Honorable Mayor, members of the council, thank you very much.  I'm going to actually have Mr. Morrow come up, our homeless solutions coordinator, and give the update.  But I just wanted to do a little intro on that.  I want to just compliment Joy for the immense amount of effort she's put into coordinating and collaborating with our partners in the community.  One of those things that is clearing fruit is this project that she's going to highlight tonight for others as well, that she continues to work diligently on.  And I think one of the preeminent concerns that we hear vocally and continually is we need to get folks out of the parks.  Yes.  And into shelter.  And this is definitely an entree to getting us there, an opportunity to be able to help us get people into shelter that's respectful and that allows for us to be able to treat folks away with compassion in order to gain the services that they need and to not continue to have them in the parks which weren't built for camping.  So with that, Joy, I'd ask that you come up and kind of just give some highlights because I think that it's important as we work on these things.  Yes.  Yes.  And I'd like to bring them back so that the council and the public know what's going on.  So with that.  Yeah, you want to flip it on?  Thank you for having me.  So as you know, with the pandemic, the city's COVID crisis response system is in need for additional emergency shelter deaths.  And it's imperative to protect our most vulnerable population as COVID-19.  Okay.  Okay.  slated to potentially end on May 31st.  Cal DPS did ask for an extension,  but to date we don't know that that will be granted.  So potentially, come May 31st,  we could have 150 unsheltered individuals  back on the streets.  And so working to do our due diligence,  I have been working with two shelter providers  that have secured funding for specifically  for emergency shelter services.  And so what we're proposing is a short-term  collaborative model for emergency shelter,  and all the details are still being worked out to date.  And so I can't really speak further,  but it is identified at this Carmichael site,  as well as potentially having the capacity  to serve 169 individuals  experiencing  homelessness,  respecting all of the CDC guidelines.  They're saying they can't hear what she's saying.  I think that's important.  So the public can hear?  I have text saying everything is super durable  and appropriate.  I think you sound amazing.  Yeah, let's take just a few minute break  to see if we can iron out these technical difficulties.  Thank you.  Okay.  I think we have a couple more questions.  I asked for a question for that.  No, we couldn't mark this one.  So I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Who can they hear and who can they not?  The thing was horrible,  so I was hoping it was not disconnected,  it got better,  but then I was still getting texts saying it was echoing,  revering.  So I said when you were talking,  you were speaking,  I said can you understand what he said to you?  No, no, no, no.  Looking particularly glossy in the glow or something?  Yeah.  I did wipe it down with a stale light,  so yeah, maybe.  Got a little grime off.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Can you hear me right now?  No.  Can you hear me?  Can you hear this one?  You made me laugh.  So the Carmichael site as proposed is part of the crisis response system of COVID.  And so we are tasked with having to transition approximately 150 people out of project room key, which is slated to end on May 31st.  There is a lot of work to be done.  There is a potential for it to be extended past that deadline.  Cal OES has asked for an extension.  However, we have not heard back from FEMA regarding that extension.  So at this point in time, I have been working with two nonprofit service providers that have come forth with secured operating funds to operate a five-month temporary emergency shelter.  An effort to try to mitigate these 150 people to exit to the streets.  And so details are still being worked out between the two providers.  And more information will be brought forth to the city in the coming days.  I have a question.  So can you repeat how many people are in the project room key?  And what the capacity for this proposed site is?  So there's approximately 150.  I don't have the exact number.  As of last Monday, there was not yesterday, but a week before, there was 147 individuals.  And the capacity of the new facility is 169.  And that's allowing for following all CDC congregate shelter guidelines and best practices.  So there would be room for everyone exiting Project Room Key plus maybe another 10 to 20 individuals?  Yes.  However, also knowing that individuals are being identified to exit into the tourist shelter, so there will actually be more available space.  I would say, we did the math, about 50.  Okay.  So we have open beds, available beds following the CDC guidelines.  Without the CDC guidelines in place, it would be approximately 300 individuals that could hold.  Would having those extra bed spaces allow for people who are currently camping in our parks and greenways to be in shelter?  Absolutely.  As well as the availability to provide safe parking for individuals that are seeking shelter and vehicles.  Okay.  And the service providers are doing more than just opening up the doors, finding facilities for people, beds.  What other kinds of services would be provided at this site?  The full gamut of wraparound services, it's all housing focused to where you identify housing barriers in order to mitigate those.  For instance, credit and or, you know, the housing barriers.  So they're three times the income.  You look at all the different factors of what's prohibiting them from taking housing on their own.  And then working with other collaborative partners in different models for shared housing, obviously with the full intent to get them into permanent housing.  And when might we expect this to open?  Like I said, the details are still being worked out.  I would assume as quickly as possible.  There's a ramp up period in terms of hiring staff, training staff.  It would be, you know, modeled similarly like the Torres Community Shelter.  So they have been in conversation with using their model and operations as like a training ground for new hires.  And streamlining all sorts of services.  Are there other questions for Melissa?  I just have a quick question.  Is there a reason why the service providers are not to be named at this time?  I think it's just out of respect.  I'm the facilitator.  And as they bring the project forward, they would be able to speak for themselves.  And candidly, I think to help Joy with that one as well, we anticipate receiving the formal request or I wouldn't even call it a request.  The formal notice of moving forward.  In the coming days.  Very soon.  I think more that kind of pressed us to getting this out with an update to Council is the fact that you have a lot of your constituents continuing to ask what is going on.  What is going on?  What is going on?  It's important that we share a lot of the behind the scenes work that's going on.  Unfortunately, a lot of the details are still being worked out.  But we needed to get it in front of you to ensure that you're aware and the public's aware.  There's a tremendous amount going on.  And this is one of the most opportune sites that has been presented so far as a potential project.  So we're really excited about it.  And one of the other things that probably people are wondering is what is the Carmichael project?  It's at 2445 Carmichael.  So for those who are interested in knowing where that site is, it's right adjacent to the yard for all the buses for the school district there.  And so I hope that that helps people kind of understand where that's located at.  So my understanding is that at this time, the city will have no other than Ms. Amaro's coordinating of bringing people together.  And we're not asking for the city to sign the lease or take on any liability or anything like that.  It's just we're helping facilitate it come to fruition.  And two, it is a temporary lease.  And you said about five months.  And then is there a potential extension?  Or have they maybe talked about an extension in case?  And would that even be possible?  Just wondering on a temporary basis.  Absolutely.  Up to a seven-month extension.  So it could potentially be there for one year.  Obviously, that is also contingent on funding.  And I'll tell you, just to tag on to that as well, I think that's why it's permanently important that staff continues to work on the long-term vision,  which Ms. Amaro continues to do in having that larger scope because we can't be relying upon temporary Band-Aids.  We need to continue to be looking at the visionary aspects of how can we shelter people long-term, longer-term, getting them the support services to get them on their feet and back into a life that is beneficial to them and the community.  And I think that that's where our objectives lie.  It's not just in these simple Band-Aids.  But this is a definite good sign of things to come if we're able to coordinate and help work with these service providers to even get to this point has been outstanding.  And we really need to see this benchmark be met.  And we're just about there.  So we wanted to make sure and share that.  I have one additional question.  If the funding is not extended by FEMA for Project Roomkey, are there any funds available?  Have you been discussing fund availability perhaps with the county or the COC to pay for the Project Roomkey until this Carmichael location can open?  The GAP funding, yes.  I've been in touch with Don Taylor.  I actually met last Friday regarding the whole scenario.  What if this, then that.  And so how we can mitigate those impacts.  As well as working with True North and then towards community shelters as well as Safe Space as they're running several of the motels.  And specific questions are who identify clients that are not in the community?  And how can we identify clients that can lease up on their own?  Identify clients that have income working with, you know, Marie Demers for T-BRA for those that can lease up on their own.  Looking at all of those variables so that we can actually have individuals secure housing on their own prior to exits.  And as of the numbers that were reported out last Friday were that there was 25 so far that have secured housing.  And so that just makes the scenario a lot better.  As well as identifying those individuals that are able to go into the tourist community shelter.  Their census will only can go as high as 120 in order to keep those social distancing practices.  And so seeing, you know, everyone has their own path.  And figuring out that path as soon as possible.  The county is hopeful that FEMA will extend.  But again, we don't know and we can't wait.  We just have to wait.  We have to and not be reactive.  We need to be proactive.  Mr. Huber, did you have any questions?  Council Member Huber, do you have any questions?  No, I don't.  Thank you.  We're not to take any action on this item.  But we did receive comments.  How many did we receive through the Chico Civic Engagement Platform?  We received 16.  And those individuals were Andy Wilhoy, Carissa Casey, Pamela Copping, Susan Smead, Yvonne Johnson, Lisa Athanos, Jacqueline Glover, Julie Three, Rich Burton, Jules Brown, Peggy Gerolin, Carolyn Arpee, Nicole Nava, Rob Berry, Juanita Sumner, and Claudette Ritter.  And then we did receive two additional ones through the public comment section.  And that's Mike Zico and Michelle Burton.  Thank you.  We did have a downtime when the technical difficulties were being sorted through.  Did anybody take that opportunity to read the comments?  Did anybody need additional time?  No.  No.  Okay.  Seeing none, we will go to...  He's fine.  He's fine.  Okay.  Seeing...  I was curious about just related...the 150 that were in the turnkey program, did that get capped off by lack of money?  Or was that about the right measure of eligible people?  Health and safety.  Health and safety.  That's right.  That primarily has held because of capacity levels at motels that are willing to participate  in the program as well as service provider capacity of who can handle and case-manage  clients and not putting people into motels and ultimately setting them up for failure.  So it's a two-fold thing.  And as available rooms come available, new people are placed in the program.  But again, it's based on those two capacity issues.  Age and disability, is that the criteria or vulnerability, I should say?  Over the age of 65 or 65 and older, as well as there's an outline of criteria for medical issues.  But it's not and, age and, it's or.  So if you're over the age of 65 or have a chronic medical, like, immunosuppressed condition.  Thank you.  Brings up one other question for me.  How much does it cost per day to house 150 people in a hotel room and have their meals?  Well, I actually asked that same question to Don recently, Don Taylor, the program administrator of the home branch.  I don't know that I've seen him through Twitter, Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter  to the motels.  Then there's the  variable is the case management  cost and that  I don't know. It hasn't been broken  down per person.  There could be multiple people  in each hotel room?  There could be. There could be  doubled up. Every  case is different.  Any other questions?  Thank you very much.  Move to item 2.3.  True North Housing Alliance  request for waiver of permit  fees at the Torres shelter  and report from Mark Orm,  City Manager. Sure. Honorable Mayor,  Members of the Council, this is one of those  shifting sands types of items  and what we found over the past  number of, a couple of months plus  with COVID-19, shifting  sands are the norm and  various things  shift here and shift  there during this very tumultuous  time of trying to figure out  the best way to move forward on a lot of these  things. With the item that you have  before you, as you'll note, that on May 18th  True North Housing Alliance did request a  fee waiver for all the permits and fees related  to the Torres shelter phase 1  permit and building project.  Before you in the report, you see that  there's a three-pronged recommendation  of consideration for the Council.  I would just assert  that that recommendation is not a  necessary tonight to consider  any of those options.  In these interesting times of  shifting sands, as I  noted, there are a lot of  individuals out there that look at this  through a lens of potential  what could happen to a project  should the City participate and there's a lot of  different legal consequences surrounding  potentially if the City  does participate in helping to support  projects. Well, it just so happens  that so there were no  questions brought about as a result of the !  It's one of those projects that  this Council's really been seeking to see our  service providers support the City by  expanding and allowing for that extra space,  particularly during COVID-19,  where social distancing is so essential.  So with that, we're not asking for any  movement by the City Council tonight on that front  with any of these, but I did want to at least  share with you the genuine  generosity of our community to consistently step  forward that sees a need in order to step forward to see the city.  We're not asking for any  additional help from the City.  So with that, that's the report I wanted to give.  So we have, the  Torrey Shelter has received a donation  that will cover the fees.  So there's really no action,  but we have an opportunity to ask  questions about the project perhaps?  Absolutely.  Prevailing wage? That's what we're talking about here?  That's potentially probably the biggest concern, yes.  In what aspect?  In the  project, if it was a donation of private funds?  Well, if the city were to give funds towards the project,  then the question would arise,  does that then make the entire project  necessarily a prevailing wage project?  But the city is not going to donate at this time?  Correct. So because of the anonymous donor,  I think that that took that question out of play.  Good. So any questions?  Will this add beds?  Or is it just beds?  Or is it just expanding and proving existing?  Yeah, it will eventually add beds.  And one of the things that they need is they need extra space right now  to accommodate just the social distancing requirements.  And in the letter it does note that it will essentially increase the number of beds.  I think that once COVID-19 has passed us,  you will definitely see that come into play  and it will expand the bed capacity.  This is just phase one.  There's more to come, which is pretty exciting.  So for those anonymous donors out there,  I think there's an opportunity for you to take a look at some of these projects.  You've got the Jesus Center doing some amazing work.  You've got the tourist shelter, True North, as they're called now,  doing some amazing work.  There's a lot of folks out there trying to find the right facilities  to help accommodate getting folks out of the parks, off the streets,  and into proper shelter.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  How many comments did we receive for item 2.3 through the engaged Chico?  We received 12, and those were from Denise Ware,  Misha Wallace, Pamela Copping, Carissa Casey,  Yvonne Johnson, Jacqueline Glover, Kimberly Burke,  Casey Croninger, Julie Threatt, Nicole Nava, Rob Berry, and Juanita Sumner.  And two additional ones through the public comments,  and that was Anne Nielsen and David Welch.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  We'll take a couple of minutes to review those comments.  I'm going to hand it over to Patrick Boyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah  Thank you.  Has counsel had enough time to review the comments?  Mr. Huber,  are you,  are you good?  Scott,  are you good?  I apologize.  Council member Huber.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes,  I am.  Thank you.  Very good.  We will move to item 2.4 resolution calling for a general municipal election to be held on November 3rd,  2020 and discussion of potential charter amendments or ballot measures.  This is a report from Debbie Press and city clerk and elections official.  I would ask if council would please bifurcate this issue because one of the potential items for discussion is direction about the farmers market to be put on the ballot.  And I have a conflict of interest for that because I have a leasehold that is within 500 feet of the market.  So ask that council have a discussion about the general election resolution.  And any other items that they may want to have on the general,  um,  on the,  on the election.  Those do not have to be decided tonight,  but a discussion of that.  And then once that discussion is finished,  I'll leave the dais and have any kind of discussion on the farmers market.  But the item in front of us is consolidating the election.  That's the only thing that's on.  Yes,  it is.  But there,  uh,  in the report,  there is,  uh,  information about the farmers market.  And that might be something that the council wishes to talk on.  Correct.  We're asking for direction.  Yes.  Regarding potential measures.  So thank you,  mayor Schwab and council.  You've received my staff staff report outlining the need to adopt a resolution to call for a general municipal election to be held November 3rd,  2020 for the purpose of electing four members representing the districts one,  three,  five,  and seven.  To serve on the city council as the council will recall,  um,  on February 10th,  2020 ordinance number 2547 was adopted,  which was the final action needed to officially transition to,  um,  district elections commencing this November 3rd adoption of the resolution that it was included in your packet.  We'll ask the county to consider consolidating the city of Chico's election in with the statewide election already being conducted by the county.  During the process to transition to district elections,  interest was expressed in considering potential charter amendments related to the recent change to district elections,  as well as to possibly rank choice voting.  Since ballot measures can be considered up until mid July,  council's being asked at this meeting to discuss potential measures that the body might be interested in and provide direction to staff to prepare the necessary documents needed for formal action.  It should be noted that a ballot measure,  regarding the Chico certified farmers market will need to be prepared as it's part of the actual initiative that the council adopted in the 2014 initiative process.  I also wanted to let you know that I spoke with,  um,  Candace Grubbs,  the county elections official,  um,  this morning on several items.  So the first one was the county has finalized moving all of the addresses into each district,  um,  so that they can develop their voter information.  Uh,  those are the seven defined districts that were approved by council in February.  They'll be sending that final map to me for review,  and once that's done,  um,  that will be pivotal in moving forward with the nomination period and having citizens coming in and determining whether or not they actually reside in the district that's being,  you know,  considered for,  um,  up for election.  Secondly,  candy is hopeful that the information needed from lab co finalizing the Chapman Mulberry annexation,  is received prior to the July 1st,  2020 filing deadline.  The county does need some time.  She expressed some concern to update the maps with those new addresses once,  once lav co has finalized that process.  So she's hopeful that that information will come in and I may be reaching out to lab code to see what we can do to help facilitate that,  because we recognize that that Chapman Mulberry,  uh,  annexation was to be considered in this district election coming up for the first one.  In November on the last part of the call,  concerns were expressed,  um,  over the potential change to,  and again,  this was potential change to a voting procedure.  Should the council wish to move towards a ranked choice voting method?  Should that change be made?  The city of Chico may have to consider conducting its own elections.  This county elections official mentioned it would be extremely difficult to conduct two very different processes at the same time.  In the past,  the city of Chico,  the district elections were not consolidated with the rest of the county elections and therefore occurred on their own date in April of even numbered years.  That was quite some time ago,  but they did actually have a standalone election for the city of Chico.  It's not that long ago.  In the standalone election,  the county elections official would then provide the city with all the updated voter files for use,  and it would cause the city to have to purchase all required equipment,  hiring,  requiring staff to help with the election process at the precincts and when tabulating votes,  or it would require the city to search for a firm to conduct the standalone elections.  Costs for standalone elections are much higher since we wouldn't be sharing all of the cost and spreading them out through all the other entities.  I know in the early 2000s,  the council considered using a standalone,  well,  it was actually a special and it had to be a standalone,  and the charter,  it allows for the city to use mailed in ballots.  At the time,  the council thought to check with a firm,  Martin and Chapman,  who was actually known at that time to be doing those types of elections.  The cost estimate came in at around $150,000 for a standalone mail ballot,  and the city opted to go with the county on a mail ballot election that actually ran about 70,000.  So there is an additional cost if we went with an outside firm.  So I just share that with you.  Just she,  Candy Grubbs asked me to share that information with you,  and now I'll turn it over to the council for discussion.  So perhaps the first thing we should act on or consider is the resolution for the general municipal election.  I would move approval of the resolution.  I probably want a public comment.  Sure.  Okay.  Thank you.  Are there any questions first?  Okay.  Okay.  Let's look into the public comment on the resolution.  How many item members of the public contacted us through Engage Chico?  I received four through Engage.  It was Julie Threat, Peggy Gerolin, Nicole Nava, Juanita Sumner,  and then under the public comments,  email David Welch.  Okay.  Let's just take 45 minutes.  Five seconds to review those.  Five seconds to review those.  Five seconds to review those.  Five seconds to review those.  Five seconds to review those.  Five seconds to review those.  Five seconds to review those.  Five seconds to review those. Okay. So we have a motion and a second for the, to move the resolution. Council Member Huber?  yes council member morgan yes council member ori all right council member reynolds i'm sorry i'm  stretched out between my eye it's like a watergate reincarnation uh aye for those that got  vice mayor brown all right and mayor schwab aye carry seven zero so that carries unanimously  um second would be for direction to the city clerk on items other items that the council  may want to have on this ballot exclusive of the farmer's market i would note that the city  clerk says that we would finalize could finalize this as late as the first meeting in july for  inclusion on the board of supervisors agenda the first meeting in august  um  and given the possibility we might have more open discussion as some of the comments said  i would like to have that opportunity to add things all the way up until that july agenda  okay we can certainly do that how much time do you need to prepare  um the wording for about measure well i would  um  probably  ask city attorney jared to respond to that i know that the process  really works with the direction provided and then he develops and writes a ballot summary  and then it starts that process when the council looks at that  um there's some time frames that have to be adhered to in order to meet the elections code  um  yeah i would imagine about a week in order to uh you know  work through all of the issues.  I have a question about the  city of Chico election. If we needed to do  a stand-alone mail ballot, would  members of our community receive two ballots?  One only for the city of Chico issues and then  one for everything else?  Or would it be one ballot? If it was consolidated on, I mean if it  wasn't consolidated but held on the same day, then yes they would  have two different ballots for the same election. However, I think  that there would be more clarity and the  county elections official expressed the desire that it would be on a different date  for all of the city of Chico elections moving  forward from when we instituted a different method.  So people would get two ballots, not necessarily  for the same day, but they would vote for everything that would  be federal, state,  local, supervisory  or assembly on one ballot  and then they'd have this other one for the city of Chico that may  even be the first  Tuesday in October or  whatever. The elections code is specific of when you can call for elections  and so it would be the first of April. If you're not falling  on the statewide or at the national level  which is the presidential election, but  it's specific as to what those dates are, but again  Kenny did express the desire to at least  have it on an off election.  That way people can register for an election so that it's not confusing to the public,  to the citizens. You are absolutely correct that they would  receive the statewide election  ballot.  We're not no longer talking about right of choice which is not even that  that far along. We're also talking about changing the date of the election?  I expressed what the county elections official wanted me to relate to you that  Because obviously the voters would decide whether we went to ranked choice voting.  And should that be chosen, if the council is even interested in that, I just know that it came up.  And that was part of the discussion for tonight's meeting.  So just wanting to let you know what the county elections official provided me with.  So what would, if we decided to go ahead with that question, it would be on the ballot for November.  Correct.  And it would affect elections there on out.  It would first, if it was passed by the voters, it would go into effect and be held that way for the 2022 election.  Okay.  Okay.  I would be curious what other cities that have ranked choice,  whether they're going to go ahead with that or not.  I would be curious whether in their counties, whether or not the county has the same opinion.  I'm just guessing that others that have ranked choice are able to consolidate.  Right.  She did again, and I will check in.  She gave me some examples of counties that unconsolidated cities that were going to that.  Because of the impact on the actual county elections,  with the two different types.  But I'll look for those and I'll reaffirm with her what those were.  I seem to recall Santa.  What was it?  Santa Rosa.  Oh, Santa Rosa.  Where that happened and they had to change how they conducted their elections.  San Francisco famously has gone to ranked choice.  Correct.  And I think Berkeley did as well.  All right.  Are there any other questions or comments on any other ballot measures that we may want to just ask questions on and decide later,  besides the farmer's market?  Well, two before we get into more controversial ones, perhaps.  Sales tax.  I don't know why we're not having sales tax.  That'll be coming back on June 2nd next week.  So you'll have that.  We'll have that in front of you next week.  And the notion that since we have gone to district elections without changing the charter,  I would be in favor of changing the charter to allow to confirm the actions of the council.  I'd be interested in knowing.  If the public voted one way and we have district elections where that puts us.  If the public votes against it.  Democracy is messy.  Yes, it is.  I'm curious.  Because I think we did talk about that when we were discussing district elections.  But that was very hypothetical.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  That is in violation of the California Voting Rights Act.  Oh.  And so the charter, when we were contemplating how to address the CVRA challenge letters that we received,  threatening litigation, the threat of litigation as to a CVRA violation was a certainty.  We would have lost that case.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  challenge to a, what a court would do with a charter amendment or charter violation there  would be less messy. So that's why the council went the route of doing the district elections.  And so it would be recommended to put that on. Essentially the question would be  shall the charter be amended to comply with the California Voting Rights Act?  And with that question, that would be the type of question I would recommend.  Other discussion exclusive of farmers market? I'm supportive of putting the charter amendment  on the ballot. I'm not interested in having conversations about changing election dates  or going to our own.  Elections, but I just want to make that clear.  That will be, those decisions will come to us at a later meeting. Right now it's ideas,  some thoughts and some directions in case there are additional questions that the clerk or city  attorney need to look into. Then I will excuse myself while a discussion is on. Oh, Scott,  did you have any comments?  No I'm through withahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah  kits for that group circulated an initiative and it was turned into the county and it came back  and it she certified it as it was sufficient there were over 5,000 signatures that met that criteria  of being in the city of Chico and elected voters so the council at the time this was in 2014 the  council considered what would they they they had three options they could call for an election they  could actually ask staff to do a financial you know and an analysis of it and bring it back  or they could accept it it's in its entirety and that's what the council chose to do was to accept  it in its entirety and what it did is it set forth some measures it set the terms of the agreement I  don't have it in front of me I apologize and I have too many computers  going to pull it up but so one of them was to you know establish the fee at five thousand dollars  it set forth conditions about the sidewalk usage and additional vendors and that kind of thing and  as well as noting that in the 2020 election a ballot measure would be forwarded in before the  people of our community or the voters to ask them whether or not they wanted to  extend that franchise another eight years and so that would be the measure would only be talking  solely about extending it in its entirety for an additional eight years thank you for the summary  and just for the benefit of the public and the council that's page seven of thirteen on your staff  report if you want to read that in its entirety questions from council  following up following up They all, it was all on the other group. And so if you're okay with that, we would move to start writing that. And so if you're okay with that, we would move to start writing that. Or you could direct the city attorney to write the ballot summary of that item. Or you could direct the city attorney to write the ballot summary of that item. Unless city attorney Jared has additional comments about it. Any additional comments? Yeah, at this point, it would be more than the summary. Yeah, at this point, it would be more than the summary.  more than the summary, I believe, it would be preparing all the documents  for you to approve to then add that on.  I'd be doing a little more work than just preparing a ballot summary.  Any other questions or comments from council?  I'm okay with it. Okay. I'd entertain a motion if there are no  other comments. I so move.  Second.  All right. Can we call the roll?  Council Member Huber? Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ory?  Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. And Mayor Schwab has recused  herself. So it carries 6-0 with one recusal.  And the mayor's back. All right.  Could we  just add  at the next couple council meetings have this open agenda item  to allow us, if we're ready at the next meeting, if somebody makes a motion saying let's put this  on the charter as a charter amendment or let's put this advisory on  without having to re-agendize. Or we could just  wait until the July meeting.  But I'm not ready tonight to add anything.  I don't see, and I see a lot of the  comments that let's wait until we're more open.  But why wait until the last minute?  So is there a mechanism where we could kind of keep this discussion  agendized? Well, I believe  we can just have a placeholder unless the city attorney disagrees.  But I know that the assistant city manager will be bringing you back  the sales tax potential ballot measure at the very next  meeting. We could have an item following that for an update on any  potential.  I don't think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  I think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  I don't think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  I don't think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  I don't think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  I don't think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  I don't think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  I don't think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  I don't think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  I don't think that's an issue that's going to be brought up through that way.  charter amendment to move to district elections. We're saying we're  out of compliance. So it sounds like that's  probably something that we're going to need to take action on to bring our charter in compliance  with the Voting Act, correct?  Yes. And so  we had a vote, 601, to  bring back the farmer's market item. I believe there was  discussion, I would call it general consensus  for me to do  the additional work on changing the  charter for the district elections. And the tax item will be coming back  next Tuesday.  I don't know that we could get the change in the  charter for district elections done for next Tuesday,  given the short week.  Do we need to provide additional direction for those items to be drafted and worked on?  It would be much more comfortable, yes.  So in that case, I'd like to make a motion then that we would direct staff to  begin work on updating the charter to  align with the Voters Protection Act  and align with what our actual elections are.  Second. There's a motion and a second  to put a measure  on the ballot that would have our  charter agree with the California Voter Protection Act.  Yeah. Council Member Huber?  You know, I have to say, I did not hear  the conversation well enough to vote on the  vaccine. It was actually  just providing direction to staff to prepare  the charter amendment that would bring our  charter in line with the California Voting Voters  Act.  So it would be just to implement district elections  by updating our charter.  Okay. Sorry. Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Orry?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Thank you. Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Yes. Honorable Mayor, members of the council,  I just can't help but make a note.  I hear a lot and I see a lot of information  that asserts that the city council is trying to  underhandedly bring things, items forward such as this item.  And I just want to make sure it's very clear to the public  and I know it's clear to the council.  This is an item that staff felt was prudent to bring forward  now versus later, just in case there were items that need to be  proceeded to be moved forward.  There's not one council member that I'm aware of that asked for  this information to be brought forward tonight.  Being that the June 2nd meeting next Tuesday is fairly deep,  we felt it was prudent to bring this one forward.  The city clerk and I discussed that.  So I just want to make sure that that's clear to the public  and I know it's clear to the council.  But I just want to make sure that that's clear.  I would move that we continue this discussion  to the next meeting.  Second.  Any discussion or comments?  Seeing none, can you please take the roll call vote?  Council Member Huber?  This is, okay.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Orry?  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  We'll move to item three, reports and communication.  The following reports and communication items  are provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section  unless the council agrees to include it  on a subsequent agenda.  Council member requests, pursuant to APNP 1010,  council members may verbally request an item  to be agendized at a future meeting.  After stating what the item would be,  a majority vote of council is needed in order for staff  to agendize.  Council members may also submit requests in writing.  Discussion on these items, discussion on the request  should be limited to whether the item should  be heard at a future meeting.  We have two written requests, and we  may have some verbal requests.  It would be my suggestion that we hear the written requests  first, and then open up the floor to the other council  members.  Council member Stone, you submitted a request  to agendize the discussion of escalation of attacks  during NVRHC events.  Yeah, and really what I was looking for  was the city manager police chief's report on this.  So rather than an agendized discussion specifically  for action, I asked for some information from staff  early on as this was escalating.  And I didn't receive it.  And so I requested it as an agendized item,  thinking that there was maybe some criminal elements  to it, which is why my reference to if this  has to be a closed session meeting,  and I since learned that that's not the case.  And so I was hoping at the last meeting  that we would at least just get an oral report as  to what was happening to put the community and the council at ease  as to the rising escalation.  Of course, that didn't happen.  I didn't get to the last meeting either.  And I'm still waiting for more information.  So since that time, of course, the state has taken action.  So again, we've run up into this problem of process.  We have a council member that wants to hear  an item of reasonable concern.  And it's a request to agendize.  And this falls on another agenda,  even though we're having meetings every single week.  By the time we hear about this, the state of California  deeply immersed in a public health crisis statewide,  nationwide, worldwide, has the time  to address those concerns that we couldn't get an update from.  So I was hoping for an update from the city manager  and or the police chief as to what we're doing to protect  our community members.  And I'm not sure that that needed a special agenda item  to have any discussion since there wasn't a specific policy  objective there.  So your request is for a report from the city manager,  or police chief?  Yeah, you got it.  Do you want to put that in form of a motion or questions?  I just wanted to make a note that tuning into the Board  of Supervisors meeting today, they engaged on this very topic  with a request that public health,  as an appropriate entity to collaborate on an issue  like this, help identify a more suitable space  for the state-approved activity.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that. So I just wanted to add that to the conversation. But that conversation is taking place at the county level as well. So there's a great recognition that the tensions are rising and that there may be a more suitable.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  evident in our city, in our community, and our staff, I would hope, would be informing us as to  what they're addressing. I think it's the worst place in the world for a council member to start  trying to micromanage what city staff is doing, which is why this was couched with.  I just want to hear from city staff what you're doing. If there was a necessary element  where we needed to take some policy action, I could see the appropriateness to agendize this,  but to date I haven't heard from city staff regarding this issue at all,  and I'm disappointed with that.  So I guess that's a motion to have that discussion sometime.  Sometime?  Well, I think the state is taking some actions in lieu of the safety concern.  Do you want the discussion tonight or at the next meeting?  I would have loved it tonight, but again...  Second.  Okay.  Why are we...  Yeah.  Amen.  So implicit in that is to suspend our rules, correct?  Yes.  Okay. So let's have that motion first and that vote.  I said implicit. I'm not sure really getting a report from a staff member requires a suspension of the rules,  but...  Sure. Move to suspend the rules in order to have a report from the city manager regarding Councilmember Stone's concern.  And I'll second that, and I'll note that again, this is not an agenda item request for policy action.  Councilmembers are requesting a report that is at least a week and a half old from a staff member regarding an incident in our community,  and we're suspending our rules for that.  Second that motion.  Okay. Request to suspend the rules.  We have a vote, please.  Second.  Councilmember Huber, and this is to suspend the rules to hear this item tonight.  Is this a motion, please?  It is a motion to suspend the rules and to take up Councilmember Stone's item to discuss the impacts on the needle exchange program.  It was to...  To get a report tonight.  So the first part of that is to suspend the rules in order to take it up at this meeting.  To get any kind of a staff report regarding the item.  Okay.  Yes.  Thank you.  Councilmember Morgan.  So I'm going to vote yes.  Normally I would say...  I don't know what I'd say.  I don't like to suspend the rules, but I'm saying yes so we can hear a report that isn't prepared and doesn't exist.  So it should be entertaining, but I'll go with yes.  Councilmember Ory.  Yes.  Councilmember Reynolds.  Yes.  Councilmember Stone.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Aye.  Mayor Schwab.  Aye.  Harry 7-0.  May I ask a question?  I guess I do want to put people on the spot.  So we are to understand, Councilmember Stone, you asked specifically for a report from staff and didn't get one?  Correct.  On the 17th and on the 18th.  This item.  This item was requested on the 18th and then we had a council meeting the next night, I think, and I requested an oral report.  We have the idea here.  Okay.  So Councilmember Stone said that he asked for this item on the 17th?  I asked for a report from staff as to, you know, the exact verbiage I don't have immediately in front of me, but I requested information regarding the, quote, the escalation of incidents occurring.  Correct.  Correct.  So he had asked staff.  I believe he sent that email to the city manager, myself, and city attorney, Jared.  I said that I would leave it up to the city attorney because you had also thought perhaps the best place was in closed session and I couldn't address that.  Oh, and let me clarify.  The request to have this agendized, I guess is the way that verbiage was, was not, I left that ambiguous for you and I wasn't expecting you to agendize.  In fact, quite frankly, I'm a little bit surprised.  I'm a little bit surprised to see it on this agenda this way, recognize that that's the way it was asked in the first place.  Well, I think at the last meeting when you mentioned it at the end of the meeting and you had said that you had wanted that item to come forward, I then said to my staff, please make sure that gets agendized.  Understood.  Okay.  Thank you.  I just want to make a quick note.  I'm supportive of having a conversation today.  Okay.  That said, I do believe that NBHRC had prepared an entire report.  I think it was a report that was sent to us by the NBHRC.  Not related to this.  So I'm trying to connect items that aren't related exclusively, but kind of illustrating some things about the location and other issues and concerns that are arising that tie into some of this tension, right?  So I just, I feel a little bit hesitant to engage in a conversation without them present and without that information in front of us.  I'm willing to support it.  But I want to make a note that I would appreciate that report as well, since it's directly tied into what we're talking about.  I'm supportive of it, obviously.  And I just wanted to report what's happening in our community as these incidents are escalating.  And do we have a plan for how to mitigate that?  And so involving NBHRC and others is something I support, particularly if the city manager finds it relevant to include in a report.  So we can take that action.  Casey has a question.  I guess I'm a little confused on staff time on asking for a report on something.  Doesn't usually that come to council and then we direct staff to prepare a report on something?  Or does this fall in that where it's like under an hour and we're allowed to do that?  I don't know.  I'm just curious.  I've never requested a staff report.  I'm just making sure.  I'm with you.  This is entirely uncharted territory.  I've never seen or heard anything like this in any community, recognizing both the incidents as well as the manner in which we're agendizing this report.  I would just add that typically, as you know, Council Member Reynolds, we do get updates when significant incidents occur in our community.  And I would have considered these rising tensions as significant.  I think based on what I'm hearing from the community, there's a lot of fear that it's going to escalate to an increased level of violence.  And that's really scary.  And I would hope that we would be having more conversation about the best way to approach that.  Oh, I absolutely agree with having the conversation.  It was more the question on directing staff and just was more on all items, not just this one.  Thank you.  I just have one comment.  Is that at our last meeting?  At our last meeting, we had a more general discussion of what items that we should be bringing back.  And one of kind of those hanging items, one of which was the report that we asked from the NVHRC.  And Council at that time decided not to hear that report until we could have a more open council meeting.  Just saying.  So we're here now at an open council meeting making any requests to agendas.  No, no, no.  We're here at an open council meeting that there would be people, members of the public here engaging.  That would have been a motion.  I would have supported it.  I think I stated that at the meeting.  I just want to clarify.  Okay.  So, I'm sorry.  Just one comment.  And I know, Mr. Stone, this doesn't answer your question, which equally concerns me if you asked for a report and didn't get one.  The only thing that I have seen public from anyone was from Sergeant Durkin, who was the officer in charge at the last,  following that report that I brought up, following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report that I brought up following that report  be looked at and discussed. I'd be interested to hear if we move forward with a report from  the police department on how they think that should be dealt with. I remember years ago,  never in these council chambers, but I remember years ago, Chico PD every Friday and Saturday  night or Saturday morning and Sunday morning, depending on how you looked at it, lined up  outside a number of downtown Chico bars, five or six police cars deep because of violence  and tension that was occurring every night at these establishments. The then chief and  deputy chief threatened to shut those establishments down as public nuisances. And they never had  to. It never came to council, but it was dealt with probably the way this should be. I'm  not sure I see the difference, but whenever we get any kind of report anywhere, I would  be interested in hearing what you think.  I'm interested to hear from the police department and how they think that should be dealt with  because it's not any different.  I agree with you exactly. That's exactly my concern here is that we're getting reports  of escalated violence. I actually think violence, however you want to define that, ugly words,  whatever it is, we're seeing an increase in activity. Both sides are reporting that. I  think it's fairly, it's pretty well defined that there's an escalating incident of violence  here.  I think it's fairly, it's pretty well defined that there's an escalating incident of violence here.  I think it's fairly, it's pretty well defined that there's an escalating incident of violence here.  All accounts there are reporting that. One group is pointing fingers at another, and I think it's probably important that we have that discussion.  And I've never heard of a community that has an escalation problem like that that isn't being addressed and then either privately to council or staff or publicly, this is what we're doing to address it because it seems to be a growing concern.  And yet it's taken two weeks and another agendized item to discuss it. I hate to put city manager Orm on the spot. I hope this wasn't putting him on the spot.  Since I asked for it some time ago.  So council moved to suspend the rules. There was a motion to hear a report tonight about the needle exchange on Sundays. It was seconded. Can we have a vote, please?  We suspended the rules. We haven't voted to get the report.  Okay, and then that was a motion by council member Stone, seconded by council member Ori to hear the item at this meeting.  So just a second.  I don't see the report.  I think I'd prefer for the city manager to take whatever time he feels necessary with the right people. Unfortunately, that probably pushes it off yet another week.  So the motion is not to hear it tonight?  I made the motion to hear it tonight and to extend it or continue it for however long the city manager would find appropriate.  I think with all, I say this respectfully.  Your point has been made.  Is that what you're trying to say?  Your point has been made and we expect to hear something.  Yes.  Okay, we'll have a vote.  And so I just want to be clear.  If you get the report as a verbal report or in addition, a written report that the city manager often provides, that's in lieu of bringing it to the meeting or is this motion to bring it to a future meeting?  Because that's what we have.  To agendize a discussion of escalation.  Let's have this agendized.  We suspended the rules so we don't have to agendize it for a future meeting, right?  Exactly.  Right.  It's just I think you guys were tabling to allow him to have time.  So I'm confused on what the motion should be.  It depends on whether we're satisfied with the report, I guess.  And I believe that our motion included not just to suspend the rules but to have the report.  I could imagine that the report would be all three minutes.  If they want more time, they'll take more time.  But let's just do it.  All right.  City attorney, would you concur?  On which point?  Just hear an oral report tonight.  Yes, I understood the motion was to suspend the rules and to hear the oral report tonight.  All right.  Can I make a, it wouldn't be a substitute, a friendly amendment?  Well, we don't have a motion on the floor now.  Okay.  So say whatever you want.  As I appear.  Well, I would have asked that if the skipper deemed it so necessary if he would do whatever he was going to say and defer to the deputy police chief who is in attendance, that would be fantastic.  Not to take away from you, skipper.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm happy to talk if you would like me to.  All right.  Please.  It's 15 minutes to talk about talking about it.  And, and, and.  And one of the things that I want to say is that that's the reason why the deputy chief is here, because we anticipated that, you know, you would want to hear an update.  And, and there really isn't a hidden P in this soup.  It is a simple fact that this item was brought to my attention a couple of weeks ago by a number of council members.  And it immediately took hold of my attention.  And I immediately got it off to our chief, our deputy chief and the PD team.  So that they could obviously engage.  And one of the things that I did in follow-up to that was have some follow-up meetings.  And they said that they will be deliberately dialoguing with those involved to help de-escalate the situation.  Because they are the best to know how to do that.  So with that, I'd love to turn it over to deputy chief Madden so he can give an update on where things are at on that front.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening, mayor, vice mayor, council.  I'm a little ill-prepared.  But I do I'm very familiar with the internal goings-on of the organization.  So we were aware two weeks ago we had an incident where officers were called out, responded out to the WindCTOR park.  A police report was taken.  An investigation was conducted.  We've interviewed several people.  Late last week we were aware of some additional potential protests by some groups.  We reached out to those groups.  We met with them.  We talked with them.  These are all relationships that we built as a police organization to just educate people  that this is occurring in a public space and to make sure people know what the rules are.  We did have an incident where we were called back to the exchange Sunday.  We ended up staying there trying to keep the peace.  Right now we have a plan moving forward.  It is a public space.  Our job is to keep the peace and make sure this is a situation that's occurring that's  licensed by the state of California.  We recognize that.  We are going to stay fairly.  We are going to be fair and impartial and enforce the law.  That's our plan.  I do have several meetings later this week.  If you didn't know, just know that the police department, up until the pandemic, was meeting  regularly with Butte County Public Health and North Valley Harm Reduction.  We were providing feedback on some of the things that we were seeing to help them be  more successful with their program.  We're engaged.  There's no question.  It's a great organization.  It's an interesting topic for discussion.  People are all over the place on how they feel about this program.  At the end of the day, the police department will keep the peace.  We'll do our job.  We'll enforce the law fairly.  That's my report.  Do you have anything to add, Mr. Orme?  No.  I just appreciate the city council's interest in this.  One of the things that we can always rely upon is our police department will enforce  the law fairly.  That's one of the things that I always trust in.  Every item that I've brought before them, they have followed up on.  This is another example of that.  Obviously, they're high emotional items, highly emotional items.  They have to be even more sensitive in those kind of responses.  These kind of issues, in conjunction with COVID-19 and a lot of other things going on  in our community right now, I think that it's a very sensitive item that they're very well  aware of.  If that reassurance is enough, then that's good.  I know that that plan of how to better deal with this, I think that Councilmember Stone  focused on the fact that, one, the state of California is looking at, they modified some  rules to allow for some flexibility.  Then the point that Vice Mayor Brown made is that the county is looking at better opportunities  to help engage on it as well.  You have partnerships coalescing now.  You have a police department that's ensuring that they're going to be enforcing the law.  That's about the best that we can get right now.  I wish I had more, but that's where we're at.  Thank you.  Any considerations of separation of groups, particularly due to COVID?  I saw some of the videos over there.  I'll admit they're all pretty grainy.  It's tough to tell what it is that you're looking at in the first place.  The phone's upside down.  You've got to take another look at the video.  It's pretty wild to see what's going on there, but what you can observe, meaning it's difficult  to discern what's going on.  It's hard to tell what's right, what's up and down, and what's wrong.  There's a whole lot of limited mask wearing.  There's a whole lot of greater interaction that's inconsistent with the state.  I know we have protesting regulations that have just come down from the state that are  pretty specific.  This seems to be an area that, again, is a growing hotspot for that type of concern because  they're a permitted activity, whatever our feeling is on that.  I'm wondering if we have the ability to coordinate off sections that allow people the opportunity  to come and go without interacting from a COVID standpoint.  In other words, using the lack of a mask as a threat to somebody who's infirm, walking  up to use that service.  Is there a way that you can make sure that the space is open?  I'm seeing videos, and I'm not going to make a value judgment as to whether these are appropriate  or not or who's on the appropriate side, but there are people with umbrellas in order to  shield some activity.  I'm wondering whether that's something that we've considered or was an option within the  department or what your thoughts are about providing some of the linear safety at that facility.  Yeah, it's an interesting prospect.  One of the things that we're faced with, which makes it quite intriguing, is the fact that  we didn't permit the use.  To manage the use for something that we didn't permit oversteps a boundary line that the  city has.  It's a state authorized use.  But that doesn't absolve us of our responsibility to address the public safety need.  That's why the police department is engaging.  Of course.  And so I don't know if there's any measures of that kind that police department has ever  envisioned doing on a situation like this.  Well, again, the whole site is pretty sensitive, even just for our response, with the idea  of what's occurring there.  So we've been trying to work with all various sides of the issue for North Valley harm reduction  to be successful with what they're trying to accomplish while still maintaining peace  and order.  So it's a public space.  It's one of the issues.  And some of these guidelines are fairly vague on true enforcement by law enforcement.  So we're doing the best we can.  We're reaching out.  We're partnering.  We're educating people so they understand what the rules are.  We're doing the best we can with that.  But again, at the end of the day, this is a city park.  And we're the police department.  And we're going to enforce the laws there.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you, Deputy Chief Madden.  And I think you're touching on a point that we're all floating over, which is this is  a public space.  And this activity would be much better suited for a building.  I think actually all sides pretty much agree with that statement or in a non-public space,  whatever that might look like.  The Board of Supervisors' discussion today was about exploring the potential of doing  it in the public health parking lot, right?  In a space that could be considered a public space.  That could be considered private or a little bit more discreet, right?  And so I don't know if there's ways that we could participate in some of that buzzword  right now, lobbying.  But it seems as though, and I think everybody agrees, that if this were in a building or  in a different type of space, that could be helpful and mediate some of those tensions.  And so I know those discussions are happening.  I'd love for us to be involved in them.  And I think that that could really benefit everybody.  Yeah.  add to that, Vice Mayor, we've had those conversations with North Valley Harm Reduction  and Butte County Public Health, and that was our recommendation as well.  Thank you. All right. Great report.  We did receive comments on this item. Can you tell  us how many people  commented through Engage Chico Civic Engagement? So I  had 33 comments forwarded via  Engage Chico, and I believe we have six.  Yeah. Six through the public comments.  So for the Engaged, it was Chanel Fowler, Carissa Casey,  Macy Doherty, Karen Wilhoyt, Rob Berry,  Yvonne Johnson, Jacqueline Glover, Carolyn Arpey,  Deborah Pitcher, Deborah Jones, Anna  Palos, Julie Threat, Daniel Rodriguez, Kimberly  Burke, Casey Croninger, Steve  Campin, Amy Marie, Peggy  Jeronin, Rich Burton, I can't even read my writing,  Jessica Montgomery, Nicole Nava,  Misa Wallace, Susan Smead, Roxanne Eldridge,  Daniel Moots, David Welch, Julie Brown,  Jessica Giannola, and Nicole Nava. The other  ones were Gary Vertel, and Claudette Ritter, and Michelle Hill,  and maybe some of them did both.  Public comment and Engage.  I'm not seeing any of these public comments in my agenda.  Electronic agenda. It's a technical problem, clearly, but  I show zero public comments in the 3.1a.  So they're in front of you, so I might want to look at that.  Because they are dropping into, I have them in my iPad, but let's  check and see. And for the record, the others have  profligated.  I have the same experience with this item, but on other items, I do see the public comments on the  exact.  Okay, so you didn't, you can't see those on the printed version,  so thank you for that, but it's not.  No, they should be dropping into your iPads.  I'm seeing 11 comments for this item on my iPad, in addition to the printed comments.  Interesting, because I printed off as a 515,  or actually about 520, the 33 comments, and then  I went back in to see if any new ones had come in, and they hadn't.  So I'll check into that and make sure that that's working.  Well, let's just take a few minutes to read the comments that we do have.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't want to waste anyone's time.  I don't know.  Thank you.  Does council need additional time to review comments?  Are there any other questions or comments after reading the comments?  I do have a question for the city attorney, actually.  I hate to make you sound like a broken record,  but there's a lot of comments in here mentioning  banning the needle exchange, the syringe access program,  and specifically referencing other communities who have instituted a ban.  Can you clarify two things for me?  One, is the city of Chico able to ban this state-approved program?  And I guess that's the first question.  The city of Chico, no city, is able to ban the state program.  What bans that I have heard that have occurred were bans of using or issuing permits on a designated city place,  such as the Civic Center, where the Civic Center typically would have a permit program.  Cities have gone to not allowing this type of program to occur in the Civic Center.  So, just to be clear, for the cities who have instituted a ban,  if a program were to apply through the state for a permit to operate a syringe access program in one of those cities,  would the city's ban have any authority over that program?  I don't know of any way to ban in that situation.  Thank you.  And the reference to other cities who have banned and the city of Chico should ban, too,  I don't know what that's making reference to.  And if there is a way, I've yet to see it.  With all respect, this is off agenda.  Thank you.  The next council member request is from Council Member Stone.  Submitted a request to agendize a discussion on closing streets to dining patrons this summer downtown.  And since this is a downtown item, I need to recuse myself and ask Vice Mayor Brown to lead this discussion.  I'll wait for Mayor Schwab to exit.  Sure.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Council Member Reynolds as well.  Two down.  Two down.  All right.  Council Member Stone, take it away.  Okay.  This probably should be filed under the let's encourage and give direction to staff to expand opportunities,  which I know they're sharp and capable of doing that as well.  But given the kind of timelines of all these things,  I thought it would be a good idea to at least give direction.  And I think it's a good idea to give direction to staff if council is supportive of such a thing.  And the concept is this.  We've now got a report to be, I believe it's, I can't remember, it's 25 or 50% of the capacity of a restaurant.  So the floor space is the maximum capacity that the governor is now permitting restaurants to open up to patrons.  And given that real estate loss and given the benefits of being outside to have open air exposure,  I thought it was a good concept at least to throw to staff.  I'm less vested in that actual item and more vested in what can we do and perhaps get a report from staff as to how we might be taking,  you know, looking at things outside the box.  I know they're creative and I know this is, this specific solution has worked in other communities.  But again, the concept is you have a restaurant that now can only use a maximum, let's say, of 50% of their floor space.  I think that's what it is.  And so that means that they have 50% less patrons at least given all of the other environment, molecules,  roads, and other things.  So if you're going to have a restaurant that's going to be rolling around in a space, this is going to push things further and further out.  And yet the city has real estate in its roads in perhaps downtown areas or other commercial areas that could be exploited.  And you can see how complex this could become.  Well, I want my street or I don't want my street or this is not a throwaway.  So it really is something that staff has to decide is viable and appropriate.  But I wanted to kick off the idea at least to encourage the direction to staff  to think outside the box and provide some relief.  So again, the concept is the restaurant will have more space in a closed street on the asphalt to have an open air alfresco seating.  And particularly for restaurants in larger commercial areas, that seems to make sense.  Downtown area is an example.  And I had originally brought this up as a possible carrot option, meaning that for businesses that have been compliant and we haven't had complaints or citations,  or threats of citations, that would be given a first opportunity.  So the intention here is to encourage staff to work with the chamber, which I'm sure is going on to a large extent,  the DCBA, which is I'm sure going on to a large extent, and find out where there are opportunities to implement something along these lines.  Thank you.  Any questions or comments from council members?  I've had, we have an email from a pharmacist who is advocating this and others.  Thank you.  On public health.  Yes.  On public health.  On public health.  On public health.  On public health.  On public health.  On public health.  On public health.  On public health.  On public health.  On public health. So I appreciate the fact that you're broadening your request, but I'm very specifically would like us to consider this at the at the next opportunity for us to get feedback from DCBA and other businesses to see if this would help.  from DCBA and other businesses to see if this would help. I agree so if that's a  motion I'm excited about that and I'll second it. I agree that that specific  request yes we're gonna wait for a public comment but I this specific  request seems like a pretty good opportunity and again communities have  been doing this in other parts of the country with some measure of success. I  also got a request if I also got a request from the farmers markets to  potentially do something like this along the same lines to expand because again  their real estate space is tightened because of that that restriction so as a  separate item again working with staff on how to address these but a second  council member worries motion. Council member Morgan. I agree in full I think this would be  great Tricom virus or no virus this  could be a cool thing for downtown other places I wouldn't want to have the  discussion without the owners of the restaurants being allowed to speak in  the room and that quite frankly that other people that be impacted so it's  it's a bit of a catch-22 unfortunately. It is I understand right it's like let's  push and let's help them here here's government we're here to help that's  worked out never I totally agree so I I don't know how we can be sensitive to  to that unless staff can start talking to DCBA and they can come speak as one, but we've got to let people speak on that.  That's a big, big deal.  Yeah, Chamber and DCBA must be, and the individual businesses in the surrounding area must, well, it would be a requirement of the law, I'm sure.  It just has to be something that they buy in on.  Mr. Orme and then Mr. Constantine, it looks like there's some comments.  Yeah, absolutely, and I was going to say that Chris can speak to this better than most because that's been his focus, working on the mitigating impacts to businesses bucket.  And so if you wouldn't mind, have Chris come up and speak to this, just to give you an update as to what's happening in order for you to make a better educated decision on what you want to add to.  Please.  Especially with the announcement that the university will not be opening the first half.  Is there an issue with the mic here?  No.  Thank you.  Thank you, Madam Vice Mayor.  Especially considering since downtown will be doubly impacted by the delay in the full opening of the university, we've been placing the focus as Team Chico on the downtown and figuring out the best ways to support their economic vitality and growth.  Currently, the downtown is operating at about one-third its normal daily movement.  A base.  Based on mobility data from this time last year.  And so we've been already meeting with the DCBA and one individual, one business owner that is on 3rd Street about the potential closure.  And so we're hashing out what are the best opportunities, how would that impact businesses, what businesses would be supportive of that, and asking the DCBA to present to the city some alternatives that we can consider both from the public works, public safety, and city administration perspective to allow exactly for what's being requested by council members.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Council Member Huber, are there any questions or comments from you?  Okay.  Well?  Go ahead.  The pharmacist that I spoke to also suggested that the university might open up their parking area since they won't be needing as much for the downtown.  Totally.  It's part of your discussions.  So we have a motion on the floor and a second.  Can we reference public comments on this?  Thanks, Chris.  Yes, we have 20.  We received 22 comments in engaged Chico and that those were from Andy Wilhoyt, Chanel Fowler, Carissa Casey, Nancy Doherty, Misha Wallace.  And we have a motion on the floor.  Jamie Strigi, Rob Berry, Yvonne Johnson, Deborah Pitcher, Deborah Jones, Daniel Rodriguez, Peggy Gerolin, Anna Paulus, Julie Threat, Kimberly Burke, Casey Croninger, Amy Marie, Nicole Nava, Juanita Sumner, Carolyn RP, Margaret Hicks, Claudette Ritter.  And then we also received one comment.  We have a public comment.  Email and that was David Welch.  Okay.  So take 30 seconds to read that.  I'm sorry.  Take a couple of minutes to read through all of the comments and then we'll continue.  I wouldn't want to speak for the council, but as Ann pointed out earlier, we had a considerable amount of downtime for us to catch up on our reading if it seems like we're not spending a lot of time reading.  Once so.  I'll watch you.  And if it feels like you don't want need to continue I'll ask.  I'm good.  I'm good. [inaudible] [inaudible]  Ooh, I have a...  This should be on me later.  No.  He said he...  He said he lost all audio and nothing.  It's still...  He actually had said earlier,  I don't want to be the one that holds up the entire meeting.  So...  This is ground control to Major Tom.  Everybody's done with their comments,  so we have a motion on the floor in a second.  Could you repeat the motion, Ms. Presson?  It was to have staff meet with DCBA and the Chamber.  To engage the Chamber, DCBA, and the University  in regards to the possible use of the streets  and to direct staff.  I believe that would be the Assistant City Manager  who's already working with those groups.  I did not get whether or not you wanted a report back  or you wanted...  I felt like it was a directive for staff  to look for those opportunities.  I heard pretty explicit requests  that we want this on the agenda.  We want to have a formal discussion.  A specific item, yeah.  Is that accurate?  But I would also love to continue to hear that.  Looping in the Chamber and the DCBA  and necessary economic development  and other things.  Next opportunity.  Yes.  So that's...  And for a direction,  I'd love to get a continuous report.  This is, as I've said many, many, many times,  this is, I think, one of the most pressing issues  we've got in the city for...  in the past few decades.  Mr. Constantine.  Mr. Arum.  One of the things that might be helpful  is we already had on agenda at the next meeting  a council member request to have an update  on the business bucket.  Maybe what we can do is shift that presentation  down to the general items.  That way, if there is action that's necessary  that council desires to give direction on, they can.  And that way, that presentation item that was at the top  will just get shifted down.  And that way, it's on there.  And for as long as it needs to be on there,  we'll just keep it on there.  Great. Thank you.  Great. And we'll call the roll.  Okay.  So I have...  I have Council Member Huber as absent.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Ori.  Aye.  Council Member Reynolds.  She's recused.  Oh, yeah.  Council Member Stone.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Aye.  And we have Mayor Schwab as a recusal.  So that carries four, zero with two absence,  and one recusal.  Two recusals.  Okay.  Oh, Casey, I apologize.  So she...  Okay.  Got it.  So we've had two council members written requests.  In this section of the agenda, we are also able to have verbal requests.  Does any council member have a verbal request?  Yes, I have two verbal requests.  Okay.  Let's do one at a time.  Okay.  Okay.  I won't lump them together.  They're different.  So we were informed this week that as temperatures in the city of Chico are rising into the hundreds  for multiple days at a time, we'll be suspending cooling center operations due to COVID-19.  I wish we could have this conversation sooner since it is a health and safety issue for  folks on our streets and degrees are only rising, reaching pretty high states this week  and weekend.  But I'd like to discuss...  I think we have a lot of potential alternative uses for the allocated funding that would have  been spent or some of that funding that would have been spent for the operation of the cooling  center to help mitigate some of those impacts.  That might include supplying water in various locations, shade tents or other ideas.  I'd welcome them.  I don't feel comfortable with this being left on the table when we're reaching these high  degrees and when we don't yet have adequate 24-hour shelter opportunities for folks to  stay cool indoors.  So I'd like this to be discussed.  Okay.  So I think we'll have this discussed as soon as possible.  Any questions from folks?  Move to agendas.  Second.  Quickly.  Okay.  So under our APMPs, this is approved and probably will be, the requested discussion will not be  agendized until a written report by the council member is received from the city clerk.  I will provide it.  Absolutely.  So that would be the direction.  Okay.  So can we have a vote?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  put off reasonably due to COVID-19.  The two items that were noted were the NVHRC program,  which we are moving forward with some discussion on  at upcoming meetings, and cannabis regulation.  I'd like to formally request that we bring the adoption  of the cannabis ordinance back to Council  for discussion at the first meeting in June.  The ideal situation would be to have various formats  for public engagement, and I'm hopeful that staff will  or can make some of these work for the Council meetings ahead.  In fact, I would welcome reading comments out loud  at our next meeting in good faith,  and inviting other alternatives for this.  However, this item in particular has received  countless hours of public comments,  and what was in front of us in March  was the opportunity to formalize our ordinance.  As we're engaging again with the NVHRC operations,  I'd like to request that Council revisit  the cannabis ordinance at the June 2nd meeting.  This is an issue of economic development,  creation of jobs, new industry,  and these are things that our community  desperately needs right now.  So with that, I'll take any questions that folks have.  Move to agendas.  Other comments?  I have comments.  We voted 7-0 not to take items of mass importance  to the community without having the public here  a week ago.  A week ago.  And now we're going to say, let's talk about dope.  Without the public in the audience in attendance,  we've seen the disaster that it is  to have a single council member  try to vote and be part of the meeting,  yet we're going to allow the public  to try to do the same thing  in an item of utmost importance,  and I completely reject  that there's any economic development  credibility to your request at all,  and challenge you to find a city  that gained money as a result of an ordinance like this one.  The city attorney and city clerk were  commencing there. Did you have a comment?  I can't recall on this item if there was a  public notice that needed to be done.  I see what you're saying.  It was, and it was, I believe, noted as a public hearing.  So it would require the 10-day noticing.  So it would not be able to come back at June 2nd  because of the public notice requirement.  What about a second meeting in June?  Well, we don't have a second meeting in June.  Scheduled.  As an ordinance, first reading can happen in a special meeting.  Second reading must happen at a regularly scheduled meeting.  So this could come back  after 10 days at a special meeting  and then, presuming that sometime in June,  final reading could happen at our  regular meeting in July.  Are we not in agreement?  That our special meetings are for essential city services?  Well, can you see the agendas for the last five special meetings?  I completely agree, Mr. Ory.  Clearly, I'm requesting an exemption for this particular item.  Are you going to amend your motion?  I'm not sure.  I made the motion. I'm not sure it's necessary.  I didn't think it was.  Well, I thought it was specifically for the June 2nd agenda.  I would.  Next available.  On a procedural basis, I would think that,  it was necessary to reframe it only because we have to say,  however you put this in your legalese language,  that, A, we're setting aside the fact that we said  we wouldn't talk about non-essential things without the public.  B, we're setting aside our other agreement  that we'll only have special meetings if they're essential.  C, we're now going to have a special meeting in June  for something that's not essential after we agreed to do it.  And I can't think about what number five is.  Mr. Ory.  Mr. City Attorney, can you clarify what would be needed  as part of this motion, if anything?  So those prior council directives would need to be waived,  as Council Member Morgan outlined there.  For this specific item?  Correct.  So would that be the one that we're only doing essential services  or the one that special meetings are only for essential services?  Or the one that we won't do non-essential services  without having the public?  Or all three?  All three, yeah.  All three that I think all three were voted unanimously for,  if I remember correctly.  So we have to set aside all three of those unanimously voted items  in order to take up this non-essential item.  Thank you.  Do you want me to amend my motion?  Yeah, I'll amend my motion that we hear this item  at the end of the meeting.  Okay.  at the earliest possible point, including making the waiver  and exception for at least this item and all the items,  if necessary.  We have a capacity now that the governor just declared  that allows us an extra 20 people  in this room alone physically here.  And hopefully we can work out some of those technological kinks  in the 10 days that we're going to be working on this.  So.  Is there a second?  There was a second.  Okay. I'm not comfortable with the fact that we're not going  to be able to get this item out.  I'm not comfortable moving forward in light of the discussion  and decisions that we had last week.  I do agree that we are probably ready to move forward on this.  However, until we have public in the room,  I want to be consistent with our items.  So. Ready for a vote?  Okay. So Councilmember Huber is not available.  I do not believe.  So he's absent.  Councilmember Morgan?  No.  Councilmember Ori?  No.  Councilmember Reynolds?  No.  Councilmember Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  No.  It's tied.  So it fails due to the tie with one, tied vote with one absence.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Okay. Are there any other Council requests?  Seeing none, we will adjourn to the regular Chico City Council meeting  on Tuesday, June 2nd at 6 o'clock in the Council Chamber.  Madam Mayor, we should probably do the closed session announcement.  Let's do closed session.  Yes.  The record reflected the Council recessed into closed session at 530 this evening.  The one item on the agenda, case number 19CV03324 was discussed.  There was no final action taken on that matter.  All Councilmembers were present.  It concludes the report for closed session.  Okay. Thank you.
