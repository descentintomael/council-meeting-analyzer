I' m a field representative from the norcal carpenters local 1599 and I' m here to advocate for a consultation on the community council and I recognize that it' s crucial to the well-being of our community. the need to provide area standards for labor on construction projects in our community. area standard labor language needs to be the template the developer used in our beautiful town of chico and on any projects. construction workers are the backbone of our town' s growth and development. they work day in and day out dedicating their skills and labor to shape our landscape. I' d like to express that without these standards the construction force is systematically abused through wage theft, 1099 where workers have no workers comp when injured on the job and the litany of safety violations. health care and livable wage are a vital necessity to the workers building our projects. apprenticeship programs ensure the projects are built to the highest degree and local hire ensures not only tax revenue from money spent by the workers but ensures those workers can enjoy the basic things in life like spending evenings with their families, maybe attending their child's little league games or going to a dance recital instead of commuting in traffic for two hours. by promoting local hiring practices we can create jobs for our own residents and our employees. reducing unemployment rates and fostering a sense of pride and ownership in the projects that shape us. the housing crisis in california is a very real issue and the only way to mitigate the problem is by building more housing. but we shouldn't take advantage of the workforce helping us solve that crisis. and those same workers should be able to afford to live in the communities that they're building. the language that should become the policy here in chico would support responsible contractors that are already doing the right thing by their clients, employees and our city itself. these responsible contractors have proven time after time that they can perform to the highest standard. this policy would bolster chico's working class and cultivate a responsible market for good contractors. this would create a minimum standard for developers that are coming here telling them that you value your citizens that build on our land. i look forward to talking about this more with you in the future. thank you for your time. thank you. bonnie pipkin followed by beau powell. hi council. my name is bonnie pipkin. if i haven't met you i started on the arts commission two years ago. i just wanted to thank you for the acknowledgment to our outgoing commissioners and just say a little bit more. thank you to louis nava for really starting the utility box project that is in full swing now and is going to beautify our downtown. and thank you to kimberly for her leadership as chair and to monica mcdaniel who has really become a mentor for me in the arts commission since i have joined the arts commission. and i am now chair of the arts commission, a position that i take great pride in. and i'm speaking to you not on behalf of the arts commission but as a citizen who is an artist and is working and producing and bringing art to chico. we have an amazing arts commission now thanks to all of your nominations. and a lot of very energetic people who want to make a lot of exciting things happen in chico. and i know that you are all considering the budget right now and there are many things to weigh. we're super thankful for the 1% of the tot tax that has brought us the granting program that we're able to provide funding to our amazing community arts organizations. and we had a strategic planning meeting at the beginning of march where we were able to meet with the arts commission and there were just a lot of really incredible ideas. and so as you consider your budget, which is a very complicated thing, respectfully to all of you, i believe that a lot of really amazing community arts events could happen with the energy that's on the arts commission right now. and i'd love to meet with any of you any time to tell you about the ideas that came up in the strategic planning meeting because there's a lot of really cool things. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively comes out to our neighborhood and even though the school bus goes down my street you know that was 11 years ago they legalized spraying of the public right-of-way at 2015 five months after I came here was complained B County had a law they made standard practices law for agriculture and by refusing to enforce the law B County has facilitated taking away our rights to travel around without being sprayed now I came here in December so I could talk here with Sean Morgan and mayor Coolidge was here well after I said what I said here Mayor Coollet's went on the action news and he said he was proud that they you know hired 47 police officers said he was on the council for a eight years that's forty percent of the police officers have been hired no one probably or maybe not knowing that they were effectively The in-law hospital facilitates this. We have the highest cancer rate, the highest suicide rate, the most ACEs of any adverse childhood experiences. We don't even count spraying children with chemicals as an adverse childhood experience. The mayor here, you know, has a special needs kid. When they have the Special Olympics, the cops were running with the torch. Action News makes sure they show an orchard just freshly planted there. Every chance they get, they use public employees as props to normalize the spraying of us. Chico State is well aware of it. I've attended retirement classes. There are meetings full of Chico State retired, and they know all about it. But just like the public employees, their unions are facilitating crimes against them. Now, I know good people need a little bit of a nudge sometime, and that's what I'm trying to do. Trying to get you to ask the media to respect your community, respect your families, respect your children, respect your businesses. Thank you. Thank you. Mary Gardner. Good evening, everybody. I'm Mary Gardner, currently the president of the Chico Arts and Culture Foundation. And I'm here just to echo the honoring of specifically Monica McDaniel and her 16 years of service. I served alongside her in many different capacities over those 16 years. And I'm here to thank her for that. We really would not have gotten through some really hard times without her leadership and generosity. She just has a huge heart, but also is very thoughtful and one of the most considerate people in terms of listening to all points of view. And she always brings that to the table. And I've just been really, really proud to be alongside her in this journey. It's hard to let her go. But she definitely has put in her time. She has been the longest serving arts commissioner as far as I know. And I think I've known every single one of them in the last many, many years. So anyway, thank you for honoring her tonight. And thank you for all your support for the arts in general. So have a good evening. Thank you. She was our last speaker. All right. 5.1. Consideration of an organization. Ordinance amending chapter 1.4 of the Chico Municipal Code. Adding additional conditions for real properties constituting a nuisance related to missing and boarded up doors and windows. Mr. City Attorney. John Lamb. Thank you, Mayor. City Council. This next item is an ordinance amending the city's nuisance abatement code by adding additional conditions of real property that would constitute a nuisance. In 2024, on several occasions, the City Council engaged in public discussions regarding the conditions. The podems effectively the city has been includes a definition of what constitutes a nuisance. To include an occupied or vacant building with broken or missing skylights windows or exterior doors in addition buildings having boarded up windows or openings that are not painted with a minimum coat of paint that is similar to or compatible with exterior colors of the building. For these new violations violations of these conditions are subject to existing remedies under the city' s code municipal code such as administrative nuisance abatement administrative citations as well as civil and criminal penalties and remedies. That concludes my report I' d be happy to answer any questions council may have. does council have any questions? Mr. Winslow. this is the second time we have updated the nuisance ordinance since I' ve been on the council. probably not you john but would somebody give a public update on how enforcement of the previous update has worked or hasn' t worked? can you clarify? these are tools we use mostly to engage people who aren' t working to remedy situations. There' e 31 items listed in the end tools in the toolbox. We have certain folks for instance that are maybe fixing an interior don' t want to put the facade back on until they identify a tenant and in good faith they are seeking a new tenant and they maybe use some boarding and they put a mural on there. Those are people working in good faith sometimes we have people that aren' t working in good faith. This is just an additional tools to our toolbox to engage those folks. if that makes sense. s great. I guess in particular a lot of people ask about downtown buildings in particular what was on everybody' s mind as we added both this and the previous update to the ordinance. People ask me a lot what' s happening for this or that building that' s vacant downtown if people are receiving fines under the ordinance. I know for a long time we had a list of different descriptions of situations with property owners. familiar with that. Any other information for people to know? are you referring to a specific property? the one that came up as a specific city council hearing already. I don' t like to single them out. there were commitments made about continuing and meeting some deadlines. Those deadlines haven' t been met. That individual is receiving notice of violations and citations on a weekly basis that constitute daily fines. council is in office to get started again. There' s nuances and lots of details. He needs to receive an encroachment permit. He feels that' s not something he should go through at this time. There' s been back and forth. We need to have that encroachment permit for liability purposes in the city and working within the sidewalk and the street area. There' s a lot of details. What the tools are once we use these to engage an individual and if they won' have to go back to our citations and notice of violations. Those are the tools and they continue to escalate. that' s more than I knew. you were sitting in the seat. I wanted to get a better view. that' s the only building that' s been fined under the ordinance. in the downtown. council member goldstein. I had a similar question. What' s the process for enforcing of this? citizens report to code enforcement if there' s a nuisance of this type in their neighborhood and then fines are levied on them. I' m not really familiar. we' re not the building police. There are lots of circumstances that happen with each situation. We work within those realities to try to get people to move forward. I think some folks believe that if somebody is not doing something we want them to we go out and arrest them and force them to do something. That' s not exactly how it plays out. I' m saying that jokingly but there is I think some people think we can make them but we instead use the tools we have including citations, notice of violations, things that will be potentially putting a lien on their building or cause them other stress as they pay their taxes or other things like that. It can sometimes be a drawn out process. that' s good. thanks. Mr. van overbeck. thank you. I think in the case of the building we were talking about I don' t want to we all know which one it is. Those windows and openings have not had windows in them for 12 years. It' s literally been that long. We just need to find a way to be more a good way to be able to get people to move forward. this is a little bit more aggressive about enforcing this kind of stuff because that really impacts the downtown. I know you know this. Do you believe this gives you the tools you need to do that? we' re currently with or without the new language we are actively citing. I know you are. these are more tools when we would have a future situation. That situation is something we talked about at length at a specific council meeting. There were a number of effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively seeking effectively effectively effectively do you think you need to be more effective? I do. thank you. Mr. Bennett. I have a copy of 1.14230 the penalties. I think at some point we need to take a look at the penalties. I think the penalties being assessed to actually motivate that' s a nice word. To motivate some folks that don' t seem to understand the damage they' re doing to downtown. I will leave it at that. can I clarify one thing on 38. A vacant building having a Even with this new language they can still have boarded up building fronts for a long period of time which I thought we were trying to avoid that. that' s why I tried to provide an example of somebody who maybe has actively fixed up their interior they don' t want to put the façade back on until they get final direction on a new tenant. Mostly we have folks that engage or put a mural up and they' re seeking a tenant. They' re not able to achieve that. I don' t know what benefit we would receive from penalizing them as they seek a tenant. plus we' re not just talking about front windows we' re talking about windows and there are many situations in old buildings I can see a couple from my office where they' re boarded painted look good it' s a situation where internally the configuration of the building no longer is using that window so they have it plugged for lack of a better term. As brendan mentioned no amount of words can possibly describe every adverse situation that we' ll ever run across unfortunately. I do believe we have in totality with the 31 items listed and it says not even limited to what we need if someone' s not moving forward with anything. But when we engage them it doesn' t mean they' re all of a sudden going to jump to attention either. It' s incredibly challenging sometimes. I just wanted to follow up on council member bennett' s comment that it seems like maybe we need to look at our penalties being assessed and you have already touched on this so sorry if I' m dragging it on. Are there other things that are there other tools you need or higher fines that are allowed for you to use because I' m worried we' re going to keep seeing this problem with the aforementioned building downtown or other buildings? we could certainly review that' s a different section of the code than the one we' re discussing tonight but that is in 1.14.230. It' s a pretty typical level of fines I would characterize it as but if council wants to explore more we certainly can. We can put that in the agenda request for another meeting. typically with administrative citations the fines are typically set by government code. For non-building code related violations it' s usually $100 plus 200 and then it escalates up to 500 for the third violation. For building code violations you have I think it goes up to 1,000. The point of that though is I think these citation amounts they sound like they are not going to be significant but they are not a lot but we are able to cite by the day. Once you get to three you' re at $500 per day. Just keep that in mind. that' s really helpful. it is significant. then it does go to $400. and then up to five. per frequent file later. it is significant and it does add up and it' s cumulative. the goal sometimes if we sometimes levy a notice of violation and a fee. and they quickly say I' m ready to get back at work. we can rescind those. it' s a tool. in some cases the amount isn' t going to necessarily make that action happen even if it' s incrementally more. again this situation is unique. we' re talking about the code. it' s supposed to be city wide but we' re all frustrated with the certain situation. this isn' t about any particular one. I specifically remember when we first started this was we have worked with the carrot for a long time and we had a lot of patience and a lot of ongoing conversations and working with people on a one on one. however when the stick is needed we needed to update and that' s why we' re here today for that. thank you Mr. Lamb for getting that back to us. do we have any speakers on this item? we do not. all right I' ll consider a motion. before a motion. is there going to be discussion? do we have questions? do you have more discussion and questions? go ahead Mr. Van Der Rohe. I have a point I want to make. one is related to number 30. this is again the boarded up windows. I don' t want to see any boarded up windows. if somebody the interior configuration is changing and a masonry building you brick up the opening and make it look like and we see that all over town with older buildings get repurposed. but you need to make that opening match with the new construction. I don' t want to see any boarded up windows unless there' s active construction. unless they' re undergoing construction. then the other one is number 12. I' m sort of a shade tree mechanic. vehicles have to be registered for somebody to work on it if it' s in their driveway for 14 days. but a lot of times people are fixing up old cars and they' re not t know if you have any questions for the city attorney. why are we requiring the vehicles to be registered? council member van overbrek. number 12 is actually existing code that was not addressed in this amendment. that was passed previously by the council. it' s not important enough if it was open for discussion this time. I don' t want to go back. I think that and brendan can probably talk about this as well. I think there are some valid times and reasons for using boarded up windows. for example, if a window is destroyed for whatever reason, brendan has already talked about the long drawn out process from code enforcement. in order to send notices of violation and ask someone to put in a new window, that could take weeks. it could take a long time. in the meantime, there may not be a building that is not the owner may want that building boarded up just because it prevents vandals, squatters from going into that site. that would be a situation where there would be construction so you' re waiting to get the window to replace. that' s fine. that' s not what i' m talking about. what i' m talking about is somebody just boards up the opening and paints it and leaves it indefinitely. if you have construction going on, you' re going to replace a window or you' re doing more extensive remodeling of the building, then that' s fine. but there should be a window that is there should be some time limits, six months or nine months. but we have buildings where they' ve been boarded up for a decade. mr. lamb, did you have anything else? that was my comment, there might be a reason to have this so you wouldn' t have boarded up windows that stick out and are clearly boarded up windows as opposed to painted to match the exterior paint of the building. aesthetically, a little bit more pleasing than just wood. i' d describe this when we looked at internal affairs as putting a second layer of lipstick on a pig. i don' t think that means it' s a bad thing, but having a boarded up window painted something aesthetically pleasing is a little bit better. it doesn' t get out of the root of the problem. cities tackle this in other ways like vacancy taxes in order to try to change that incentive, to incentivize landlords to find a deal with a tenant that will work. those are separate things we have to pursue. that requires voter approval. as far as what we' re doing now, i' m ready to make a motion. councilmember o'brien, go ahead. councilmember o'brien. i certainly do not want to punish property owners, however, leaving buildings in a decayed state becomes an attractive nuisance to crime blight. decrease in overall property values, et cetera. i think everyone understands that. i do believe in the broken window theory. it is just human nature. the collected property prompts the other neglect and that goes beyond just the specific property. so i don' t want to punish property owners necessarily, however, we must have a basic standard that our community has for abandoned buildings for those reasons. i think this is not perfect, but i think it does something and maybe it is a little bit like a lipstick on a pig. but it is something that we can do and i think it' s a start. i' m going to support this. councilmember goldstein. councilmember goldstein. thank you. there are vacant houses on my block and around my house. i have tried to look into how we can get people living in those houses, how we might incentivize owners to rent them out or maybe sell them to somebody who can fix them up. i learned there' s not really a tool in the code enforcement toolbox to address the issue. there are boarded up windows on those houses which beyond the vacancy issue and that we' re in a housing crisis, there is an attractive nuisance. i' ve been worried, especially there have been house fires in abandoned houses in chico. i' ve been worried that people might see that as an entry point. i light heating fires in those houses on my block. i' m very excited to see this move forward. i wonder though, will painting a board on a window really fix the problem? it' s a little bit harder to tell that there' s an entry point. i think it would be a good idea to put a board on an entry point into an abandoned house if it' s not bright wood, if it matches the house. but i' d also support if we were to clarify some language if needed, make sure that this is a temporary allowance. i' m not sure that we should allow people to have painted boarded up windows for a long period of time. but, yeah, so i believe we' re moving in the right direction with this. are you ready for a motion? i' m ready to entertain a motion. i' d like to make a motion to approve with the exception of item 30 to add the words this would be only allowed under active construction for no more than six months, at which point the code people could renew it. so you can paint over your boarded up window if you' re under construction. that includes waiting for a window that was broken. and you can only have it boarded up if you' You can't really get a window that is been boarded up for six months. did you get that, debby? i'll second that. okay. all right. And that was a motion and a second to introduce an ordinance of the city of chico amending chapter 1.14 to the city of chico municipal code adding additional conditions of real property constituting a nuisance related to missing and boarded up doors and windows number 30 to add the words active as long as the boarded up windows are due to active construction in no more than six months. Council Member Goldstein. Aye. Council Member Hawley. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. No. Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Carrie 6-1. All right. 5.2. Downtown Chico Property Business Owners Improvement Assessment Increase. Deputy City Manager, Ms. McCarthy. Good evening, Mayor Reynolds, Vice Mayor Bennett, Council Members. I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager. Before you tonight is the Downtown Chico Property Business Improvement District proposed in session. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to start by saying that the downtown Chico Property Business Improvement District, or PBID, was originally formed in 2017 with the concept of making downtown cleaner and safer for all visitors. The original period was for, formation period was for five years, and it went through a renewal process in 2022, which now gives it for a time period through December of 2027. The PBID is funded through assessments on downtown properties that are within downtown Chico Property Business Improvement District. The!<|sv|> E podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem podem podem podem effectively effectively effectively! effectively effectively! effectively district plan that was part of the public record when the public hearings were held for the formation. You can see that in the annual report the pbid discusses the need for this assessment increase and that is costs in general are just going up. They have that as well as they need to keep a reserve in place for the pbid as well. Now as they have seen those costs increase they have also seen the need increase in downtown for additional clean and safe opportunities. You can see in the budget that almost 90% of the total budget goes towards clean and safe and by that they mean funding the downtown ambassadors. Those are the awesome people in downtown chico with the blue shirts doing an amazing job cleaning up the sidewalks helping out the downtown property owners and making our community at least in that part safer and cleaner for We are one of the biggest payers into the pbid because we own the most amount of property in the pbid. You can see on this slide there is a cost increase to the city. The property assessment if we were to go forward with a 5% increase would mean next year we would be paying approximately $84,000 and in addition the general benefit assessment would also be raised by 5% if the council so chooses and that would bring it up to just about $23,000. So we have a lot of money in this next 10 years bringing our total cost to roughly $107,000. Staff sees the pbid really doing a great job in trying to activate what they can with the funds they have. Again almost 90% of those funds are going to our downtown ambassadors to try to keep downtown chico clean and safe. Again with all of the noticing and all of the management district plan information that went out to the property owners that preapproved that 5% increase this is really just a step a formality step that the council can take to authorize that 5% increase. So if there is any questions today the pbid president Eric Hart is here as well as council member van obervek sits on the board as the council's representative and I as well am happy to answer any questions that you might have. All right before we go to questions I want to thank the I will turn it over to the board members and the council members. Thank you for that presentation Ms. McCarthy I really appreciate it. I am curious I know we were emailed about assessment updates and reaching out to property owners and businesses to update those assessments. I am curious depending on the responses we get to that if the financial need will increase or not. I think that the email I could be wrong council member Holly but I believe the email you are referring to has to do with the downtown Chico businesses as opposed to the downtown Chico property owners. Okay thank you. So two separate processes we are in the process of making sure that the downtown businesses are up to date with their business licenses and are paying the associated downtown business license tax and that is something we are going over separately with the dcba. This process is for the property owners of the downtown Chico area and so that 5% increase is the maximum they can request on an annual basis based on their reformation process that we went through. Does that answer your question? thank you for the clarification. You are welcome my pleasure. Do we have any speakers? We do not. All right. Any further discussion by council or I will make a comment. I am the city board member on the pbid board. I want to call out Audrey Taylor back here who has been the glue that has kept this thing together for years. Eric Hart who is the president has done a great job. We all are familiar with the challenges that downtown has and ambassadors are fantastic. They have so many difficult situations to deal with. They have done a nasty job. I want to commend them and the people on the pbid board for fighting a good fight and keeping downtown going. I would urge all of my colleagues to approve this assessment increase. Mr. Winslow. nothing more than the downtown ambassadors do great work. It' s good to have them around downtown. It certainly benefits the whole community. I would make a motion to approve the resolution. I have a motion and a second. Ms. Preston. Council member Goldstein. Aye. Council member O'Brien. An easy yes. Council member van overbeck. Yes. Council member Winslow. Yes. Vice mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. Aye. 5.3. I will turn it over to the council. Currently the memorandum of understanding between the chico police officers association who encompass our police officers and police sergeants and the city addresses out of class assignments for the membership of the poa. Currently anybody who is assigned to an out of class assignment receives around a 5% increase to their base pay if they are assigned to that assignment. Not less than 4.5%. There is discussion under the overtime section that talks about those people who are assigned in out of class positions intermittently who are in management positions who are like a sergeant going into a lieutenant position lieutenants are in a different mou they will receive overtime pay but if that same person were to be in that position for 30 days or more The problem with that is that the out of class assignment is still at that 5% rate. This is a rare instance. This is for somebody who is covering for lieutenant or somebody who is in a management position who is out on an extended leave so there is a need to fill that position for an extended period of time. In that case if the sergeant for instance is going into a lieutenant overtime pay no overtime pay and also in that instance they are removed from their alternative assignment if there is one if they are on a detective assignment or special team or something like that often that is happening as well. It comes to that they for that period of time will be receiving less than what they would at their normal assignment. They do have the incentive of gaining the experience however the incentive is The purpose of this side letter is to treat those employees more like an interim assignment. Placed in that position as a manager as that position. They would get a 20% increase of their base pay and also the stipend if they were to be assigned by the police chief to the watch commander position. That is up to the police chief whether he would do that. I will ask the Vanoverbeck. Go ahead. Council member holly. I was going to ask if this was the standard across all departments that any time someone is stepping up into a role for an extended period of time their pay rate would go up by 20% in addition to that $650 stipend. It depends on the classification and the assignment. I think it depends on the With these assignments when a police sergeant is promoted permanently into a management position they receive a 20% pay that also includes their alternative assignment pays. It includes that extra 10% or 5% or whatever it is they are assigned currently as their sergeant position. That of class assignment is based on their base pay so it is not quite as much of an increase as if they were going to be promoted permanently into that position. Thank you. I have a question. Eric could you move back so I can see. Thank you. Otherwise one of us is going to have to go to the chiropractor tomorrow. Let' s say I' m a sergeant and a lieutenant has a medical leave and I get put into I would like to know as the sergeant who is in the job on an interim basis am I getting paid the same as other lieutenants or more or less? That depends. Currently you will be getting less because you are lower on the pay scale. If you are at a 20% rate I think generally still because it is based on base pay the way it is proposed now you would still be getting less because I believe most of the lieutenants are at the higher end of the scale. I' m not getting the full payment I would get if I were in the job permanently. Do you have a sense of what the differential would be is it 10% or 15%? Maybe this is a chief question. I think I can make it a little more clear. It doesn' t have to be precise. What you' re getting at and what Barbara is trying to say is that the difference between the two is that we may have a sergeant who is not at their top step in the pay range for a sergeant and then I bring them up to be an acting lieutenant for a period of time. Even with that 20% increase to move to that next rank they still wouldn' t be making as much as a top step lieutenant because they weren' t at top step sergeant plus 20. That 20% to put it in perspective is only when a person has a 10% special assistant or a assignment, 5% for their post intermediate and advanced certificate plus their pay bump for the actual promotion. They already get 10% for a specialty assignment and 5% for the post incentives. That' s already calculated into their pay raise that' s coming. thank you. thank you. council member wenzel. council member holly's question maybe I wasn' t understand this correctly. You get a 20% increase on your base pay and a $650 stipend? those are current. the $650 is only if assigned to that watch commander. Generally speaking it' s just the 20% base pay increase. $650 is on top of your 20% pay increase but only if you' that works. I require watch commanders 24-7. It' s a management level oversight of our patrol division. Say I' m a watch commander and I want to take a day off. The chief requires me to backfill my position and since they don' t get overtime they negotiated for a stipend just as the fire division chiefs and battalion chiefs or I' m not sure about division chiefs but battalion chiefs do for their positions. They get that as a one time $650 every shift they would cover which is more than half less than what they would get on overtime for covering a shift. It' s a bargain for the city by all means but those are intermittent as people are on vacation and only as a watch commander. none of this is a the if this is happening on a regular basis now we have increased staffing in the department. you still have folks who take vacation or they get sick and when I see a long-term sick occurring such as we had a lieutenant who went out a few months back on a long-term medical condition instead of paying a daily $650 times two shifts I would have to pay a $1300 a day to cover two shifts I had asked the city manager to allow me to bring someone up or back fill for that position over hire on that position as a position was coming available it was much cheaper for us to do that but these are one offs now where someone is on a vacation day or sick day. I' m seeing more of the financial ingenuity here. councilmember o'brien. thanks for bringing this forward. I' m going to take a the bottom line is this and applies to both police and fire when these individuals step up to take on these command positions watch commander what have you they' re taking on the duty for that moment. When the chiefs are gone they are the chief of police and the fire chief and their responsibility is significant they' re making literally life and death decisions we do not want to punish people for stepping on that responsibility we want to make it something that is somewhat rewarding because there is a lot of stress when you do that when you take on that call both the chiefs understand that I understand that and we want to not punish them for taking that responsibility on it' s a huge one for the city and a huge one for this community and I' m going to support this. I' ll make one quick comment I just wanted to thank barbara for translating this into something that I could understand pretty easily and I think it' really easily so thanks. do we have speakers on this? none. entertainer? I will make a motion to approve. second? motion and a second. all right Councilmember Goldstein? aye. Councilmember holly? yes. Councilmember o'brien? yes. Councilmember van overbeck? council member O'Brien's request to have a conversation about card and city parks. Thank you mayor O'Brien. Thank you mayor. So the discussion of card operating city parks has actually been ongoing for many years probably as long as I have been in the city which is a few decades probably as long as our city manager has been with the city as well and it includes conversations that have occurred recently and that's all good and there's reasons why those have occurred but those discussions did not occur because of poor management by our staff. I want to be very clear about that in fact our city staff specifically director Gustafson, Eric and his team have done a terrific job managing our parks and I commend them for that job and I mean that. Thank you. But what card could provide in my opinion is an enhanced focus on recreation. It is in their name. I think there is great potential for a partnership between the city and card. However to move beyond the discussion phase which has again been ongoing for many years I believe the two governing boards meaning the city council and the card board need to formalize those discussions on what this partnership would look like interest cost timing sequence capacity and also the future of the park. I think there is great potential for a partnership between the city council and the card board. Ultimately what the recreation opportunities could look like. I think it is a blank canvas I really do. However as I said we need a mechanism to get this information to the decision makers meaning the card board and the full council to do this justice. As such I am requesting that we the city council officially direct staff to engage with card and bring back options to both governing boards. before we go to speakers do we have any questions for Mr. O'brien? Mr. Winslow? I know you' re saying blank we could consider everything but are there particular areas you have in mind particular ones you think should not be considered for turning over to card? I think really that' s part of the conversation I don' t think we maybe understand some of those dynamics there could be issues with specific parks that would not be conducive to card running. I don' t know what those are but I think it is a good question. I think that' s part of that conversation. You say the bidwell park and playground commission will no doubt play a role but you' re recommending we just have the boards meeting. Do you want to send it to the parks commission first in order to have some of their feedback? I think certainly getting their feedback would be beneficial. That' s again part of their function. I think that would be respectful to do that for them absolutely and beneficial. All right do we have any speakers? No. All right. Do you want to turn that into a motion? I will turn that into a motion. Madam Mayor thank you. Can I request do we have the card director here if we could request a comment from you would you mind is that okay? I was trying to spare you Annabelle but since you' ve been called I can' t help you now. No problem I' m happy to be here and happy to continue to partner with the city. I think we have an incredible relationship. Thank you. We do recreation we bring the fun right and so I think there' s a lot of benefit in formalizing that conversation to figure out what are the things what are the opportunities and what that could look like long term. I mean we' ve got a history I think it started like 80s or something like that so it just makes sense to continue that conversation about how we can continue to leverage the facilities and the spaces of the city and allow card to do its fun programming. Great thank you Annabelle. Thank you. I second the motion. You can restate the motion would you? So I have that you would like to direct staff to let' s see let' me get up there. You did indicate that you would like to direct staff to let' s see let' s get up there. I think that you wanted it to now go first to the bidwell park and playground commission first for consideration and then on to card I had ongoing discussion obviously the two governing boards would need to formalize a discussion on what a partnership sequencing capacity would look like and then someone said I believe when council member Winslow asked about whether that was going to the bidwell park and playground commission you said that would go there first so I just if you can tell me what sequence you want that in. I want them to weigh in whether this would go to the bidwell park and playground commission or not. I would say that I would send it to them initially first I don' t know if that' s necessary but certainly getting their opinions on this whatever that looks like I' m fine with as well. My request for friendly amendment would be we send it to them first and they' ll have a hearing on it and we' ll get some report from them. I want to hear the city manager. question as to what is it and my thought as to how we would proceed with this is probably one or two parks at a time and then we would go through that process. I would say that we would go through that process because we would have some work to do to try to identify the operations and management costs that card is going to want to take over operations and management of each individual park is completely different as to what that means and by the way card was started in 1948. that' s what I mentioned regarding capacity and timing that was my point in that. Are you suggesting we need to identify a couple of parks to do that? would you like to start with mark or what you' re suggesting? I think I would one thought is to allow us to work with card and maybe start bringing those forth because we still own several fairly active parks and I' ll rattle off a few just for the sake of argument. City plaza, depot park, comanche creek, tiker come to mind as potential. park and playgrounds and each of those is a very different animal. I would like to have a playground looked at as well. another good one. just my thoughts on this and why I think it would be helpful to have the biddable parks and playgrounds commission weigh in on the general idea of we' re going to try to potentially transfer a lot of parks over to card and under what principles? I see the recreation focus like children's park feels like a fit that there' s playgrounds there even like keeper acres within the park. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively! overly active but some improvements plus the fact it' s a vital part of our stormwater drainage system we can' t walk away from. Again each of those is very different animal. my point is to get this going that' s what we need to do. I don' t want to get lost in the weeds right now because we don' t understand what those weeds are. I' m going to stick to my original motion that was seconded by tom at this point. Certainly we can look at some point if we want to shift this off to bidwell park and playground commission to weigh in I' m fine with that but I want to get something going I don' t want to get lost in the weeds right now. one comment I think would be that the! the bidwell park and playground commission because their initial reaction if it' s unformed is probably going to be negative but if they have something specific to respond to because I think it' s a good idea I' d like to see it happen. I' m not suggesting you change your motion and I' m not going to withdraw my second but I think that would be the right order or the order I would to clarify are we not reviewing any of the currently card managed parks just ones that could be managed by card? well most of I think it' s fair to say most of the card parks they own hooker oak is the only one I can think of they don' t own. Annabelle is that right? at nature center. at nature center. at nature center. at nature center. that' s another one they rent from us so there are very few that are city properties. we want to narrow the scope a little bit in honoring of your comments tom why don' t we do what the city manager suggested those parks that you name mark let' s look at those specifically and if that gives you enough direction as far as them taking those specific parks that you want to go with. something that strikes me is like we' re doing something confusing and not on the right path we have an upcoming discussion recommending the parks commission discuss a bidwell park master plan big picture thing now it feels like we' re going down to picking off some little pieces of parks and discuss turning them over to card I feel like it would be worthwhile to have a general the role of the commission and that we should be giving the commission that is their role is to advise us on parks the responsibility to do that before we make the decisions in advance of the discussion before we curtail it and send it to them as a ready made project like we' re going to give card these parks. we have a motion and a second on the floor so on that motion and second I think we should wrap that up unless somebody is going to do a friendly amendment we need to move that forward. I propose a friendly amendment I guess it' s just backing for it we send it first the bidwell parks and playgrounds commission these questions. and that was a friendly amendment? it could have been. okay I' m sorry so the motion that I have is to direct staff to work with card to discuss this bring it back when it comes back I would like to ask the commission to review the park commission and obviously with those identified areas then it would also then go to review after the council hears it first it would then go to the parks the park commission the bidwell park and playground commission. if I may jump in as I mentioned in my original comments I' m fine with them weighing in and what sequence that is I' m not that concerned but I want to get something going I want to get that discussion started we don' t even know where we' re going to go with this we have to s get this moving. would you accept having it go staff and card staff are going to determine what it is but then bring it to the parks and playgrounds commission we see it next with their having weighed in and having recommendations. if it does not delay this conversation too long I would be okay with that. all right. motion and a second. I do understand what it is. thank you. council member goldstein. aye. council member holly. yes. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. mayor Reynolds. aye. item 5.5 council member winslow. butte county tax sharing agreement. there' s a little theme of interagency things going on here right now I' m just now seeing. I had asked to have a discussion I appreciate everybody for approving it on tax share agreements there' s a really complicated detailed history going back I did not know all of it when I first brought this up I had made mentions of this city county tax share agreements there' e property tax and sales tax I had gotten these really extreme reactions from people and some of that suggested to me there was something not right with it all I had some conversations with ms. sorenson he sent further information to us since then and I' m my sense is what I' ve concluded through all my research which came out in this report is that there is grounds I think to say that the city of chica ought to be apportioned more of the overall tax revenue the fact that butte county has passed their own measure h is not the first time that this has been s kicking in April 1st gives them the opportunity to be secure with their budget and this is the best time we' re going to have to reconsider this kind of thing one thing I learned is not the first time this has been brought up and of course when this was set in 1987 it was on the heels of lawsuits back and forth there was three from the city five from the county something like that but there was a lot of hostility around it I don' t see any basis for us to have that question is what leverage does the city have to be requesting more tax be apportioned and the answer is nothing like a lawsuit kind of leverage but four out of five county supervisors do represent like a lot more parts of chico and the other also represents incorporated areas something some math that I did on some population data is in 1990 something like 42 percent of the county population lived in incorporated areas now it' s over 70 percent that' s over 70 percent in 1990 to now so that' s significantly changed when these were set the county was responsible for a lot of areas we had what we set was essentially a an agreement with a portion to justify chico annexing the areas within our urban sphere and so we wouldn' t have contest from the county over them losing tax revenue but we' ve had now in particular since 2018 is a significantly higher proportion of the county population lives within these areas so they I think we have to rely on our police in our fire department for safety they drive on our streets and the quality of our streets is the biggest determinant to like do they have smooth roads it' s not in the county so much anymore and that also means we have more costs associated with that we look at how many firefighters and police officers we have per population we just have more overall in a greater share so my sense in all this is just to say that I think there' s a basis for us to make the argument I don' t have the whole argument constructed now and I think moving forward with this would either be requesting some additional input from staff probably the finance committee is an appropriate place to send this in order to have some additional review we can come up with sort of a basic idea of what we would like to request in terms of sales tax property tax and why and then we get feedback from the county and we sort of like you know talk it out as friendly governments who share a lot of the population you know thank you. any questions or thoughts? councilmember or vice mayor. I was wondering where you were going with this because I could not tell from everything that you had put before us but you' re proposing to go to butte county and ask them for some money. yeah. so ask. simple.! based on something that we might be able to put together to show them a compelling reason why they would give us some money. the people of butte county would benefit from it. that' s what you' re asking. thank you. any other comments for council member winslow? first of all I want to commend council member winslow for doing the work on this. and it does appear on the surface that we are not being appropriately compensated. how exactly we convince the county to give us more money is not clear to me without some sort of leverage. the other thing I want to point out is that the finance department is in the middle of budget season and so I' m very sensitive to burdening them with the money that we need to get to. this but certainly we could take it on in the finance committee and do some work on it. I' m seeing a good reason not to look at this other than that it' s going to consume some staff time and I don' t want to put that on them right now because you' re in the middle of budgets. fair. do we have any speakers on this item? none. okay. I' m going to entertain either further discussion or a motion. so I agree with you. but I think another component might be to allow us to form an ad hoc committee. we could invite some of the county personnel and sit down and talk. you don' t want to. I will note that we have the local government committee both council member van overbeck and I sit on it. we have quarterly meetings to kind of like space department. that would be the best part but it' s something we could pick up there. we get into the details of things in that. if we send it to finance committee then from there you guys could. we would probably also talk about it in the local government committee regardless of it in finance committee. that probably is a good place for it to be. at least a discussion is local government committee. that' s both entities. the two entities that are involved that would make sense. I just don' t know how receptive they' re going to be to giving us more money. maybe something we need to keep in our back pocket for a while when other conversations come up and negotiations come up but I' m just not sure how receptive they' re going to be to those conversations. that makes sense. for anybody who doesn' t know five out of seven of council members and four out of five county supervisors have to approve any amendment to this. it' s not like you scrape by with a bare majority on this. people really do have to see this is a benefit for the majority of people in butte county which happened to live about in chicago. people in chicago now. other incorporated areas also have a similar stake in this conversation. can I ask you Mr. Morrison because you know a lot about this. you sent us a ton of documents which I leafed through on this. as far as sending it to finance committee to take a closer look do you think based on the information we have available you have available you can take a closer look or would it really call for some investment of staff time in order to advance the conversation? I think finance is a good place to start. I think it' s a good place to start. I think it' I think it' but at some point as some of you have alluded to we would have to come up with some compelling argument for why we think the shares should be tilted in our favor. some of those documents you sent us on other tax sharing agreements they calculated the cost of services in the area and they looked at the bid budgets of the individual governments and said who' s really struggling for this and that. that sounds like a lot of work. it' s a lot of work. plus the fact that some of the comparisons are not really for example that 2017 comparison was very I will go with crude. it didn' t take under consideration much. for example you could compare us to reading but reading has its own electric utility we don' t. they have their own water utility we don' t. we have card they don' t. they have their own recreation district. electric card gets a share of the property taxes. there' s always you will never find another city that' s a perfect match. trying to draw comparisons is difficult. and then the other thing you encounter as you look through many if not most of the tax sharing agreements that have been pursued this century they' re done annexation by annexation. and I can' t even imagine what an administrative nightmare that thank you.! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively support the claim? I started out thinking the answer was no but then by the time I sat down with the county c. A. O. And I think their controller at the time pretty much sat down and said never mind. Let' s just move on because I didn' t see how you could make a compelling claim that we were disproportionately supported and one of the things I' ll point out is you' re drawing a distinction between what' s county jurisdiction and city jurisdiction but even in the city we are butte county citizens so we do enjoy the services of behavioral health and welfare system the jail the district attorney it' s environmental health etc. Be prepared for those counterarguments. I had some similar discussions with the questions around measure h when people are asking me to endorse it. It seems like good conversations to have. Like I said I think now is the time if ever it makes sense. Even if back in 2012 2013 you said this was an equitable arrangement or compared to other cities comparable cities it was an equitable arrangement since the camp fire chico has had more of the population for the county and the projections are that' s going to continue to increase. increases in property tax values and sales tax revenue. do we have a motion? I think my motion would be if it' s okay with the finance committee folks who all happen to sit next to each other over there that we would motion to put this on a future finance committee agenda with perhaps a little bit further analysis by staff but not so much as to burden budget season. I' m okay with finance taking a look at it. But I think it' s a good idea. s a good idea. But I think it' s a good idea. But I don' t want to ask staff to do anything substantial at this point and I think well maybe I can confer with Ms. Martin but I' m very sensitive to that. But certainly finance can take a look at it. Mark sent a big document dump on Friday afternoon. Thanks a lot Mark I popped my first beer and then I got this email from Mark and he wrecked my weekend.
