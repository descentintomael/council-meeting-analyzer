 review after the training has concluded or if you want to share the recording with someone  you're more than welcome to do so. I'm also going to go ahead and I'm going to share my screen with  everyone. All right so you should be seeing my screen at this point in time. I'm showing a  PowerPoint presentation. So what we're going to do is we're going to go through this PowerPoint  presentation for the beginning of the training and then we'll actually jump into the content  of the training. So we'll go through the peak minutes process.  All right so this is the peak group training specifically focused on how to take your  minutes in the system. Today is February 16th of 2022.  All right so this first slide here just outlines all of the different group training sessions.  The first session is the overview and training training.  administration session. That's where we walk you through the back end of your PEAK system and how  to configure your PEAK system. The second session is the drafter and approver session where we talk  about how to draft agenda items and then subsequent to that how to approve agenda items.  Our third session is the agenda coordinator session. That's where we talk about putting  together the agenda for your meetings. And then the fourth session is the PEAK minute session.  So in this session we will cover how to complete our minutes in PEAK. We'll start with taking a  roll call and going over how to take motions and notes. We will also discuss how to complete  basically the PEAK minutes. We will go overhead, generate, download, and publish our minutes  to our view page. Just as a little disclaimer, if you're not using PEAK to do your minutes,  if you're using Live Manager and Minutes Maker,  you don't have to do that. You can do that by clicking on the button on the top right hand side.  You don't need to attend this session. So if there's anyone on the phone that is using Live  Manager and like HTML Minutes or Minutes Maker, you're welcome to go ahead and jump off. I'm not  going to be offended, but you won't need the content in this session.  All right, so class is in session. Day four of our adventure nears an end. So what we're going to  cover today is we're going to cover how to access minutes in the PEAK system. We're going to talk  about taking a roll call and confirming attendance. We're going to discuss how to add items to our  minutes. We're going to cover how to take motions, notes, and assign one vote to multiple items.  So basically in the same section like consent items. We're going to talk about generating  our minutes and show how it looks once the minutes are generated as a document.  We're going to talk about how to publish to the view page and show how to unpublish as well.  We're going to talk about how to publish to the view page and show how to unpublish as well.  Then go into creating a new item and attach the minutes for meeting body considerations like the  next agenda item minutes, approval minutes. Show how to download minutes in Word and make manual  edits for future use and upload minutes, the minutes from Word. And then we'll go over Q&A.  Excuse me. So we are live. Everyone in the session will get a copy of this recording.  After the session. And then finally, if you have any questions, you can go ahead and put those  questions in the chat window. I'm happy to address those questions as we go through the content this  morning. I do ask that you keep your questions more generic versus specific to your site and  setup. So just because we have a number of different agencies on the phone this morning,  excuse me.  Make sure that those questions would benefit everyone on the phone. So I do ask that you keep  them just more standard questions. And if you have specific questions to your site and your setup,  that you email those to your trainer and your project manager.  All right. All right. So let's go ahead and let's jump into the PEAK system here. All right. So  logging into PEAK. So if you've been on another session, you've seen this before, but I'll just  review how to get into PEAK.  So PEAK is an entirely web-based application. There's no need to do any kind of local installs  or local downloads. You can access PEAK entirely through the web. And your URL should look something  like youragency.granticus.com. Mine is university or granticusuniversityatgranticus.com. Okay. And  yours would be something specific to your agency. Then I'm going to type in my username and password.  So you'll just type in your agency and password. And then I'm going to type in my username and password.  If you do forget your password, there is a forgot password link right here that allows you to  send yourself an email to reset your password if you do forget your password.  I'm going to go ahead and hit sign in here.  System loves to be just temperamental. Just a moment here. All right. So when you initially  log in, kind of depending upon how your account is configured, you may see PEAK pop up automatically  or you may be directed to this page here. This is called our media manager page. Our media manager  page has a variety of basically purposes with it. But its primary purpose is that if you're  streaming with Granticus, it is the archive repository. So it'll ask for you to go back and  watch recordings of meetings. In addition to that, it also has a lot of other things that you can do.  It also allows for you to manage your media settings. So like if you're wanting to record your  meeting, for example, but you don't want to live stream that meeting, you can configure the settings  within this site here. This site does have a couple of purposes, though, for customers who are just  using PEAK. It does have a couple of purposes or it ties into PEAK in some capacity. And one of the  things that this site has is that it has what we call the view  page. So we can go in and we can access the view page. Now, the view page is essentially the page  that once you're live, your citizens will go to to access like the link to the published agendas,  agenda packet and the minutes. So you can actually see a preview of that page directly from this site  here. That's where we're actually going to start is looking at the view page. So I'm going to go  ahead and go to administration here. So there's a number of different pages that we can go through.  And you'll see a little bit more information at the bottom, a little bit more information at a little  of that view page in another browser.  Now this is gonna look a little bit different  because this page will actually be embedded  onto your site in some capacity  once you go live with your system.  So it will be embedded, but this just gives you an idea  of how it's gonna look once it's embedded.  You may have seen this page in other sessions.  So if you've been in other training sessions,  you may have seen this before,  but essentially the way that this page is laid out  is that it has two primary sections,  this upcoming event section, and then this past meetings,  or we call it prior meeting content.  So the past meetings or upcoming, or excuse me,  upcoming events is basically gonna show  your upcoming meetings.  So if you go on peak and you schedule a meeting  in the system, you're gonna see that meeting shown here,  kind of dependent upon when the date of that meeting occurs.  When you publish the agenda in the agenda packet,  you're gonna see those options showing here  as well, as you can see here with the city council meeting.  Now today though, we're focused on the minutes.  So this would be located, our minutes would be located  in our prior meeting content,  because we will be doing our minutes  after the meeting occurs, it's a past meeting.  I'm gonna go ahead and dive into my city council,  cause I'm gonna be working with my city council today.  And so once I open up my city council section here,  I'm gonna see this meeting city council,  a Kirstens task for minutes training,  you can see the date of that meeting,  was February 15th,  so happened yesterday at nine o'clock a.m.  We can see that the agenda,  and the agenda packet has been published here,  but we don't have a link to our minutes,  so we have no link toward minutes showing.  So, this is the goal of our training today,  is to get the minutes link,  just like this February 10th meeting,  and just like this meeting here,  just show up on our view page,  our public is gonna be able to click on that link,  I'll just go a little further,  ahead and click on this link and then that would open up the minutes for that meeting okay  so that's going to be our ultimate goal today  right so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to just keep this tab open but i'm going to go ahead  and jump back to my media manager site and then to get to peek from here because we want to start  working on our minutes okay we want to start working on editing our minutes and then getting  them ready to publish so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and click on this apps menu  here at the top and then i'm going to go ahead and click on peak agenda now once i click on peak  agenda by default i am brought to the home screen or the dashboard of my peak application just as a  refresher that the dashboard of the home screen basically what what this page does is that it  grabs various data from your page system and it presents it here so we can see information like  this and then we can see the page that we want to publish and then we can see the page that we  want to publish and then we can see the page that we want to publish a tally of how many agenda items  we've submitted in the system how many items we need to review if we're like in a reviewer and we  can see our scheduled meetings now if i click on my back arrow here i went ahead and i located my  meeting this is the meeting that i'm going to be using for training purposes today this tuesday  february 15th city council meeting and if i go ahead and i give that meeting a click  okay once i give that meeting a  click then it's going to bring me to my agenda template builder here  so if you've been in an agenda session agenda coordinator session your trainer should have ran  through this information with you like how to configure your agenda and how to publish your  agenda once you publish your agenda at least once just the agenda you don't publish the packet but  just the agenda once you publish that agenda at least once by clicking this publish option here  you're going to see a list of the agenda that you've submitted and then once you've submitted  a training item you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're going  to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're  going to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little further  you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little  further you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're going to go a  to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're  going to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little further  you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little further you're going to go a little further  of the dashboard. But next to the dashboard, we have this meetings tab. The meetings tab is  basically going to show us the scheduled meetings by default for the current month, which is February.  Okay. So we can see our scheduled meetings for February. And we can, of course, change like the  view of this screen here. But over here on the left hand side, we're going to see a list of  scheduled meetings. And so if I scroll on this list here, I can then go in and locate my meeting.  This is my city council Kirsten's task for minutes training. And I can see that I have my minutes  link here. So this is the link to my minutes for this meeting. And if I click on that link,  it also then in turn brings me to where I can go in and edit my minutes.  If I click back on that screen, just as a point of reference,  you'll see that I have my minutes. And if I click on that link, it also then in turn brings me to  notice that some of these meetings don't have a link to the minutes. Well, the reason they don't  have a link is just because the agenda has not been published. So you do have to publish the  agenda at least once before you can see that link to your minutes. Just as a quick point of  reference, these other tabs at the top here, I'm sure you've seen them already. This items tab,  this just allows me to search for agenda items that have been  previously created in the system. There's a number of different ways I can search on this tab here.  The create new option allows me to create a new meeting. So it's to schedule a new meeting or  to schedule an agenda item. And then the administration tab allows me to configure  the backend of my system. So this is where I can go in and set up information like my meeting body,  my meeting body members. I can set up like my templates or my meeting types.  And we will come back to this administration section once we get to a certain parts  of a minutes training, i'll revisit this.  Alright, so let's go ahead, though, and let's access our minutes, so i'm just going to come to this meetings tab here,  i'm going to go ahead, locate my minutes,  for my February 15th meeting, just go ahead and click on the link here,  and then that's going to bring you to my minutes.  minutes. All right, so once I'm in my minutes here, this is where I can go in and I can process the  minutes for my meeting. You'll notice at the top here we have just some information on our meeting,  so it has the meeting body. It has the meeting location, so where this meeting took place.  We have the date of the meeting, and then we have the time that the meeting occurred, from 9 a.m.  to 10 a.m., and those are pulling from the details of my meeting. If I'm wishing to get back to my  agenda, I can click on this view agenda, and it brings me back to the agenda template builder  where the agenda was essentially built out for this meeting, and then I have the ability, as I  mentioned, to click on this view minutes here, and that's going to bring me back to my minutes  for this meeting, so I have a capacity to toggle back and forth between the agenda and the minutes.  Now, to give you a layout of this screen, on the left-hand side here, we're going to see the agenda  for this meeting, so we're going to see the headers, and we're going to see the agenda items for this  meeting. On the right-hand side here is where we're going to be able to go in and record our  actions for this meeting, so we're going to be able to go in and record like our mover and  seconder here, how our members voted, and any discussions that we had with the members.  Okay, you'll see a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  information, a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  information, a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  information, a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  information, a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  information, a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  information, a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  information, a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  information, a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  information, a little bit more information, a little bit more information, a little bit more  present and who is absent at this meeting. You have the capacity to edit this roll call.  If you want to edit it after you've saved it, you can always go back in and make modifications or  changes. To take my roll call, I'm just going to click on this roll call button here, and that's  going to bring up my list of members. So you'll notice that I have six members for this meeting  body. I have Betty Smith, Charlene, Amy, Doug, Sean, and then Gina Smith.  I have the ability to mark the member as present, absent, or a voting member.  Now you may be asking, where is this information pulling from? So how is the system getting this  data? Well, if I duplicate this tab, so I'm just going to just duplicate this tab here,  and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and pop into administration here. So the  back end of my peak system, because I mentioned that we were going to visit administration a  couple times during this training. So when we go into administration, by default, we land on the  meeting body section. The meeting body section is going to list all of my meeting bodies  in my peak system. So you may just have one meeting body, or you may have multiple.  I am working with my city council today, so I'm going to go ahead and locate my city council  right down here.  And I'm going to go ahead and click on my pencil icon. Now when I click on my pencil icon,  by default, I'm brought to the details tab. So this is just showing information like the location,  the default location, the time, things like that. But then I have the second tab here,  which says members. And so if I click on my members tab, that is going to list all of my  members. So this is how the system is getting this list. Betty Smith, Charlene, Amy is from  this list of members.  So I'm going to go ahead and click on my members tab here. Betty Smith, Charlene, Amy, Doug, Sean, and Gina.  Okay.  Now on this tab here, we're able to see information like office enroll, start and end date, and status  here. That information doesn't pull on that roll call list. Okay.  And then just as a point of reference here, the system looks at this status to see whether  somebody is an active member or like their term is completed or maybe were terminated for some reason.  Okay. So this status is what basically pulls the members onto this list here. It's what the system  looks at to see whether somebody is an active member or they're a historical member. If they're  a historical member, then they wouldn't pull on that list, of course. So the start and end date is  just for reference purposes, but this is actually what's telling the system who is an active member  of the meeting body. Also determines the order as well. So you can see Betty Smith, Charlene,  Amy, and Doug, you can see those people are pulling an order on this list. So if you do have a particular  order that you want your members to show in, you want to make sure that's configured on this list  here. Now, another thing that when you're adding a meeting body member, so if I click add member,  that allows me to add a meeting body member. But if I just click this pencil icon next to Betty  Smith's name, you will notice that there's a checkbox here that says voting member. And that  just allows us to see if there's a meeting body member that's a member of the meeting body. So  that's a very important thing to do. And then you can also add a meeting body member to determine  whether Betty Smith is a voting member or not a voting member. To give you an example, I have  customers where they have staff members that show up on their attendance list, but they're not  actually, you know, participating in the voting, but they're part of the roll call. So they'll add  them to this list, but they'll uncheck them as a voting member. Or like, for example, sometimes  the mayor is not a voting member. And so if that is the case, you can uncheck that person.  Now, you can always in this roll call list here, you can always mark somebody as a voting member. If  they aren't listed by default as a voting member in the members list, you can check them here or you  can always uncheck them. All right, so let's go ahead and let's pretend like Amy Saunders  was absent for the meeting. So I'm going to go ahead and mark Amy as absent.  And we're going to go ahead and say that Gina Smith is not a voting member.  In my notes field here, I can put in a note and say, for example, why Gina Smith was not at the,  or excuse me, Amy Saunders was not at the meeting. So I could say Amy had a family.  Okay, so I can put in a little note there that Amy was not present at the meeting. And then I can go  ahead and click on confirm again. And then I can go ahead and click on confirm again. And then I can  go ahead and click on confirm again. And then I can go ahead and click on confirm,  and then you'll see a little thing that you'll see a little thing that you'll  you'll see a little thing that you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll  you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll  you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll  you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll  you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll  is not showing on that voting list, okay, because she was marked as absent, okay.  You have the capability to mark somebody as absent for just a particular vote. So, let's say you have  a member that, for example, was present for most of the meeting but came in, let's say, during awards  and recognitions, and let's say you want to vote on this item for employee of the month, you can  mark somebody as absent for that particular item, but then once we come down to consent agenda,  they could be marked as voting for the item or items.  All right, so that's the roll call. If I click roll call here, you can edit the roll call at  any point in time, okay. Also, we'll notice that Gina Smith is not marked as a voting member,  therefore, we do not see her name showing up on this voting list here, okay.  All right, so looking at our agenda here, another thing that we can do is we can click on this add  item, and this allows us to add an agenda item to our minutes. Now, if we add an agenda item here,  it doesn't come back to our agenda template builder here, it only adds that item to this  left section here. So, if you have an item that was added during your meeting, and you want to  go ahead and add that item to your agenda item, you can do that by clicking on the add item button.  So, if you have an item that was added during your meeting, and you want to go ahead and add that item to your agenda item,  To show here, you can use this add item feature. Now, the feature is very basic in nature.  The thing that you can do, or the only thing really you can do, is you can add the title of  the item in any note, but we can't add any sort of like attachments from here,  or any other like discussion information, or suggested action. The only thing we can do is  we can add the title, okay. So, just note that this feature is very limited in its nature.  If I click on this add item option, then I can go in and I can add the title of my item.  So, I'm going to say, Kirsten's test item for training today.  Then I have my section here. My section is going to be where I want to place this item.  So, let's say I want to put it under awards and recognitions, I can go ahead and I can add that  section. And then I have my notes field. So, my notes just allows me to add any sort of conversation,  or any sort of discussion for this item. So, I can say discussion for the item goes here.  And I can add this discussion once I save the item. So, then if I go ahead, I typed in the title,  the section of where I want to place the item, and then I added a note here, and I'm going to  go ahead and hit save item. Once I hit save item, you can see it adds that item under my awards and  recognitions. You can see it does not have a number assigned to it. Okay. So, it doesn't have  that 3B, another limitation of this feature. But what's nice is I'm going to show you that in just  a moment, you can basically push this data to Microsoft Word. And then once you push the data  to Microsoft Word, you're going to have all of the editing rights that you normally do in Microsoft  Word. And one of the things you could do in Word is you could go in and add that number. Okay.  Now, if you add the number in Microsoft Word, then of course it would not come back over to this  system here. But what a lot of times customers will do is they'll do as much as they can in the  peak minutes system here, and then they'll export their data and finish up what they need to finish  up in Word just because the limitations that this section has. All right. So, I went in and I added  my test item here. If there is a limitation, I can just go ahead and add that in here. So,  you can just press a little daddy daddy, daddy daddy, daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy  daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy  daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy  daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy Starting at the top here, so we'll just start at the top of our agenda and work our way down. I'm going to go ahead and click on this first item here, which is my call to order. Now once I click on my call to order, I'm going to see the title of that header showing here. By default, I see my motion tab here, although this is not a header or an item that we are going to be motioning on.  daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy  By default, I see my motion tab here, although this is not a header or an item that we are going to be motioning on.  OK, so I won't talk about this information right now.  But what I am going to do is I'm going to jump over to my notes section here.  In my notes section, I'm going to go ahead and add a note and I'm going to type in my note and I'm going to say the meeting was called to order at 10.  1130 a.m. by Council Member Smith.  OK, so I just typed in a note there.  This field right here is what we've seen in other areas in PEAK.  It is a rich text editor field.  And so we can go in and we can change the style of text.  So if I want to change it to something other than Arial.  I can change it there.  I can bold.  I can add bullet points.  I could add like a table, for example, and I can even paste into this field as well.  Now, once I've added my note, I do want to make sure I click save.  So down here at the bottom right hand corner, there is a save option.  We just want to click that every so often just in case something were to happen, like our browser were to crash or computer were to crash.  Then we would have our data.  OK.  The system does not auto save for you.  So you do want to make sure just like other areas in PEAK that you do hit the save button.  The next order business is roll call.  We took a roll call up here so I could add a note if I wanted to, like another note to my roll call.  I already added one there, so I'm not going to add an additional note.  But just you can have.  You can have a roll call line and then you can actually I'll show you in just a minute where you can bring this this roll call down to under this line here using Microsoft Word.  On the next section we have is the awards and recognitions.  So the awards and recognition section.  This is not a section where I'm going to be voting on any items.  This is just a section and part of my agenda where I'm recognizing, you know, like employees and personnel such as that.  OK.  But I do have two agenda items under my awards and recognitions.  So if I click on this first item here, this employee of the month award to me and he said Sanchez for January of 2022.  When I click on that item, we can see in this top level section here we have the title of this item and then we also have the title of the header, which it applies to.  There is a trashcan icon here.  The trashcan icon allows me to delete the item.  Be careful that if you do delete an item off of your minutes, just know that you can't retrieve that item back once you've deleted it.  So make sure that you are intending to actually delete that item off of your minutes because you cannot get it back once it's deleted.  Now, it does pop up with a confirmation message.  Are you sure you want to delete this item?  And then you can cancel out of that action if needed.  OK.  Just be careful with using that trashcan.  Now, if I click on the motion for this item, like I mentioned, this is not a voting item.  We're not going to be voting on this employee of the month.  This is just something that was read during the meeting.  OK.  So if you have non-voting items, you can record actions for them.  Like some people will record an action of like received and filed.  But what most customers will do is they'll locate the notes field.  And they'll just type in a note if there's any notes they want to add.  So I say, Manny was proud of all the kids.  And then I'm going to go ahead and just hit save here.  And that adds that note.  That note's going to become a part of my minutes record.  OK.  This second item here, Kristen's test for training today.  OK.  And you'll notice that you'll see a little bit more information  that you'll be able to take a look at,  like a little bit more information you'll be able to take a look at,  like a little bit more information you'll be able to take a look at,  like a little bit more information you'll be able to take a look at,  like a little bit more information you'll be able to take a look at,  like a little bit more information you'll be able to take a look at,  like a little bit more information you'll be able to take a look at,  like a little bit more information you'll be able to take a look at,  like a little bit more information you'll be able to take a look at,  like a little bit more information you'll be able to take a look at,  Now, as you're working in the minutes, you do have the capability to download a preview of the minutes at any time.  So if I come up here and I click on the download option, once I click on the download option, it's going to give me three options.  Downloading the minutes as a document, a Word document, a PDF, or HTML.  I'm going to go ahead and click Word document because that's the most popular option and go ahead and click on download.  And then we can kind of get an idea of how our minutes are looking so far.  Now, when you click on the Word document and click download, it does take just a moment for those minutes to download.  And so once they're successfully downloaded, then we're going to see a preview of the minutes showing here.  Now, just keep in mind that these minutes are not published yet. We have not published them.  So they are still in draft at this point in time, but we can see what they're looking like thus far.  So at the top here, and this is where everyone's kind of system is going to vary because we all kind of have different needs as far as our minutes go.  But this just kind of gives you a general idea of how your minutes are going to look.  So at the top here we have this header information. So we have like the logo, we have the date and the time of the meeting, where the meeting occurred, and then we have this minutes line.  Now this right here, this is my attendance, the attendance that I took. We can see it says present Betty Smith.  This is Charlene and then it lists the members that were absent, which is Amy. Amy had a family emergency, therefore was absent during the meeting.  So that line does appear at the top, but if you want to add that attendance section under like a roll call section, you do have the capability  Let me enable editing here.  You do have the capability to copy and paste because we are in a Word document.  So any of these formatting options that we typically have in Word are going to be available in this instance as well. So I can take that information, copy it.  And then under my roll call here, I can go ahead and paste that information and it may take a little bit of trial and error to kind of get it how we want it to look.  So I'm going to delete that. Okay. And then I'm going to unfold this. I guess I may take a little bit of trial and error.  Okay, but now I have my roll call.  Showing under my roll call line here. Okay.  And of course, if you want to format this roll call differently, you know, I could say present and then I can have, you know, everyone on a different line if I wanted to.  Like I said, what you have currently right now in Microsoft Word is the options you'll have in here as well because we're essentially just in Word at this point. Okay.  And then if I scroll down here, there's my awards and recognitions. We can see that there's our note for my awards and recognitions. There's my note here.  There's my note for my attendance as well. Okay, so there's my attendance note. And if I need to, you know, copy information like I just did with my roll call, you know, paste it somewhere else, I can do that as well.  Alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and minimize this one.  And then I can go to my calendar here.  Let's go back here to our minutes.  So the next item of business we have is invocation and pledge. This is not something we vote on, but I can go into my notes tab here. Verify I have the correct header selected and I can go ahead and type in a note.  And I could say like  Bob Smith led the pledge and Pastor  And then I can go ahead and hit save to save that data.  Then we have this presentation sections. Like I said, everyone's section is kind of going to vary. So I could, if there's any presentations on the city manager, I could list that information here. If not, just continue moving forward.  Now this next section is going to be my public hearing section.  And so  Some of you may not record, like if you have public speakers, you may not record who spoke at the meeting. But if you do in this public to be heard, you can add notes here and you can say  Members of the public, which member of the public came and spoke and what specifically they spoke about. So I could say  John Doe came and spoke about XYZ  Jane Doe  Okay, you can you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you  that sometimes clients will ask me is,  can I use peak minutes during the meeting?  You absolutely can use peak minutes during the meeting.  I will say that it's not built to be used during the meeting  just because of how the navigation works,  but it doesn't mean that you can't use it  when you're in the meeting.  All right, so coming down, we have this consent agenda.  I don't know, for some reason,  we have duplicates of our consent header.  So the next sort of business that we have  is our consent agenda.  I'm actually gonna come back to my consent agenda  just once we've done a couple of individual motions  and votes for items.  So we'll come back to that in just a little bit.  So I'm gonna go ahead and jump down  to my first reading of ordinances here.  This first item we have under my first reading of ordinances  is my purchase of a new coffee maker  for my parks department.  So let's say I want to record the motion  and the vote information for this item.  So I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to select that item.  I'm gonna verify that I have this item selected.  Here's my trashcan icon,  which will allow me to delete this item off of my minutes  if I want to delete it.  This is where I can add any sort of discussion notes.  I could say, for example,  like, there was a item,  Council, make sure,  you are a great, [inaudible]  I'm just putting in some test data here for my notes and go ahead and click on save here.  So I just added some notes here. Now, like I said, you can add any discussion or  any sort of just additional data that you want to add. Okay, so we added a note there. You will say  I do have the body of the note showing here. Because this is a longer note, it does cut off  in this section, but I can always come to this notes tab to view the full body of the note.  Now, when I'm ready to go ahead and take a motion on this item, I'm going to go ahead and hit motion  here. Let me refresh my screen. I'm being a little temperamental today. I'm going to go back to that item.  All right, so I have this item selected and I'm ready to record how my members voted for this  item and the motion on the floor. So the first thing that we have in here is this motion text.  The motion text is the one that shows the item that you voted for. So I'm going to go ahead and  hit the motion text. I'm going to go ahead and hit the motion text. So I'm going to go ahead and  text is a little bit tricky when you initially see the motion text. It's a little bit  tricky to get used to, but once you kind of get used to it and do a couple of items, then it will  become much easier. It's just when clients are seeing the motion text initially, it can be a  little bit confusing just because of how it's set up. But basically in this motion text here,  what you're going to add in the motion text is what is the motion on the floor?  Well, for this item, it's to purchase new coffee maker for the parks department.  So in my motion text, I'm going to say purchase a new coffee maker for the parks department office.  Now you can copy and paste into this field. So I can take this title here and I can copy and  paste into this field. The only thing you have to be kind of careful of is when you're copying  and pasting is formatting.  Just because if you're pasting from another source, that's not your default font, style, and  font size, it will change that information.  So you want to make sure that once you paste into this field, that you adjust the formatting  appropriately.  Alright, then we have a motion two, so the motion two is, what is the motion on the floor?  Is the motion to approve a new coffee maker for the parks department office, is it to refer  this item?  item? Is it to adopt the item? Do we want to continue the item? So we're going to select the  appropriate motion to, and I'm going to see the motion is to approve this item. So I'm going to  go ahead and find approve. Now you can start typing into this drop down here. It can be a  little bit kind of tricky when you're trying to type. So I'm just going to select the option here  of approve. Okay. And just as a point of reference here, where it says motion to, just as a point of  reference as to where this data is pulling from, these motion to options, that's going to be back  in our peak administration. So if I'm back here within peak administration, I click on this admin  tab, and then I click on this minutes section, there's a motion to and a motion result. If I  click on the motion to, I can see that I have a motion to. So if I click on the motion to,  this is where all of my motion types are pulling from. So basically this list right here is pulling  from this section here. All right. So I'm going to select approve here. Then what I'm going to do is  I'm going to come over and select my mover and my seconder. Now, just something to keep in mind  that our training database is a little bit wonky with this information and it has some extra data  here that you shouldn't be seeing in your system. But basically we have a mover and a seconder  column here. So this is where I'm going to go in and I'm going to mark the mover and seconder.  I just realized, let me do this. I realized that the mover checkbox disappears. So let me refresh  my screen and come down.  Let me see if we can get that. That's interesting. Hmm. Okay. Well, there should be a checkbox here  that says mover. So you can record your mover. For some reason that is not showing. Like I said,  this is a test system, so we can have to take it with a grain of salt. But here I'm going to go  ahead and just record my mover and my seconder. We'll just actually pretend like I recorded my  mover and record my seconder.  So there should be just a line of checkboxes here to record my mover, my seconder. And then I have  the option to mark for, against, abstain, and absent. Now the rest of these abstain, yes, no, and  recuse, these should not be showing either. So that's kind of a bug of our training system. So  ignore and disregard these last four here. But I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to say,  um,  the ! Doug was four, Charlene was four. I'm thinking what happened. I think this is actually, this is  my mover column and this is my seconder. I think just the screen is off. So mover, seconder column,  and then this is my four columns. So four against, abstain, and absent. Sorry, I know that's a little  bit confusing. So essentially, if I click the mark all four, what it's going to do is it's going to  apply for the second column. So if I click the mark all four, what it's going to do is it's going to apply  for next to everyone's name. So, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,  your data in this screen here.  So it'll wipe out all of this data.  And then you can restart over marking  your four and your second are.  All right, so motion text here, I  think my motion text got wiped out.  So I'm just going to add that information back.  That's where I'm going to add the motion text here.  And then motion two, I wanted to say that it was to approve.  And then the last thing we want to add is the results.  So we're going to look at our voting result.  We're going to see how everyone voted.  And I'm going to go ahead and record that voting result.  So I have a number of voting results  here, adopted with conditions, adopted, passed,  failed for lack of second.  We're going to go ahead and say that this item did pass.  Now, this results dropdown here is also  pulling from peak administration,  specifically in my motion text.  So I'm going to go ahead and add my motion results here.  In my motion results, you can see  we have a number of different motion results, passed, failed,  for lack of second, adopted, carried unanimously.  So you can put all of your different motion  results in the system here.  Then they're going to carry over to this results section here.  Then I'm going to go ahead and do a save.  Once I do a save, then that's going  to add my motion information.  Purchase of new coffee maker for parks department office.  We can see that my motion did pass here.  I have a visual indicator.  I also have this M icon here.  If I need to delete this motion, I can click on my X here,  and that will remove the motion.  And then if, let's say, I'm in a different area of peak,  but I need to edit my motion, I can click on this motion tab  here, and I can go back and make any changes or adjustments  to any of these fields.  And then once I'm done, I'm going to hit save.  We also have the capability when we record a motion  to click New Motion here.  So I can click New Motion, and then I  can add a second motion, which we'll do in just a moment.  So that is how to take a motion and a vote on an item.  We're going to go ahead and move on to the next item  in our first reading of ordinances.  So I'm just going to click on Item 9B.  I'm verifying that I have an Item 9B selected here,  Purchase of New Golf Clubs for the Team.  OK.  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and start  with my motion tab here.  And in my motion text, I'm going to go ahead and add my motion  text, so Purchase of New Golf Clubs for the Team.  OK.  Then in my motion too, we're going to go ahead and say,  OK.  The motion is to approve a motion.  I know, I just skipped over it.  OK, approve there, OK, so my motion's to approve,  and then I'm going to Bebop over here  and record my mover, and my secondary,  and how my members voted.  So just remember, these checkboxes  here are all by a one column.  So this right here is my mover, this right here, a daddy,  here is my seconder for against abstain absent. I'm going to go ahead and say that for this motion,  I have a mover, but let's say I don't have a seconder. So the motion, let's say, dies on the  floor. So I'm actually going to clear this information out. Okay. So I'm going to work  forward my mover, but we're going to say actually that the original motion on this floor was to  approve, but we're going to say that this failed for a lack of second. Actually,  say approve, but then the result was it failed for a lack of second.  Okay. All right. So the original motion on this floor was to approve golf clubs for the team. We  had a mover, but we had it failed for a lack of second. Therefore, the motion died on the floor.  So then I'm going to go ahead and click save. So that's going to add that  first motion here at the top. Failed due to lack of second. Okay. Let's say though that there's a  second motion on the floor. Okay. So let's say that somebody re-motions on this item. So there's  a new motion. What I'm going to do is I'm going to click new motion here, and that allows me to  generate a second motion. Okay. So in my motion text here, I can add, let's say that this motion  on the floor was to purchase.  Three new golf clubs for the team. Okay. Let's say they actually needed three instead of just  one set of golf clubs. So in my motion text there, I'm going to say purchase of three new golf clubs  for the team. We're going to say the motion was to approve. And we're going to say this time there  is a mover and seconder. I'm going to do mark all four. We're going to say the motion did pass.  And we're going to say the result was that it did.  And then I'm going to click save. Okay. So this time,  you can see now we have this first motion here, purchase of new golf clubs. That motion failed  due to lack of second. And then we have a second motion on the floor, purchase of new golf clubs  for the team. I could even do a third and a fourth motion. The most I've seen is four motions on the  floor. That's generally though for,  large clients and in a different, different system. But you can do as many motions and  votes as you need it. So if you have three, let's say motions, we need to add,  you can continue adding those motions. If you need to edit an existing motion,  just want to make sure you click on that and then you can edit the information.  And if you want to remove a motion, you can click the X.  Let's check out what our minutes are looking like though. Once we've done a couple of these items,  recorded a couple of motions.  and votes on the items. So let's see if I click download here in WordDoc, click download, what  that's looking like. All right, so here's my motion or my minutes, excuse me. Okay, so I did  open up my minutes again, therefore it reverted my changes back to what I had before. So what you  want to do is make sure that you do enough within PEAK, you do all of your information  that you can within PEAK, record that information, and then export it to Word.  Just because if you make changes in Word and then you regenerate the Word document,  it's going to undo the changes you've made in Word. Okay, so here I have my minutes and  we've talked about this information. And then if I come down to my first reading of ordinances,  there is my first item here. This is just a note for the item. And then here is my voting  information. So it says moved by Betty Smith, seconded by Charlene Davis. Okay, there's my  mover and my seconder. And then we can see here is my motion text. So this right here  is that motion text. So it's pulling from this field right here. Okay, so you can kind of see,  how that comes in in your minutes. Sorry, I'm trying to do a side by side. So you can see that  that's how the motion text comes in. So it's kind of a little bit confusing initially in PEAK,  but once you see it as part of the generated minutes, it makes more sense because it follows  this motion line. This is what we're motioning to like approve or to adopt or recommend or  whatever the motion on the floor is. Then we can see a tally motion passed. We can see who voted  for the item.  Then we have our second motion here, purchase of new golf clubs for the team. This is my first  motion here, moved by Betty Smith, seconded by to approve new golf clubs for the team.  Motion failed due to lack of second zero to zero voting for voting against. And if I wanted to like  delete these, for example, I can remove those, of course, because I'm working in a Word document.  Then we have our second motion here, purchase of new golf clubs for the team. This is my first motion here,  moved by Betty Smith, seconded by to approve new golf clubs for the team. And if I wanted to like  delete these, for example, I can remove those, of course, because I'm working in a Word document.  Then we have our second motion on the floor, moved by Betty Smith, seconded by to approve new golf  clubs for the team. And if I wanted to like delete these, for example, I can remove those,  for example, I can remove those, for example, I can remove those, for example, I can remove  a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball,  a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball,  go ahead and minimize this page here and come back to my peak minutes. Okay. Now what I want to do  next is I want to talk about my consent agenda. So I mentioned that I do want to come back to my  consent agenda once we had done a couple of agenda items, just individual votes. Okay. Just because  it makes more sense kind of once we do individual votes than to do the consent agenda. So when you  are working with the consent agenda in the system, there is actually two ways to work with  the consent agenda. I'm going to show you both methods of how you can work with your consent  agenda. If that's something that you have on your agenda within peak, I'll show you the first method  first, which is typically the least popular option. It doesn't mean that you can't use it.  Just note that it's just going to be the least popular of what option clients choose. And then  I'm going to show you the most popular option. So I'm going to show you the most popular option  second. Okay. So the first option that you have for working with the consent agenda is you're  going to go in and you're going to select one item from the consent agenda, unless the exception to  this is unless that item was pulled. Okay. So I'm going to select an item that was not pulled from  my consent agenda. So we'll go ahead and say approval for St. Patrick's Day potluck with the  public works department.  Okay. So I'm going to select that item, verify that I have that item selected. And then in my motion  tab here in my motion text, I'm going to say in my motion text, something like consent agenda. Okay.  Then once I type in my motion text, I'm going to add what action the consent agenda had. So was the  action to approve the consent agenda? Okay. So I'm going to say, okay, so I'm going to say, okay,  you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda,  you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda,  you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda,  you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda,  you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda,  you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda, you are a consent agenda,  remover, and seconder. And we're going to go ahead and say that everyone voted for the consent agenda.  So I'm going to say for. Okay. Then my result, we're going to say the consent agenda did pass  and click save. Okay. Now, once I click and select that the result was that it passed.  So once I fill in basically all this information, then what's going to happen is I'm going to see  this button here down at the bottom that says apply to multiple items. And so if I click on that,  what that does is allows me to apply this motion and vote to the other two items listed under my  consent agenda. If an item was pulled from consent, then I could uncheck that box here.  If I click apply to selected items, what that's going to do is that's going to apply this motion  and vote information to all of the items that I've selected. So I'm going to click apply to that.  And then I'm going to click on the consent agenda. And then I'm going to click on the consent agenda.  Then if I go and I click download here and I run my Microsoft Word document,  we can see what that looks like. So it's basically just taking all the motion and  vote information and applying it to each item under my consent agenda.  So now if I open up my Word document and just click enable editing here,  then you can see that on my consent agenda, the system has applied that motion and vote  information moved by Doug, seconded by Charlene to adopt the consent agenda.  So it applies that information to each agenda item.  A lot of customers though, when they look at this, they're not huge fans on the motion and  vote information under each item for the consent agenda. So the second alternative,  to working with the consent agenda is applying this motion and vote information  under the header line itself. So in order to do that, so the other method for using the consent  agenda is that first, what I'm going to do is just delete all these motions here.  So I'm just going to come in and delete them.  So let's do that super quickly.  Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on this,  main consent header line here. So I'm selecting my consent agenda header line.  Then in my motion here, my motion text, I'm going to type consent agenda.  Okay. I'm going to record the motion. We'll go ahead and see the motion was to adopt  the consent agenda. So we'll go ahead and say adopt here.  Then I'm going to select my mover and my second.  And mark all four. And the result was that it did pass and click save.  Okay. So that applies my motion and vote information under my consent header line here.  Now in my notes field, if I click my notes, I could say, for example, item 8B was pulled  from consent and voted on individually. So I'm just indicating my notes field, for example,  if an item was pulled and clicking on save. Okay. Then I could return to item 8B if I click on item  8B here, and then I could take my motion on item 8B. Oops, I need to refresh this.  Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and click on that.  Okay, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  approve the item, it's passed by it. And the result was this item did pass. We'll say adopted  with conditions and click save. So we have the consent header line, okay, a motion vote on the  consent header line, and then this item was pulled. So I did an individual motion and vote for that  item. Then if we download our minutes, we can check out and see what that looks like.  And then if I scroll down, here's my consent agenda. So it says item 8B was pulled from  consent and voted on individually. There's my motion and vote information for my consent agenda.  There's my items here. And then there's my motion and vote for item 8B.  Okay. So two methods for using the consent agenda. Either you can have the motion and vote  information under each agenda item, or you can have the motion and vote information listed under  the main consent agenda line. And then if an item was pulled from consent, you can take a motion and  vote on that item. So that's the two methods for using the consent agenda. And then if an item was  pulled from consent, you can take a motion and vote on that item individually. Okay.  All right. So coming down here, we'll go ahead and do another motion and vote. This is just a,  we'll actually do this third reading of ordinance here. So this is just my third reading of  ordinance item. So I'm just clicking on this item here, verifying that I have the item selected.  And then in my motion text here, I'm going to type third.  And there is spell check. I myself am not a great speller. So that always comes in handy  when you're working with the minutes. And we're going to say for this item here,  there was a mover and seconder, but we'll go ahead and say this item did end up failing.  So I'm going to say everyone voted no. We'll say the motion on the floor was to approve the item,  but then the result was the item did end up failing.  Okay, and click Save.  And we can see now, we have that this item did fail, a third reading ordinance, Okay, so item did Not pass, Okay,  Okay, so item did Not pass, Okay,  then we have this closed section, a header here, so, if you do have a closed section, you're welcome to add any notes,  or, if you have any items that you vote on,  you're welcome to add any notes,  if you do have like a close session, those items are still going to appear on your minutes report  unless you delete them. So just know that they will be still be visible on your minutes report.  And then we have this adjournment section. So coming down to my adjournment section,  if I click on adjourn here, you can definitely vote on your adjournment if that's something that  you do. What typically a lot of customers will do is that in this motion to they'll add an action  of adjourn. So it says motion to adjourn, then they'll record the mover and the seconder. And  I'm going to say mark all four. Everyone's like, yes, we want to get done with the meeting.  And the result was, of course, that it did pass to adjourn the meeting because everybody wants  to be done. So we'll go ahead and say adjourn.  It's like pass here and click save. Okay. And then if I go and I download my minutes report,  we can check out and see how that looks.  And then if I scroll down to the bottom of my agenda here,  it says moved by Betty Smith, seconded by to adjourn.  So we can see that we have a motion passed voting for a voting against.  You could also go into if I get out of the screen here, you can go into your notes tab here. So we  can come to our notes and we can add a note. I could say beating was adjourned at  a.m. And then just type in a note there as well when the meeting was adjourned.  All right. All right. So we have got it and we've taken our roll call. We've taken notes. We've  taken motions and we've taken votes. Now, let's say that we have completed our minutes. So we  are done with our minutes. Okay. But before we can post our minutes, we have to actually have them  approved at the next meeting. Okay. So if this is something that we're going to do, we're going to  have to create your minutes, get them all done and then have them approved by your council or your  meeting body before they can actually be posted. This is the process that you'll follow. Okay.  So what you're going to do is you're going to download a copy of your minutes.  So I'm going to click download or doc download.  So I'm just download a copy of my minutes.  You'll want to make sure that you make all of your changes in Microsoft Word that you want to make.  So like, for example, if I want to move this section down  under my roll call, I'm just going to copy and paste.  Oh, I need to enable editing.  Oops.  I should cut this and then we're going to paste this.  I'm just going to change this.  Why those came over with numbers?  Bold.  Not in bold this.  Okay.  All right.  So let's say we made some changes in Microsoft Word too.  And now I'm ready to, to save these minutes to my computer.  So I'm going to go ahead and do a save.  Just save them.  Basically locally to my desktop or to my files.  I'm going to go ahead and just do a save here.  All right.  So I've saved a copy to my computer.  So I've saved a local copy to my computer.  Okay.  Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to close out of Word here.  Just get out of Word.  Okay.  And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to need to create an agenda item  with these minutes as an attachment.  Okay.  So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to follow the drafting process  where I'm actually going to get out of this minutes section entirely.  I'm going to come up and click on create new.  And then I'm going to select the option, which is agenda item.  And then select the appropriate template.  Now you may just have one template listed or you may have multiple.  It kind of depends on your site and your setup.  I'm going to go ahead and just select this basic template here.  And then in my template item title, this is where I'm going to fill in and say,  for example, like approval of minutes for the February 15th.  Then in my item type here, I'm going to go ahead and select the appropriate item type.  So you may have something like minutes as your item type.  And then I'm going to say the submitting department.  So you're just filling this in as if you're drafting item.  Drafter's name should come over.  And then in my meeting body, I'm going to select city council  because you're a city council minutes.  And then I'm just going to pick the next meeting date.  So the next meeting date is March 2nd.  So that's the date I want to put these minutes on.  Then in my agenda section here, I'm going to go ahead and say the section  where this item should go.  So we're going to say my minutes.  Go under my consent agenda here.  And then you may have some other details you may need to fill out.  This is just a test system.  So these are just kind of some test fields.  I'm just going to pull this information out.  And then in my pending uploads, this is where I'm going to go in  and grab my saved copy of my minutes.  So if I go to my files here, there's my minutes right here I've saved.  And then I'm going to go ahead and say, I'm going to close out of it.  I guess first.  So give me just a moment here.  I'm going to close all these tabs out here.  That should be fine.  All right.  I'm going to go ahead and grab my minutes now.  And there's my attachment right there.  OK.  So my attachment, my minutes that I just created has now come in my system.  And I can rename these and I could say minutes February 15th meeting  if I wanted to.  OK.  And then I'm going to go ahead and say create.  And that's what's going to create the agenda items.  So therefore, I can get these minutes approved at the next meeting.  OK.  And then there's my attachment for my minutes.  There's my minutes I just created.  OK.  All right.  Whoops.  Sorry about that.  Then you can go in and you can select a workflow if you need to select a workflow.  If you don't need to select a workflow, then you can just click set to approved.  And then the status would change to approved here.  OK.  All right.  So that's how you get the minutes approved at the next meeting.  OK.  So that's the process for getting the minutes approved.  Now, let's pretend that the March 2nd meeting is approved.  So let's say that the March 2nd meeting did happen and the minutes did get approved.  OK.  Now, how do we post these minutes to our constituents?  What I'm going to do is I'm going to then go in and locate that meeting.  So I'm just going to click on this dashboard here.  And then I'm going to go ahead and select my meeting here.  I'm going to click on view minutes.  So I'm going to go back to my minutes section here.  OK.  And then when I'm ready to post my minutes, it's going to be a two-step process.  The first step is that I'm going to change my status here in this drop down to say final.  That's going to provide a visual indicator to users of the system that my minutes are final  and that they're published.  So you're going to see that status kind of showing throughout the system,  just providing an indicator that the minutes are now complete.  Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on publish PDF.  So download allowed me to download the minutes like a PDF or a Word document,  but now I'm ready to publish, so I'm going to click on publish PDF.  I can either click generate automatically, which means that the system will take the data  from here, and it will generate the minutes automatically,  or I can choose upload, so if I've made edits in Microsoft Word,  and I want to upload those minutes with the changes and updates, I would select upload.  Now, if you're using the upload option, you'll click choose file. When you click on choose file,  then you can go in and you can grab your minutes. Now, the thing is, is that if you are uploading  your minutes, then you have to change them to a PDF. Okay. So if I go and I open up my minutes here,  here, excuse me, I'm going to go ahead and open up my minutes.  I'll need to make sure to change these minutes. So do a file and a save as,  because they're in Word at this point. I want to do save a copy here and actually then save  these as the PDF type versus a Word type. Okay. So where it says save type as, I want to make  sure I select PDF. So I'm going to do that. And then I'm going to go ahead and save these as the  PDF and then click save because the system is not going to allow me to upload these minutes  as a Word document. It only accepts PDF. Okay. So now that these minutes are in PDF,  now I can go in back to my minutes or my peak system here, click choose file. And then I'm  going to see those minutes, city council, and it's summary. I'm going to see those minutes  and be able to select them. Then I'm going to select my view page here,  which is my past events view. That's the view page I want to publish these minutes to.  Then I'm going to go ahead, oops, things are popping up, and go ahead and click on publish.  Now, once I click publish, then the system's going to publish those minutes to my constituents.  If I come back to my view page, okay, where we started our training initially,  and I go ahead and I refresh this page,  if I come to my prior meeting content, click my city council,  Kirsten's test for minutes training, I talked about our goal today was to have this link showing,  the link to our minutes, and now we've successfully met our goal because now I have the link to my  minutes showing in this minutes column here. If I click on that link, that's going to open up my  minutes where then my public is going to be able to view my published minutes.  If you would like to unpublish your minutes, so if you want to remove the link,  there is an option to click publish here, and then, or it says publish PDF, and then I click  unpublish, and if I click unpublish, then if I come back to my view page, and I refresh,  and I go to my city council,  we can see that the link to the minutes completely disappears.  So that's no longer showing here.  If I want to republish my minutes again, I can just click on publish PDF, click upload,  choose file, and then upload my minutes again.  You also can just republish on top of your existing set of minutes,  so you don't necessarily have to unpublish and then republish.  You can always re-upload again, which will replace the original copy of your minutes  with the updated version.  And then if I'm republishing, I'm just going to select the view page here.  Let's see why this keeps opening and click publish.  Okay, so you kind of have two options for unpublishing and basically republishing again.  So now if I come back to my view page, I do a quick refresh here,  and I can see that I have a few more minutes in peek.  So if I click on my city council, now we have a link to our minutes.  All right, so that is essentially the process for how to take your minutes in peek.  So just as a refresher and to recap our session today,  we logged into our peek system and we checked out the view page,  or excuse me, we check out the dashboard.  I talked about the dashboard and how to access your minutes from the dashboard.  So if I click on the dashboard, I can see that I have a few more minutes in peek.  We also talked about how to access our minutes from this meetings tab here.  Once we got into our minutes section, we talked about how to take a roll call, how to take motions, how to take votes in this system, and then discussion or action notes.  We talked about how to open up our minutes in Microsoft Word and make edits in Microsoft Word.  Then once we were done with our minutes, I showed you how to create an agenda item for your approval of minutes for the next meeting.  After we did that, we came in and we published our minutes. I showed you that you can either publish your minutes directly from PEAK or you can grab the PDF and upload those minutes.  And then I showed you what the publish link looks like on the view page.  And then we also talked about how to unpublish as well.  So I'm going to go ahead.  And I want to check in with the group. I want to see if anybody has any questions on anything that we've discussed today.  Any questions or concerns at this time?  Okay, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great  All right, so I don't think we have any questions. We have a pretty small group today.  So we'll go ahead and end the session here. I'll give you some time back.  I want to thank everyone for their attendance for this session today.  If you need to register for any future sessions, you can do so through Granite Custy University.  Otherwise, if you're done, then your trainer will be in touch with you as far as next steps go.
