 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right. Thank you for that.  And if you can please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right.  All right. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . .  Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here.  Mayor Kulich? Present.  All right.  Speaker Card Announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the Council on any matter listed on the agenda  should first complete a Speaker Card that can be found at the back of the chamber.  Once completed, those Speaker Cards should be turned in the City Clerk to my left, to your right.  Speakers are taken in the order in which the cards are received,  and once the first Speaker has been called, no additional cards will be accepted.  At this time, I don't think he knows this is going to happen,  but we have someone behind the scenes here at City Council  that is literally behind the scenes, who has been serving the City for 24 years.  And Kayvon sits back in that room there, and he is no longer going to be with the City of Chico.  He is, um,  he's retiring from us.  So, we have a few things for him.  So, Kayvon, if you can come out.  I know you can hear me.  He, this, you know, before, well, let's do this down at the podium,  because we need to honor this person who's definitely done some amazing things for us.  There he is.  I really wish you had him.  Make sure my mic works.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we have a couple of things for you.  First, I want to start with this.  Because he does, in fact, bring action to our Council meetings and allow the community to see it.  Oh, my God.  So, that is the most unique plaque we've ever done.  That is awesome.  And you can walk around the house.  My wife can get sick of me doing that.  And then I'm going to give you this gorgeous plaque from the City showing our appreciation  and recognizing you for all your years of service and service to this community.  It's been amazing.  We know you're back there all the time.  Obviously, you know, sometimes we're having fun out here, sometimes we're not.  But regardless, you're there each and every time.  Every special meeting, every crazy meeting, every meeting that's gone on until 1 in the morning.  I have witnessed it.  You've witnessed it all.  So that's for you.  And then I get to read this proclamation, which I don't think could be long enough.  But...  You guys are too much.  I really...  I'll tell you.  For the things that you've seen and put up with over the years, technical difficulties that have arisen,  all the other fun challenges you've had to deal with, this hardly scratches the surface.  So I want to thank you.  So whereas in 1999, Kayvon first contracted with the City of Chico,  boy, you didn't know then, but you know now,  to provide video service for government meetings.  And whereas he has provided outstanding video service for more than 24 years,  ensuring that the citizens of Chico had access to its government meetings.  And wherein in that 24 years has videotaped, yes, over 1,500 meetings.  Providing a minimum of 7,500 hours of public access.  I'm so sorry, that's totally...  What do you mean like that, man?  Of local government meetings.  You didn't even know it was that bad, did you?  No idea.  And whereas Kayvon has gone above and beyond providing service,  and that I think that's truly noted, way above and beyond.  At a moment's notice for special meetings, emergency meetings,  including continuing to provide service after his contract expired.  Just...  Because he truly cares about the City of Chico.  In order to allow the City to find a replacement.  And where he has played an integral part of providing public access  to the City of Chico government meetings,  and has provided the City exemplary service.  So on behalf of myself and the City Council,  we thank you for your many years of service.  Thank you. [inaudible] [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  will be still coming to public meetings  and placing comments.  This won't be the last you see of me. Thank you.  Really appreciate it. Thank you.  I don't think any of us flew it that way  because we're sure this has been a matter.  Thank you so much.  I don't think in 24 years  we got him to shed a tear on camera.  All right.  Hopefully he doesn't do anything  and zoom in or something.  All right. Let's see.  All right. We will move on  at this point to  our closed session announcement.  City Attorney John Lamb.  Thank you, Mayor. City Council, earlier this evening  the City Council recessed in closed session.  All Council members were present.  The first item was item 2.1,  Conference with Legal Counsel, pending litigation.  Council was brief.  Direction was provided. No final action was taken.  Item 2.2,  Conference with Labor Negotiators.  Council was briefed.  No final action was taken.  There's nothing to report on that item.  Item 2.3, Conference with  Real Property Negotiators.  For items A, B, and C,  City Council was brief.  Direction was provided.  No final action was taken.  For item 2.4,  Public Employee Performance Evaluation.  2.0,  Direction was provided. Staff, no final action  was taken. That concludes my report.  All right.  Thank you very much. We'll move on to the consent agenda.  All matters under the consent agenda  are considered to be routine in nature  and therefore can be enacted in one motion.  Do we have any speakers?  We do not.  Okay. Any Council disqualifications or no votes?  Mr. Mayor?  Yes.  I'm going to no on 2.2.  All right. We have a no on 2.2.  I want to pull 2.2.  All right. All items with the exception of 2.2  need a motion to approve.  Move to approve?  Yes.  All right.  Okay.  All right. We'll give the motion  to Council Member Morgan  and a second to Council Member Winslow  because he tried for both.  All right.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Okay.  All right.  Hmm.  Interesting.  My individuals  are not showing up.  So, hold on one second.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right.  Item 2.2, which is a resolution  on the City of Chico to amend the  the masterpiece scheduled to establish the removal and storage of abandoned shopping carts  and i believe we had two council members interested in either voting or pulling this  item but you pulled this item you're free to address this as you like okay first of all  i want to say that when we passed this particular item uh back in september  i was in favor i'm still in favor of the concept as far as removing grocery carts  from our public areas our public spaces along the highway along the roads that needs to be done  what where i have a problem in a conflict is charging the victim the stores who own the carts  um who are victims because they are removed illegally  to be charged with the removal of the carts  and they are charged to regain possession of those carts  i believe that it would be in the best interest my personal opinion it's the best interest  if the city pays for the uh removal cost of right now it's estimated at twenty dollars  and perhaps take the same approach as we did with the architectural review board that this  outcome is of benefit to the community and perhaps it should be paid through  uh  uh !  our city and not burden the individual business owner with a fee for to regain possession of the  carts that are collected by uh the city uh the second part the uh fifty dollar fee for ongoing  issues i'm okay with that because at that point we realize we do have a problem that needs to be  corrected uh so that's okay it's just that initial twenty dollars uh i i just  can't support that doesn't seem right so that's my comment all right further comment from council  yeah i'm i'm uncomfortable that the entire burden is on the merchants  and uh it seems that the people who are stealing these things which are quite valuable  um should be uh cited and the police should have the ability to confiscate them or somebody uh when  whenever you see somebody with a shopping cart wheeling it down the street it's by definition stolen  and and uh we should the burden shouldn't be entirely on the merchants  although they have a responsibility for controlling what happens with your property  all right further comment i have an opinion i'll weigh in on um i while i agree with you in  principle i think we need uh i i actually wanted originally a  uh shopping cart ordinance that required stores to have a security system in place in locking  carts at all their source um which certainly would be more costly than this um i think that's  maybe the route some of them will go after they realize that their cards happen to be the ones  that disappear more often and while i realize that they also are are being punished for a crime  being committed to them at the same time a lot of them are leaving their cards on pretty much  unintended for extended periods of time. So the carts are valuable particularly to  the stores. I think this is just obviously the direction we need to move  in. Unfortunately because of state laws that were passed, you know, items under a  certain monetary threshold aren't able to be, you know, they'd be cited and  released more or less the cart taken, but obviously that creates a problem for PD  in terms of confiscating the cart, transporting the cart, everything else  along those lines. I'd like to see them move to a locking system. That's my, would  be my ultimate goal. I think I proposed that originally in 2018. So with that,  I'll make a motion to approve. I'll make a substitute motion. It says this goes  back to staff and to be modified somehow. Because we can't live up to our mission  statement of an ideal location for business when we're punishing business  owners for things that are being stolen.  Okay.  I think they'll make some really, really good comments about there's got to be a better way to do this without making so punitive to the business owner. I don't think the city should pick up the cost for all that. I think we're paying enough for our transients and people that are stealing things of that nature. Maybe there's a better middle ground. I'd like to see that. So my motion would be send this back to staff, see if they come back with something that's workable that we can agree on.  Second.  All right. We have a substitute motion and a second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Something better hopefully will reach her.  All right.  So we'll move on to public comments.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda within the jurisdiction's authority.  Council cannot take any action at this meeting.  May under request under this section of the agenda and can't respond to speakers.  However, I will say that this is for local matters and local matters only.  We're not here to discuss on matters outside our purview.  So I know we've had some issues with that in the past.  So if everybody can keep their comments local, we would appreciate it.  So how many speakers?  We have four.  All right.  Three minutes.  All right.  If I can call the first two names and have you line up in the middle aisle.  Charles Withoon followed by Will Kennard.  Hi.  Thank you for your service.  And this opportunity to share some info.  Chico is such a pretty place in the fall.  Colors, charming shops.  The Esplanade is distinguished as one of the premier boulevards of the world on some coffee table book somewhere.  I saw it.  Why not?  Let's address the blemish of our unprecedented rate of deaths outside.  I have never witnessed such a high rate of deaths outside.  In Chico, in my life.  Then the data is piling up.  Addressing people's needs and the death rate goes down.  And the crime rate goes down.  Addressing people's needs can save us money.  I have some information for you you'll get after the meeting.  Tiny home villages like in Hayward.  Micro shelters on church parking lots like in Redding.  Safe car parks like in Alameda.  And a temporary.  A temporary.  Managed campground.  Or a fraction of the cost we're spending on emergency services.  A cost that we currently put the taxpayers on the hook for.  You might wonder why we still have so many people on the street with available shelter beds.  Well we've met with unsheltered folks and they have told us shelter beds may be empty because  the nighttime noises and odors.  Of so many other people in such close proximity are impossible for me.  The banging on my shelter door in the middle of the night with threatening shouting outside.  I feel unsafe at the shelter.  There's too many people there.  I got my stuff stolen.  These are valid issues that we hear complaints regularly.  From people.  Our citizens without houses.  It could be addressed by tiny home villages.  Micro shelter programs.  Safe car parks.  Temporary managed campgrounds.  Safe space is helping.  How about the city put out a request for proposals?  We've got a crisis here.  Let's not.  Why not?  Let's address the blemish on Chico of the chaos at the city camp at Eaton Cohasset.  We have more time.  I'll go over with you.  More detail about this.  But there are differences between what's going on there and successful programs.  Like successful programs are known for having a secure perimeter.  A gate monitor or a camera surveillance system.  A common shelter area for food preparation and regular meetings.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Will Kennard followed by Hillary Crosby.  .  I'm concerned with who can vote in our local elections on local matters.  I'm not sure if non-citizens can vote in our local elections.  And I think it might be time for the in the charter to address it explicitly to say local elections are for full citizens and residents of Chico, California.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hillary Crosby.  I'm gonna go to Hillary Crosby followed by Bryce Goldstein.  Good evening.  Thank you for the opportunity.  My name is Hillary Crosby.  I'm the Executive Director of Safe Space Winter Shelter.  I just want to take a minute and talk about the good things that Safe Space has been doing  in the past year.  So, well, first of all, it's our 10th year of sheltering here in Chico which is amazing.  This year we were able to expand services to include not only sheltering but the and  then what, right?  Because sheltering is a very important part of our lives.  is great, but then what? So we expanded our case management department to provide one-on-one  services to people experiencing homelessness, and we're pulling directly from the people that are  accessing our services. So starting with those first, right? So this year we were able to serve  75 clients so far with individualized case management. Permanent housing has been obtained  for four people that were experiencing homelessness through our program, provided support and  encouragement to countless others to utilize shelter beds that are available at the Torres  Shelter, the Jesus Center, Orville Rescue Mission, Sober Living Environments. We've worked in  collaboration with Behavioral Health's outreach program, with medical providers in town, as well  as countless community-based organizations. We are participating in the Resilience Collaborative,  a really combined effort to establish resilience work within our community.  Our street outreach team provides basic needs,  and services to hundreds, including water and, you know, ice resources in the summer.  We work and provide a cooling center in collaboration with the City of Chico.  Last shelter season, we served 160 unduplicated guests within our emergency cold weather  sheltering program, which ran for 11 weeks in the coldest part of the winter. We utilized 300  volunteers, and we partner with many different faith-based organizations to provide services  at their church, and we've been able to provide a lot of support to those who are experiencing  homelessness in the pre-COVID-19 period. We are also in the process of expanding the  Japanese Japanese- Japanese Japanese- Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese  Japanese !  Japanese  transportation barriers. So this building was a great spot. I just want to go over what are  allowed use of the space that we feel we are within our rights. The code 19.22.02 in is a  temporary use code that appears to be within our bandwidth to use this building for. And I just  want to kind of give us a snapshot of what's been going on over there. The last two nights we've  served 39 people at night. We are at capacity. This is the first time in the history of safe  space that we have ever been at capacity on opening week. So the need is there. And I think  it's really important that we look at the... Thank you. All right. Thank you for your time.  Have a good evening. And our last speaker is Bryce Goldstein. Good evening, City Council  members. My name is Bryce Goldstein. I'm the City Council member for the City Council. I'm the  City Council member for the City Council. I'm the City Council member for the City Council. I'm  I served on the City of Chico Planning Commission for four years. I'm now a Climate Action  Commissioner. And I've also been a safe space volunteer for six years. First, I agree with  Charles. We really need a managed campground. And we need other forward-thinking ways to get people  off of the streets. A citizen brought up a potential issue and sent a letter to the City  Council and put it on social media about potential zoning issues with the intake center location of  safe space this year. And I think it's really important that we look at the future. And I  think it's really important that we look at the future. And I think it's really important that we  look at the future. And I think it's really important that we look at the future. I read that  citizen's Facebook post and it gave no specific details on what the issues were with the zoning  and allowable temporary uses. So I went to the city's municipal code. Temporary uses, including  emergency facilities, are allowed by right in the downtown north zone. Under our shelter crisis  declaration, the intake center should qualify as an emergency facility from my reading. But of  course, we have staff who deals with our zoning issues. This isn't just a question of how we're  going to deal with this. This is a city council issue, unless it gets brought to city council. So if  there is an issue here, staff should be able to work with safe space for compliance, as it's not a  council issue. But what would be a council issue is pursuing solutions to homelessness, like  managed campgrounds and supportive housing. So just always encouraging our city council to  consider the forward-thinking needs. And just wanted to say that safe space is a great way to  continue to do really great work in keeping our city clean and keeping our residents with a roof  over their head on freezing, rainy nights. Thank you.  Thank you.  All right. Thank you, everybody. We have no public hearings tonight, so we just have a regular  agenda. And we'll start with item 5.1, interviews and appointment to fill vacancy on the, it says  climate and action.  Oh.  Sorry.  I had to change the name. I apologize.  Once on a blue moon, you have a spelling error. I got to point it out.  Thank you.  All right. We'll turn it over to our esteemed city clerk and elections official, Deborah Press.  So, council, what you have before you is an unscheduled vacancy that I'm,  that we have had on the Climate Action Commission. Because this is a seven-member  board, we're looking to add this final piece, or this person, as the final piece to that,  to be successful.  But the Japanese are the Japanese are the Japanese are the Japanese are the !  But Japanese are the Japanese are the Japanese are the Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are  Japanese are Japanese are  And so it would be his nomination to do that, to select someone.  And so what I was hoping for, since there's only one year remaining on this position,  if we can see if there are applicants who are here.  Again, the criteria to serve is not based on whether or not they can make it.  This is a holiday week, so it has been difficult to perhaps get people here.  However, it is not the requirement of appointment in order to make this meeting.  In the meantime, what I would like to suggest is perhaps after the interviews,  allow that to conclude and then if the council will allow a change in the policy or the procedure  to have Council Member Morgan actually make,  a nomination and then the council could confirm it  and then that person is ready to get going as effective immediately.  I don't know why I'm having a hard time.  I guess it's the typo.  I apologize.  So having said that, I can call the names to see if our applicants are here.  And the first person would be Gregory Bradburn.  Michael.  Michael Condon.  Okay, if you could go ahead and come up and just introduce yourself to the council.  You have three minutes to indicate why you'd like to serve.  Okay.  Good evening.  My name is Michael Condon,  and I'm interested in serving on the Climate Action Commission,  principally for two reasons.  One, and this might sound a little silly, but it's important.  I'm a grandfather.  I have two young granddaughters attending school here in Chico,  and there's nothing that makes you think about the future  and contemplate the world that we're leaving behind  than having a couple of grandkids.  The other reason I feel important about this has to do with my career.  In 1970, I started working as a firefighter on the Mendocino National Forest,  not far from here.  Thirty-eight years later, I retired as the Chief of Fire and Aviation  on the Plumas National Forest, also not too far from here.  And I've been paying pretty close attention to fire seasons  in the few years since I've retired.  And what I've seen scares the heck out of me.  The nature of our fire seasons have changed significantly.  I don't need to tell you that.  We've seen literally death, destruction of property,  health issues related to smoke,  all due to fire seasons that have become much longer and much more severe.  So the impact is real.  It's here, it's local, and it's caused largely by climate change.  I am absolutely convinced of that because I can  see the nature of the fire seasons, how they're much longer,  how they've gotten drier because the distribution of rain is different than it used to be.  So there's no doubt in my mind that climate change is a huge issue  that affects us very directly and needs to be dealt with.  Now, it's easy to see that, you know, to say at the city level,  what are you going to do?  Not much, you know, it's a drop in the bucket.  This is literally an issue that needs to be dealt with globally.  It needs to be dealt with at the national level.  It needs to be dealt with at the state level.  And also at the city level and even at the individual level.  It's important enough and big enough that it can't be solved at any of those levels.  It takes action at every level to make it work.  But what's going to make it work?  Well, let me tell you what I did at the personal level.  And this is important to how I might approach my role on this commission.  My wife and I have solar panels on our house and we drive a hybrid car.  And, you know, initially we might have looked at those options and things that we did  because we want to reduce the climate footprint.  But the reality is they save us a heck of a lot of money.  And to me, that's where the focus needs to be.  There are solutions out there that are both practicable,  that make sense economically and financially.  And I guess that's what I would like to help you figure out how to do for the city.  I think there's a lot of things that can be done.  The skill set I bring to this is very important.  I'm not very much a generalist.  I do have prior experience on the city council and in other communities.  So I understand the role of city government, city council, and also on advisory committees  and their limitations.  So I'm here to help and willing to get to work.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So, Claire Finn.  Melissa Frosto.  Hello.  I know this isn't a formal interview where a question is being posed, but if there was  one I would assume the question would be, why do you want to join the Climate Action  Commission and how are you qualified?  That's a great question.  I would love to tell you.  My name is Melissa Frosto.  I went to Chico State.  I graduated with a major in Human Geography and Planning and a minor in Environmental  Studies.  I work as a planner at Laco Associates where I work on environmental analysis, permitting  and planning documents, and where I have the unique opportunity to assist a municipal advisory  council in another county on brand ag requirements, assisting with public outreach efforts, and  coordinating meetings.  Every month I see people show up for their community, and it isn't always pretty or very  fast, but nonetheless they show up.  As a consultant, I'm a community leader.  But I wanted to stand out in the Japanese community because they are the most important  My Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese  Japanese Japanese Japanese  past year hasn't been my only exposure to the Climate Action Commission or the Climate Action  Plan. At Chico State, I also learned about the Climate Action Plan and wrote an essay on the  goals and policies. At Chico State, I also learned about environmental justice, sustainability  principles, and conservation and preservation of the environment. As a planner, I've developed  skills balancing economic development and environmental protection, and then I've also  assisted writing CEQA initial studies and EPA environmental assessments in the pursuit of  preventing significant and avoidable damage to the environment. My commitment to sustainability  and environmentalism is what fuels my desire to join this commission. My years of experience in  my field and skills have equipped me with the necessary knowledge and expertise to serve  effectively on this commission and achieve my goals. Thank you.  And I look forward to hearing your decision.  Thank you. Janika Kramer.  Jillian Leach.  Geraldine Mahud.  Hello. I applied earlier and got the other one, I don't know, four months ago maybe? A while ago.  So,  I'm going to ask you a question.  my background is as a teacher. I taught at Chico State and Butte College for about eight years  and then went to work at Willows at the high school. So, I got to know very well the farm  community and the perspectives of people, you know, who were different than I had known before.  I taught a lot of research and writing, so I can do a lot in that regard to help any group.  I served on the Arts Commission for a few years before.  But then, unfortunately, the Japanese Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  Japanese  is a nonprofit that has a citizen monitoring for Butte Creek through the year.  I'm also currently a board member on the Janet Turner Print Museum at Chico State,  and so I do a lot of collaboration in different volunteer positions that I serve on currently.  I am a retired person, so I can give a lot of time and attention to this.  I'm also a board member on the Butte County Local Food Network, which is a great nonprofit.  They do a lot for building community gardens, do a lot of in-school programs,  and distribute a lot of healthy food to needy populations in the area.  In addition, lately I have been serving as a treasurer, a member of a group called Groundwater for Butte.  They've been holding town halls.  It's a public action committee that holds town halls and meetings, done mailers and public events  to help educate people around local groundwater issues.  One of the concerns has been the formation of the Tuscan Water District,  which no one in Chico got to vote on, and whether or not another district was totally needed or not.  So trying to help a little bit with just getting people to be in conversation about some of these issues  that will affect our community, and things that are becoming more urgent  as we're less sure of the kind of climate that we could count on for all of our lives.  Let's see, what else was I going to mention?  Also, like former speaker, I'm very, very motivated around this.  I have two grandchildren who I'm very concerned about.  From what I understand, did I just hit my time?  Oh, I'm getting down to it. Sorry, I saw the light.  This past year, from what I've read in a lot of credible sources,  for the year we were at 1.4 degree warming.  You know, that's not a consistent level.  It very well may go down some.  It was an El Nino year.  But we're hitting, you know, much closer to some critical measures,  and I would like to do whatever I can in the time I have to help.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We received an email from Richard Roth who indicated he couldn't make tonight,  but would still like to be considered.  And then Brendan Sellers.  Okay.  Those are the individual speakers that we have here tonight.  And one note I do want to make.  Is as we're setting, as I'm sitting here, we're also, I've got people in the booth.  Obviously, we just honored Kayvon.  I just want to let you know, because, Council, you're getting emails that Channel 11 wasn't on.  That is handled by an outside vendor.  And they, we contacted them, and it just now came back on.  So they're supposed to flip the switch at 6 o'clock.  So we'll be looking at that.  So back to this item, Council.  Council Member Morgan, if you would like to make a,  a nomination at this point, or if you would like additional time,  I'm happy to bring it back.  It's up to you.  Okay.  Okay.  So the Council needs to confirm, with a majority vote,  any nomination that's made by an individual Council member.  So Council Member Morgan has nominated Geraldine Mahood.  So does the Council like to make a motion to confirm that?  Move to approve.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Second.  We need people to help with this process and government and city of Chico,  and we appreciate you putting in your application.  As someone who submitted an application and never was selected,  I certainly appreciate you doing it.  It's very important to our process, so thank you so much.  We hope to see you in the future for another application process.  Please do not be discouraged.  Thanks.  All right, and with that, we will move on to item 5.2,  consideration of the resolution to convey two Humboldt Road City Greenway properties  to the Chico Area Park and Recreation District.  And I believe we have a report from Mr. Gobson.  Welcome.  Thank you, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Councilmembers.  Honored to speak to you tonight.  I'll be brief, and then we'll have Manny McKay from Chico Velo do a quick presentation.  But this 5.2 is to convey two parcels.  Two parcels of city-owned land that are currently zoned,  secondary open space off of Humboldt and Forest.  The city was approached by CAR, Chico Area Recreation District,  and Chico Velo to convey the land to build a new bicycle,  mountain bike-themed park, dog park, and other park-related facilities.  So staff thinks it's a good idea.  Council action before you tonight is to convey the land.  But again, this is Manny McKay, president of Chico Velo,  that will give you a brief.  Brief presentation on the concept there,  along with kind of an overall theme for an active Humboldt corridor.  Manny?  Awesome.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Pleasure.  Good evening.  Once again, my name is Manny McKay.  I'm the current president of the board for Chico Velo.  Again, thank you for the time to share kind of this vision that we have,  and I'm really excited about it.  So just spend a brief few minutes going over our plan,  and hopefully we get approved.  All right.  Thank you.  I think most of you are probably familiar.  I think most of you are familiar with Chico Velo and our history and what we do.  But just in case you aren't, we've been around for about 40 years.  Most of that time as a formal 501 nonprofit.  The four goals that drive most of our work you can see there,  but mainly we advocate for bicycle infrastructure, safety, education.  We provide stewardship and volunteer opportunities through several of our programs.  Trail works you probably have heard of and also adopt a path.  We also want to aim to promote Northern California as a bicycling  and recreation destination.  So I think this is a great opportunity.  And bottom line, we want to get more people on bikes  and also just active transportation in general.  So this project definitely touches all four of those,  which is what we're really excited about.  And again, I'm going to walk through our vision for it,  which is in partnership with CARD.  We also have a really long history of positive engagement with the city  on specific bike infrastructure projects.  So bike plans, active transportation plans, and then specific projects,  or projects that are really important to the city.  So I think it's really important to think about all of those things  and think about the next steps around bike and ped infrastructure  throughout the last 40 years.  So again, I'm going to focus on the bike park,  but as Eric kind of alluded to,  we have a much more ambitious and broader vision  that we're referring to as active Humboldt  that kind of comes to life stitched together  through several component projects.  So again, I'm gonna focus on the bike part,  but we're currently working on repaving the upper section  of old Humboldt Road.  And I think it's gonna be a lot of fun to think about it.  And we've already been working with Public Works Engineering and Butte County on that.  So that's underway and privately funded, and we're really excited about that.  Again, I'm going to talk about the bike park.  But then we also hope to, in the future, bring some active transportation infrastructure and improvements to Windchime Park, also on Humboldt Road.  And then big vision, multiple, multi-years maybe down the road, is this really broad sort of active transportation corridor all along Humboldt Road.  Humboldt Road's already this really great east-west transect of the city leading to and from downtown.  It would be this really kind of a model active transportation project, tying together schools and businesses and mass transit stops, all these great parks.  We've also got the skate park that already exists.  So it's just a really awesome vision there that we're really excited about at a big level.  But again, the bike park is one piece of that, so I'm going to talk about that mostly.  So just a really high level, just to introduce you to the concept of bike parks.  They are specifically designed for off-road mountain biking, kind of skills and progression.  They're also this kind of unique way to bring an activity that you typically have to go sort of the outskirts of town or further to practice these types of things.  But a bike park's a way you can kind of, you can bring it in town into an urban environment, a much smaller relative property size.  And for more of that urban experience.  They're also growing in popularity, and people do travel for bike parks, again, because they provide that opportunity for learning and progression and skill building.  We've seen them pop up in our region.  We've listed a few bike parks there that have popped up kind of in our northern region here.  And then, you know, even in our own community, we've got groups that I think could certainly benefit from this, both CARD and Chico Velo feel strongly.  And we've got lots of, especially youths.  We've got youth-oriented groups that could really benefit from a park like this.  So we've got our North State Mountain Bike Composite Team.  They grow every year.  They've been extremely successful.  And it's really been nice to see the engagement around youth cycling.  So they're certainly in support.  Groups like that are in support of a project like this as well.  And then certainly kind of an ulterior goal that we have for this project is to deter some of those non-sanctioned features and projects that we'll see.  And so we've got a lot of things that we're working on.  We've got a lot of things that we're working on.  We do have a large mountain bike community that tend to want to build jumps and things like that.  And so with this, this would be basically building a space that's specific to those types of skills and activities.  Hopefully taking some pressure off of upper park in that sense.  So this is just very kind of common images and features that you might see at a bike park.  Again, these are just kind of ideas at this point.  But for Chico Velo and CARD, we've got a specific idea of what we'd like to see.  And we want to make sure we're gearing this towards all levels and skills and abilities.  So it would be something that's available for people that are brand new to maybe this type of activity,  but also those that are already advanced that are looking to kind of grow those skills.  But we also want to include things that are not bike-specific.  So our goal is to also make this a community hub space, a family gathering location.  So while the bike features...  are certainly prominent and what we're really advocating for,  we're also wanting to build in things like a food truck space, a dog park,  probably some more traditional playground equipment and those types of things.  Again, so that sort of the whole family could come out, especially if only one of them is working on bike skills,  others can be doing other things as well.  So this is just again a concept, right?  Just a really nice drawing and image of what this could look like.  Just want to make sure...  Again, I reiterate that this is just a concept.  None of this has obviously been approved or we haven't received much in the way of community input and all those things yet.  But this at least gives you...  It is relative to scale, so you can kind of get an idea of the spatial layout and the ideas that we're kind of thinking about.  So you can see the specific areas that we've designated for bike skills,  but also those ancillary kind of supportive things like the food truck area, dog park, and those types of things.  Let's see.  As far as the roadmap and the timeline for this, so assuming the land transfer is approved,  we would pretty quickly just move into working directly with CARD under a partnership agreement.  And then right into looking for putting on an RFP for a contractor that would do both the design and build of the project.  That's how what we feel is the most appropriate for a project like this.  So again, the same contractor would be helping design and then also leading the design.  And the construction of it.  And then of course that would lead into all the appropriate community workshops and feedback and input sessions  to really finalize the design and what those features and what the community really wants and needs.  Of course CEQA and all of those types of things.  And then if we...once we move into construction,  we're really fortunate that we have a lot of interest and support from private funding to make this project happen.  There's also some really specific park grant opportunities that could align here.  And then both CARD and Chico Velo also have additional resources to support construction.  But at this point we feel really confident in the funding to make this project happen.  And then we've already been discussing maintenance and long-term sustainability to make sure, you know, it's maintained.  These things do need maintenance.  And so between CARD and Chico Velo, we both feel that we can manage that.  And that even starts with the design.  So we would intentionally be designing things that are durable or require low maintenance or no maintenance at all.  But between our volunteer and stewardship programs, again, TrailWorks and other programs,  and then programming that CARD would probably be interested in offering at this site,  we're already thinking about ways to make sure it's maintained in the long term.  And that's all I have.  Happy to answer questions.  And I also...Annabelle Grimm from CARD is here as well.  She can jump in and answer questions as well.  All right. Thanks for being here.  Any questions?  All right. Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Any speakers on this item?  Yes, I have one.  All right. Three minutes.  Nicole Farley.  Hello. Nicole Farley, Executive Director of Explore Butte County.  Thank you for letting me be here to speak in support of transferring the surplus land over to CARD  to build a new bike park facilities in partnership with Chico Velo.  Having relocated here from a community that had multiple bike parks designed for skill development  and progressions, I can personally say that I have used bike parks to meet my neighbors,  my community members, but also visitors from all over the United States at those skills parks  in partnerships with workshops and skill development classes that I took on my mountain bike.  So the proposed project will bring value not only to the community,  but will also help our hotels through the promotion with Explore Butte County and Travel Chico  to bring people here from our target markets with our mountain bike parks.  So with that, I encourage you to vote yes on this transfer agreement to allow CARD and Chico Velo  to continue the process of building out this skills park for mountain bikes.  Thank you.  All right. Council discussion.  Entertain a motion.  I'd second it.  Council Member Tannen, a second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  I'd like to just add the comment.  I think this is a no-brainer.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tannen.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  And we get a dog park.  Yes.  Council Member Tannen is very happy.  All right.  Awesome.  Excuse me.  Item 5.3, confirmation of amended contract for Deputy Director Public Works Operations  and Services.  And we have a report from Chelsea Phoebus, Director of HR and RN.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Council.  Before you tonight is a proposed amended contract for our Deputy Director of Public Works.  A little closer.  Sorry.  Operations and Maintenance.  We have a scarcity of vehicles in our Public Works Department, and currently our Deputy  Director, Skyler Lipsky, utilizes one of those vehicles.  And so what we are proposing is to free up our resources in the Public Works Department  to provide him with a vehicle allowance that is fairly standard among Deputy Director and  Director contracts of $400 a month.  And that will allow us to free up a vehicle for use back in the fleet service for Public  Works O&M.  And so that is what I have before you this evening.  And I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  All right.  Questions?  Comments?  No.  He's not going to be able to park anywhere he wants in his own car.  Does he know that?  He does now.  All right.  I, you know, I heard rumors.  All right.  Entertaining motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Van Overbeek.  Second from Council Member Bennett.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Reports and communications.  Following reports and communication items are provided for the Council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section unless the Council agrees to approve.  Any other comments or suggestions to include it on a subsequent agenda?  City Manager's report, Mr. City Manager Mark Sorensen.  No report.  All right.  We have item 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 on for information only.  Item 6.5, Council Member requests pursuant to APMP 1010.  Council members verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting after stating  what the item would be.  A majority vote of the Council's need in order for staff to agendize.  Do we have any requests?  Seeing none, we'll move to adjourn.  Thank you very much.  Happy holidays, all.  Thank you.  Thank you.
