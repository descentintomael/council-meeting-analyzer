I just wanted to have a quick moment of silence for Robert boehm. he was the city attorney from october of 1978 to march of 1997 and retired from the city and worked very hard for the city. so just have a quick moment of silence. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Thank you. We tried. This is on consent agenda. I set this up here. I set that as a prop to show you who you are. It's a long story, but I'm Stephen Hazel. And it's kind of odd to say, but like I said in the last meeting, I'm God also. I am actually before. I just like to identify myself where I'm coming from. I do have a shirt. I do. Two home field, like, giant jerseys. It's God 1 and God 2. And it cost me $340 a piece. It's agenda, please. I know I am. But the God 2 shirt still has his tag on it. If you want to be God 2, you can be. Okay. Now, before I begin, I know who burned Bidwell Mansion. Okay, I know who, what, where, when, why, and how. Bidwell Mansion is not on the consent agenda. I know it is. I'm just making a point. It has to do with federal emergency because there are, this could be, I'm just asking, this could be included in a federal disaster or the state or something. But other than that, it refers to the dam. Just say hypothetically the dam occurred right now. Now, the police, this is right in my alley. This is FEMA, right? Wasn't FEMA involved in the dam, the Oval Dam? And what I did was, it is. I say it's great that you guys are getting authorization because maybe you can take action now against the cover who actually breached the dam at the time. Mr. Hazel, you're off topic. I'm right on, I'm right on. You're disrupting a public meeting. I'm right on point about this. The dam is. And what I'm saying is, as a federal, yeah, I'm right on point on 2.1, which is the resolution, which gives you the right to do that. But if you're officers under FEMA, right? Now, I'm just saying hypothetically the dam was breached, they would be assigned as possibly, right? And if I have information, not exculpatory information, but after information the dam was breached, delivered by the then governor and then Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, because they did, and I could prove it. I gave you the progressions of how they did it. I'll tell you right now. See, they went from 40,000 CFS to 65. They held it. And just enough to breach it. And they did deliver it and pumped it to 100,000 CFS. Now when real Corp came out, he did say he goes $100,000, I mean CFS. It was right there. He slipped. That was it. Now what I'm saying, if you're investigating this, you could really— Mr. Hazel? No, no. It's just important. Your subject—this is not on the subject matter. No, it is. It is. Because their duty as officers checking on this FEMA, if there's information that the dam, or hypothetically, which it was in 2016, it's their duty if it happened now, the biggest earthen dam on the North Hemisphere. It's their duty as officers to do that. Plus, I am God. I have authority over everybody. I'm telling you. You're telling me. I don't know. I think that's pretty good information because— This is your last warning that you're disrupting a public meeting. This is— No, I'm not disrupting. The dam is not on the agenda. I'm on point. I'm on point. I know you're working with the FBI. You don't like people to talk in public. See, that's what I do. Because—and what I do, I'll show you. I use sidewalk chalk. It's funny. When I'm denied my right to speak in public, I go on sidewalks and I write stuff in it. And—well, I try and censor that speech. So that's why I'm fine when I go to city councils. Okay. That's it. That's your time. Thank you. Okay. A&W. All right. Do we have any no votes or disqualifications from consent? No. All right. Consider a motion. Motion to approve. Second. I have a motion to approve by Councilmember O'Brien, a second by—I don't know. I don't know. Councilmember Winslow. A&W. Yeah, A&W. Okay. Councilmember Goldstein. Aye. Councilmember Hawley. Yes. Councilmember O'Brien. Yes. Councilmember Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. All right. Public comments. Any members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter that is not already listed on the agenda and within the jurisdiction of the City Council. The council cannot take any action at this meeting on these requests made under this section in the agenda. How many speakers do we have? We now have 13. Thirteen. So we need to do two minutes each. Okay. All right. So I'll call the first two names and if you could line up in the middle aisle. The first speaker is Mike Johnson followed by Io Savage. Well, good evening. I was just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the! It's worth noting that Engine 6 and her crew do exist and come out of station 2, which is down on East 5th Avenue down Esplanade, much further south across the street from Amarillo Hospital. Meanwhile, expansion in the City continues, most recently with the approval of Bellmure and with much more in the works. And of course, we were on the very edge of the borders of the recent Park Fire. The fire union itself says this, when seconds count, we are many minutes away. Emergency response times in the district are more than double the national average and they're only getting worse. Response times meaning to in-home medical emergencies, car accidents, and anything else, let alone for structure fires. Currently, the department has 1.5 million saved in the pot. There's 22.5 million more that's needed for the station alone. Yet, even once we have those funds in hand, there's a two-year period once those funds are amassed to the opening of the station itself, to the environmental impact studies, RFIs, and the actual construction timelines. The 2010 strategic plan mandated construction of station number 6, and yet here we are, nearly 15 years later. With nothing. Most recently, 225,000 feasibility study in 2023, but none this year. To his credit, the vice mayor proposed a dispensary tax shortly before election day, and while you did table that motion, sir, at least it was something. I strongly encourage the council to agendize this item. It's not just the station itself. The fire department's salaries are 30% less than what they are for the next 15 cities of comparable size in the state. We can do better, and I sincerely hope the council will take this action and start to agendize discussions of this moving forward. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Io Savage, followed by Greg Scott. Okay, I just go? And if you could pull the mic down closer to your mouth. Thank you. Hello. Hi. I wanted to show up and talk about the well-mentioned that recently burnt down. I wanted to say that I don't think it should be rebuilt. I don't think that, nor do I believe that a monument dedicated to the people of Machu Picchu, a racist individual that displaced the Machu Picchu people and really took advantage of them, should be rebuilt at all. I really think that the land that that house mansion was built on should be returned to the Machu Picchu people, and they should be allowed to do what they would like with it. I think that's a really good point. That also, I would say, go for all these other places that are trying to be considered historic landmarks. Historically, all of this land was the Machu Picchu people land. So I believe that the most honorable thing to do would be to give those places back to them. I also wanted to say that having so much, care and empathy for a building that does not house any of our houseless population, or feed our people, or give them any type of medical aid, and the amount of resources that's going into figuring out why that happened isn't very great either. The amount of empathy that goes into that, but there's none for our people that are freezing and starving, and also for the children and people who are in need. And effectively, our podem effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively!! Just a little bit lighthearted. I want to, on behalf of DCBA and, in fact, all of downtown Chico, put a shout-out to Eric and his crew for one of the probably best Christmas tree lighting events we've had. I don't know if most of you or a lot of you were here. I saw you. His crew, a lot of them did it on their own time. It was something I think downtown needs. It's kind of a punch in the arm to say, hey, let's get this thing going and keep it going. I just wanted to publicly thank Eric and his crew. And let's do it again next year. Thanks. Thank you. Corky Leterrier, followed by Savannah Jekyll. Good evening. Moving forward with new members on the city council, I would urge looking into alternatives to the way we presently focus on our fellow residents, and our communities are not the same as our fellow human beings living on the streets. Simply moving them from place to place is a waste of time and money. Do the research, look into managed campgrounds, not the joke that's out there at Cohasset and Eaton. I understand that people have choices. They have shelters, they have the genesis, but many of them cannot live in a crowded space with others. Many have pets that are not welcome. And don't forget, many of them have PTSD, or other issues. These are also our veterans. Getting a job or moving forward is next to impossible when you are camping with all of your belongings and you have no clean clothes. Do we continue to push people aside? Ignore them thinking they will go away? Or can we be compassionate? Really understand what is happening on a day-to-day basis and have a clean, safe environment for those who need help. Thank you. And for those of you continuing on the council, adding fees and restrictions to good programs like safe space is disgusting. Thank you. Savannah Jackel followed by Sam Barber. Last week we saw city council members crying over a house that they call a heart of this community. And yet we see the same council refuse to extend that same emotion or empathy towards the people that same emotion or empathy towards the people of Chico who are left out in the weather, who can't afford rent, who are on the verge of houselessness, or the Palestinian high schoolers who were shut down at past meetings while trying to tell you about the harassment they face. The discussion of rebuilding Bidwell Mansion has begun, and our question is, do we the people of Chico really want it? If we put together a popular vote, we believe that many people in Chico would want to see the land put to use for something other than a shrine to the wealthy slave-owning colonizers that were the Bidwells. Being a Bidwell estate is a state of the art and a state land, it has the ability to be signed back to the stewardship of the native people it was stolen from. We can look to Verbena Fields as an example of stewardship. Once a pile of gravel now turned into beautiful walkable landscapes with traditional ecological practices, Verbena Fields has been a hub for locals to enjoy nature and learn native land stewardship as well as education and fire resiliency. We should take this fire as an opportunity to tell the real history of Chico. A story of genocide, a story of colonialism, a story of failed ethnic cleansing Despite what the Bidwells tried to accomplish, the first people of this land are still here. We can use this as an opportunity for rebirth, good faith and good faith connections. Restore control over the Bidwell state to the tribe. Right the wrongs of the city's past so we can move towards a stronger future. Thank you. Thank you. Sam Barber followed by Bo Powell. Hello. We are on the ground of the Bidwell mansion. Our current mayor was brought to tears while speaking about it. Here are some things that I wish made more of you cry. We are on occupied land on which genocide occurred. $1.5 million paid out by the state of California to Indian hunters, 25 cents a scalp, $5 a head. It's a good opportunity to acknowledge, discuss and reflect on the racist history of the Bidwells, their complicity and participation in the genocide of natives. It's a good opportunity to allow native people to take the lead and the council to consider reparations and repatriation of the site that the mansion is on. I'm not at all moved to see a council member or mayor shed tears for a historic mansion while the front of the lawn just a few feet away from us is littered with people struggling to survive and without a roof over their head. A year ago Palestinian kids begged and pleaded for your help. They were in tears. You showed no empathy. You didn't pretend to care. I would much prefer that our council should show empathy and meaningful efforts to the natives whose culture we attempted to erase and whose land we currently reside on rather than mindlessly rebuilding this mansion. Put more of your efforts to the working class people of Chico struggling to get by and pay rent rather than working only for the people able to donate $500 or more to your political action committee save for a better Chico pack. Most of you take a lot of money from them. To the homeless who are starving and suffering rather than the weapons and drones for the police, 71 assault rifles, tactical SUVs, what is this all for? Let this council embrace democracy, working class solidarity and transparency rather than having closed door meetings, embracing authoritarianism, taking large amounts of money from the wealthy few and neglecting to help the community at large in a meaningful way. One more thing, the mayor vote should be a popular vote. It shouldn't be decided by seven people. Thank you. Thank you. Bo Powell followed by Steven Hazel. Hello, I'm Bo Powell. I came here on the 19th last month to the meeting after hearing about Mayor Coolidge and um Morgan being on the council for 20 years. Combined 18 of those 20 years Butte County farmers have been spraying our roadways legally sometimes. If the wind's blowing it's not legal. Let me back up a little bit. In 1989 I was working out in and was exposed to methyl bromide. Very toxic chemical banned in most of the world. In 1994 they banned it worldwide. In 2006 Butte County farmers got a special needs permit to use it. It was banned so things like the campfire wouldn't happen. It's bad on the ozone layer. So ten years nine years goes by with Butte County facilitating crimes against the highway patrol, against the sheriff's office, against the fire department, spraying school buses. Now I expected this council to do exactly what it did last meeting when I was here. Shake your head and do nothing. What I didn't expect was Mayor Coolidge to turn around and say, oh well we want to try to have more influence out of our city limits. Let's talk about safe routes to school. It's an embarrassment. We have a vice president of the United States who was the attorney general when they legalized spraying those. Thank you. Steven Hazel followed by Curtis Gedney. Sidewalk chalk. I use that effectively. My name is Steven Hazel. Some of you I talked before. I'm also God. I'm actually God. I say to certain people, some people you wouldn't know if God was standing right before you, and I am. I'm that guy. The other guy is George W. Bush. Actually, it's H. W. Bush. Like I said to you before, I'm introducing myself because I'm going to get this clear. I get to establish myself. I'm not just a kid claiming a pronoun. I'm actually God. I'm born 12-6. I was born at night. I wasn't born yesterday. At 11 on the 9th night. 51 minutes before midnight. Now the government has to put a barrier in 51 years. They asked me 20 years ago, Steve, when did you first know your God? I was at the pediatric trial for 12 months. I said, hey, when the Berkeley Farms truck ran over my dog, the first victim of this war. Mr. Hazel, you're off topic. I'll get right on topic. I live at Jarvis Gardens, 217. If you want to talk about Jarvis Gardens, right behind me, remember that? The Valley Edge, remember that? No on P. That was perfect. The burden on the public. Now if things were going right, maybe we would have got it approved. But here's the positive. You know what? I have a different vision for that place. Tiny town of Chico by Burchard at the Valley Edge. It's even got an email address. Tiny homes. In turn, a negative and positive. The second guy almost killed Trump. He worked on tiny homes in Hawaii. I'll have a tiny home theme of model homes. And plus all the $25 billion he squandered on mental health, the governor. I could have 250,000 homes, motor homes, Hillcooks, everything out there. All the homeless. Take care of them. I have the solution. I spent 40 days and 40 nights at Good News Rescue Mission in 14 months right here at Torrey Shelter. You know it. I'd like more time. You've cut me off like five minutes. Can I have more time? I'm gone. You want to give God more time? I just want to check. I have to ask. Thank you for asking. You don't give God more. You deny me. You just like foolish. I am God. I am. So our next speaker is Curtis Gedney. I'm in great. I got to do it. Just a moment. Thank you. Curtis Gedney followed by Florence. I was really fond of the covered bridge area. I was kind of saddened that it burned down. It's being rebuilt. It's got a monument there. I've spent years up there. And I think it's got picnic areas for you to hang out. And unlike Bidwell Mansion, I don't think it can be rebuilt because it's concrete. There's just no way it can be rebuilt. But I think you can put a monument there and put a tourist building there and a picnic area and something like that. I think it's a great idea. I'm happy. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Florence followed by Lori Monroe. Hello. I wanted to start with a land acknowledgement. Some of our other excellent speakers have said that we are on land. This is the unceded stolen territory that we reside on here today. And I would also like to do a labor acknowledgement for the Chinese immigrants that John Bidwell pushed out after they finished building the railroads and a lot of the infrastructure that we still rely on today. And I wanted to say that I think it is shameful of the city council, especially of the mayor, to care so much about a building but not about human life. There are people right outside that you could help. You could do something. And I think that's what we need to do. We need to get these people sheltered, get them medical care, get them mental health services. And instead we are doing a fund to rebuild Bidwell Mansion. That's all I have. Thank you. Thank you. Lori Monroe followed by Bill Monroe. Hi. Welcome to the new council. And I just wanted to ask that you consider agendizing a managed campground and have a discussion about the pros and cons of a campground for homeless people in the city of Chico. Thank you. Thank you. Bill Monroe followed by Charles Withoon. Hello. Welcome new council. Welcome Madam Mayor. And yes, I'm not God. I don't think. But the I would ditto what my wife just shared that we do need a managed campground. But the reason I was going to come up here was that I hope that we do not try and do a Disney style reconstruction of the Bidwell Mansion. That would be kind of a travesty, I think. It just isn't the same. You go to Sutter Fort in Sacramento and kids go down there and they're shown around Sutter Fort and then it's explained to them, well this isn't the real fort. This is something that was built during the Depression as a replica of the fort. And they're just crestfallen by that. It would be a similar thing with Bidwell Mansion and I think some good things can happen with that site and I hope that it does. It will be a challenge ahead for the state parks people, but I'm sure they're going to want your all influence. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Charles Bethune. Good evening. Thank you, Council, staff, for your time tonight. I am here to announce a memorial for the 44 unsheltered neighbors of ours who have died outside in our area recently. We're meeting at Children's Park 420 Saturday, December 21st and we'll walk to the hands and read the names of the 44 who were formerly among us who have died outside recently. I welcome all of you to join us. I am here to ask the Council to direct staff to find additional ways to widen our response to our shelter crisis. This is a crisis that was described as brutal. The approach, Chico's approach to the homeless situation is described as brutal by the ACLU. I am here with the backing of five other non-profit groups. NIST has provided detailed proposals for tiny homes and church parking lots based on successful programs in Redding, Eugene, Livermore, and Walnut Creek. We have provided detailed proposals for managed campgrounds and even modeled after award-winning programs in San Diego, Portland, and San Jose. We have such a wide variety of unsheltered neighbors. Many are fragile senior women sleeping outside tonight. We need a wider range of shelter options before fragile Jan dies outside. Choose your words carefully. We are creating a legacy that we will all share. We are going to be And of which, our children will either be sad or proud. Working together, we can more effectively mitigate our deadly shelter crisis. Working together, we can do it. Thank you. Thank you. Public hearing, item 4.1, hearing to consider a historic landmark designation request. Alexander and we have associate planner, Ms. Driscoll. Thank you. Good evening, councillors. My name is Madison Driscoll. I'm an associate planner here at the city. And I will be presenting the staff report on this item. This is a proposal to nominate an existing home at 488 East 3rd Street onto the City of Chico's Historic Resources Inventory. The home is located on the northern side of East 3rd Street between Pine and Orient, just three blocks from downtown Main Street. The single family home was built by Dr. N.T. Enloe. The house served as the home for the Enloe family from 1935 to 1942. The home is an example of colonial revival architecture. The two-story side gabled white stucco home remains, retains many of its original character defining features, including the nine symmetrical windows and a balanced center door. This is a current photo in comparison. And although the home has been architecturally altered from previous renovations, staff still recommends approving this item for the inventory due to meeting Section 19.37.040 of the Chico Municipal Code, in which resources associated with individuals who were significant to the history of Chico, the state of California, or the nation. In this instance, the house, like I said, was built and served as the home for Dr. N.T. Enloe, a prominent doctor and surgeon within the Chico history. Dr. Enloe came to California to work at the Sierra Lumber Camp with a one-room hospital, seen here. Dr. Enloe also constructed Chico's first-ever hospital at 330 Flume, with originally 25 beds. Eventually, the hospital grew and relocated to its current location at 1531 Esplanade. Today, the hospital is still under operation and is a valuable institution to the city of Chico. It operates dozens of buildings throughout the city and is one of the city's largest employers. Additionally, Dr. Enloe served as the president of the Butte County Medical Society in 1925, and also conceived of the first-ever lumber ambulance. The ambulance was designated to navigate 25 miles down the first flume from West Branch to Chico. On November 20, the Architecture Review and Historic Preservation Board held a public meeting hearing and voted to forward a recommendation to city council to designate the property as a landmark. Staff and the Architecture Review and Historic Preservation Board recommend that the city council adopt the following resolution and designate the home as a historic resource. I'm available for any questions. Thank you. Any questions? Alright. I'm going to open the public hearing. Do we have any speakers? We do. We have two. Bob Somerville followed by Bo Pau. Good evening, city council. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to speak on behalf of the applicant. I'm Bob Somerville. I was a city planner here for several years and managed the Historic Preservation Program. Anna and her husband, Dustin, are out of town on a scheduled vacation. It's a work-related issue. But they're in full support of staff's recommendation to adopt the resolution in your agenda packet. I think it's a slam dunk to list this. They hope you will. So I'd be happy to answer any questions about the project or the process. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Bo Pau? The Enloe House is kind of like the Bidwell Mansion. No problem if we tell the truth about its history. You see the commercial on TV for Enloe, our history and your future. Well, I have six octenarians, people over 80 in my family that went to Chico High. All of them are looking the other way. All of them can tell you that Enloe looked the other way while the skies were black in Chico and Butte County from the smudge pots. And now today they're looking the other way while farmers are spraying children. Their nurses are sprayed. The nurses' children are sprayed. I doubt if Dr. Enloe would be proud of what's going on. The farmer that lives next door to my mom, pays money to Enloe, donates money. Todd Kimmelschuh donates money to the hospital. They both spray people, their farms. My mom lives out there in Dayton Road in the Mobile Home Park and Nicholas Nutt has been spraying them for years. The money he's made off of spraying them, he's been able to buy more orchards. We need people to care about each other. I mean, law enforcement, what's it for? They facilitate crimes against their own. We need to take it serious. Thank you. All right. Close the public hearing. Any discussion from the council? Entertain a motion? I'll move to approve designating the Enloe House as a landmark. Second? Go ahead. Second. All right. I have a motion and a second. Okay. Councilmember Goldstein? Aye. Councilmember Holly? Aye. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Winslow? effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively members of council during the regular chico city council meeting on June 6 of 2023 council initiated a conversation covering photo enforcement of red light camera or red light violations. Council ultimately voted to place further decisions toward photo enforcement of red light violations on hold until such time the police department was prepared to move forward. The decision was based on the need to increase the staffing within the chico police department to meet the demands of managing a red light camera monitoring and enforcement program. Since this decision by council was made we have continued to increase our staffing within the organization to a point where we are prepared to move forward with a formal request for proposal for the project. This will allow further analysis on the requirements of the system as it pertains to the staffing needed to manage it. During the initial discussions about photo enforcement programs we determined that the It would possibly necessitate the hiring of three additional community services officers who we would assign to the traffic unit and help facilitate the program along with assisting with the increase in traffic accidents that we' re having in the city. The cso positions would be responsible for the daily monitoring and decision making for the red light violations sent to the organization via photo enforcement protocols. Each cso would have a total cost of roughly $84,000 annually. By utilizing community services officers for this program it would allow the sworn traffic officers to focus on proactive enforcement initiatives. Our goal is to always continue finding ways to help make our streets safer and photo enforcement of red lights has shown to increase safety and reduce accidents at large intersections within communities. Recently the police department conducted a road and streets traffic safety survey which entailed a question concerning the use of red light cameras for photo enforcement at major intersections within the community. The survey was run for one week and yielded 1,885 total participants with a strong desire to initiate a photo enforcement program. And a major concern for roadway and street safety within the community. I know you were provided with the results of the survey hopefully you had a chance to pour over those there was a lot of responses that came in. I department is on those. I can answer any questions related to that survey if you have some. My request for council tonight is to provide direction on my three recommendations which are move forward with submitting the request for proposal to the public purchase government system for a minimum of 45 days once the request for proposal closes evaluate the overall fiscal impact to the city of chico. And then a possible agenda item for further discussion and final approval of the proposal. Thank you for your time I can answer any questions that you may have. the only question I have is regarding the use of the community service officers as you say in the staff report it would necessitate the hiring of three additional officers but you don' t mean to say that they hire those cso' s just for the monitoring of the red light cameras you mean that' s in addition to other duties they would have? correct. okay. thank you. so chief I read your survey the comments from the public on your survey I thought it was fascinating to hear that many times people saying the same thing people aren' t stopping at stop signs they' re going too fast and they' re running red lights and it was over and over and over again so thank you for doing that it helps solidify at least for me my opinion about the red light cameras. if I remember correctly the last time this was heard there was some uncertainty surrounding training the community service officers for testifying in court regarding the red light violations has it been clarified if city staff will be doing that or if vera mobility will be doing that? so it would be a city staff training from the police department vera mobility is just a vendor for red light camera systems that was utilized as a presentation for council vera mobility was just to show what the system is and what it does and allow questions to be asked. thank you. so I don' t have a question but I do have a comment if I may. so there' s an old adage and it' s from the 1920' s I believe almost as old as our colleague Tom van overbeck that' s a joke he' s listening I want him to have a little chuckle but the adage relates to the way that you reduce collisions and fatalities and that' s engineering enforcement and education and I look at this program as actually covering two of those not completely but supplementing what we have and I want to make sure that we don' t think that these cameras ever replace people replace personnel because they do not. Uniformed personnel particularly working traffic have a very great impact on collision rates and fatalities and I want to make sure that we understand we' re not replacing people. This is not just about car safety it' s about peds it' s about cyclists they' re all in danger from people who run red lights and if this helps in reducing those collisions that are typically extremely strong and extremely extremely dangerous and I' m all for it and I will support it. If there' s no other questions I will make a motion. I' ll take speakers first and then we' ll that' s okay no problem. I think we' re good on questions. ll throw just one more because bringing up the whole I think this is a good idea I didn' t start thinking it was that great of an idea I heard about a lot of the California regulations on how these are used and it assuaged a lot of my concerns. The one thing that that I think s concerns from the public about and some of the reasons why these have been implemented and removed in the past people feel like they' re being abused a little bit used for ticketing in order to generate revenue. So one of the concepts that our friend Tom had said is that we' re not trying to use this as a gotcha for people and one of those things where we can filter out if people are moving very slow in their car they' re not really creating a big danger hazard they just didn' t come to a complete stop. Are we confident that we can implement that in the programming of the cameras to make sure that target to only target more dangerous abuses of the traffic system? that' s a good question and it' s an honest question. What I have learned is as council member holly stated vera mobility they' re actually the largest vendor in the nation and here in California they are the supplier and vendor for every city that has them in California with the exception of two. We have a lot of I had a meeting with them like a zoom learning moment with them and one of the questions I asked was specifically related to that. The way that system works to ensure that does not occur is there' s multiple things that happen there' s a photo of the vehicle approaching the intersection from behind the traffic light. There' s a photo of the vehicle from behind the vehicle showing the red light. There' s a photo of the vehicle when it actually goes through the intersection on a red light and then there' s a 12 second video clip that shows the vehicle approaching the intersection with the light red the vehicle going through the intersection and estimated speed based off a radar system that' s in the camera systems and that gives us the ability to make a judgment decision of is this person egregiously violating a red light and creating a safety hazard. Those are all factors that we would take into consideration when we get a citation for a red light and can place what they call business rules on the camera systems for initiating a citation in those violations. at this point you won' t think you would need specific direction from us in order to detail how we use the program like that? that would specifically be something that me as a department head would set out in the rules piece for it. thank you. thank you. all right. speakers? yes. we have five. all right. i'll call the first two. vick followed by carla caldera. hello. my name is vick. two weeks ago on december 3 i was on my way to volunteer for reading pals at an elementary school. as i backed out of my driveway a car Sheridan Avenue on the wrong side of the road as I moved over to the curb and I was honking my horn continuously. The car slammed into my vehicle and also sideswiped me and then drove off. I hit and run. This was all caught on a neighbor's ring doorbell camera, thank goodness. My car was totaled and this has been a huge inconvenience for me. No transportation, dealing with a lot of writing up police reports, my insurances, etc. How ironic this has been since I have been to two previous city council meetings bringing this to your attention that we need white strikes going down the middle of the road and also possible speed bumps. Also, surveillance cameras are needed on Palmetto Avenue. I'm so glad you brought this to the attention tonight about surveillance cameras. Motorists are still rolling through the city of Palmetto Avenue and they're still rolling through the city of Palmetto Avenue. We're still rolling through the city of Palmetto Avenue. We're still rolling through stop signs, textings, and on cell phones and speeding both on Sheridan Avenue and Palmetto. I am very frustrated that this has happened and continues on. Safety should be our number one consideration on our streets. Thank you. Thank you. Carla Caldera followed by Greg Scott. Good evening. I also live on Sheridan Avenue or District 7 and I do think that people need to slow down. However, I am not a fan of mass surveillance. Like, I don't know. I'm not so sure that they'll only be used for that purpose. But what does slow me down when I'm driving is speed bumps. What does make me feel safe as a pedestrian are sidewalks on our street, which we don't have any on Sheridan. And I really just wanted to come here and support my neighbor because he had a hit or run on our street twice. It's not the first time that it's happened to him. podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem podem more than 800 people died from red light collisions. In the 14 cities in this study that reduced or eliminated red light cameras, their accidents at red light intersections went up 30%. I'm in downtown every day throughout the day, and I cannot tell you how many times people either run red lights or obviously go the wrong way on the roads, but that's a whole other story. It's time to actively try to do something to try to stop this. I agree with Councilman O'Brien. It's not going to replace people. Uniformed police officers do have a dramatic impact, but this is to be used in places where they can't be all the time, and I would wholly support and fully support the use of red light cameras. Thank you. Thank you. Steven. Steven Hazel, followed by Dane Blau. All right, Mr. Hazel, this one's red light cameras. This is Steven Hazel. I'm still gone. Okay. I have a gold rush calendar that says, to God, our number one fan. A gold rush calendar. I do. I have that. Do you have that? No. Okay. Now, this is a subject to me. I live in a garbage car, and we've had two serious accidents there. Now, going out, we need a car coming, but I'm talking about the intersection there. This could sound extreme, but you guys already made up your mind. That's what I'm saying. That's what we say. Public comment, you just do it because it's required by law. You know you're going to vote 6-0. It's wrong. Red light cameras. No. That's not the solution. The other gentleman on the end, in his mind, he thinks it's true. No. It doesn't work. Rating, whatever they have, percentage, whatever, overbeats it or whatever. Now, see, that's a town. That town sucks. Okay. That's not the answer. No. No, no, no. We had two serious accidents. One guy went through, you know what, he's coming, going, I guess, east on East 20th, and the car's coming down at Notre Dame right there. Twice, we had two major accidents. First, before moving through, there was a van. It's a car chase. It's a car chase. It's a car chase. It's a car chase. It's a car chase. It's a car chase. It's a car chase. And it's right in the side. And pull back. The lady moved out. And this drunk guy came out. They pull back. Boom. Hit. And we're going. I go, wait. I was a bad guy. Wait a minute. You never insist on a right-of-way because the lady pulled out. Of course, she had the green, but she sees the guy's going 40 miles an hour. You never insist on a right-of-way because you could be dead. I said, it's going to happen again. She's happened three. So that week, it was in November. We had the state of California at a driver's car participating in an age-well drive smart program. I got a certificate. I told everybody, watch, it's going to happen. And it's like, ever seen early edition where you know what's going to happen? I put myself right there. It was at 5 to 9. It happened. Here comes another car. And it happened. Boom. But it was boom, boom, boom. It hit three times. It follows out in the crosswalk going across toward the farmer's market. I'd been killed instantly. Well, maybe not you would have, but it would have been ugly for me. It's true. It happened. And a dog barked. It was everything. And the next day I was describing to this lady in 219, her name's Linda. I go, right when I described it, the dog barked. It was spooky, man. My life is divine. It's weird. Two accidents happened. It's a true story. I go, oh, now watch. I've got to be there because someone's going to get killed. It would be me. So I just, I waited there in my chair. It was exactly 5 to 9. It happened. This lady came through and said, yeah, I saw this guy on the phone. I go, lady, you don't insist on the right-of-way. The thing is, it's not the answer. You know what the answer is? It's the signs right there. It's the signs. It's a medical, it's a dental office. But they have one, get rid of the green sign and another one. And the other one says about measure 8 for the fines of no date. Get rid of the sign because it's like tunnel vision. So I wanted a drunk guy to go home. I did. Because he's going to be future mayor of you later. He would have been. But now he's home. He's 10,000. He'll find he'll lose everything. His car, his, what is that? A little Mini Cooper is demolished. And it was terrible. But see, I wanted him to go home, even though he's drunk. All right, that's your time. So that's what it is. Mr. Hazel, that's the best you've done. You actually stayed on track. So that was amazing. Well, there. Thank you. Don't. But your time's up. You still got to go. But going out. But going out. It's an old person. Your time's up. Come on. Thank you. It's the time. The time was cut off. No, your time's up. Our last speaker is Dane Blau. Good evening. I used to live in Cupertino before I came to Chico. And the police in Cupertino were draconian, the way they would stop people at rolling stops and, you know, just give tickets for everything. Giving tickets to people because they were in the wrong neighborhood, because they would have a sticker missing from their plate or, you know, not having their seatbelt on or some minor thing. And they had cameras on all the stoplights. And they just did. It was a terrific system of abuse. It's one of the reasons I left the place. I mean, they were universally hated. The use of anonymous cameras instead of kind of community policing is a very slippery slope where, you know, why not put cameras on everything and then have people watched everywhere? It's kind of like, you know, it's in an uncontrolled situation. It's just it becomes basically kind of like a lockdown. I actually did a study myself. I'm sure it wasn't as formal as the studies you've seen here. But I did a study myself of the accidents in Cupertino compared to Chico when I moved here some years ago. And it's about the same size cities. And the number of accidents in the two cities, here's this one city, Cupertino, that was arresting, I mean, not arresting, but ticketing people for real, almost minor stuff. Everyone got a ticket every year. They were paying their way with the tickets. And here's Chico, which has a very, didn't have a, I don't think they had a traffic group in the police at the time. And the number of accidents that caused injuries and fatalities was actually less in Chico. It's like most of the people that get caught in these nets, especially anonymous ones, are, you know, innocent people that make a mistake. And you're not. You're not going to stop people from making mistakes by having cameras. But you do anonymize the whole process of, you know, catching them in their weakest moment. I just got hit by a woman on Skyway a couple years ago. And she T-bowed me and my car spun around. My car was destroyed. Well, she and I exchanged information. She took off. The police showed up. About five minutes later. It was really quick. And the policeman said, hey, is everything okay? I said, yeah, no one's hurt, you know. And, you know, she could have gotten a ticket for leaving the scene of the accident and all this other stuff. And, you know, causing, you know, pulling out at the wrong time and all these things. That wasn't necessary. She's going to have insurance problems. She's got to fix her car. I mean, ticketing in that situation is just, like, over the top mean to people, okay? So what I'm saying is that you have to be very careful with this. That's what I'm telling you. All right. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. All right. Just a reminder to silence our cell phones if we can. Okay. Entertain a motion. I had a clarifying question. Okay. Sorry. I think you might have already been through this. But the third recommendation, is that where the potential additional officers would come in if we are looking at that potential photo enforcement program? And that would be at a later meeting, correct? So my understanding is all we're strictly doing tonight is just to vote whether we want to go out for RFP so we can bring back the conversation. So I'm guessing this will probably come back around budget time since it's going to be at least out for 45 days. And then it's got to be analyzed. But, sorry. Yeah, that's exactly right. The RFP will answer questions we have as to the economics and the amount of labor that we need to apply. Great. Then I'll just add my two cents on that. I'm a transportation planner. And I think that our first priority. Generally should be better design of roadways to disincentivize speeding and increase safety. But that said, we have people being killed by hit and runs on our streets. And pedestrian deaths generally have been rising in the U.S. due to a variety of factors, including vehicle size increasing and making it less safe if you get hit by a car, less likely to survive. So I'm open to learning more information about this as a city. And I hope that it's part of a broader set of tools for addressing pedestrian safety. And I'll see you next time. Thank you. So if there's no further comment now would be appropriate time to make such a motion. I was going to throw in something. But you can make the motion first. If you want to throw something in. Go ahead. Just to respond to a couple things. So I had a few people from District 4. Sheridan's in District 4. That's my district. Mentioned the safety issues on there. One of the things that Carla said was you have concerns about mass surveillance. And just to clarify this was something that I thought of in the first instance. And we're legislatively prohibited from using these cameras for other uses. uses than enforcement here. You notice a lot of street lights traffic lights already have cameras on them and we can' t use those cameras for these purposes. We' re pretty limited in that and it' s not adding a new element of surveillance except for the specified purpose. Also to council member O'brien's point before about enforcement and education engineering also not having sidewalks on your streets and not having lights on there safety of the streets and we have to design our streets better but I think it can make the city more safe at least at these particular intersections where we have these issues. all jokes aside council member van overbeek really carried the ball on this and I want to acknowledge that and with that having been said I would like to make a motion to authorize direct the police department and public works to! All right. I have a motion by council member O'brien and a second by vice mayor Bennett. Okay. Council member Goldstein. Aye. Council member holly. Yes. Council member O'brien. Yes. Council member Winslow. Yes. Vice mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Thank you. Thank you mayor Reynolds and council. This was actually prepared at the suggestion of the mayor. As you well know there are some meetings that get canceled due to a holiday falling on that Tuesday and there's also during the summer months that we go dark and I thought that mayor Reynolds' suggestion of providing a calendar at the beginning of the year to be approved by the council so that we would have it on the website as well as being able to help guide our meeting schedules. This in no way means that the council will only have X amount of meetings because our councils have always had special meetings when needed and those will always meet the 24 hour noticing requirement so it isn't to just stop having meetings it's actually just to set the regular sessions in place. So I'd like to just turn it over to the council. I believe we do have one speaker on this item but just wanting you to discuss it and perhaps amend the calendar as it best serves you and in terms of notifying the citizens that our meeting schedule is in place. All right I have a couple comments but we'll take speakers first and then we can talk about it amongst ourselves after we take the speaker. Steven Hazel. Oh Steve. Steven Hazel. Thank you. I'm a product of two Berkeley graduates. We got the ax. Okay. Yeah. I just like to do my job. I just wanted to do that. Hey you pioneer people. That's you guys. Remember the pioneer days. And did you have council meetings like four times a month. This is about the calendar. I talked about that. Did you used to have it once a week. Some cities used to have that once every week. And then they cut down on stuff if you went twice a month. So if you were always like twice a month that's good. But also did. I created the wave in high school. I did. I was a podemajors twice. I was in75. I did. You're off topic. This is your warning. You're disrupting a public meeting. I'm talking about I'm on cue because I'm talking about going back to your history. I'm on cue, really. It's like I'll show you an offer of proof because I actually tried. I also, I was an attorney one time, okay? I tried a case, and I did get a judgment. So I know parliamentary procedure. Actually, most attorneys, the presiding judge said that most attorneys don't even go to trial, and I did. And I got a judgment 10-2. I'm proven point of not willing in California, which is impossible. Mr. Hazel, you're outside the subject matter of the jurisdiction of this council. This is your warning. I'm on it. Okay. You're disrupting a public meeting. Because I have expert, I say I'm an expert at this point. I'm trying to establish my background. I actually tried a case. Well, people can't say they were an attorney, and I was. You look at me, you probably, no, no. And I'm trying to say the case I won. Do you have a comment on our calendar? No, I am. But you're interrupting me. See? You think you're a mind reader. No, no. See? I'm commenting. You're interrupting me. See? You think you know what I'm going to say. And before I lay it out, you know, you understand. I have a broad, I establish foundation. I come back. Apparently, you have my speech written for me. You do. You have my speech written for me, apparently. Okay. Thank you. No crime has been committed. All right. So I can stay here. It's time to go. You can resume it for a while. No crime has been committed. You're interrupting a public meeting. Sergeant at Arms, please. You're removing my right to speech. I have three speeches. I'm working. I have three speeches. I'm working. Thank you. You're wrong. You're violating my right. I'm working. I'm working. All right. Thank you for bringing this forward. This actually was my suggestion after six years of wondering whether or not we were going to have to be back the day before the 4th of July or the day after the 4th of July and what was going to happen. I just said, you know what? We knew when the 4th of July is going to be at the beginning of the year, we can probably make those decisions. So there is only a couple of small changes, and that was the second meeting in January, and that's because I think over half of us are going down to Sacramento for a training. And the only amendment that I would make to this or suggest that we consider making is the meeting in July, that we would do it on the July 8th instead of the July 15th. And other than that, if anybody has any questions, I'm welcome to answer them. But that was my only. Yeah. No, that sounds great. Thanks. Not a lot of anomalies there. Some people have kids, families, vacations, things that they want to do. I think it's just nice for staff and people to know when we're not planning on being here. Of course, if there's an emergency or something comes up, we'll gladly be here. So I consider a motion to approve as amended. So moved. I'll second that. All right. And we have a motion by Councilmember Winslow and a second by Councilmember O'Brien. Okay. Councilmember Goldstein. Aye. Councilmember Hawley. Yes. Councilmember O'Brien. Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck. Oh, excuse me. He's absent. Sorry. Councilmember Winslow. Yep. Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes. And Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. We have no items after the agenda. Reports and communications. The following reports and communication items are provided for the council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. City Manager's Report. Yeah, I do have one quick item, and that is in relation to the Bidwell Mansion loss. Obviously, we've had a lot of conversations with California State Parks. It is their property. And I just want to let you know that the superintendent is very interested in coming before council. We're hoping in January, potentially February, to begin the conversation of what's next for the state property. So I just want to let you know that they are. Very interested in beginning that public conversation. All right. Thank you very much. 6.2 is information only. 6.3, councilman requests. Pursuant to APMP 1010, councilmembers may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting. After stating what the item would be, a majority vote of council is needed in order for staff to agendize it. Do we have any councilmember requests? All right. So with the election fresh on everybody's minds, I would like to make a statement. I would like to proactively consider methods of strengthening democracy in Chico, reducing partisanship, and making it easier for people to vote in their local elections. So I want to agendize discussion of election reforms, including establishing an independent redistricting commission for after the next census, and potentially other election reforms. I'd like to second that motion. All right. We have a person to second. I don't think we need to vote on this story. Yes. Majority vote. Okay. So councilmember Goldstein. Aye. Councilmember Hawley. Yes. Councilmember O'Brien. So I'm not going to vote on any requests at this point until we have our committee assignments, collateral duties all assigned, which will be at the next council meeting. So I'm going to say no at this point. Okay. Councilmember Winslow. Yes. Yes. Councilmember Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. No. Okay. It carries 4-2 with one absence. All right. Anybody else? If I may. I'd like to make a motion to agendize a council discussion surrounding streetlight master planning. I hope we can explore the prospect of standardizing the implementation, install, and placement of the approximate 5,000 city and approximate 2,000 PG&E. Okay. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively Mayor Reynolds aye. Carries 5-1 with one absence. Alright. Any others? Alright. With that we will adjourn to our regularly scheduled City Council meeting on January 7th 2025. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year's to everyone. .
