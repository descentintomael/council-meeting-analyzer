Thank you.  Next is Public Participation.  Public Participation.  This meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N.2920.  Since the county has moved back into the top tier one purple category, the Council meeting  is going to be held without Public Participation.  Public Guidelines are for no.  Public Participation.  indoor public meetings. We could have it outdoors as long as there's no more than, I believe it was three family groups attending. So in an abundance of caution for the safety of our staff members, safety of our public and safety of the council so that we can get the COVID under control as much as possible.  This, we will not be having in-person public participation at this meeting and staff attendance in this room is very limited.  However, the public may participate remotely. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video found on the city's website.  Remote public participation.  Is allowed in the following ways.  Engaged.  Engaged Chico, excuse me.  Yes, would you read.  Yes, would you read.  Yes, would you read. Remote public participation during the meeting as I am. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video found on the city's website with remote public participation allowed in the following ways. The Engage Tico civic engagement program was available for citizen input on individual The Engage Tico civic engagement program was available for citizen input on individual agenda items prior to the meeting. Engage Tico comments were closed at 4 30 pm.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will. Public comment will be accepted by email sent to publiccomments at chicoca.gov during the meeting prior to the close of public comment on an item. The public is encouraged not to send  prior to the close of public comment on an item.  The public is encouraged not to send more than one email  per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email.  So first is the consent agenda.  Mayor Schwab? Yes.  I promised I wouldn't have questions about the agenda,  but I lied.  I am confused by an item  and I'd like a clarification before we go further.  Yes, please.  As you know, one of the items that we discuss  would be on the agenda was a question and a proposal  by myself that was passed unanimously  by the Council to agendize.  The issue was for an accounting of all funds spent  for the litigation of City versus, excuse me,  City versus MTJ, City versus Horry,  and Mulholland versus City.  That was the specific language  and in addition to that, there was the request  for discussion of ways to recover those funds.  Could somebody explain to me where that is on the agenda?  I'm going to have to defer that to the City Attorney  because I did request that that item be on this agenda  and you had sent an email and me too sending the email  and I requested that to be on the agenda.  The City Attorney had a different opinion,  so I deferred to the City Attorney  and perhaps he can give us his explanation.  Yeah, those will be discussed in closed session  under the item 7.4 relating to the Chico scrap metal  versus City of Chico.  The issues you are describing do pertain to that case  and I will explain to you how in closed session.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So that's the second half which I totally,  it would be very hard to understand how a whole different  bit of litigation is going to tell us how much money was spent  on different litigation and what are alternatives  for that different litigation is.  However, I can imagine that an accounting of the cost  of the litigation would be privileged.  Okay.  So, how possibly could be an expenditure  of the City not be able to be discussed  and disclosed in open session?  Again, I cannot get into the details of that in open session.  I will explain in closed session the issues surrounding  those matters.  I will ask the Council or I'll take it upon myself  after closed session to publicly disclose the cost  of that litigation.  And I, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.  I, again, totally disagree.  It sounds like you have this disagreement with both the Mayor  and with other department heads on this item.  So, I look forward to closed session.  I think that this is another cover-up of this,  this whole issue and I'm disappointed.  What?  Wow, my microphone is much louder than everybody else's.  Yes.  No, it's not.  Okay.  Okay.  Why don't we just take the closed session item ahead  of schedule and take it now?  It's a possibility.  I'm not totally in bed with that idea, but.  The Council at closed session could take action to discuss it  in open session, correct?  Correct.  I just request to take the agenda item earlier  in the agenda.  But if it's not on the agenda, then it's not.  Okay.  So, if it's not on the agenda to discuss, are we allowed to,  well, it is on, you're right, it is, as closed session.  And then reporting out on closed session.  It's up to the Council.  If you make the motion, I'll support it.  No?  I understand the sentiment.  I appreciate it.  I think the mistake's been made.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you.  One thing I was going to note on the public participation,  we are looking into the possibility  of using the Zoom platform for future meetings  where the public can participate via Zoom.  Initially when we had started down this path,  Zoom was not compatible with the Granicus software  that we use to record our meetings.  And now it looks like it may be.  So I know there have been a couple of emails like,  why can't we have people be able to participate virtually  through Zoom and some of the security aspects  and the compatibility aspects are being navigated.  So, okay.  Okay. So we'll start with the consent agenda.  So the consent agenda sent agendas for items that are routine  and can be acted in one motion.  Are there any Council disqualifications or no votes?  Any public comments via email or via Engage Chico?  So we received one email or comment in Engage Chico  and that was from Robin Engle.  Okay.  And I would ask Danny if there are any public comments on consent?  No.  Okay.  It's a very short comment.  Okay. Everybody had an opportunity to review that.  Council want to remove any items from the consent agenda?  Otherwise I will entertain a motion.  Second.  Motion and a second.  Another vote please.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Sorry.  Council Member Orry.  Aye.  Council Member Stone.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Aye.  Mayor Schwab.  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  And then business room floor.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter.  Council members are not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited three minutes.  Or as determined by the mayor, based on the number of speakers,  council can't take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda.  Did we have any comments on Engage Chico?  We received four comments from Engage Chico and the copies are in front of you.  And then we can check with Danny to see if we received any public comments.  But the four comments are in front of you.  Okay.  And the comments that were received from Engage were from Lisa Currier, Kim Dietz, Angela McLaughlin, and Robin Engle.  And there are no public comments in the session.  Thank you.  Okay.  Has council had an opportunity to read those comments?  Then we will move to public hearings.  Item 4.1.  A hearing ordering formation of maintenance assessment district A38.  Oh, hi, .  Hello.  Good evening, council.  Item 4.1 is requesting the formation of a new Chico maintenance district, A38, for the covenant court subdivision, which includes improvements that will be  established in a funding mechanism through property taxes.  Obviously, it's a fairly common item.  So if there's any questions specific to this one, I'm available to answer.  That concludes my report.  Are there any questions?  Okay.  So I guess I'll ring the gavel anyway to open the public comment.  Did we receive any comments?  We did not.  Okay.  Did we receive any emails?  No.  Okay.  That's easy.  So we'll close the public comment.  And I'll entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Okay.  Second.  All right.  Have a vote, please.  Okay.  Councilmember Huber?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Ori?  Aye.  Councilmember Stone?  Aye.  Okay.  Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absent.  I'd like to request a five-minute break.  I didn't make some big changes.  I didn't make some big changes.  I didn't make some big changes.  I didn't make some big changes. [inaudible]  Okay, thank you.  Regular Agenda 5.1, Consideration of Policing Review Ad Hoc Committee.  Final report.  Report by Mayor Schwab.  So, these are my notes from the Police Ad Hoc Committee.  I read an email today.  It was 960 pages.  I'll probably have another 20 pages to that.  But, fortunately, I've condensed it down to just a couple of pages.  But,  that summarizes our proceedings.  So, if you'll indulge me, I've got some things to share with you.  And, perhaps it would be better if we waited for questions at the end.  So, at the June 23rd Special Council meeting,  the Council approved my proposal to form an ad hoc committee  for the Ad Hoc Committee.  to review police force, use of force policies,  including training and implementation,  and report those recommendations for any reforms to the Chico City Council  within 90 days.  Council-directed special attention should be paid to items highlighted  in the My Brother's Keepers Pledge.  This was a very limited focus for the committee.  It was very limited in time and scope.  However,  during that process, I think, I would hope that all members  of the committee learned quite a bit, and so did members  of the public who were able to attend via WebEx.  The committee was small.  There were only nine members, three Council members.  Each one of those Council members was able  to appoint someone from the public.  I think it was pretty well represented in that respect,  as far as, you know,  the National Left-Rider Center.  I heard some complaints from the public  that it was very heavily conservative.  I would disagree.  There were also three members of the police department.  The chief started as the interim chief, and two officers,  one which was the training sergeant.  I think it was important to have the police department there,  members of the police department, members of the union,  because if we're going to have any change,  we need to have the buy-in of the police department.  We had several findings.  The city attorney affirmed that the Chico's use  of force policy is compliant with AB 392.  I think you all remember back in the beginning of June,  late May, when there was the incident in Minneapolis,  in the early early 2000s.  The murder of George Floyd.  We had a number of people come after us,  or come ask the city to look at the use of force policy,  specifically those My Brother's Keepers.  We got lots of emails saying that they demanded  that our use of force policy was in compliance with 392.  And our city attorney's office actually did a line  by line comparison of 392 to our, you know,  our use of force policy.  And it was their advice that we were in compliance with that.  We did spend a lot of time talking about training  and hiring and background checks, because that was  to the integrity of the process.  Also in the training, there's lots of questions on the use  of de-escalation, and that goes directly to training.  So for Chico Police Officer hiring and background checks,  in California, the Commission on Police Officer Standings  and Training, Standards and Training, called POST,  they set the standards for hiring, recruitment,  and training practices.  We had a representative from POST at one of our meetings.  He was actually, I think, the field supervisor  who has a direct, you know,  direct relationship with the city of Chico that comes in  and audits our practices for training, number of hours  for training, the hiring process.  And it was his opinion that the Chico Police Department meets  and in some areas exceeds those standards,  particularly in the background process.  These are completed by a completely independent company  who specializes in law enforcement.  They're not a law enforcement employee hiring.  Many law enforcement agencies, especially those  in the north state, have someone from their existing staff,  a detective, or perhaps someone who is a retired officer,  do the background checks.  Well, there's some implicit bias there.  We are a small community.  People know each other, and they may, as much as that person may  want to give as much as they can,  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some might be some bias in that background check. However, the city of Chico has their background checks for law enforcement by an independent company. POST requires officers and dispatchers  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  requires officers and dispatchers to have a pre-employment background check, but Chico  Police Department goes above and beyond that standard and requires pre-employment background  checks for all personnel that work or volunteer for the Chico Police Department.  Post reviews the investigations and the post representative that attended our meetings  that they were incredibly thorough.  A note on lateral officers, if someone is coming from another agency, the chief has  access to those background checks from the personnel file at the other agency, can review  those and it's the practice of the Chico Department if there is anything that is sealed or questionable  in that background check.  They will not hire that officer.  Chico Police Officer Training Overview.  Chico Police Department meets or exceeds the requirements for post mandated training and  offers additional optional training.  Every officer's training is logged on post software, post monitors requirements and notifies  Chico PD if his officer is out of compliance in their training.  Meaning that they haven't stayed on top of it.  Marty Picon who was the post representative verified that Chico Police Department has  never been out of compliance with their training for as long as he had been reviewing those.  That gave me the impression that he is probably at 10 years or so, so quite some time.  The training outlines and lesson plans are posted on the City of Chico Police Department's  website.  The training is also available on the City of Chico Police Department's website.  CIT training.  Chico Police began sending their officers to CIT training 10 years ago to become certified  after taking a week long course.  All officers started receiving a day line CIT training 5 or 6 years ago.  And Council recently funded the police department about a quarter of a million dollars for some  additional CIT training.  I think it was $1.5 million.  That's a lot of money.  So the training is for 40 hours for the training and for the overtime that would be incurred  by officers being off the street.  Reality based training is something that is very important and the Chico Police Department  is investing in it and is asking for the council's support to invest in it even more.  Recent literature has advocated including the just released post de-escalation training.  The police department has also announced that they are going to be doing a post de-escalation  training that will provide inoculation strategies and techniques publication.  That reality based training that will provide inoculation from stress and maintain decision  making ability at the same time.  So this is comprehensive training that takes into account the stress levels, the high adrenaline  and combining it with one training so that it's not isolated or it's in silos.  It is done in silos.  It's done in silos.  In conjunction with that.  Starting last year, the department use of force training has shifted away from skill  based or block training.  They've discovered they need to train the officers in scenarios that allow for critical  thinking so they can perform these skills on the street.  Chico Police Department has been reviewing their use of force training and moving towards  using techniques that are principle based.  And gross motor skills.  They are already doing some of this work and they are looking to do more in order to  create the paradigm shift they are seeking.  And the post publication I mentioned earlier recommends this high fidelity training.  The Council directed special attention should be paid to items highlighted in the My Brother's  Keeper Pledge which were very similar to the Eight Can't Win.  They are the top of the list and the top of many people's concerns.  Chief Madden shared that the Police Department is looking for ways to regionalize the CIT  training with the goal of providing 40 hours for all staff.  In Northern California, Chico Police Department is really looked upon as the leader in training.  Not only the thoroughness of the training that the officers need to be doing but the  innovation that they are receiving it in.  Officers use of maneuvers that cut off oxygen or blood flow.  The carotid artery hold, AB 1196 removes the carotid control hold from the policy.  The Governor has signed this bill and it will come out soon at our next policy update.  Our Chief has said that the, just the choke hold is the most important thing to the Police  Department.  The choke hold has not been part of our policy for years and did take action immediately  to adjust the carotid control hold.  Officer intervention.  Intervention is already in place.  We have mandatory reporting requirements as well.  Chief Madden will be adding to the policy the duty to intervene and report other law  enforcement agencies as well.  So that is if.  A sheriff's officer, someone who, a highway patrol officer, a different police agency  that perhaps was in a car chase that ended up in Chico.  They are all subject to the officer intervention that is in place in the City of Chico.  I asked about STACN to ensure officers could intervene or report their supervisors.  It is one thing for an officer to report another officer but for an officer to report  their supervisor is another.  So Chief Madden responded that the policy would be changed from using the term officers  to law enforcement personnel to capture that intent.  Officer shooting at moving vehicles.  Chico PD policy clearly expresses that shooting at moving vehicles and the inherent dangers  of this type of force.  The Chief.  A.  stated that he would not remove this policy as there may be a time where officers may have to fire on a vehicle  in defense of their lives or the lives of our citizens.  The chief can think of a number of scenarios where this type of force may be needed to be used.  For instance, on December 19, 2016, a truck was deliberately driven into Christmas Market in Berlin,  leaving 13 people dead and 56 others injured.  The truck was eventually stopped on its own automatic brakes, but there was no intervention by law enforcement.  Types of force.  Emergent technologies are becoming available, which the police department is interested in.  They are expensive, items such as the bolo wrap, less lethal rounds, and drones,  which allow the police department to use de-escalation and alternative methods of force to resolve issues.  They are new technologies, and they have to be tested, and they are expensive.  But if our goal is to resolve situations with the least amount of force, we need to be looking at these technologies.  Chief Madden shared that the police department is looking for a way to recognize the CIT training  with the goal of providing 40 hours for all staff.  Officers' use of all other reasonable means of force before resorting to deadly force  is a problem.  The CIT training is addressed in Policy 300.3.2.  Very long, so I didn't cite any particulars there.  The use of force incidents.  The Chico Police Department tracks all use of force incidents, and these are included in an annual report.  Use of force incidents are a very low percentage of the total annual calls.  However, the Chico Police Department does not track incidences of D.E.O.S.  or de-escalation.  Chief Madden is identifying software which would track de-escalation incidents, so this  data will be included in the annual report.  The use of force data is forwarded to the training instructors so that this information  is constantly being incorporated into trainings.  Officers giving a verbal warning.  Verbal warnings addressed in the deadly force applications.  Officers reporting.  Each time they use force or threaten to use force, for instance, pointing a gun at a  person, the intervention is already in place.  We have mandatory reporting requirements as well.  Chief Madden will be adding to the policy the duty to earn a ring and report other law  enforcement agencies as well.  The example of other agencies coming into our city.  They will be...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  They will be required to use each time they use force or threaten to use the force.  So there's some changes on the horizon.  The Council has already approved the additional funding for CIT.  There's anticipated changes in state law.  We saw some bills be introduced late in the summer that are going to be in effect in January,  but I would expect that there would be many more in the new legislative session.  Already SB 230 is...  will be in effect in January.  The Chief is already revising the use of force policy to make sure that it is compliant with  230.  And in addition, making sure that the officers are trained in these use of force policies.  Any changes that are put forward.  to the manual so that on January 1st there won't be a learning curve. They will be familiar and trained in those changes ahead of time.  The Police Community Advisory Board has been re-envisioned by the Chief. I saw on the agenda planning calendar a discussion of that in an upcoming meeting.  So it's not going to be the same Community Advisory Board included in that.  That would be a different agenda.  I think some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  and where they can be affected on a more statewide or national level.  And I think we're going to see that from the state level.  And I think it's also important to note that when we started these series of meetings,  we had Interim Chief Madden, and now we have Chief Madden.  I have found him to be someone who is very open to suggestions,  someone very passionate, very interested in knowing what the community,  how to interact with the community, how to be more open,  and how he will manage his department and his force.  The community does desire transparency.  There are already annual reports.  I would like to see some council updates so that people,  many people are saying, well, where's the accountability?  Well, the accountability is with the council.  It's with the city manager.  So having those reports brought to the council so they can be reviewed in a public setting,  I think, is appropriate.  The Police Community Advisory Board.  Some committee members did express a desire to have additional information from outside sources  to explore other cities' use of force policy.  Remember, this was a very short in duration committee assignment.  We did reach out to some other law enforcement agencies,  but they were not forthcoming in attending.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Either because of time, probably.  And Mayor Schwab and Committee Member Berry did submit emails  which were attached to this report,  as well as Margaret Swick, committee member,  and Corey, oh gosh, what was his last name?  Hunt, thank you, did submit some emails.  And Councilmember Casey Reynolds did as well.  I suggested that the council look at the training funding to make sure  that the officers can be trained in some of these new technologies, the CIT training,  moving from a tool-based training to a tool-based training,  to a holistic approach.  It's a positive investment in our community.  The post-annual audit results, currently, from the way I understand it,  when the post representative comes to CHICO to review things,  to look at the electronic data interchange to track the training,  if there is anything out of compliance, then he notifies,  or that person knows that.  If there is anything out of compliance, then he notifies the police chief.  I would recommend that they also notify the city manager,  so there is that oversight as well.  As noted earlier, I would like the department to have some new software  that could track the use of force and de-escalation incidences  to better summarize the training.  The assessment is key to identifying strengths,  and opportunities in developing new training.  Software platforms will assist making data-based decisions.  In addition, training summaries need to be presented in a format  which would provide that analysis.  Implicit bias training, I think more information is needed  before I could make a recommendation.  The committee did not discuss specifics of implicit bias training.  There were several concerns raised by the committee members,  and members of the public regarding bias.  The concern of filing complaints was raised several times.  I think that it's important to have our community feel comfortable  in coming forward to make those complaints,  so that they can be investigated.  The officer, if the officer is in wrong, can be disciplined.  If it's a training matter, then we need to know about that.  So it can be addressed in the training.  However, if someone is not feeling comfortable in making a complaint,  or feels that there might be some repercussions from making a complaint,  I think that that needs to be addressed.  And I am hopeful that the community advisory board,  community police advisory board, will help provide the chief some guidance,  so that they can be advised in that.  They will be empowered to take complaints.  But also, what are those barriers?  And I think being in an organization,  it may blind you from seeing what those walls are  seen by other members of the community.  But the chief cannot act on hearsay, or suppositions,  or this is what people say.  They need to be able to react to specifics.  And so, as we can get more public lodging those complaints,  if they are there, otherwise they cannot be addressed.  So that's my recommendation.  We did find that post-training reimbursements,  and so an officer goes to a post-training,  their training is reimbursed by post.  Their travel necessarily isn't, but there are some expenses.  So police training budget is given annually.  When those reimbursements come back to the city on those post-trainings,  it isn't given back to the police budget,  it's given back to the general fund.  So I think it's important that I would recommend  that those go back to the police training budget.  Committee member Hunt said that he felt that the police  should not have been members of the committee.  He would like to see some programs around community trust of police.  He felt that what seemed to be a culture of demissiveness  needs to be addressed.  And would have liked to have presentations  from independent organizations.  Committee member Berry wanted increasing the budget  for training purposes, support the transition  to reality-based training, support the emotional health  of officers, increase staffing levels and adequate budget,  defer the guidance of the police chief regarding management  of crime in Chico, establish an annual audit report  from the chief of police on key metrics associated with post.  Proper and adequate support of the police department  in the budget process should also receive top priority.  So what I came away with in the, after the ad hoc committee met,  was I felt that we were able to do what was asked of by the council  to look at those My Brother's Keepers issues that were very similar  to the Eight Can't Wait, to see that our use of force policy  addressed those particular issues and was in compliance.  That we were in compliance with AB 392, which I feel that we are.  Many members of the committee wanted more and I had told them  that the scope of our committee was very limited and that I,  they could express those concerns and let the council decide  what next steps might be taken.  There's going to be many, there will be legislation at the state level  that will be coming towards us.  We have a brand new chief who has new goals, a commitment to our community.  And just an outstanding training program in the city of Chico.  I was very impressed with Sergeant Pena, who takes the lead on the training.  Very committed to the latest, latest, what do we call that?  Pedagogy, pedagogy in training.  And I, I think that, I think that, I think that, I think that, I think that,  I think that it is important for the council to stay informed  of what is going on with the police department.  To have annual reports.  Or more as needed.  One complaint we do hear about many times is if there is a critical incident  or an officer-involved shooting.  Why is it done at the county level?  Well, the state does not provide a different form of investigation.  So I think looking at what is being done at the county level.  where the expectations for change are.  Are they at the local level?  Are they at the state level?  Or are they at the federal level?  There are lots of concerns that we should have  more mental health advisors, workers, technicians  riding along with the police.  Is that the city of Chico or is it the county of Butte?  So looking to see where it is that we can make those partnerships,  make those changes,  and to always to be looking to our community for guidance.  So I can answer any questions.  Vice Mayor Brown was on the committee  and I'm sure she has some comments to make as well.  Any questions or comments for me?  Vice Mayor Brown, would you like to make comments?  Sure.  Thank you.  Well, I want to thank Council for agreeing to appoint me to this committee  and to the committee and community members who served  and observed the discussions that Mayor Schwab just outlined.  I think you all know I requested to be on this committee  because of its alignment with the proposal that I brought to Council  that Council had considered.  Earlier, and I wanted to make sure that I had all the information necessary  to make informed decisions from the seat that I'm in.  I think it would have been valuable for any Council member  to kind of hear the overview of how our police department is doing  and to look at our policies and our training requirements.  I genuinely believe that the goal of this Council was to ensure  a thorough review of our policies and accompanying training  and to do that in a collaborative way,  which I believe that's how the committee was structured.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I think I will make some final remarks.  of a critical discussion on instituting changes to policy  that the function of the committee fell short.  We did receive a handful of presentations  that were valuable and information  from the Chico Police Department  and our professionals working there  about training and policy.  And we never really moved to what I would call  the next step, which is why or why not  to implement more robust use of force policies  and comparing those to other communities  or to the sample policies put forward by Campaign Zero  and adopted by the It Can't Wait organization.  I think leaving this committee,  I fully believe that we have a police department  whose policies are aligned with state law,  whose training requirements exceed state requirements.  And I think that we've done a lot over the years  to become a stronger police department.  The discussion about changing our use of force policies  really wasn't about questioning that reality.  It was about looking at paths forward  and kind of measuring and being a little bit more critical  in our analysis of the language and function  of our current use of force policies,  measuring those against departments  across the state and nation who have done more  to effectively address public health, public safety,  mental health crises and more.  So I'll just note that I left these meetings with a few things  that I'm pleased to share with you.  The police department has a really solid foundation  in training and policy.  That the committee did not do its due diligence  in comparing their policies and training  to other organizations  and potentially comparing them to organizations  that are a little bit more reform minded  and looking at those changes.  And that the community was not as involved  as I would have felt comfortable with in these discussions.  I think it's important to have a balance  when you're having these conversations  that all the stakeholders are at the table.  Obviously the Chico Police Department is a stakeholder.  They're going to have to adapt to these changes  just as they have to adapt to state policy changes that occur.  But I feel that we consistently heard from the public  that they weren't feeling like they had a place  to ask their questions or a place  to kind of share those experiences.  So I think for me that was absent  and a more robust committee discussion  and I want to say kind of debate about some of these items  felt like it was absent.  And so I couldn't really say that I was absent.  I couldn't really pull from this process  what the path forward could be.  I deeply understand the issues of policing  in communities are complex.  I also recognize that we have new leadership  and Chief Madden who's expressed a strong desire  to institute new policies and to look at new ways forward.  I'm looking forward to seeing those changes.  And I also think that we need to do more to rethink  the way that we define public safety  and our approach to it in the short and long term.  So I would still be supportive of looking at  and comparing our policies to policies that exist  in other communities as models  and to looking at ways to change that discussion.  But I do appreciate the opportunity to serve and to learn.  Thank you.  So this report is for just review  and acceptance by the council.  So comments, questions?  Thank you.  Quick comment.  The Mayor Schwab, he put the committee together  at a very turbulent time for policing  a lot of community outcry  and the probably easier not to do it.  And no one was going to be fully happy  with everything that went and how it went  and who got on the committee.  But I appreciate the work of the committee  and your report was incredibly thorough and good.  So wherever this ends up going,  this was a good step for the community.  For the community.  Thank you.  To comment on Vice Mayor Brown's statement  that the community probably did not have as much interaction.  COVID-19 2020.  Yes, we could have done a better job of that.  Perhaps the community police advisory board  is a better place for those discussions.  This is a first step.  I didn't see any glaring inconsistency with state law.  I saw some very forward thinking,  thorough training,  thorough hiring practices,  compliance with state law.  But in order to have that,  the transparency,  transparency and trust and involvement in the community,  there needs to be an ongoing dialogue.  Other questions?  Yes, so first I wanted to thank you,  Mayor Schwab,  for your work on this.  And then thank you more broadly for serving as the mayor  for the last few months  and for your service to the community.  And I'd like to thank all of the outgoing council members  for their service at this time.  And thank you also, Vice Mayor Brown,  for being involved in those meetings.  So, Vice Mayor Brown, I had a question.  Your statement left me feeling like  there are next steps in mind as far as you're concerned.  And I'd like to know if you could sort of outline  what you think those next steps would be,  if you'd like to.  And also, what would the protocol be for  the  getting there, for going to the next steps?  Yeah, thank you, Council Member, for the question.  I think there's a couple of things.  And one thing that we hear regularly from the community  is looking into or analyzing this idea of an independent  body of citizens to do a little bit more of a review.  I know that the Police Community Advisory Board  may be morphed into more of that type of a model.  But I think I consistently heard from the public that,  and I think we consistently hear,  that there is a desire to have something that's a little bit more  independent as a work group and to do some analysis.  I think this was a good foundation from like an educational perspective  to learn where we are at.  And one of the things that we just didn't have enough time to do  that I had requested was there are model policies  that come from police departments throughout the nation,  some in California, some not.  I know there's differences in state law in different states,  and so that plays in.  We just didn't get a chance to look into the nitty-gritty of that  and to kind of measure that language.  There are sample policies presented by Campaign Zero,  adopted by the Eight Can't Wait group,  supported by some level of research.  I won't say that they're evidence-based.  But the real conversation that I wanted to have  was comparing these policies that are listed here in this report,  the My Brother's Keeper,  which is very similar to the Eight Can't Wait policies,  to our policies, semantically.  And I think that's a good foundation for us to have.  And discussing why or why not to change  or to adapt to those new policies.  And that's a much more nuanced conversation,  but it's a conversation that I wanted to have  and felt was kind of necessary for me to understand  where to move forward  and where maybe strengthening some of those policies  could be beneficial  and where maybe it doesn't make sense for our community.  So I think that's what I would say would be a helpful path forward  for me as a policymaker.  So where would that,  or where are we at?  Where or when would that proposal happen?  When would we discuss that?  I mean, this seems like our opportunity  since we're reviewing this voluminous report  to propose some of those things.  But are we thinking that,  are you thinking that there's a point in the future  that you'd want to propose that?  I kind of had hoped it would have occurred  during the committee meetings,  but there was some discussion about continuing them  with that aim.  I think it was a little lost on me  why we didn't have those discussions.  So I think it could happen here at the dais.  I think it could happen in a continuation  of the ad hoc committee or some new version of it.  I think what matters most to me  is that the public has, you know,  open access to those conversations  so that they can learn as we are.  And Mayor Schwab,  I didn't hear any references  to, I heard references to police advisory committees,  but I didn't hear any references  to citizen advisory committees  or citizen oversight committees  or whatever label you want to place on that.  I wonder, was that discussed at all?  That was outside of the purview of our discussion.  This was the policing review, not police,  and that's an important distinction.  This is policing in as far as the practices  of the police department and training, hiring,  and the policies.  In many comments, you saw that there was a desire  for an oversight board,  but that wasn't part of our focus.  I would think that if at a later date,  council member would like to bring that forward,  they may.  My suggestion would be to let this chief  show his commitment,  well, he's shown his commitment,  but through his actions,  what kind of changes may come in the police department  as far as opening, over openness,  transparency,  and how the citizens  or the community advisory board is.  So do you feel like those two things  are sort of mutually exclusive of one another?  Yes, I do think that they are mutually exclusive.  Citizens Oversight Committee,  I think is the council, quite frankly,  and the city manager.  Through the city manager.  We have direct,  the city manager directly reports to us.  If we feel that the chief of police  is not doing his job,  which his primary job is to make sure  that the use of force policy is compliant  and the officers are compliant with state law  and the officers are compliant  and the officers are compliant with state law,  trained to that,  and that the department represents that.  That it is in his,  or the police chief's judgment  on the use of force policy.  Since we oversee his,  or the police chief's supervisor,  then the council has that more direct authority.  That's why I'm encouraging more reports  to council,  chief has already made sure  that the training outlines,  requirements are on the website,  that those transparencies occur.  So I'm going to suggest that structurally  and procedurally,  the council acting as a citizens' advisory committee  is not the same as citizens acting  as a citizens' advisory committee.  Because citizens have the ability  to talk to each other  on a regular basis about things.  We have all sorts of rules  about how often,  and the structure around  how we can talk about things.  I am heartened, like you are,  and I believe Vice Mayor Brown is,  by our new chief  and his direction and his enthusiasm  for continuing to make this department  as good a department as it can be.  At the same time,  we suffer many of the same issues  that cities around the country have  with continuing officer-involved shootings  over the years.  The community,  certainly a section of the community  or a portion of the community  has been asking for quite a while  to have a greater role in oversight  of  the police department's actions  of shootings,  of various functions.  I was just looking over a list of cities in California  that have advisory committees,  and there's over 20.  I would like to see the result of this  being the next step  that we start having discussions  about a citizens' oversight  or citizens' advisory.  So I don't know how we incorporate that  into the acceptance of this report,  but that would be my recommendation  for going forward for next steps  as I'd like to see that discussion take place.  A couple of comments.  One is that I don't think that it is  right to compare officer-involved shootings  in Chico to what we're seeing  in other communities.  The officer-involved shootings,  the last two,  well,  two,  were investigated  and found that the police officers involved  were following the regulations  that they were,  I suppose the term would be,  justified.  The one that we have had most recently,  we haven't had any type of report on that.  So if the question is,  what is the investigation?  Well, we saw in one case of those,  it was appealed through the court system  and still upheld.  So,  I would like to see our police department  come out more in front of those investigations  or more open with those investigations  once they occur.  It seems like many times they're silent  and it could be because they're going into the litigation  and they're not coming forward to those.  So I would argue firmly that  those high-opening cases,  high-profile shootings that are occurring  in other communities  should not be compared to what is happening in Chico.  I do think that they should be investigated  and perhaps something statewide,  like an investigation team  that isn't comprised of county teams.  Well, if that's the direction that council wants to go,  they need to know that  it's going to be expensive to do that  and the results will not be as quick.  If the council would like to fund that separately,  then that's an option for council to do as well.  I would suggest that if you  wanted to have a discussion of this,  of an oversight board,  then that comes from you as a council member  under,  council member requests,  and if the council wishes to go forward  and consider your request at a future council meeting,  then they could do that.  That's where I'm thinking.  Our chief is here too,  if anybody has any questions for him.  Sorry to put you on the hot spot.  Other questions?  Any other questions or comments?  Okay.  We need a motion to review and acceptance of the report.  We did receive some comments.  Oh, yes.  We received five in the engaged Chico component,  and those were from Lisa Currier,  Jessica Giannola,  Angela McLaughlin,  Robin Engle,  and Daniel Rodriguez.  And then Danny, did we get any?  We have one in the public comments email from Laura Westwick.  Okay.  We'll give council a few minutes to review those.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I think I will make some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  Council need any additional time?  I move to accept the report.  Second.  So we have a motion and a second to accept the report.  Any additional comments, discussion?  Have a vote please.  Council Member Huber? Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member Orry? Aye.  Council Member Stone? Nay.  Vice Mayor Brown? Same.  Mayor Schwab? Aye.  Carries 4-1 with one absence and one abstention.  We will go to item 5.2, Vice Mayor Brown's request to resolution supporting Medicare for all.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thanks for hearing this item, which was presented to me by the Duke County Health Care Commission.  I am a member of the Duke County Health Care Coalition with broad community support and endorsement by a range of local organizations and agencies, which is included in your agenda packet today.  It's not lost on me that this Council will never make decisions about federal policies, such as Medicare for all.  However, I do believe it's our duty to join other cities in support of these efforts that can have a massive positive impact on our residents and our community.  COVID-19 has eliminated how inequity in health care access isn't working for most Americans.  This resolution I'm requesting Council endorse tonight is a small statement from our city, alongside another 40-plus cities in our country, supporting the effort to create a health care system that's more equitable.  So I humbly request that you join me in supporting this Medicare for all resolution.  I also want to thank members of the public for sharing their perspective on this item through public comment tonight, and to the Duke County Health Care Coalition for their work and for bringing this item to us.  And I'm open to any questions based on what's included in today's agenda packet.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Questions, comments?  I was in a conversation earlier with someone who said, well, why are you acting on something, what can the city do about it?  And I said, well, this shows support that we are the advocates for our community, that perhaps we can't make the change in Chico, but in making this statement, presenting it to our community,  to our elected officials at the federal level, state level, federal level, we can show that the citizens of Chico want this and have that support.  So no, we can't make, you were right in your introduction, we can't make the case, well, we can make the case for Medicare for all, and we can influence.  And I think that that's important for us to do, to be the outlier.  We can be the allies for our community, to be the advocates.  Thank you.  So we do have a lot of comments on this.  So how many people did we hear from Engage Chico?  From Engage we received two, one from Jessica Giannola and then the other one from Kim Dietz.  We did receive multiple emails that I had forwarded on today.  I did not get an actual count on those, but, Dani, have we received any additional through the public comment?  Just one on public comments from Bruce McLean.  But we did receive multiple ones that were just sent to our individual address.  We did, and there were quite a few of them.  They will have been downloaded and also be part of the public record in the agenda packet, just because of the timing and the time that they were coming in.  And I didn't consolidate all those names.  Okay.  Perhaps just as a way to outreach to our community that encouraging people to make those comments into the comment email would be advantageous for the future.  Yes.  All right.  Any other questions?  Well, I will make the motion to submit.  Okay.  So, I will ask for the support to sign on to this resolution for Medicare.  Second.  Oh, it's a three-way time.  Make it to Huber.  Saves our community money.  Second.  Give it to Councilmember Huber.  Okay.  Any other questions before we take a vote?  Comments?  Okay.  Councilmember Huber?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  No.  Councilmember Orry?  No.  State?  State.  Okay.  Councilmember Reynolds is absent.  Councilmember Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 4-1 with one absence and one abstention.  So, item 5.3, which was Councilmember Reynolds' request for the Peddi-Cap-R up crawl will be tabled and talked about at a discussed December meeting.  5.4.  Councilmember Stone, Highway 32 traffic issues, the 2nd Street Fair.  Sure.  I think this, you know, when this item came up in September, or I brought it up, we were  looking for ways to fix some of the traffic concerns, particularly we had a pedestrian,  automobile pedestrian accident that was fatal on the northern end of Highway 32, and there  have been a lot of access issues, particularly ADA access issues along 2nd and 3rd Street.  Okay.  And there's a lot of traffic issues that should be addressed, and these are, you know,  this is potentially a lower income, more lower income area.  There's a school across the street, and there are hundreds of, well, excuse me, thousands  of students that traverse that section, both from the university as well as throughout  the community.  Crossing that section of Highway 32, there was another fatal drunk driving accident  by a, where a student was killed traversing that section of town, and it just seems amazing  to me that yet even with the agenda item to have this discussion, there's no additional  details from staff or otherwise about what's going on there and what are our potential  options.  So I will just reiterate that we should be addressing that, and I'd like us to, and I  thought that's what Council was voting for.  Well, I've been clearing out files, and I found the Chico Nord Avenue State Route 32  report that I will leave with you.  It's a report that was made in November 2006, and I realize that a lot of things have changed,  including the invention of the iPhone.  But I think that there's some good information that is in here.  State Route 32, so state level, but we've done some great work along State Route 32,  including the traffic signal at that tennis court crossing, for lack of a better term  for it.  I know it has an official name.  But it does, this is another example of where we can unite together and advocate to our  state officials, to BK, to the county, to get some action done.  Because although it is a state route, these are our community members, our citizens who  are crossing those streets.  You make an excellent point.  The intersections there and the Caltrans sidewalks are ADA compliant.  So it is the adjoining streets, the city of Chico's streets, and not the highway itself  and those specific intersections.  So the intersections themselves are up to some measure of ADA compliance, and you understand  how these things can change over time.  But the intersections themselves, the pedestrian crossings themselves, are reasonably ADA compliant.  It doesn't matter.  I think some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  of a community that's over 150 years old.  This is not a failure of staff.  This is just the revenue that we have in order to fix these things.  But this particular couple of sections, we have seen a high fatality rate.  We know what the advocacy could be to help it improve in those areas,  and we know how many people, and this is what's kind of astounding to me,  you have a very large apartment complex.  I can't remember the name, and I'm not going to say their old name or their more casual name,  but there's an apartment complex, a very, very sizable one,  that has residents that are students at the university  that have to cross that section of the highway every single day,  and in order to do that, navigating that course at 2nd and 3rd and 1st  without the light, if you dare to, on Highway 32.  And I can't believe that we're going through this.  We're going through this number of cycles in order to get this addressed.  At least a report.  Public Works Director, Engineering, Brandon Ottoboni here,  and can you share some light on any action that's being taken in this area?  Yes, thank you very much.  I thought I'd just, it was an apropos moment to talk about some of the things that are going on.  Caltrans is in the process of looking at that entire corridor.  So if you're familiar, they start at the Highway 99,  intersection of Highway 32, and have worked doing ADA improvements  and installing curb, gutter, and sidewalk,  and they're working their way up Highway 32  to where it turns into, obviously, Walnut and then North Avenue.  And so they're looking at that North Avenue, Walnut Street corridor,  looking at operational improvements, so traffic signal,  addressing certain traffic signal operational components,  looking at installing traffic signals there at 8th and 9th  where you'd make those 90-degree turning movements,  as well as carrying the ADA.  So we're looking at that and we're looking at the improvements through the corridor.  As it relates to the city components of it, we actually right now have a survey out.  We're doing a local road safety plan.  And so we're analyzing and looking across the board of local road safety concerns,  and ultimately that will generate a report identifying high-priority areas  that have higher collision rates based on certain variables and components.  And we'll detail that in a report that ultimately will be utilized in the future  to address that.  So we're looking at that.  to prioritize grant applications,  specifically through the Highway Safety Improvement Grant Program  that Caltrans administers.  So that's out right now, and we're getting that input  through the survey from the community  and working with different stakeholders like the school district,  especially as it relates to Safe Routes to Schools.  So that is something we are currently and actively working on.  Any questions?  So is there any action to be taken?  That should have already been brought here.  So we will move on.  Okay.  Could we have a few more minutes break?  I know we're almost through with the agenda.  Yeah, I was going to ask that.  So let's take a 10-minute break.  Or less, yes. Thank you.  Five or 10-minute break.  I think I will make some some some some some some some  Are we ready?  Call our meeting back to order.  Item 5.5 is Council Member Ori's request, a special timing period.  Mr. Ori.  We don't have a city attorney here.  Oh, he's in the other room.  The city attorney is present.  I shall say from...  This is a direct result of the housing committee work.  In my mind, we were able to determine pretty accurately, I think,  and it's been...  It's been worn out with our construction numbers  that we have a healthy pipeline of existing infill development.  You know, it's in the order of 6,000 units.  You know, it's somewhere in the order of 500, 600 units a year.  And it's a pace that seems...  would be difficult to exceed,  especially given the...  the rebuilding of Paradise and other large public works activities,  construction activities going on that our own builders will participate and compete with.  And so then it becomes a couple questions.  We have already built out to our general plan,  or close to our general plan considerations,  and we certainly have a housing affordability issue that we need to grapple with.  And so the proposal in front of us is to...  I think it's embedded already in the general plan,  the notion that we don't move to special planning areas  further out of the city center  until demand has brought us to that point.  And that we now need to take the time to re-look at  where our growth opportunities are.  It's been encouraging to see the ADUs and the infill.  And, you know, for just one great example,  because so much of our housing is being built there,  the planning policies that were put in place for Marion Park  and the additional number of units that will now come to be built  out along Bruce Road, that we pause and make it clear as city policy  that until we have a plan, we're going to have to move to a new building.  So I think some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some  Any other comments for Council Member Ulrich?  So my motion would be that we don't consider,  we don't move forward with special planning areas  until completion and acceptance of the housing element  and until such time as the general plan is in compliance.  We will take a couple of comments.  I just thought to see if anybody has any comments right now.  City Clerk, I know we got several comments on this item.  We did.  So via Engage Chico, we received five comments  and those were from Jessica Giannola, Maggie Scarpa,  Kim Dietz, Bill Broward, Angela McLaughlin.  And then Dami, did we?  No comments came in the public comments.  Okay, we received a number of emails to-  Right, and through the regular mail.  And so I'll include those names as well in the minutes  from those comments.  So any further discussion?  Okay.  Have a roll call vote, please.  Who was the second?  Okay.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Orry?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries six zero with one absence.  We have no items.  Okay.  Any other comments added after the posting of the agenda?  Reports and communication.  The following reports and communication items were provided  for the council's information.  No action can be taken on these items unless the council agrees  to include it on a subsequent agenda.  City Manager's report.  Sure.  Just a couple of items for the city council.  As we all know, we're back in purple.  Unfortunately, we took a jump from orange to purple.  And it's my hope that the due diligence of this community,  as already proven previously, will come to fruition once again.  And that everybody just remain vigilant through these times,  do what they can to help commit to getting us through that.  City staff will once again continue to operationalize with  essential services.  And so you'll see some modifications internally to the  city.  However, the city services will remain dedicated and committed  to serving the public, regardless of the modifications  internally.  But I just want to ask the public to remain vigilant.  And we're going to continue to press as hard as we can to make  sure that we're doing as well as we can with that messaging so  that the community understands how important that is for our  community's safe and health.  I also wanted just to make note of the fact and congratulate  President Hutchinson.  It looks like the master plan was approved unanimously by the  Cal State Board of Trustees today.  And so I want to congratulate her and Chico State for getting  their new master plan approved today.  With that, that's all I have to report.  Thank you.  I have a question on any  progress that's been made on sheltering or camping.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's an ongoing conversation every day, literally.  And so our homeless solutions coordinator, Calkins, and I have  been dialoguing via email even during this meeting.  And there is continuing evaluation and research on a  number of buildings.  Unfortunately, as we continue to go through and we find another  building that looks fantastic.  And I see them in emails all the time from the public, as I know  council does as well.  It's usually a building we've already evaluated.  And what we're finding is that a number of issues are occurring as  it relates to sprinkling of the building being one of the primary  items and the size of the building.  One of the biggest issues that we continue to labor over is  ensuring that it's a consolidated effort of use of that space,  whatever that space might happen to be, and that we have adequate  service provision for that location.  And so.  I know that that effort is underway.  There was another building visited today, this morning.  There will be another building visited tomorrow morning.  And so those iterations of looking at facilities to  accommodate particularly a warming center will continue day  in and day out until we find something.  We are at the precipice of even looking at appealing to the  community through a release of some kind that may come to  fruition by tomorrow even, if not by the end of the week, just  asking for and pleading for help to see if there is a location  that might be able to facilitate such a use.  So just know that is vigilantly being looked at.  And as difficult as it is to realize that nothing has come to  fruition yet, it by no means is due to a lack of effort on the  city's end.  We are wholeheartedly being assured that our community  partners are helping us look for that.  That's their area of expertise and what they understand in that  service provision.  In addition to that, the county is working hand in hand with us  in that effort as well.  So for whatever that's worth, I thought I'd share that.  So thanks for the question.  6.2 is sun shining and negotiation proposals,  CPOA information only.  6.3, council member requests pursuant to AP and P 1010,  council members may verbally request an item to be agendized  at a future meeting after stating what the item would be.  A majority vote of council is needed in order for staff  to agendize.  Council members may also submit requests in writing.  We have none in writing.  Any verbal requests?  Yeah, thank you.  Along the lines of the conversation that you were just  having with the city manager, I'd like to at the next meeting,  I'd like to agendize a staff report and discussion of what our  options are for a cold weather shelter.  I understand that there's a lot going on, that it's being worked  on.  But I think the council should be apprised in public of what  those options are and be able to make a decision in that regards.  You know, last year, last year we had the Jesus Center that we  were able to fall back on.  The year before that, we had tents.  And not doing anything is not an option to my way of thinking.  So I think we have to have that discussion.  And I would love your support on that.  So we have a motion.  So we have a motion.  From Council Member Huber.  Second.  Now we have a second.  Any discussion?  Have a vote, please.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Orry.  Aye.  Council Member Stone.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Aye.  Mayor Schwab.  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absent.  OK.  So we will adjourn to closed session.  Is there any Council Member disqualification on any item?  No?  OK.
