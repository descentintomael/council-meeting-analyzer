Anyone wishing to address the council on any matter list on the agenda should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the chamber. Once completed, please provide the card to the city clerk, to my left, to your right. Speakers are taken in the order received, and once the first speaker is called, no additional cards will be accepted. Thank you for the folks in the back of the room who have signs for being against the wall. We appreciate that. That's where the signs go, not out in the audience, so we don't block anybody's view. And again, just a reminder, we encourage you not to clap or boo or hiss or cheer anyone speaking, so no one feels intimidated and everyone feels like they have a welcome opinion that can be expressed here. So, moving on to item 1.6 is our closed session announcement, which we did a little earlier this evening. Mr. Winslow-Ewing. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. The city council met with the city attorney, city manager, and staff in closed session on the posted agenda items. A direction was given. No action was taken. That concludes my closed session report. All right. Thank you very much. And we will start with the consent agenda. All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and can thereby be enacted in one motion. Are there any council member disqualifications or no votes? All right. Seeing none. Any speakers? No. All right. Entertain motion. Move to approve. Second. Motion. Vice Mayor Rounds.

Okay. Let's do. What did we say? 15 is. Yeah. Three, right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And if I can, I'll call the first two speakers up. And Nicole Nava is our first one, followed by Stella Held. And if Stella could go ahead and go into the middle aisle, that would be great. Good evening. I wanted to speak here on a couple of things. One, I want to support a speaker I believe will be coming soon that is representative of a property that is across from the alternative resting site. And I want to underscore what you heard him say at the prior meeting, which was that there are a lot of negative impacts being experienced by neighbors and the professional retail places and schools that are nearby. And so there is a lack of appropriate comportment. I guess we'll put it that way at the very least. This is resulting in things like attempted car theft, ripping out of sprinkler lines, electricity, harassing of employees, some of whom are high school students. If you didn't catch that any prior time and a lot of other activities that have impacted the businesses. This is there negatively, causing even a couple to give notice, is my understanding, where they won't be re-upping their lease specifically because of that site. It was not other reasons given. They made a point of saying specifically because of that. In addition, a care home where my great aunt used to stay across the street had one of those individuals break in and the person was in one of the residents' room, which is the bedroom if anybody has not been to that facility. So it's a lot of things. It's very distressing. I feel like some attention needs to be paid to adhering to what folks were told at the outset, which was that there would be a certain number of people, that those people would be people who had been evaluated and deemed ineligible for one of the two shelters or was offered a space at one of the two shelters and subsequently refused. Other people staying there were not cleared to be there. I feel like maybe attention needs to be brought. That's where we need to be talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the judge and talking to the and be on the path to wellness, which I think everyone hopefully can agree getting on a path to wellness is the way to go. That brings me to another thing is that looks like there's people here tonight for a certain topic. I just would like to say that when you consider whether or not to discuss a certain topic that might or might be discussed tonight, that you keep in mind that providing certain type of relief is appropriately done at service providers, at churches, and at maybe not in the residential areas. Thank you. Okay, Stella Held, followed by Molly Mormon Hogan. We are here representing the property owners of the Heritage Oaks subdivision, which backs up to the Tysher Ponds. We are asking that the homeless encampment at the ponds be the top priority as the next area to be cleared out. For four years now, we are and continue to experience the same issues recently observed at the Eden and Cohasset site. The one difference is the encampment at the ponds is not in full view for the public to see. The illegal suspicious activity from the encampment has greatly increased and jeopardized the safety of our residents and children. Therefore, we strongly urge all parties involved to make the clearing of the encampment a priority. Thank you. Molly Mormon Hogan, followed by rich Ell. Hello, I'm Molly Mormon. I've been a part of the Heritage Oaks neighborhood for 17 years. I've been there since the beginning. I've watched it deteriorate in quality and become an extremely unsafe neighborhood for our children. We very strongly as a neighborhood feel like you've neglected us and the pond as well the entire time it's basically been there. We feel like you're making us saying we're a priority but when we finally got to the ponds being cleaned it got halted. Which is a whole separate section I think. At this point I feel like it's pretty clear we're not a priority based on how we're being prioritized. Switching up the sites became a problematic decision for both sites because they go back and forth. When Comanche Creek got cleared out they came to our neighborhood dropped off trailers of people and drugs. When Tiger Ponds got cleared out they went to East Avenue and that blew up. So now we're concerned that they're coming back because they are. I've read the settlement notice, I've read the legal notice, I've gone over everything and all the stipulations. It's extremely exhausting and frustrating so I can see. Now where we're at. Where we're at with our neighborhood being affected by this immediately after we partially got cleaned up and then it got halted for the other site. We have a very high volume of illegal drug dealing, drug using and in the open and dangerous and intoxicated drivers in our neighborhood. Under all sorts of intoxicating things. We have drug dealing, these people in our neighborhood they're established drug dealing corners. We have some housing. We have houses that are 15 to 20 feet from daily drug deals. And then they come back. The other day a lady came out stumbling. Couldn't find her whatever she needed. She was bleeding everywhere. Needles went everywhere while me and my kids stared. By the time I got them in the house and we called the police they're gone again to the ponds. This happens about every 10 or so minutes when we're out there with our kids where we see somebody come through. Yesterday my neighbor and I decided that it was on the house. It's not safe for us to leave our kids out there. Because in another 10 minutes an intoxicated driver came down the street again. So it's scary that I can't let my kids out on the R lawn by themselves anymore. He did get arrested with before he passed out at the wheel. He had several warrants for driving under the influence excessive alcohol and prior convictions. We've had people drive buses in our neighborhood until they crashed. In a house. Not a kid. So we don't really feel like we're being our neighborhood is very safe. I'm not understanding why we can't be protected by the police and as well as have the anti camping enclosure enforcement. I would like to see the chief of police make our children and our neighborhood a priority. We are in a state of emergency. We are in a state of emergency. We appreciate you all being here. But if we could have you sit for just so the folks behind you can see. But we understand the numbers that are here. So thank you. Hi. Good evening. My name is Richard. My home backs up to Tiger Ponds at the entrance on Creek Hollow which is the main thoroughfare for all of the drug dealers. And my concern is that my children don't even feel safe playing in their own backyard. Since you've cleaned out the west. My backyard has become the drug spot. The designated drug spot where they shoot up daily. Multiple times a day. Directly behind my house. My wife and I went down there last Saturday all suited up. Carrying Narcan. Cleaned it all up. And the next day it's all back again. So I'm not going to go back down there and clean it up. But this is going on directly behind my home. We're subject to for the last two years. We've been in the area for a long time. Just constant, constant. That quiet little street Creek Hollow used to be where kids could play and people could hang out. And now it's a constant. It's a little drug nest back there is what I call it. But, you know, we have to needle sweep our property before we could even let our kids play out. And we have to pick up needles. Since you cleaned out the west side, the traffic is ten times worse from a drug standpoint. I just called in a guy last night. They were smoking meth right outside my kitchen window. One of those passengers of that vehicle was taken in on felony warrants. That's a daily occurrence. And great support from Chico PD. But we all know they're understaffed and overworked. And there's no they can't make it out for every call. And, I mean, we call a lot. There's a lot of activity at the end of that block. And it's gotten worse, like I said, since we the last two weeks. It's almost daily, if not two times a day. I'm calling the police for some incident. Somebody's shooting up. Drugs going on right outside my kitchen window. So from a safety standpoint, it's just a little unsettling that we went to Eaton Road, a Cohassiter. We're trying to go there before clearing out the other side and just locking down the pond and being done. It's two years of explosions, stabbings, shootings. Being woken up this past weekend to domestic fight right outside my front door. Or backyard, I'm sorry. Right outside the backyard at 3.30 in the morning. Followed that same day at 10 o'clock at night. New campers moving in carrying shotgun down to the camp. I mean, you don't exactly feel safe when people are taking weapons, which I'm sure they want to protect themselves. But that's a drug dealer going down with weapons to the ponds. And now we have campers 30 feet from our homes. So I thank you for your time. I just want to express my concern about not cleaning out the second side of the pond. Thank you for your time. Thank you. I'm Shea Yes, followed by Chris Vogelman. Hello, City Council members. I promise this wasn't the last meeting I was going to be at. I'm here again. I appreciate it. I appreciate you guys listening. I just want to reiterate, again, I represent the owners of the business center. We're having a lot of issues with that homeless alternate site. We're still having a lot of harassment issues. We're still having a lot of complaints from our tenants. So our public restaurants are taking the brunt of that force. their family oriented restaurants they are having people come in to use the public facilities of restrooms they are using those restrooms to bathe in they ultimately make a mess and damage and destroy the bathrooms and that responsibility falls upon those business owners who are taxpaying business owners of Chico and local family local families of Chico themselves one of them reached out to us and let us know that they had a situation where there was a person passed out in front of their doorway of the restaurant with a needle sticking out of his arm and they had the same exact issue the next day this is a family oriented restaurant where kids and families come it's a massive safety hazard and you know it's a huge risk and it's a huge risk and it's a huge risk and it's a it's a derailment of business and potential customers to say the least we're still having issues with graffiti and vandalism La Dolce Piazza has a pretty nice greenery we have a lot of palm trees and shrubbery it's very pleasing to the eye there is one spot that we found that was burned so we had a shrub bush that was burned and never had that happen since we've been there so we can only assume that it's in correlation with these acts of graffiti and vandalism garbage everywhere ruining of infrastructure so again like I said we're just having a hard time we're just reaching out to the city letting them know we'd appreciate it if this could get resolved in some manner I understand that there are other things in play but this was I will be emailed to the city office tomorrow and they are all kind of I understand that there are other things in play but this was I will be emailing to the city office tomorrow and they are all kind of I'm just signaling you guys, I ran a request to put this as an item to agendize this item in the next council meeting. So I hope that the city council's members will receive that, and then hopefully we can talk about it as an agenda meeting for the next meeting or the meeting after. And like I said, it seems like I'm not the only one having this issue. There's a lot of residents in other parts of the city as well, so it just seems like this is a citywide issue. But I appreciate you guys' time. Thank you for listening. Thank you. Chris Vogelman, followed by Sierra Sandoval. Good evening. My name is Chris Vogelman. I've been a resident of Chico since 1965 when my parents moved here from Sacramento to escape the crime that is in that city. For the last five years, I've been a resident of Heritage Oaks. Absolutely fell in love with the neighborhood and the people. I thank my neighbors, my fellow neighbors, for being out here tonight. Showed support for our neighborhood. It's the type of neighborhood that has Easter egg hunts for the entire, for all the kids in the entire neighborhood. We have one of the hugest Halloween turnouts anywhere in this city where we host thousands of people come through our neighborhood. And for the last two to three years, we have been inundated by the transients in the ponds, which have taken that one, taken that area. And so, you know, it's a very, very important area for us. It's an area that I used to love to walk my dog in, go down there, see the beaver swim in the dawn. And now I can't even go down there. It's just unsafe. And it's unruly. And it's, frankly, disgusting. I want to thank council and our city officials for clearing out the west side of the ponds. But it's very important. And I'm going to get to the other, to the east side of the ponds. Because as some of my neighbors have mentioned, the traffic has actually gotten worse. Tom was so kind to come to our neighborhood on Saturday and have a discussion out front. And in the time we were there, two of our regulars drove up to the ponds and were making their deliveries. Like I said, it's a daily occurrence, sometimes an hourly occurrence. I'm a pretty carefree guy. And lately, everything in my house is locked up. My gates, the propane tanks on my trailer, my water spigot. I mean, I just have to, I can't leave my garage open for 30 seconds. If I'm going inside, I've got to close my garage before I come back out. Because I know some yahoo is going to come down the street and steal whatever is easily accessible. It's just nonstop. And I just can't stress the importance of clearing out that eastern. Quadrant of tiger ponds as soon as possible. And I'd even like to ask Chief Aldridge if there's any way. I know you guys can't respond to every call instantly. But if you can make it a regular routine for someone to just cruise through there and make a presence known. It's just walking over from the from the department, walking through the trail and walking back. Or send just sending someone maybe at the end of their shift or something. But there just needs to be a presence because they don't care. It's just all of us down there right now. And we really need your help. And I think very much for your time. Thank you. Sierra Sandoval, followed by Ciceri Sherry. Hi. I grew up in Butte County. I was born in the town of Paradise, the town that was destroyed by the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. And most expensive national disaster. And the most expensive national disaster in the history of California history. And the most expensive national disaster in the world in 2018 in terms of uninsured losses. The fire started on a Thursday in 2018. What people don't talk about is where everybody went after the fire. If they couldn't stay with friends and families, they stayed in Walmart's parking lot. This was the start. This is the home. We are Butte strong. All of us. I love Butte County. I think of all of Chico was affected by the loss of the entire community. I see that things need to change in our town. It needs to heal. It needs to remember community. Our town has amazing resources. While we were here healing the fires from the pandemic, everybody is sick, dying. People became scared of each other. I see people struggling to eat because people that used to eat together are now unable to eat together. They're scared. A community fridge brings the community back together. I think that people look. I look at people and they say, you're homeless. I don't want you in my establishment. We don't look at people at the community fridge if they're homeless or if they're rich. I don't ask people where they come from or what kind of income they have. They can freely use that fridge. I have a bulletin board where people can put resources up for people. I think that the guide to people getting straight is feeding them. They say the quickest way to your heart is your stomach. If you give them resources on something and guide them in the right direction, I think they'll go there. I'd like to see community fridges all over where people can eat and find resources to things like where they can shower and get a job. I just really believe that it takes a community and community effort into making these changes. It's not all on. You guys? So that's all I got. Thank you. Thank you. Ciceri Sherry followed by Jessica Giannullo. And again, if we could just have folks line up if you're called next. If you could just stand in the aisle. I'm so sorry about that. I spaced out. No problem. I've been working all day. I'm sorry I'm not all here. I'm sorry. I'm here to talk about the community fridge. I've heard some concern about the neighborhood around there, unsurprisingly. But I'd like to let you all know that I am the closest homeowner to the community fridge. It is so close to my house, in fact, that if I look out my back window, it's right there. Okay? It's not a bother to anyone. There is no noise. There is no traffic. In fact, it's cleaner. The alleyway that it's in is actually cleaner now that the fridge is there because people who walk by pick up. And not just the people running the fridge, but people who take from the fridge pick up as they go and put it in the trash that's provided. I've lived in that neighborhood. I haven't been a homeowner in that neighborhood for the whole time, but I have lived in that neighborhood for seven years now, almost eight years now. And there did used to be a trash problem in the alley there as well as a dog poop problem. I'm certainly, please don't get the impression I'm blaming the homeless for that. It's certainly a lot of dog owners in the neighborhood and I'm sure they can't all be homeless. But the fact that the place has been kept up better now that the community fridge is there is a testament to the quality that that adds to the neighborhood. So I'd like to support Council Member Winslow's request to agendize waiving the use permit fee as well as approving the permit to keep the fridge open. Thank you very much. And again, sorry I wasn't waiting. My bad. Thank you. Jessica Giannola followed by Tommy Alexander. Hi, Council. Again, I'll start with requesting that we extend... I'll extend our access from the community to the chambers here by way of phone calls, Zoom, whatever it might be, so people out there can join us and hear that connection piece is important. Along with connecting in the community, I would hope that some of you would have an opportunity, maybe even all of you, to potentially even volunteer at, say, Safe Space. That's an idea. And I can tell you why. I volunteered with Safe Space, actually interned there with Chico State. And the very, very first night that I did, I was actually pretty scared. I was terrified of what could happen to me because of all of the things I heard online and in the community about how scary the individuals were. And I know I've shared this story before, but it's really important. It took me putting myself in a situation I was uncomfortable with to talk with a population that we're terrified of just to see them as people and heard their stories of how they got there and what they needed to get out of that situation. And as city leaders, I would see that that is something really important that you do. You take the opportunity and you partner with our programs and you speak one-on-one with the people in our community because your decisions are what impact their life. The decisions you make either bring a bridge to them or it keeps them in the space that they are at. And that's, again, that community connection piece. So I hope that I know that our past council members have. Some have. I know that one took the opportunity to even stay the night just to see, like, be in someone's shoes. What is it like to lay on the ground? That's your only chance. Your only opportunity. And I've seen him become a stronger advocate for services that we needed in our city that would eventually, hopefully, the hope was that we could see improvement in our city. But he didn't get that chance. That's something that was for us pretty bad for changing his stance and making it vocal. Hey, we need to help these people. And I think that if he did that as a majority, you're less likely. You're less likely to get that pushback, that hatred, that narrative shift is what needs to take place. And you can do it as a team. Let's see. What else did I want to say on that? If we don't have the fridge on the agenda, that is something that is super important. It's nutrition. It's food. No one's making money off of it. It's simply providing access to something, food, that people don't have access to. Even my daughter, who's a college student, she's asking me where she can get food. Because it's hard. It's hard right now. It's really hard to find where there's food, vegetables, anything. And to make things that much harder for someone to access it, especially from caring volunteers in the community, we can do our part. We can do what we can do to make things more accessible. Thank you. Thank you. Tommy Alexander followed by Laurie Monroe. How y'all doing? Tommy Alexander. Heritage Oaks. I'm danger close. I'm first. I'm first and foremost. When you walk into, walk in and out of, I'm the house you see. So what do my kids see coming and going to school every morning? A tent. Or homeless coming and going. Bicycle stolen. Trash everywhere. Needles. I blow my yard. Proud owner. Blow my yard two, three times a week. Neighbors will vouch for me. I blow syringes. Do something. Tom, appreciate you. Seeing you. Appreciate you. Come to my house. Bring your kids. They won't want to stay. That's all I got to say. Thank you. Laurie Monroe followed by Bryce Goldstein. And if you could go ahead and line up in the middle. My name's Laurie Monroe. I'd like to just say that I'm in favor of the community fridge. I think that it's good that services can be provided to people in a lot of different ways. And I have a question for the council that maybe could direct back. To staff. Which is why did this come about this way? Rather than the staff person looking at the situation and saying. It's not reasonable to ask a volunteer person who is providing food in the community. To come up with $1,600 to continue the service. And maybe ask the council. Staff could have asked the council to help come up with a solution. So that we wouldn't be here tonight. Thank you. Bryce. Bryce Goldstein followed by Kimberly Michael. Hi. My name is Bryce Goldstein. And like some other good folks here. I'm here to speak in support of council member Winslow's request. To agendize. Waiving permit fees. And taking a closer look at. Supporting mutual aid projects in our city. And of course that's spurred by the need to support the community fridge. I live about four blocks away from the community fridge. Pretty close to Park Avenue. We used to have the Jesus Center a couple blocks from my house. And people who were food insecure for years. Could go there for a hot meal. We don't have that anymore. We don't have any affordable grocery stores in my corridor. Along Park Ave. By the barber neighborhood in Chapman Town. So there's a lot of low-income and food insecure folks in my neighborhood. And with inflation rising the cost of basic necessities for food. It's been really hard. For a lot of my neighbors. And the community fridge has been a great resource for people. So I want to see us do anything we can to support our community. And that includes approving their administrative use permit. But also again looking at whether or not a use permit is necessary. For a small volunteer run project like the fridge. I'm not convinced that we need to have people do a whole site plan for something like that. And I'll add. That I've been a planning commissioner for four years. And it's really made me realize that we need to remove bureaucracy. From a lot of our processes in this city. If we can do it. So I hope that you will consider agendizing this. And we can talk about it more next meeting. Thank you. Thank you. Kimberly Michael followed by Chelsea Baron. Good evening council. My name is Kimberly Michael. And I'm here in support of the community fridge. It's come to my attention that there was a $1,700 permit for the fridge. Which seems kind of ridiculous. I think we're all in agreement here. That people in Butte County and in Chico are struggling to eat. Find shelter. These kinds of things. The whole first half of business from the floor was people talking about homeless issues. Part of the reason people are homeless is because of systemic barriers. That prevent them from finding housing. Or prevent them from picking themselves up by their bootstraps. So I think people who are in leadership positions like y'all. It's responsibility to make that process easier for people. So I would ask you to please consider using your power to relax bureaucratic interventions and constraints on small mutual aid projects. People are just trying to feed each other. We deserve to share food with people in the places that we live. In residential areas. You know it was brought up that you can go to a church or something like this. But residential areas are often food deserts. They're places that don't have grocery stores. That people don't have access to. And accessibility varies. Some people, you know, college students, kids. People who have different physical limitations. They deserve access to food too. And people who have that. And have the ability to share the surplus that they have. Deserve the right to share that as well. So again, please consider using your power to relax these bureaucratic constraints on mutual aid. Thank you. Thank you. Chelsea Barron followed by M. Einspar. Hello Council. In Chico, a community fridge is an act of love between the person who uses the fridge and their community. The community fridge should be granted regulatory, and the community should be able to use it for their own benefit. And I'm here today to give you a little bit of relief for this small mutual aid project. I volunteer at the South Chico Community Assistance Center every two weeks. What the community fridge does every week. It feeds people who are trying to just make ends meet. And people who want to be here in Chico need that. We help address food security at the center throughout the month. By helping them have a little bit of dignity. We set up a pantry where it is kind of the same. People don't have to prove, much like the fridge, that they are poor. That they need food. And that they would like to be there. The community fridge does the same thing. It's just that we have a giant building. It's small, but it's full of heart. We don't have the same request. A $1700, $1700 for one person to come up with. For a community fridge. It seems outrageous. The community fridge accomplishes missions we strive to do bimonthly each day. I want to reiterate to the city council that they should take up this business from the floor. And we strongly encourage as part of the South Chico Community Assistance Center. That you grant regulatory relief for this small mutual aid project. And other projects like this in the community. I think you should also possibly talk about bringing them up more. Now I have to go back to doing mutual aid. Thank you. Ms. Einspar is our last speaker. So, I'm here to speak in support of the community fridge. Food is for everyone. Food should be accessible. It should be provided in neighborhoods without having to pay a $1700 fee. The complication of our bureaucracy has made it impossible for us to provide food. We should be able to feed ourselves. We should be able to feed our people freely without restrictions and roadblocks. The people deserve to be fed. And we have potential here to provide communal relief for our neighbors. So, let's take it. It's not that complicated. We just have to keep it simple. I urge the council to provide regulatory relief for mutual aid projects such as this. In addition to this, I'd like to speak briefly on the public library concern. Personally, this is upsetting to hear that the public libraries are being If you're going to speak on libraries, you have to do it under that subject. Okay. Thank you. That was it. All right. Thank you, everyone. All right. We will move on to item 4.1, public hearing. Hearing ordering the abandonment and vacation of portions of Bruce Avenue and La Vie Sait Way public right of way. And I believe we have a report from the director of public works, engineer. Okay. Thank you. Good evening, Chair and Chair and council members. Can you hear me okay? Good evening, Chair and Chair and council members. Can you hear me okay? Good evening, Chair and Chair and council members. Good evening, Chair and Chair and council members. Good evening, Chair and Chair and council members. Good evening, Chair and Chair and council members. Can you hear me okay? Good evening, Chair and Chair and council members. Roberts and Erickson petitioned the City on behalf of the trustees of Chico State University to abandon and vacate a portion of Bryce Avenue and La Vista Way, which is in the public right away currently. And the abandonment section would be from Warner Street West to the dead end, that is within the Chico State campus. And the reason for those abandonments is future development plans at Chico State University. And the four utility companies that were contacted had no objections to the abandonments, and I recommend adopting the resolution. All right, questions? Thank you. Any speakers on this item? Oh, here, open the public hearing. Any speakers on this item? We don't have any speakers. All right. We'll close the public hearing. We'll look at . Move to approve. Second. Move to approve. Second.

Item 5, 5.1 Commission interviews for Arts Commission, Bidwell Park and Clay Run-On Commission and Planning Commission. And we will hand it over at this point to our very capable city clerk, Deputy Mayor DeWitt. Thank you, Mayor and Council. At your last meeting, you were provided with a complete overview of your six advisory bodies. And while you gave additional direction and asked for some additional research on a couple of items, you did ask for the Arts Commission, the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, as well as the Planning Commission applicants to go ahead and be scheduled to come and meet with the Council. So these interviews are really, they're an opportunity for each applicant to address the Council about their qualifications and or their desire to serve. The Council has been provided with all of their phone numbers and email addresses should you wish to have further comments or follow-up questions for them. I will let you know that as I call them up, there may be some who will not be here and some were vacationing or unable to attend. And so it has always been the past practice of the Council that attendance at these meetings are not required for consideration for appointment. So what I'd like to do is we'll take Arts Commission first. Before we start, I will let you know that we have a couple of applicants who have asked or applied to be on more than one. If they aren't selected for one, they're willing to serve on another. And so you will notice that I'll call a couple of them up for a second in opportunity to address you about that particular board. So for the... Arts Commission, I'd like to... And then if you're in the audience, if you could please go ahead and come to the podium. Gina Bax. And this is for the Arts Commission. And you can just speak into the podium. Thank you. All right. Well, good evening. Thank you for the opportunity to be here tonight. My name is Gina Bax and I'm originally from Colombia. I've been married for... I've been married for almost 18 years and I have five daughters. I have a degree in international relations with a minor in French. I moved to the States in 1998 and became a citizen in 2003. My children have been involved in classical music with the Chico Youth Orchestra for almost 11 years. I'm bilingual and have advocate for children in Chico and Durham, tutoring them in their second language. I've been a dance instructor for many years and my love for the arts encompasses all parts of my life. It would be my honor to offer my multicultural knowledge, experience and skills to promote diversity in our community. Thank you. Thank you. Vianna Boring. Hello, my name is Vianna Boring-Renaud and I'm here, hopefully, well, I'm putting myself forward for the Arts Commission and that's due to a variety of reasons. I am a Chico local, very much connected to Chico State as well. I graduated in music in 2001. Took the time to leave the country, as I think we all try to find our feet after graduating, so found myself in the UK, Germany, France and Switzerland. I've recently returned back to the area to support my father, who is still in the area. And I have, I've continued teaching piano in Chico and also in the UK, as well as being involved in other organizations in London, in Belfast, with cross-community social work and also in Bournemouth along the southern coast of England. So basically, I've had a lot of fun abroad, but how that brings to what I can bring to the table here, is that I'm a student of the Chico Youth Orchestra. And I think one of the things that I think is really wonderful about the orchestra is how towns throughout Europe and throughout England have regenerized and refocused the impact of their city centers, very similar to Chico. It's common around, from what I've seen, that we need to find a way to keep the arts inside the downtown area. We need to regenerate and work with our key stakeholders in terms of bringing money and bringing the communities, the most important part, here is the communities back to the city centers to show them and to give them provide a sense of emotional physical well-being for them so they have a sense of community they have a sense of civic pride they have a sense of being proud to come from chico there's so many people here in this town who are very proud third fourth fifth generation citizens here and it's about what can we do we've obviously seen the impact of the pandemic we've seen the impact of the economic crisis in 2008 we've seen these things outside our control impact what has taken place in downtown Chico so I think it would be very important for those in the Arts Commission to look on how can we bring the arts back how can we get things done how can we have small wins and how can we make sure that everyone is on board with seeing Chico and the community and the community as a whole so I think it would be very important for us to have the best downtown slash arts program that we can possibly have thank you thank you Jeffrey Fox okay Mary Gardner good evening mayor Coolidge and council members my name is Mary Gardner and I have served on the Arts Commission for the last four years and would be honored to serve another term I've worked in the arts either as a volunteer or professionally in Chico for over 40 years as we saw at the last council meeting during the arts funding presentation though we are in lean times Chico is still a place where creativity is alive and well during that meeting there was also a discussion regarding improvement to downtown it is clear that arts and culture will be a vital partner and I look forward to the Arts Commission contributing to that these discussions I want to add that it is wonderful to see the range of applicants to the Arts Commission this year it tells me that the community values what we do and I'm excited to see what this new commission does in the future I will close with a quote from local poet Sarah Pape art is not a luxury it is a necessary element of human life thank you for your time thank you Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy Shirley McCoy is you give a lot of opportunity to artists here in town that might not get that opportunity to have more exposure and have their music put out there and their art mediums and all that kind of stuff. And I'm currently working in the office, as well as I just recently started DJing. I'm working with Studio 416. That brings in local musicians and artists to showcase and talk about their art, their music. And I think Chico really has a very unique and diverse, rich arts community. When I'm not in the office or on the air, you could find me at a lot of local shows. And I think it really brings, you know, arts is a way to bring people together. And I'd really love to be involved, have the opportunity, to stay involved, be involved in keeping that rich, diverse arts epicenter here in Chico. Thank you. Bonnie Pipkin, followed by Katie Posey. Good evening, members of the City Council and all in attendance tonight. My name is Bonnie Pipkin, and I am a local author and freelance writer with a big background in the arts. I'm also a member of the City Council Arts Education and Arts Administration. I want to thank you for your consideration to serve on the Arts Commission. As someone with a master's degree in nonprofit arts management from NYU and nearly a decade of experience as a fundraiser for the New York International Fringe Festival, the largest multi arts festival in North America, I believe I'm uniquely qualified to serve in this role. In 2008, I helped write the grant proposal that secured the festival's first ever city funding. I was a member of the festival's first ever and from the Department of Cultural Affairs in New York City, and had a hand in all the government grant writing that followed. This experience taught me how to work effectively with government agencies, build strong partnerships, and create successful programs that benefit the community. Eventually I served on the board of directors for the organization as well. As a member of the selection panel for the festival, I had the opportunity to review thousands of applications, which gave me a broad understanding of the different aspects of the festival. I also had the opportunity to learn about the diverse artistic talent that exists within our communities, and the need to uplift and support voices from all backgrounds. I started an arts education program in Brooklyn where we would write and produce plays with teens in underserved communities. And this experience solidified in me the importance of providing access to the arts for all members of our community, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. As a published author in the young adult genre, and a former professor of literature at Kean University, I understand the importance of creating opportunities for artists and writers to share their work with the wider community. And as a former North State Voices columnist with the Enterprise Record, and now someone who regularly writes for local publications, I'm committed to contributing to the local dialogue and building a stronger sense of community in Chico. I've been back in my hometown for nearly four years now, after being in New York, obviously. I am the mother of two daughters under five, and doing my best as a writer, musician, and theater artist myself to contribute to the art scene. From big budget arts organizations and beautiful auditoriums, to scrappy performances in barns or backyards, I'm all about building community through artistic experience. Finally, I just want to express my deep love for Chico and my belief that a town thrives when the arts do. I look forward to the chance to contribute to the growth and development of the arts here at home. So I thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Katie Posey, followed by Rana Rickmers. Hi, everyone. It would be a privilege to be a part of this commission and to serve as an advocate for the arts in Chico. I'm also excited about the mission to work towards encouraging all citizens to actively participate in the artistic and cultural aspects of their lives. As mentioned in my application, the arts in Chico have brought impact to my life from a young age. And I was in Chico from middle school through my undergrad work, but after Chico stayed, I moved away. And my studies and teaching took me to a variety of places, including London, Sacramento, Philadelphia, rural Pennsylvania, Charlotte, North Carolina, Cape Cod, and Boston. And I think that those, living in those places would definitely affect, would help me to bring a helpful background as an arts commissioner, especially because being in those places provided me with an opportunity to see how the arts within communities do affect the quality of life, and also to think about how citizens within communities can participate in the arts, which is a powerful and important dimension. I also have a passion for culture. I forgot to mention in my application that I have been on an executive committee for about 11 years, the International Association for Children's Spirituality. It's made up of about, I think there's 10 of us on the executive committee. But we form different work groups for different things. Right now we're redesigning the website, which is a really big job. But by being on that, I've had to work with people from all over the world. To have different perspectives. People on the committee are from the UK, Asia, Australia, the US, Canada, South America. So our exec meetings actually happen often time at 6 a.m. my time. So it's really nice to see that the arts commission meets in the afternoon. So anyways, it would be wonderful to serve on this commission, and thank you for the opportunity to apply. Thank you. And I guess it's Rita Rickmar. Followed by Kim, and I'm not going to try to ruin the last name, so I'll just pull that name up. Hi, my name is Rita Rickmar. I retired in 2019 from teaching high school at Pleasant Valley High School. I taught art there for 27 years, and a total of 30 years of teaching art. I graduated from Chico State, and got my teaching degree in the University of Michigan. I have a teaching credential at Chico State, and I've been involved in the arts here in Chico since the 80s. I'm a working artist. I participate in Open Studios Art Tour. I'm a member of MUNCA, the Museum of Northern California Art. We're also volunteer. I'm also a member of the Chico Art Center, and I'm on their board of directors at the Chico Art Center. I'd love to be a liaison between those entities and the Chico Arts Commission. As a teacher, I felt it was very important to get my students out of the classroom and get them connected with the community. So we did many projects, including bringing students to this meeting so that the art students could talk about the importance of art in their lives, as well as touring public art and putting on different performances that involved. So I've also, as a teacher, I was involved in writing multiple grants that brought hundreds of thousands of dollars into the school district to support a program that I started there called the Art Studio at PV. So I would love to be part of this commission, and thank you. Thank you. So it's Kim for the Arts Commission. Sure. Sure. Kim, can you just sit here? Okay, Megan Turner. She's not in the audience, and she actually applied also for the Architectural Review, History, and Preservation Board. Kim and Megan are not here, correct? Kim and Megan were the only ones who aren't here. What's that? Oh, Jeff. Yes. and then I just wanted to say before anyone leaves as we move on to each of these and I know most of you are in the audience today and I think I think the council would agree with me is and we really appreciate you coming forward and putting your name in the hat for these various commissions that we have certainly this is a lot of these commissions get a lot of work done before things get to us and they certainly help our community if and in fact you are not selected it doesn't mean we don't like you or don't don't want you or or anything along those lines it just means that there is a lot of good folks in for these positions so please consider if you don't make it this time around reapplying for the future persistence is all powerful when it comes to this and we'd love to have you continue to apply for these positions so thank you sorry go ahead no thank you mayor coolidge and I'm glad you brought that up because for the arts commission we have four positions three of them are a four-year term and then we have one vacancy that the whole council will appoint and that is for a two-year term remaining on that so moving on to the bidwell park and playground commission it's seven member composition and we have three positions that we need to fill and so I will one individual has withdrawn and so the first speaker if if he's here is john blake clea and I'm not sure if I said that right latchley okay I didn't thank you good evening thank you for this opportunity I have dedicated the last 60 years of my life to natural resource and public land management I obtained a bachelor of science degree in natural resource management from cal poly san luis obispo while earning this degree I was employed by Sonoma county parks and I was also employed by the school of natural resources and I was also employed by the school of natural resources and I was also employed by the school of natural resources and the sonoma county flood control and later the California state park system upon graduation from college I was employed as a seasonal park ranger at Yosemite national park and assigned to the resource protection and visitor services division I performed wildland fire emergency medical search and rescue wildland or excuse me wildlife resources and law enforcement duties I received my permanent position with the national park service in marine county at golden gate national recreation area I later transferred to the US Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management in southern California as a ranger where I perform similar duties as I did with the National Park Service additionally I increased my wildland fire suppression duties as being assigned to a federal wildland fire incident management team during this time at the same time I accepted an adjunct faculty position at the local fire department and I was also employed by the school of natural resources and where I instructed where Instructor where Instructed lecture and lab classes in natural resources and Forestry where Instructed where Instructed lecture and lab classes in natural resources and Forestry where Instructed where Instructed lecture and lab classes in natural resources and Forestry where Instructed where Instructed lecture and lab classes in natural resources and Forestry where Instructed where Instructed where Instructed lecture and lab classes in natural resources and Forestry where Instructed where Instructed where Instructed lecture and lab classes in natural resources and Forestry where Instructed where Instructed lecture and lab classes in natural resources and Forestry where Instructed where Instructed where Instructed where Instructed lecture and lab classes in natural of 2007 as the Chief Area Ranger for Southern California and moved to Chico. Since retiring from my Ranger positions, I have flunked retirement on many occasions. I accepted associate faculty positions at Butte College where I developed and instructed again natural resource and online administration justice classes. I've also instructed at Chico State in their criminal justice. I've also instructed courses at Shasta College in forestry. Currently I'm employed with a private forestry company which manages timberlands in Tehama Butte and Plumas County. To conclude I have over 30 years experience working natural resource management with federal land management agencies, 36 years of teaching experience, and I have a degree in environmental science. I have a degree in natural resource and administration of justice at three community college classes in Chico State. During my time with the National Park Service they considered Yosemite, Lassen, and Sequoia National Park as crown jewels. I feel that Bidwell Park is a crown jewels to the citizens of the city of Chico. It would be a privilege for me to serve as a commissioner on the board. Thank you. Thank you. Tom Lando followed by Jenny Shear. We didn't have the timer. Pardon me? The timer? It comes up when I call the name. I think I was over on that last one. Sorry. A little bit. That's why it disappeared. So Tom Lando is not here. Nicole Nava and Nicole has applied for one additional board. Okay. Good evening, council, city manager, department heads and clerks, nice to see you all. That guy was really under qualified, I don't know. That was fantastic. I actually have been a resident of Chico since 76. I feel like I grew up in the parks. I do not have the educational bit related to park management or any of that. I do have some of my original have a four-year degree with honors and a two-year degree also with honors. I love the park. My kids, we made sure that they signed up for like volunteer things when they partnered with CARD to do things out there. I spent many formative years up in Upper Park at Camp Shodaka and other places that I'm sure a lot of the other people in this room have done as well. I'm highly invested in the park keeping polished as our jewel. It is a beautiful place. It's had some traumas that I am happy that we are bringing it back from. We have some aging infrastructure that I know comes before the group that I feel like I'm qualified to help have discussions about. I have attended city council and countless other types of governmental meetings, committee meetings, and other meetings. I'm very excited about the past year. I'm very excited about the meetings, et cetera. So I know, you know, the procedural piece to being at these meetings. I'm familiar with your Granicus tool and all the other things. I read all the reports, whether it's really something I'm really tied to or not, because to me, it is a privilege and to me, a responsibility to be someone who is engaged and paying attention to what's going on. I like to come to some of those meetings and support when I see things, for instance, came to a recent Bidwell Park and Playground Commission meeting where they were discussing some of the infrastructure and other things. As a participant, I submitted an idea for improving upon something I saw them bring before that commission and happily, they adopted that into a recommendation that came before you all, which was then adopted. And so I think it's important to understand that sometimes it's not jobless and jobless and jobless and jobless and jobless and jobless and jobless and jobless and just the experience, education, et cetera, that one has. I have quite a lot of that. But it's also the level of engagement, the understanding, the ability to hit the ground running, not being afraid of researching pretty heavy topics, or even what some may consider boring topics. I'm invested. I've read the bicycle plan and lots of other things that are kind of in the hopper and would love to be able to be a footprint in the process. And I very much appreciate your time and attention. Thank you. Thank you. Jenny Shear, followed by Frank Willis, Jr. Good evening. Thank you for your extensive time this evening with the interviews. I'm Jenny Shear. I'm a lifelong Butte County resident, born and raised in Richvale. And I grew up playing softball in the various parks through the Chico Stars. And my current interest in particular with the park is I have two small children, ages two and four. So it's the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. I love the park. I swim at Sycamore Pool. I love to run, bike. But my particular interest is the playgrounds at the moment. Not for any negative reasons, not a host of issues that I've encountered that I'd really like to address. But I just know, like everyone in this room knows, the importance of Bidwell Park and this community. And I'd love to be a part of that. I'd love to be a part of keeping it strong and thriving. A particular interest to me is the homeless issues in the park. Obviously that's been a critical issue for quite some time there. It's a major challenge that does infringe on the opportunities for other folks to enjoy the park. But it's one that obviously doesn't have a quick and easy solution. So I'd love to be part of the challenge there. And then the other is aquatic resources for residents of Chico. With a city of 100,000 people. With as many days over 100 degrees as we have. We need to have more access to cool down in water. Enjoy that recreational aspect. So that's something that I've just sort of decided will be something I continue to work on over the next 10, 20 years. We'll see. So that's not necessarily something that's directly related to the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. But I do take a larger interest in the recreation facilities in the city. The interaction between the city. And CARD. I'm interested in better understanding all of that. I know the commission has probably a somewhat limited scope. But as a commissioner, rather, I would be very conscientious in taking on the limited responsibilities. Thoroughly reading all of the board packets. Being prepared for meetings. And yeah, my background is that I'm a water consultant. I studied ag at Chico State. And then I studied natural resource economics. At UC Davis. So I'm a water economist. And I'm looking forward to continuing to be a resident of Chico for the next decades. I plan to raise my family here. And would like to be part of continuing Bidwell Park's glory days into the future. Thanks. Thank you. Frank Willis, Jr. Good evening. My name is Frank Willis, Jr. I'm a water economist. That's my official name. I go by Larry. I've been recreating in Bidwell Park since 1955. When my folks moved us up here from Los Angeles. I've swum and fished in the creek. I've hiked the trails. I raised three kids that are also recreating in the park. And even did summer session with my grandkids at the nature center. I've lived in Chico since then. Except for the time that I was in the service. And uh, law school. I came back to Chico. I practiced law here. I was a trial lawyer for 48 years. Four years ago I had some serious changes in my life. And I got very active in hands-on work in the park. I joined Michael Hicks and his Friday morning group. I was working with the friends of Comanche Creek and so forth. And the back cleanups. The Chico cleanups. Uh, into 2020 I thought I could do more. And there were some openings on the Park Commission. So I applied for one. And as a testament to the Mayor's comments about persistence. I didn't make the cut the first time. Later, this was in January of 21. Later that year in July, a vacancy came up. And the council was honoring me by appointing me. I've been very active since. I go to meetings. The only one I've missed, I think, was when I was two weeks post knee replacement. Otherwise, I'm there and not only do I go to meetings, I ask probably more questions than any other two commissioners combined. I also have been involved in a number of projects representing the Park Commission, working with Richie Bamlett, the the urban forester representing the park commission at the Bidwell Park Centennial. The strength I bring, I think, other than participation, is that I was a trial lawyer for 45 years. I understand how judges think. Right now, with all the litigation that's going on in this community, I am aware of how the perception of the city's actions can affect judges' decisions. And so I try very hard to provide that input to the council. I've been serving for a year and a half. I was kind of surprised my time was up. I'd be honored if you appointed me for another term. I intend to serve, if you'll let me, for as long as you'll let me. Thank you. Thank you. And then our last applicant is Mark Wolfe, and he has applied for several other boards in case you need him in a different capacity. So, Mark Wolfe. Thank you. Mr. Mayor and members of the council, Bidwell Park is, as everybody has mentioned, quite a special place. I first came here to Chico about 20 years ago. Born and raised in Northern California. Hadn't made my way over. One of the first places I visited was the park. And I quickly learned that the people in Chico were pretty friendly. Friendlier than in most places in California. People in the park would say hello to me, walking on the trail before I said hello to them. And I was impressed by that. It is impressive because it really, I think, symbolizes the community nature of the park. It brings this town together. Everybody enjoys the park. And it is, as others have noted, truly a gem, a jewel in this community. I think sometimes we lose sight of that. It's a unique feature and a unique asset to our town here in Chico. It is, again, a wonderful community meeting place. Everybody enjoys it. My background is in city planning. I served for a few years here with the city. Finished up as the director for the community development department. But worked in about 35 years, different communities around California in a planning role. So I have a great familiarity with the workings of local government. And the functions of boards and how that all works. It would be a privilege to serve on this commission. And I would be happy to answer any questions you might have of me. Thank you. Okay, so that is it for the Bidwell Park and Playground. I have three applications. For the planning commission, it's a seven-member board with three positions with four-year terms. And I have four applicants who it's their first choice. And then another four which are willing to serve on other boards. So Robert Evans, I know can't be here tonight. He let us know. And I believe the council received his letter. Brandy Laffins. Thank you. Okay, Ken Rensink. Madam Clerk, when we finish the interviews, we'll probably take a short break before we do the next part of the process. Or is that? It's pretty quick after that. Okay, so we'll go ahead and wait after that. I think we've got a microphone up there. Here we go. Or someone come down. I'll come. Welcome to the council. Mayor, really appreciate you all here this evening serving because it's both a necessary job and it's needed. But it's not very thankful. And a lot of times you don't get an extra reserve. So thank you. I've served three terms on the GEO Planning Commission. I had the opportunity to serve the table. Community service is also important to me. I read from the city council. I was a member of the city council in 2018. Had the pleasure of running against both Casey Reynolds and Andrew Coolidge. So I always enjoyed trying to help the city move forward and make good decisions. I'm a graduate of Chico State. Graduated in 1990 with an degree in business administration, offshore management. Worked in financial planning and financial services for a few years. Didn't really find the personal charm in Richmond that I was looking for on that. So I started working in the business administration. And I switched from that to Chico State. And I did a lot of teaching credentials and I've been a special education teacher for the last 22 years. On my time on the planning commission, I learned some things and realized that there was a lot of knowledge that I didn't really understand. But one of the things that I did understand from the very start was that you needed to be consistent in your application of rules and policies. And procedures. Whatever those are. There were times that I had to vote for projects or things that I didn't necessarily agree with. But I helped looking at CEWA, looking at Title 19, looking at the general plan, looking at environmental impact reports. It's like, it's check all the boxes. It's a worthy project. It's legal. It meets the requirements. It's a good thing. It should go forward. And I voted for it. There were also times when I voted against projects that I thought would be okay in the city. Again, for the same reason. I either thought the project didn't meet the general plan in some aspect or was in some other way not appropriate at that time. I think it's important to be sure that you always have the community's input. But to listen to the folks that are coming down. Because most of the time, people are serious when they come down on a parking. They only have three minutes and 30 seconds. So, I enjoy serving. I think I've helped make some good decisions with the city and helped the city conform to policy direction. And I would be one of your choices. That would be great. One final thing. I can't wait. the Planning Commissioners Academy, sponsored by California League of Cities. I would recommend that you give all your new Planning Commissioners an opportunity to attend that training, as I know you would hope and greatly. If I have any questions. Thank you. Thank you, Ken. Margaret Scarpa. Hi, Council Members. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I am passionate about land use planning and development. My degree from Chico State is in political science with a certificate in land use and environmental planning, and I would love the opportunity to assist and guide the city with development and growth. Currently, I am a housing policy analyst for the state of California within the Housing and Community Development Department. I work with cities, counties, and metropolitan planning organizations with technical assistance, analysis, as well as in guiding their applications and reviewing their applications specifically with the REAP 2.0, which is the Regional Early Action Planning Grants of 2021, as well as the State's Pro-Housing Designation Program, which is working on accelerating housing towards the type of housing that the state is looking for, as well as in streamlining objectives to ensure housing that is needed. Previously, I was a land use planner for Yuba County. I was their long-range planner, but it was a small jurisdiction, so I also did environmental planning, current planning, GIS, and the like. I updated their development code, as well as did specific plan amendments where needed. I processed use permits and land divisions. I prepared working on some grants in ADU workbook for residents to understand the process of building an ADU in their backyard. I conducted environmental review on many different projects, as well as on their transportation grants, as well as their housing grants. And I produced maps and answered public inquiries on zoning and land use. I care deeply about Chico and would love the opportunity to utilize my education, experience, and skill set with guiding development and growth in Chico and giving back to my community. And thank you for the opportunity to speak on this and to be considered as an applicant. Thank you. So, Austin Barron, First Choice Planning Commission, he is willing to serve on the ARHPB, which I believe is a current member of that board. Good afternoon, Council. Good to see everybody. My name is Austin Barron. I'm a local commercial real estate broker here in Chico. I'm here to apply to the Planning Commission, as well as the Architecture Review and Historic Preservation Board, which I currently sit on. You know, I work with many land owners, developers, tenants, homeowners alike. I'm out there in the field every day. I've helped many people apply. I've worked with many people for entitlements and been through the process on a business level. And serving on Architecture Review for two years has definitely opened my eyes to these commissions as well. I took four years of college architecture CAD design before I went into real estate. I've developed a keen eye for proper balance in this city. I believe we need more of that. I believe that a commissioner should keep the historic and traditional Chico vision. development and development at the forefront of their decisions, while also keeping an open mind to the new age of development and the needs of its citizens. I was inspired by my coworker, Georgia Bellen, current chair of the ARHPB, former mayor as well, to join their board in 2021. She's taught me a great deal about keeping a balance in development and guiding developers to better beautify and restore this town, while also conceding that some requirements may be met in the future. I think the city's role in developing a city may be too costly to inflict on a developer. Like I said, I am applying for both the ARHPB and the planning commission. I feel my skills, knowledge, and vision of local policy, city planning, and housing may be best served on the planning commission, but I'd be happy to continue on with ARHPB if that's what you guys see fit. Thank you once again for considering my application to serve my city. I'm here for any questions if you have any. Thank you. Nicole Nava. Hello. And this is my first choice. So thank you for hearing from me again. I already explained I've been in Chico since 76. Pretty much lived in every neighborhood in Chico as I used to do property management. I started out doing apartment management and then promoted up and supervised a lot of those managers in the various neighborhoods throughout town, conducting inspection reports. We had to know about zoning and all the other things that go along with that field. My husband and I were scrappy dogs and became homeowners early on. And like I said, I'm a little bit nerdy and like to look through reports and look at things. So I would look when they would have to assess neighborhoods and do things. But I would also like to ensure that you could take care of funding necessary infrastructure needs in specific neighborhoods. I have done the deep dive into the 2030 general plan, the housing element, and various other publications that have come out. As a citizen, I try to take part in every city survey and some of the other county surveys that come out that are so important. That form the basis for so much of what we do around here. Such as some of the traffic studies. And other improvements and things like the bus line that they want to ask us about. All of these things play into and feeders into things like the planning commission. As I mentioned before, graduated with a four year degree. It was in business administration with honors. I also have an associate of arts. I've worked since I was 15 nonstop. 24 of those years have been in social services. The latter I'd say decade in management. And oversight as customer engagement. Engagement types things. And project management. So a lot of that has involved things that could be contractual procurement. I've helped out counties with advanced planning documents that have been accepted by governmental entity over tech. I am highly apprised of municipality type things. And all the things that you guys tend to attend. And I more particularly want to point out that I do understand the role of commissions. And that you are, you know, researching. Putting in a lot of the effort. And volunteering your time. And that you are compiling information to provide to the council as a recommendation. And so I think that's important to know the distinctions. And to understand the rules associated. And that we are not directing city staff. But they are a wonderful resource. And I respect them. I have soft skills that are needed. And importantly, you know, I want to note that for me it's important to hear from the community. And to be able to get the information that I need. And to listen to their feedback. To keep an open mind. And as the prior gentleman noted, to me it would be very important to understand that sometimes you are going to have to say yes to something you might want to normally say no to. And vice versa. And I feel like I have good evaluation skills to do that. I would be honored to serve. And thank you. Thank you. Loretta Torres. She has also applied for the airport commission. And the planning commission is her first choice. Loretta Torres. I'm Loretta Torres. And I grew up in Chico. I lived out at Chico Municipal Airport. When I could live, when my parents had, and I had a barracks out there. I attended Chico State. I married and moved to Glenn County. My husband was a rice farmer. So we know, we learned over the years, for 50 years of farming. You learn things. You learn to understand the permitting process. The various state mandated rules and regulations that come down to us. At any rate, my husband became ill and died. And I moved back here to Chico 13 years ago. But backing up a minute, I built and designed a home, a tri-level home in Glenn County. And then, because I love looking at plans, no matter. Plans for work. For whatever. Businesses and private. I enjoy reading. And I was appointed by Larry Wall to the Butte County Planning Commission. I love that job. And I'm willing, because I'm now a semi-retired farmer businesswoman, that I have the time to do all the reading that is necessary. I know what has to be done when all the different applications come before the committee. So, although I don't have a background in, oh my goodness, some of the people here, I do believe that a layman's viewpoint is necessary in some of these city commissions that we can't all be so focused on one particular item or area. We need to consider the whole of Chico and its beautiful, beautiful, beautiful environment. for all of us so I thank you for considering me and and I hope that you will make use of the time that I have for you thank you and then our last applicant for the Planning Commission and it's Mark wolf his first choice is the Planning Commission second choice bid will Park and playground and the third choice would be architectural review historic preservation board thank you mr. mayor members of the council back again I am an unabashed planning enthusiast it started early in my life and it never left I was fortunate enough to find that I could actually work in that field and I worked in that for a long time over 35 years now I've worked as I mentioned earlier in both the capacity of a city planner working for local government I've also worked on the private side I worked for a home builder down in Sonoma County for about three and a half years as well you so I've got a kind of a balanced perspective on on things Chico is an extraordinary place after I moved here pretty much because of it well Park started learning more about this community and what makes it what makes it work and I and I was just impressed and stunned sometimes just at the vision of the leadership of this town for since its inception and we are here today benefiting from and enjoying the opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and opportunities and Thank you. Thank you. So, Council, that's it for the first three boards. The rest of the boards are going to be brought back for more discussion. I will be passing out on the break that I know we're going to take right after this the nomination form for the individual nominations for the incoming council members who just got elected. And then on the Arts Commission, the one position that is vacant for the two years will be a vote by all council members. And I would say, if you would indulge me to please maybe on the Planning Commission, go ahead and make the nominations. But I think that when council makes those appointments, it should be in consideration or in concert with the discussion about ARHPB, which is what council asked me to further analyze. And staff and I have been working on that. So, we plan on bringing that analysis back at the next meeting. And that was when we were going to make the appointments for the first three commissions and boards. So, if you're okay with that, I'll agendize first the analysis and then the appointments will come after that, if that's okay. And is that appointment just for planning or is that? That would be for these three, who you've heard from. So, Arts Commission, Bidwell Park and Playground. And the Planning Commission, if there are no changes made whatsoever to any of the structure of the ARHPB. All right. And then just another question. So, in terms of the Arts Commission, we should know who the individuals who were recently elected select before we vote on the general member, correct or no? Well, what it is, is that if you... Typically, we do it all in one. We have the individual that is a spot for Council Member Van Overbeek, Council Member Winslow and Vice Mayor Reynolds. And then right below it will be a list for everyone who gets to nominate. And so, yes, one of the council members may already nominate a person. But I think that with seven members participating, you may nominate others. And so, then we haven't in the past sought the nominations because that is really... Up to the council, a full vote of the council, whether those nominations actually go forward and are accepted. Yeah, I'm just concerned that it would skew the votes. For example, if Casey was going to pick Joe, there's no Joe, don't worry. And so, she doesn't select Joe as the member to come from all of us. Joe may be deprived of a vote. That... So, we have... Three people that will be taken up by the individual nominations. Right, or if she picked Joe because she knows, you know, she's... Right, and so, and you would really like to nominate Joe. Is that... Yeah, well, no, I mean, what I'm saying is it'd be good to know who's off that list before... Because four of us will just be playing a guessing game with whoever's there. Okay, so let me work with the city attorney because it's a Brown Act action. Right. So, you know, sending it out and then saying so-and-so's taking so-and-so and this and that, that could be a violation, that could be a serial meeting by doing that. By bringing it here, if you see that there isn't, maybe you don't make a nomination, but you see who is still remaining, you can make your nomination as an individual council member for that two-year seat. I'm just worried about the Brown Act. I just want to protect you. Yeah, I got you. I just... Yeah, I don't know. That's fine. So, the city attorney agrees. Remember, we have to do it. Okay. Any other... Any other questions? Okay, thank you. All right. So, at this time, why don't we go ahead and take a break. So, we'll... Again, thank you, everybody, for coming. We really appreciate your commitment to the city. And, again, if you're not selected, we'd love to have you in the future. So, please try again. If, in fact, you are selected, welcome to the fray. Thank you. You got it. All right. All right, we'll call the meeting back to order. I'm missing a few folks. One is coming. Hopefully both of them. You locked him out. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right, item 5.2. I just don't think we are. Now, now, now, now. Don't make me separate you two. All right, sewer regionalization project inter-municipal agreement. And we have Eric Duff, Senate Public Works Director. Welcome. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, City Council members. Thanks for the opportunity to speak to you tonight. I have a quick presentation I will bring up here. All right, so this is the request for approval for the inter-municipal agreement. The acronym. The acronym is the IMA for the Seachiega Wastewater Treatment Services to the Town of Paradise. So this is the next step, the next agreement, if you will, in the regionalization effort. If you recall, last year in June of 2022, we approved the principles of agreement, which was kind of the guiding document for this inter-municipal agreement, which is really the legal document that will guide the regionalization effort moving forward. So quick overview slide. We're going to touch on the background just to bring everybody back up to speed. I'm going to highlight a few of the items. The IMA, we're going to talk briefly about next steps and then land on a recommendation slide. So obviously, why are we doing this post-campfire regionalization effort to provide a long-term sewer solution to the Town of Paradise? So a number of reasons, of course, to assist our friends and neighbors on the ridge for their recovery efforts post-campfire. It has a groundwater quality component, an affordable housing element. And of course, from us, from a business perspective, it adds to our ratepayer base as well. But really, too, it's state-guided at this point. The Regional Water Quality Control Board likes and prefers to regulate larger regional wastewater treatment plants versus a handful of smaller ones. So it's really a state initiative as well. And they're obviously a big contributing partner. That is the latest route map for the proposed pipeline. You can see the sewer service area. In the Town of Paradise is really the commercial corridors with some residential in there as well. The route is proposed to go down the skyway at Otterson, connect over to Hagen, Elk Avenue, Crouch Avenue, then to Chico River Road out to the wastewater treatment plant. I should note, too, that Paradise will own and operate the collection system within the sewer service area. City of Chico will not. They will also own and operate and maintain the pipeline all the way to where it connects at Chico's wastewater. And at that connection is where we'll assume ownership of the wastewater. So some key dates to remember. December 8, 2020, the Town of Paradise voted unanimously to advance a regionalization approach to connect to our wastewater treatment plant. Their other option was to build their own plant. But obviously, I think the state recommendation was there, too, to look at a larger regionalization effort. And I think that's a great point. The long-term operational and maintenance costs of connecting to our plant were a little bit more cost-effective versus Paradise building and operating their own plant. February 2, 2021, City of Chico Council voted unanimously to execute a cooperative funding agreement, a CFA. So that's an agreement that allows us to be reimbursed for all of our time spent analyzing this project. Both Paradise and Chico have teams of engineers that are looking into this and confirming impacts and so on. And so. And all of those costs are reimbursed. So no City of Chico connections do not bear any of the cost for those efforts. And we have been reimbursed up to this point. April 12, 2021, the Sewer Regionalization Project Advisory Committee, SERPAC, was formed. And Mayor Coolidge and Vice Mayor Reynolds serve on that committee, along with then Mayor Steve Prouder of Town of Paradise and then Council Member Jody Jones of Town of Paradise. And really the big task of the SERPAC was to develop. And approve and recommend to the governing bodies, the respective governing bodies, the principles of agreement which we approved in June of last year. So this is kind of what I like to refer to as the project management pyramid. Again, starting from the top, the letter of support was the first item. Then the SERPAC was formed. That was completed. The SERPAC's large task, our main task, was to draft the principles of agreement. That was again approved in June of last year. And now we're in that kind of middle section there, approving or seeking approval for the IMA. The next step as we further get towards the ground level is we'll have to apply for an extension of sewer services to Butte-Lafco. And then we will start to work on the operating agreement, which is really the granular agreement that will kind of guide the day-to-day activities of the regionalization effort. Excuse me, thank you. So now we're going to kind of start on the IMA overview. And another reason why we are doing this is our municipal code. Muni Code Section 15.40285 governs and regulates wastewater received from other jurisdictions. So it's our policy, our requirement to draft an inter-municipal agreement. It's required in our code. So that's why we're here. That's why we're doing this. The IMA addresses and incorporates all 17 principles of the principles of agreement. That were approved by SERPAC and City Council. Provides a contractual language for wastewater treatment services by the City of Chico to the Town of Paradise. And one thing I really like about this, it's not in stone. I mean, it's a legal guiding document, but it's not static in the sense where there's wording written in there that it's going to be updated three years after execution. And then every five years thereafter. So if there's issues that arise as we're, you know, embarking on this regionalization effort and things that we need to change or do, we can update that. So we can update this agreement every five years. Both agencies have the ability to work together to do that. So I'm going to get into some of the section highlights and we'll move through these slides rather quickly. Again, Section 4 covers the capacity. The City will provide .464 million gallons per day of wastewater treatment. So just under a half a million gallons. And to kind of give you that some perspective, again, we are certified for 12 MGD per day. We currently. We treat on average about six MGD per day. So Paradise's total capacity or total flow at build out, which build out is projected to be several decades. So, you know, 10 to 20 years before we see those types of flows is just under half a million gallons per day. In the event that they exceed that allocation, there's an immediate 20% fee for doing so. That really works in our favor. So if they go several gallons over that 20% fee kicks in until. That scenario is corrected. If the town if and when the town reaches 90% of the .464 allotment, the town will be required to report to prepare a report, excuse me, which outlines options for maintaining the current cap or increasing the cap, which of course would be subject to reviews and approvals by both entities. The boundaries of the area served under the IMA cannot exceed the boundaries of the town. It's also in Section 4. Section 4. Section 5. The town will adopt the city's sewer use ordinance and subsequent regulation. So basically they're taking all of our sewer ordinance components, including our pretreatment, and adopting that as their ordinance and pretreatment. The town will provide all requests of information to the city regularly. The town will grant the city access to all facilities. So this is good in the event that we see something weird coming into the plant and we're able to pinpoint it to a certain connection where it's a significant industrial user on the site. So we're able to find out what's going on in the commercial side. The town will grant us 24-7 access to that facility in order to see what's going on and make any necessary recommendations or corrections. The town will construct flow control and metering structures with access to city staff for proper monitoring. Again, the town will adopt the city's pretreatment regulations, which is a big one. The town will own and operate the collection system and export pipeline. And the city will continue to own and operate the wastewater treatment plant. Okay. Section 12A of the IMA covers the capacity payment. So again, at build out, the town is going to have about .464 MGD capacity. Well, that's capacity in our plant that we have currently, but there is, of course, a cost to that capacity. And so through the principles of agreement and now the IMA, it just codifies that the town will pay the city approximately $4.9 million for that capacity. And that payment is going to be $4.9 million. And that payment will be made before any flows are accepted by the city. Section 12B through G kind of covers several items as you see here. The town will be subject to future costs related to needs of the wastewater treatment plant proportionally or directly as applicable. The town will develop zone capacity connection charges because they are going to pay that $14.9 million upfront. Then, of course, they'll have to amortize that over time to their users as they connect. The town will develop its own sewer rate schedule and collect accordingly. And the town will maintain adequate records. The city will charge the town for supporting the pretreatment program. So this is something to make sure everybody is clear. We're only going to charge the town a fee to treat, a treatment fee to treat the wastewater. Okay. And our current fee that city users use, a portion of it is for the collection system maintenance and repair. And then a portion of it is for treatment. Since we will not own the collection system or the pipeline coming down from the town, they are responsible for that. So they're going to charge their connections that collection system fee plus our fee for treating the wastewater. So I just want to make sure that's clear. There's two types of different fees. And we're only going to charge Paradise the treatment fee. Next, Section 13A covers town payment of sewer charges to the city. So no later than 45 calendar days following the date of each regular periodic billing for sewer services, the town shall pay the city a sum that equals the total of all charges for the city that were charged to town for that billing period, regardless of the amount collected by the town from its users. So that's one item or last sentence I want to focus on, regardless of the amount collected by the town from its users. So we don't want to be in the collections business for people that aren't within city limits, as far as defaults and things like that. So the town will be responsible for that. And the town will pay the city our fees, regardless of what it collects from its users. Again, 14A monthly treatment user fees. The town will pay the sewer treatment fee established in the city's fee schedule, including any future increases made to those fees. The town will also initiate its own Proposition 218 process as required by law. So, as we all know, we just went through a Proposition 218 process. To increase our fees slightly to our connections. When we have to do that again, we will initiate ours, and the town will be responsible for initiating theirs. I will go back to the previous slide. In the event that the town doesn't pass their 218 process or their increase initiative again, they will have to pay for charges for that billing period, regardless of the amount collected by the town from its users. So that protects us in the event that we have to do that again. We went through and passed the 218 process, but the town did not for whatever reason. Section 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 are really kind of the legalese of the agreement. It covers the no joint and several liability procedures for disputes, mediation, default by other entity, and the requirements for insurance and identification. Section 17, 17. 18. 19. 37. 38. 39. 42. 44. 45. 46. 46. 47. 49. 50. 52. 53. 54. 56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 62. 63. 65. 68. 68. 70. 71. 68. 68. 70. 72. 72. 73. 74. 78. 79. 80. 81. 81. 82. 68. 68. for an extension of services application, and we will start that right away. And then we will start working on the operating agreement, which again is the granular level agreement that will govern the day-to-day operations of this effort. One item I wanted to touch on before we go to the recommendation slide is last week on February 14th, Valentine's Day, as a matter of fact, the Town of Paradise unanimously approved the IMA contingent upon a minor change to Section 15B auditing records. And at first, this gave us a little bit of pause, and then after much discussion, I know City Manager Sorensen spoke with Town Manager Phillips on this item, and we talked a lot about, we have the authority to audit the town's records, and I think the town just wanted the ability to do that as well, to look at costs for services and things of that nature. And we know that, by law, we have to provide those services for cost of service and things like that. So this just memorializes it, and after a little bit of more discussion, staff is very comfortable with that. So if you don't mind, I'll go ahead and read that the city and town shall have the authority to appoint such auditors as it deems necessary for the examination of financial records of the town and city to determine compliance with this agreement. The town and city shall make available to such auditors all requested records and will assist and cooperate with the auditors in their efforts. Example, as the required documentation from the town may include reasonable efforts to collect delinquent charges, details of uncollectible charges, and account billing information by parcel. Examples of required documentation for the city may include receipts of town payments. So the requested changes by the town are in red, and staff are comfortable with them at this point. But that lands us on the recommendation page, and I think there's three options considering the town's request to amend that small section. I think, one, we approve the agreement IMA and authorize, agree, approve it as is, and authorize the city manager to execute the document or approve the inter-municipal agreement considering Paradise's suggested revisions, which staff are comfortable with, or propose refinements to the language and ask the city attorney to develop recommendations for approval. That concludes the presentation. I can answer any questions. All right. And I'd like to give this opportunity to have Vice Mayor Allen's comment on this as well. Her and I served on this, and I think it's important for the general public to understand. I think it's important for the general public to understand exactly what went into it. Vice Mayor? Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor. I see that really the only choice we have on this is B, and I will go to that to this extent. On November 18th, our lives changed for everybody here in Butte County. We had no idea how it was going to change and what we were going to be able to do to support our neighboring city. All we've heard about for how many other years now? 18, 19, 20, 23? Four years now is, we've got to support Paradise. We've got to love Paradise. We've got to take in their citizens. We need to feed them. We need to house them. We need to do this. We need to do that. If we really want to help Paradise, we need to allow their sewer to come down here so they can rebuild. We are doing this because the state of California would not allow them to put in their own sewer system. They were the largest community, I think, in California, that every single parcel was on a septic system. They don't want to build. They want to build every single parcel on a septic system. I know businesses that had businesses up there that were paying hundreds of dollars a month to Roto-Rooter to come out and have their kitchens and everything Roto-Rooted because they can't get everything down septic. And it's not right. They need to be on sewer. So some key things that went into this. Chico is not paying for this. Some of the things I keep hearing. Chico's paying for it. That's why we went through this rate increase. Nope. Chico's not paying for it. Paradise is paying for it. $14.9 million up front. They're paying for it. The city, the town, our city attorneys, and a regionalization expert who has done this in other communities spent hundreds of hours working on this. So for us to do C and to send this back to make refinements and everything, I can't imagine there's a refinement that hasn't been done in the hundreds of hours that have been worked on this. There is no tie-in coming down the pipeline. Oh, you're going to rebuild. Oh, you're going to build on the hill. Oh, you're going to do all this, that, and the other. No, there's no tie-in. It's not allowed. It was specifically put in there. There's no tie-ins. It's coming straight down to Chico for us to think. And what were my other? I think that's it. So if we want to be a good neighbor, I think we need to be a good neighbor and help Paradise rebuild and help their city have a viable septic system so they can rebuild their community. Thank you, Vice Mayor. And along those lines, too, I will tell our community at this point in time. And I can say this. Without a doubt, of all the things we've done since my time on the council, this is by far one of the most amazing things that we are doing and a thing that will serve Paradise for years to come, as well as help the city of Chico. I'm going to ask Director Guffison a question along those lines in a second, because I already know the answer to it. But on June 2022, we approved the principles of agreement. And I can tell you, I've got seven meetings, something like that. We went through this agreement line by line. We ensured that the tie-ins, like Vice Mayor Reynolds mentioned, were not allowed, because that was a concern that people were having in the community. We went through and made sure that this was a good agreement for the city of Chico. We made sure and checked to make sure that we could still do development if we wanted to do it. It wouldn't hinder it. If anything, it's going to help it. And that leads me to my question. To the city of Chico. To Director Guffison is, a lot of people said we've had various discussions on development that with Paradise tying into our sewer, does this limit us from doing any development in the city of Chico? Or is this going to create a fee increase? Maybe you could answer both of those questions to your knowledge. And I've heard your answers before, so I can already know. No, great questions. And no, the answer is no. It's not going to limit any development in the city of Chico. At this time, I mean, we have capacity in this capacity identified by Paradise. They're paying for this capacity. What we're going to do, if this all works out, is immediately put that payment into building extra capacity into our plan. We have some quick additions we could do and a primary clarifier and a secondary clarifier that we could increase capacity rather quickly. So it will not limit our capacity. And again, their build out is a very long time. We're talking two decades before they reach that amount, per their projections. So we have a lot of work to do. We have time. And it's a benefit, I think, to the plant in the sense that it broadens our customer base. It will not cost us any more. It will help, if anything. And it also really puts us in a good light, in my opinion, with the regional board, who regulates us very significantly. And again, they like regional scenarios. They like that consolidation. And I think it will position us well. I think it will position us well for the future for grant funding opportunities, additional alternative funding opportunities for increasing our treatment standards or levels, capacity improvements, condition improvements. So I think it will position us well for a long-term good relationship with both Paradise and the regional board. All right. Thank you. Any other questions for Mr. Ruff? I have a question for Director Gustafson. Is there a difference in the processing capacity of the plant based on seasonality? I mean, you have some biological reactions that I think would move more slowly in the winter than the summer. Actually, differently. They move a little faster in the winter because we have increased flows. And the students are here in our scenario. When the university is in session, we see higher flows in the wintertime. Those tend to taper off in the summer. So yeah, there's two different ways of measurements we use. The average dry weather flows and average wet weather flows. And there is a difference. So we can process more in the winter than in the summer? We do process more just based on our flows, our wet weather flows. And it tends to reduce in the summer months for a number of reasons. Again, no students. And we like to think the majority of our collection system is in decent shape, although 30% of it has reached its useful life. So we do have an intrusion scenario, an I&I scenario. When it rains, we do have some do see a pretty big jump in flows from rain events. So the question was really not what are you actually processing. It was assuming that you have the same amount of, let's say you were at capacity. Let's say you were at capacity. Would you be constrained if the weather were hotter or colder? I'm trying to get a sense if there's a... If there is rain events. The throughput changes with temperature. It does during, not necessarily the temperature, but precipitation. So during wet weather events, it does change and increase. But we would, you know, we're heavily regulated by the Water, Regional Water Quality Control Board. So if we start to near 75% of capacity, 80% of capacity, we have to draft fully engineered reports on what we're going to do to combat that capacity, whether it's going to reduce certain areas or increase capacity at the plant, which is... Typically always increased capacity at the plant. Yeah, so that's where I'm going with this. So right now we're running at about half of... You're processing half of the capacity. But there's no scenario at the current level that we're going to bump into that headroom. But you're saying at 75%, then you have to start thinking about it. Absolutely. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Bennett, you had a question? I read the entire report, and it was excellent. So is the area, and what I couldn't figure out, is the area that Paradise is allowed to tap into or send down the hill, product send down the hill, is that defined or is it going to be expanded up to the .453? It is defined, and I will go back to that slide. So it's defined. It's defined, if you could see my cursor there, in really the commercial areas in orange. Okay. So this is the darker green shade is the total town limits, and the orange shade is the sewer service area. So it is defined by parcels. Okay. 4.464. There it is. Correct. And then there's three income sources. I'm going to say revenue sources. There's a 14.9, and then there is the... treatment charge for the product coming down the hill. And where I lost it, I couldn't understand if the pretreatment, was that an expense by the City of Chico, or is that an expense that may be required? It's not required within this document, but it may be required, and that would be an expense for Paradise, therefore it doesn't impact Chico. Or... It will impact Chico from a revenue perspective, so that is a third cost pretreatment regulation. Okay. So they're adopting our pretreatment, program, which is great. We have a very aggressive pre-treatment program. So an example will be if there's a commercial customer that wishes to connect and their effluent is rather stronger than normal, and once it reaches certain thresholds, we permit it differently. We will consider it as a potentially significant industrial user. So they pay pre-treatment costs and additional costs based on the strength of their effluent. And we also layer in, depending on the scenario, a pre-treatment program where they have to actually treat a certain degree of that wastewater on site. An example will be we have a large brewery in town, and the process of brewing beer is great. It produces a fantastic product, as we all know, but that process also has some strong byproducts, some effluent that gets discharged into the sanitary sewer system, which is very difficult to treat. And so we require, in those scenarios, a pre-treatment process. So a large brewery in town has to pre-treat a certain aspect of their effluent before it's discharged into the sanitary sewer system. That's heavily regulated by our staff, and Paradise would be adopting that regulation and paying those added costs as well. Okay. And then you provided clarification. I was concerned about down the road. This agreement is going to be forever. Down the road, if something changes, and it has to be modified, how do we do that? And you've answered that with every five years, there's going to be a review and possible changes. So thank you very much. Excellent presentation. Thank you. All right. Further questions? Councilman Winslow. Thanks for the presentation, and so does Vice Mayor Reynolds for sharing what's happened in these committee meetings in the meantime. Some people were talking about small mutual aid projects earlier, and this is a really big mutual aid project, and I think it's great. We're able to provide something to help Paradise rebuild, especially in a kind of way emphasizing growth in their downtown and their core. Still, it's a really big project, and I've been interested since it was first proposed in the effects of it. I sat in over a year ago just as a sort of environmental advocate at large on a meeting with Paradise town staff and town manager and exhausted all the concerns that I could think of, discussed alternatives to it, of which I think the conclusion was there were none. It was a septic system or don't build or it was this project. So the main concern, Vice Mayor Reynolds addressed that there can be no connections between the town of Paradise and the city of Chico where we want to encourage growth. But when we talk about amendments to the agreement, is that fair game to amend within these five-year discussions? I would say no, because they are capped at the capacity of 0.464. Plus, from an engineering standpoint, they're capped at the capacity of 0.464. So I think that from an engineering perspective, trying to connect to a pipeline of that size or that magnitude underneath the skyway would be very, very difficult. There was, by my count, precisely one comment on this that we've received with some questions or concerns in there. And because there is so little of that, because it is a good project, I think we all recognize that. I just want to mention a few of these in case you have an answer for it. It looks like actually, I remember Bennett just asked, there's no prevention, there's no provision setting forth which entity will own the treated effluent at the point of discharge from the city of Chico? No, that was not asked. You asked a different one. Is that addressed by the fact that we own the wastewater treatment plant, that we own all the poop that comes down the poop line? Correct. Once it enters our plant, we own the wastewater. We do whatever we want with it. Correct. Not whatever we want. We've got heavy regulations in the state. Good answer. Good answer. Evan, did you get that in the back there for me? For the enterprise record? That Council Member Winslow quote? Okay. Just wanted to make sure. All right. Any further questions? I think that, yeah, I think that, that, thank you. All right. Any further questions? All right. Do we have any speakers on the side? No. Okay. Entertain a motion. I move option B under recommendations to accept with amendments. All right. Absolutely. Second. All right. We have a motion and a second. Whenever you're ready. Council Member Bennett. I just would like to thank Mayor Coolidge and Vice Mayor Reynolds for all of their work for the years of monitoring this and making sure it's workable solution for the town. I absolutely vote yes. Okay. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Thank you. Okay. We'll move on now. So, item 5.3, presentation fiber utility and broadband infrastructure. And we have our Deputy Director of Information Services whose name is actually Josh Markey, not Jason. Close enough to quote it. Welcome, Josh. The floor is yours. Good evening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, members council, my name's Josh Markey. I'm your Deputy Director of Information Systems. I'm here tonight to give you an update on the fiber utility. It's been just over a year since I gave you an update and felt like it was time. Feel free to ask any questions or interrupt if you want more information, but I wanted to quickly just remind everyone what I do. our goals and objectives that were outlined in the broadband plan that was adopted in January of last year. We identified four goals and objectives in that plan. It was to improve affordability, enable competitive options, pursue 50-year infrastructure, and address digital access and equity gaps. Some key details of the network, how we're designing the network, is that it's going to be an open access network. The city will own and operate that network, including the equipment in the residence or business. ISPs will be offered from our marketplace, so you'll be able to have multiple ISPs to pick from. You could even have multiple ISPs delivering service to your home or business. We're focusing on underground construction, so directional boring and traditional trench cutters. We've identified that we want an active Ethernet design. Those details differentiate us from other networks and is a common model that a lot of municipalities are picking and is very favorable for upcoming funding opportunities with the state and federal. The pilot location, the area in purple, very closely aligns with the Chapman Elementary School District boundary. And then you'll notice there's an orange strip above that and then a red area to the north. And those designated areas just kind of grew based on funding sources. So we originally had some ARPA money that was allocated by the council, and we were focusing mainly on the purple area, which is, for those who can't see the map, west of 99, north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99, and north of 99 will provide us with a lot of funding opportunities that I'll talk about a little bit later. Really quick historical timeline, which has too much detail on it, but I will just hit a couple of those topics. The interim report that we adopted January 4th of 2022, and then the fiber utility was created in February 15th of last year. And then fast forward to this year, on the 13th of February, we applied for the SURF EDP grant for $2.5 million that we're awaiting a notification on sometime in April of this year. And then today, I published the construction RFP to get us current labor prices for what this will cost to construct. So again, current activities, looking for partners and opportunities for collaboration, had a lot of sit-downs with local and state entities. On how we can make this work for our community, some opportunities for us to, you know, co-locate with those entities. A lot of that surrounding the California Middle Mile and trying to get a local presence. One of our constrictions in this area is that we don't have many opportunities to get out of our area. So we're kind of in an isolated, at least for the internet, isolated area. And we're trying to procure more opportunities to get out of our area. And we're trying to procure more opportunities to get out of our area. And we're trying to procure more opportunities, which will help, you know, participating ISPs come and service our area at much more affordable prices. Preparing for utility operations, and then, of course, exploring additional funding options, which I have a couple slides about. Current funding, council allocated $4.8 million of our ARPA monies to the fiber utility. And then last year, we applied for and were awarded $4.8 million of our ARPA monies to the fiber utility. And then last year, we applied for and were awarded $2.5 million of our ARPA monies to the fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid It's a federal program that gives a supplement for eligible households of up to $30 a month, which can be up to $75 a month on eligible tribal land. So future funding, lots of opportunities, which I'm sure you guys have seen in the news. A couple of the ones that we're keeping an eye on and that we will probably be applying for is the federal funding account. Butte County, not the entity Butte County, but the area of Butte County, was awarded $19.2 million for the federal funding account. We will be, as they develop those rules, we will be looking to apply for that. The 2023 LADA grant will, in theory, come out in or be due in August. We'll be applying for that again. The California Advanced Services Fund, which is more kind of the traditional funding source, for rural areas to get broadband. We will be applying for that in a couple of the more nuanced areas of the city. And then we're awaiting the California Loan Loss Reserve, which we're supposed to hear more about sometime in 2023, probably quarter three or quarter four. And then the California State Digital Equity Planning Grant is a small grant compared to all the rest, but may have some digital equity. So that will be a big tie-ins and allow us to do some outreach. So we'll probably be applying for that one. And then one of the larger grants that's going to be available is the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Grant, or commonly referred to as BEDE, which the rules are being developed right now. So we anticipate an application period of 2024, probably quarter one or quarter two. So upcoming items on the timeline. And there's one on there that I get asked the most about, but I'll kind of get there. Construction award for the labor and materials. Anticipate that in late March. April, doing contracting and purchasing for those materials and services. The FFA grant application in quarter one or quarter two of this year. The LADA grant again in August. And the pilot construction grant, we anticipate beginning no later than September. And then operations. So when we can actually service someone, will probably be shortly after construction begins, but will take a good year, year and a half to complete. So we're, a lot of the grants that we've applied for, and I anticipate us applying for, have a lot of rules about finishing construction in 2025. So that will be our goal. And I'm available for any questions. I know that's a lot of information. All right, questions? Yeah, this may be a question for Director Martin, but I'm hearing that you expect the capital costs to be covered by grants. Is that right? Yeah, at this time, we're not planning to seek any other funding source. I think in the future, there will be a discussion about how to fund further growth of the network. But right now we are using only grants. So thank you. So the question is, on an operational basis, I presume there's been a pro forma put together. What percentage of the operating costs will be covered by revenue from customers? 100%. That's the right answer. Yeah. Thank you. All right, Councilman Wenzel. Just out of curiosity, when we do construction and operations begin, what's the first street sign? What area of Southwest is first going to serve? I will try to not answer that specifically, but I can talk about a general area. And the reason I don't want to say a specific area is obviously there's some people who will benefit sooner than others. But if you look at the purple area on the screen, the area around Chapman Elementary, there's going to be some equipment that will likely be on the Chapman Elementary school ground. And service will spread from that location. Okay. Thank you. I hope that was specific enough without saying a specific street. So anyone else? Okay. You mentioned one of my least favorite words, which is trenching of streets. So do we have something in there for a complete street? So if it's trenched, it's paved edge to edge? So we are trying to stay in the, we will be trying to stay in the green space. And, and we're trying to target directional boring, which should have a lesser impact. We are working very closely with the engineering department to try to stay ahead of their projects and stay out of, you know, disrupting any new asphalt. Okay. Yeah, we've noticed with some of the updates that sort of, well, as an example, the Mulberry reconstruction that just happened, conduit was installed. Oh, okay. Great. So we're just thinking ahead. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I think the last thing we want to do is dig up some streets that were just put in. Yeah, absolutely. All right. Any further questions? And we just have for information, so no public comment. So thank you very much for your time. Thank you. And that's John. No. Just kidding. Just kidding. All right. Okay. We will move on to item 5.4, administrative services department reorganization and update to appendix. B3. And we have administrative services director, Barbara Martin. Welcome. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds and members of council. Thank you for your time tonight. The presentation that you just saw was kind of a contextual item to put before you the request for a management analyst in the administrative services department. As you can see, the landscape of our broadband activities have evolved since we last discussed this last year. Josh is doing an amazing job keeping up with the latest information about these grant opportunities along with managing the pilot project for the fiber utility, issuing requests for proposals, contracts, et cetera. And normally I would bring this request to you in a budget meeting during the budget process, but because of the timelines and because of the opportunities that are coming, we see this as a need immediately for this position. So we are looking for this approval tonight. This upper level administrative position will assist with the grant opportunities and the contracts as well as be the lead administrative position for the administrative services department. It will allow us to move some of the more technical and advanced responsibility of our currently allocated finance analyst to this position. And then in turn, we would be lowering the finance analyst position to an administrative assistant position to allocate the positions a little bit more reasonably. The overall cost for this will be approximately $128,000 per year, the burden of which will be in the short term will be grant funds and the fiber utility effort. There will be some general fund cost, but in the immediate term that will be utilized by savings that we have due to staffing shortages that we have. It's about a $23,000 cost per year to the general fund for the oversight of that administrative function. So with that, we'll take any questions about it. All right. Questions? Doesn't look like any. Thanks. Thank you. Speakers? No. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. Motion by Vice-Minister Reynolds. Second from Councilmember Tandon. When you're ready, Councilmember Bennett. Yes. Councilmember Morgan. Yes. Councilmember Tandon. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Carries 7-0. All right, and we are going to take a short break and then come back. All right, well, we'll see you in a couple of minutes. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for joining us. All right, we'll reconvene. All right, moving on to item 5. I'll let you get situated before I toss this over to you. All right, item 5.5, Councilmember Tan, your Request Library Funding. Councilmember Tan. Thank you. We all are aware that County have made some decisions on their meeting, Supervisor's meeting on Tuesday about cutting the hours further for the Chico's Library. And I understand the Chico's Library is a vital resource and it's a safe space for a lot of kids, parents, and families. And for someone who just wants to go and research something new or develop a hobby. Not everybody can afford every single book they desire to read. I cannot, so I still have three books at my home from the library right now that I'm reading. So, and we have provided funding in the past to different organizations. And I believe our PUFF funds are eligible to be used for our library. So, I would encourage, I do understand that Supervisors are planning a long-term plan to fund the libraries. And they did talk about, they have created an ad hoc committee to discuss the options for the long-term funding sources. And, but I believe that as a city, we should allocate the library to the community. But I would also like to say that we have the required funding to keep the library open for at least another day. Or for some of the services that the county is cutting. So I just would like to get the support of my fellow council members to allocate some of the ARPA fundings. Because the library is a vital resource for our community. And I would also like to volunteer to serve on the ad hoc committee. And I would also like to get the support of the council to get the funding for the library. Or to get some of the discussions going on in that direction. All right. Questions for Council Member Tannen? And keep in mind, there's still a public comment, too. Any questions? All right. I have a question. Mr. Sorensen, maybe you can give us an official answer. So where is the county at with their funding? And what are the costs right now in terms of their budgeting for library? Do you know? Mr. I believe they cut a million from the library. But unfortunately at this point they're not able to answer the question I think we all want to know is how much does it cost to keep our library open for another day. So they're not able to provide that yet. But indicated they would be able to in the near future. Mr. Okay. All right. Do we have any speakers? We do. We have, I believe, five. Mr. All right. Three minutes. Okay. Nicole Nava followed by Laurie Monroe. And if you could line up in the aisle, that would be great. Good evening. So this topic is near and dear to me and I want to thank Councilwoman Tannen for bringing this up. I spent many a day every day at the library when I was a child and I was a bit of a latch kid at times. I had a mom that was working. She was working lots of hours. And it was like an escape for me for a lot of other reasons. And there are seniors that find value there. They have numerous workshops that are provided at the library on specific days that I'm sure now that will impact those free services. They have tax services to help people there. Children go there for clubs, for tutoring. People who don't have internet get to access internet there. And I think that's a great question. I think that's a great question. People who are even stopping in because they're having extreme weather issues one way or the other take refuge in there and read and sit and visit. And it just really is a good community resource. A lot of things go on there. They have the book sales and so much more. And it really did break my heart. I understood, of course, because, you know, it's standing up against the need to save, you know, firehouses and things like that. And so it was very difficult. It was a very difficult decision, I'm sure, for the county. And I want to also underscore that I get that here in the city we have competing priorities. We also have our public safety and all these other things. And we've been waiting for our roads to be repaired for so long. I'm not necessarily saying circumventing any of that. I also would appreciate if we have special types of funding such as ARPA and others that are available to tap for this. I think it would be a wonderful thing to do to be allowed to have it open for people. We're going to have to wait and see if we can get it open for the extra day or two that were taken away per week. And I think it wouldn't be a bad thing for us to also, because we have different brains power here at the city than the county does, that maybe some experts here would be aware of some additional funding opportunity stream, something coming through where we could leverage that. Even the fact that they're trying to do, like, the broadband and infrastructure thing and connect low income folks. Maybe there's some element of that. That can be explored. Is there some little nuance within that that might be able to fund it? I just think we need to think outside the box a little bit. And then maybe even connect with, I don't know if it's possible, since it is a county entity, if the, I always say it wrong, North Valley Community Foundation might have some kind of funding. Or at least to stand up a privately funded, like, the citizens who want to donate to help fill the gap. So thank you. I really, really hope we can lean into this one. And I think we have a lot of questions. And I appreciate your time. Thank you. Lori Munro, followed by Bill Munro. Hello, Council. I'm Lori Munro. I could tell you great stories about my wonderful experiences at the library. And you probably each all have them, too. So I'll just go to one thought, which was when I was looking at where to move when I was planning to move back to California in 2014, one of the things I went to was each community's library web page. So look and see what their library had to offer. And so it's really part of our community, but it's good for business to have a library that's functioning. I'll also add that while I was discussing this with a friend here in the council chambers, he mentioned that he chooses not to own a printer just because he has, he doesn't need one very often. It's not worth it for him. He has a job as an EMT, so he doesn't have access to a printer daily at work. And so I think that's a great point. And so he uses a library printer. So that's another service that's available to people. And it's harder for him because his days off don't always coincide with the library open days. Thank you. Thank you, Bill Munro, followed by Holly S. Thank you. I will ditto everything that that lovely woman had to say. And I will present my credentials. That's my library card. And one thing that's been a little bit missing from all the presentations is that I'm a library clerk. And so I think that's where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be talking about where we need to be an organization of people who grow bonsai that meet there. There's craft groups that meet there, and it's all free. All you've got to do is present your library card, and it gives you access to that room and a key, so after hours you can go in. It's a wonderful, wonderful resource. It's a true... There's Bidwell Park, and there's the library, and the university, maybe. The true gems in the city of Chico. Please do find some funding to bring back some of these open days at the library. Thank you. Thank you. Holly, followed by Katie Posey. Hi. My name is Holly Charles. I'm a local mother of three, and I work at Forest Ranch Charter School. I am an instructional aide who facilitates and actually teaches many days of classes there for resource classroom as a special ed assistant teacher, so to speak. And my original background is in working in interior architecture, and I went to graduate from UC Davis with my degree in that. You know, I grew up in kind of a blue collar home. My mother made the choice to not go to work, which was to our family's financial judgment in the 80s when most mothers were going to work because she wanted to homeschool her kids. And I find it really personal and sad, but I try to say that with grace, understanding how difficult sometimes it is for communities to figure out how to financially cover everything that's needed, and just really imploring to this council to do whatever can be done over the course of time, maybe not right now, right here, but over the course of the next few years to really prioritize the library as an important part of this community because it is. I spent the greater part of my childhood in the library. Especially going to my junior high and high school years when being homeschooled was actually pretty lonely, especially in the early 90s. And I speak for a lot of other lonely people, you know, thinking of that, thinking back to that time in our community who desperately need the library as well as just the education factor. It was a real safe haven for me to spend hours of my life. I graduated 16 years old and went on to a community college and I have ADHD that I've never treated with medication, which is fine. And I found ways to do that by not going home, but staying all night at the library until the very last second when the library was kicking me out the door because that was the way I was to make sure I got through all of my studies and could, you know, then go on to after work to go or after school to go work two jobs and pay my way through UC Davis without the help of my parents because they couldn't afford it. They were still homeschooling my other younger brothers and sisters. So all of that is to just say our public library is a tremendous resource to our young people, to our lonely people in our community or, you know, whoever it may be. I remember surfing the scholarship, national scholarship pages, you know, they have, you know, whole sections dedicated to job folders back in the day. Now that's not as necessary today, but that was a big thing at one point as well as, you know, like I said, scholarship, you know, sections, reference sections and all sorts of things. There's so many reasons why we just really need to prioritize it. And so I ask, please, if we can do that in our general fund moving forward, and I'd be glad to volunteer to be part of helping any, you know, you know, you know, ways to help raise money for the community with that. Thank you. Katie Posey is our last speaker. Thank you, Council Member Tandon for bringing this up. You all probably know where I stand on the library, but, I recognize that there's a lot of work that needs to be done. I recognize that your conversation tonight might be limited to discussing the City's participation in the group formed at the county level. But I also think it's important to identify something that I think your constituents who use and support the library want to know to what extent are you, do you want to be invested in long-term and committed support of the library? Because we know the history that the City used to, they don't any longer, and it's just the county. And as you know, this was discussed. I did go to the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. I sat through the presentation. But only 36% of counties in California have the library solely funded through the county general fund. So do you share something I think that the public would love to hear is do you share the value, the belief that cities should be supporting the library of public resource alongside the county. I'm now asking you. As some other speakers have mentioned, the library does offer as a public resource certain benefits and advantages that no other public resource does. And the research shows that libraries funded by multiple sources are the most successful. We know that many of Chico use and benefit from the library, and we're talking all socioeconomic levels. So it's vital to keep it open. And in case you, there could be 50 reasons I could go into why libraries will never be obsolete. But I only have time to go over five. So if that's something that you have thought of, will our library can be considered part of what some call a social infrastructure? This would be any physical place that allows community members to interact in a public area like libraries, parks, community gardens, so on and so forth. You heard one of the speakers mention that. Not everyone wants to read a book on an electronic device. I assure you, you could go out and take a poll. And I'd like to ask you to do that. Maybe if you have the time, ask people in Chico, do they prefer to read on an electronic device or print books? I assure you the research is showing us that people will always, there will always be many, many people that prefer print books. Libraries provide important special programs, guest speakers, book club discussions, even free classes. Those in our community that don't have a computer can use these resources at the library. And libraries allow individuals to enter and use these services. But libraries do offer services for free. And as I mentioned earlier, they offer services no one else does. So I think that the city coming alongside the county is really important. But I look forward to hearing your discussion. Whether you agree with that or not, it would be wonderful to hear your reasons. Thank you. All right. Further discussion by council. Council Member Winton. Yeah. Well. Like a lot of people who spoke here, I think the library was totally transformative in my life. And even if I don't use it all that much right now, I think back to the times I used it, it was obviously as a child learning how to read. Reading and being read to is totally transformative in people's lives. And living in a place where you don't have that opportunity is going to lead to different outcomes. When I was a teenager, I had three brothers who were all about the same age. At one point we had a two-bedroom apartment. And I was also homeless as a college student at one point. And being like privacy challenged, the library is a very unique place where it's public. You're not expected to buy anything. There's no special privilege that allows you to be there. But it's a totally peaceful place. It's one of the only places where the public is invited and people can, it's socially acceptable to shush people. There in the city council chambers. Right? Yeah. I, you know, our city council is a little bit different. Our original library that's now the history museum was a Carnegie library. Andrew Carnegie donated a bunch of money to found a bunch of libraries throughout the United States. And we have more of a history of philanthropy supporting our library. Because I have this poster of the Butte Mall. It was this 1988 fundraiser at the Chico Mall that had just opened for the library. We don't see much of that anymore. And I'm concerned that if we allow this to pass, the library to go down to four days a week. Maybe three days a week or two days a week after more budgeting at the county level in the summer. Then we could be seeing a downward spiral of interest and investment in the library. If we can't demonstrate investment at the city level, then why would private organizations or anybody else decide to kick in to keep the library open? So I think that the very least we can do is signal a commitment that we will support the library. And we will make sure that it has some sort of support from us. And that that can be something elastic in the long term depending on need. But I think it does have the value to the community. And will have long lasting impacts in the character of our community. Whether we have a good functioning library. Whether people can look up our library's webpage and find that we do support it well or not. So I thank Councilmember Tandon for bringing this up. And I will absolutely support going forward with the support. And I think that's some kind of proposal to financially support the library. Vice Mayor Munoz, you have something? Well, in general, I absolutely want to support and do whatever we can. I'd like to maybe have staff advise us on what they think we can do. I don't want to get in the habit of every time the county cuts a million dollars, we pick up a million dollars. Because that could be a super slippery slope to go down. I'd like the ad hoc committee. I would, when we get to the point of making a nomination, I'd like to have a committee. I'd love to have nominate D to serve on that committee. I'm not sure where we're at or if we're just asking staff to bring back a recommendation on what ARPA funds are available. And what we think we can do after we hear back from the county to see what it costs to run the library for a day. That's what I think I'm hearing. Yeah. I made that request to the county weeks ago in anticipation of this coming up. So I can make that a motion that we have staff bring us back a recommendation. I have a quick question though. Yeah. Or two items. Yeah. You know, I see here that, you know, the city has contributed towards the funding of the library until 2015. What happened after that? Like why the city was not contributing anything afterwards? The more important question is what happened before that. Because the county did this before. They said we're going to stop funding the library because we have to fund these other things. Because they were operating on strategy and principle. And then the city came in and picked up where they decided they wouldn't. And they knew this time when they did it again, the city would come forward and go, oh, we'll pick it up. So my question is what next? What if like, oh, let's not fund Butte County Sheriff or Butte County Jail or Butte County Behavioral Health or anything else called Butte County? And the challenge is, and I won't support the motion, whatever it is, if it has any funding with it. Because every time we do this, we're going to have to do it again. Every time. Every time outside the budget cycle, we go, okay, this is a new priority. This is a new priority. This is a new priority. We've had two strategic planning sessions where we talk about all the initiatives and all the priorities of the city. And we can prioritize it. And if everything is a priority, nothing is. We're dealing with tax money, maybe. The sewer is important. The roads are important. The police are important. The fire station is important. Understand when you say yes to anything, you're saying no to other things. Even though you're only talking about one. And this is what this is about. The county did it before. The county will do it again. The county is sitting strong saying we're not funding the library until we get our fire stations back. Because they believe that's their priority. Our council is saying, well, maybe we'll do everything. But we won't. Okay. Council Member Bennett. Thank you. Great points, as always. But I do support, I think we all support the library. I mean, that's a given. I don't know of anybody who would say, oh, no, I don't like our library. The issue here before us is lack of details relative to what it would cost or what the consideration would be. What we would be saying yes to. So I support the library. But I can't support something that I don't have a dollar amount to attach to it. There aren't enough details. City Manager Sorensen is reaching out to the county, asking questions, and trying to ascertain as much information as possible. And it's not coming back yet. And they may be waiting. I watched the supervisors meeting when they discussed this. And they're forming a game plan. Who knows? I don't know. There was no time frame during that discussion. There was no time frame. It was a concept of ad hoc committee. So we've got a whole bucket full of unknowns. And we're trying to make an intelligent decision, which we can't do, in my opinion, until we have the rest of the information. So City Manager Sorensen, if you'd like to jump in with something, that's fine. You always have great input. City Manager Sorensen Yeah. Well, I think that I don't think there's any opposing view to what you just said, that we need to understand what the price tag is. So we'll need to find that out. And then you'll need to start thinking about term. You know, we're talking, it sounds like we're talking about a supplemental this fiscal year. But then how do you want to handle it moving forward after that? So it's just something to think about. City Manager Sorensen Particularly. As we approach the 23-24 budget decision making process. Councilman Brant, over. Councilman Brant Yeah. I have another. Well, so, I mean, we all, people, Dale's and my generation, you know, we grew up learning the Dewey Decimal System. And the library was, you know, the word has this sort of reverence and magic around it. And all these little towns in the United States, they have these Carnegie libraries that were funded in the 30s. And they were a little bit more expensive than the other ones. But libraries were then, they were there for two reasons. One, you did research if you were trying to understand a topic in some depth. And secondly, it was a place to borrow books. So what I'm hearing from the people that spoke was that it's a place for high school kids to do homework. I was in a meeting with some of the supervisors on this topic. And one of the supervisors said, well, it's a place for homeless people to go when it gets to the end of the year. And he said, well, where do they go when it's time for rich people to go into poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty and poverty I don't know that that's the role of the library. So I think these things have morphed from being libraries in the sense that I understood it when I was growing up to being social centers for the community, and there's nothing wrong with any of that, but I think we have some clarity around what is the mission of the library. All right. I have a question for our esteemed leader. And you may not have these answers off the top of your head, and Jen, you may have to comment here too. So in terms of ARPA funding, ARPA funding has to be spent by 25? 26. Incumbered by 2024. Okay. And funding the library could possibly be ARPA funding. On the section, on the chunk that was considered revenue loss replacement for the general public, which was at one time about $10 million, we'd have to take a look at what's left. Yeah, correct. Okay. So, and then do we know how much ARPA funds we have left off the top of our head? No. I mean, without... With the eligible part, we would have to look into that. But off the top of my head, I'd say in excess of a million. Okay. And then the county received considerable more ARPA funds than we did, yes? Yes. Do you know how much? Do you know how much? Do you know how much they received in terms of recall? It was a big number though. I can't remember. It was much bigger than our number. Yeah. As I remember. So, and I can't recall the exact number off the top of my head, but we can Google it. Okay. Yeah, I'd be curious about answers to all those questions before we approach this. I think without a doubt, I would guess that my fellow council members agree, I think he would be a perfect person to, council member Tien, sorry, would be a perfect person to be on this ad hoc committee and have that discussion. But, you know, I think the county could get a little creative for a few years as they work on a long-term solution with some of their ARPA funds, which I'm sure they have as well. But anyway. I'd just like to add something to that. And I do understand that, so my guess is that city was helping to fund the county in these 15 years that was provided to us, right? And on, I do understand that, you know, a lot of the Chico residents use the library. So if we need to step up our game time to time when the county needs help, I would like the city to do that. Because the residents of Chico who live close in Chico use the library more. So I hope once we have those numbers, we can bring it back and have a discussion on it at that time. Want to make that motion? Yes, sir. All right. Second. Second. Motion and a second. Madam Clerk, did you get the gist of that? I was typing it all along, so yes. There you go. All right. And a second from Council Member. Council Member Bennett. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Would you mind restating the motion for me? That staff is to, when they, when staff receives additional information, which he's already reached out to, the city manager's already reached out to the county to bring back a recommendation that the ad hoc representative would be Council Member Tandon, but that we really need to bring it back after the county has provided us with more details. Thank you very much. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Item 5.6, nothing added after the posting of the agenda. Item 6, report and communications. Following reports and communication items are provided for the Council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section of the Council, under this section of the agenda unless the Council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. We'll start with this 6.1, city manager's report from. No report, Manager. Mark Sorensen? No report. Thank you very much. Item 6.2, Council Member request for since APB 1010. Council members may verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority of Council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. And I believe our first request is from Council Member Van Overbeck, monument signs for historic buildings. So. I'm going to recuse myself from this because I have an older building and I may want to participate in this so I'm going to recuse myself. Okay. Thank you. Wait for her to leave the room. I would like to start with a question for the city manager if I may. Just so I'm clear. The only thing required is a change to the sign ordinance to allow these signs, right? Is there anything else the city needs to do? Not that I'm aware of because from what you've described so far, it doesn't involve any city funding. No. It would simply be allowing it. No. We've had some debate. The sign ordinance really is silent on these signs. There's some question about their intended purpose. They don't appear to be advertising which is really what the sign ordinance targets. It doesn't really apply to informational signs or many of the various signs that are required by all kinds of different regulations. So we've had some debate whether we can get away with a, not get away with, but whether it's appropriate to use a director's opinion that this sign as defined once we have a good definition. So it appears to be exempt from the sign ordinance. And then we could add it to the list of zoning or code cleanups that we do periodically. Or we do a hard, you know, attack it as a code amendment. The other thing that I would like to add is that the city has a lot of information about the sign ordinance. And the intent is that there is a standard design format, colors, fonts, sizes. Sizes in particular and content. Yeah. And that they are informational, describing the history of older buildings. Correct. And so I'm presuming the city would want to approve that and then integrate that into the sign ordinance. Correct. Okay. So what I think we would appreciate is a good definition. I think it's a good definition of limits. Because for example, you know, I've seen what you are proposing. It was roughly, I think, 22 inches by 30 inches in one example. Yeah. So we just want to have some guard rails. We don't want somebody putting up a 10 foot by 10 foot monument sign. Right. As Jen said, that would be monumental. With their own version of history. Okay. So just a little bit of background. The idea of monument signs is that they would be attached to historical buildings to tell the story of the buildings and they would be informational in nature. And so many cities have done this, especially cities that have very interesting histories like Chico does. And so this would cost the city nothing because the building owners would pay for the signs. And they're already existing. So we would like to make this a historical building tour on the DCBA website, which has been up there for about 15 years. So the idea would be to take the buildings that are already called out and create monument signs and then mount them on the side of the building. So I would like to propose an item for the agenda to discuss the update to the city sign ordinance to allow building monument signs. All right. We have a second. Can I just maybe add some context? Okay. I think what Mark was pointing out is that perhaps we don't need to amend the code or we can do a cleanup subsequently. But to proceed with the concept that you laid out, I think it would be better just to direct staff to work with the DCBA and the historic society when they're ready to proceed. That would be the guardrails. We would just be engaged. Mr. V, we'd still have to bring it back to as a regular agenda item to even discuss it. So I mean, staff could certainly come up with some recommendations. Fair. Yeah. I'm just suggesting that I don't believe a code amendment is required to proceed. But then as the city manager pointed out, we could add some language to the code at some point in the future just to clarify how it might work. So if I may, just bring back some options from city staff to allow the historical signage. Okay. Can we add it to the agenda now? Or do we need to? Well, so if you make that motion with that change. Right. And then we'll bring back the specification and the design. Okay. Yes. So. Yes, I think that's the important part is bring back a definition of what these are. Yeah. Yeah. And I think staff could do that with DCBA pretty rapidly. And is that Mr. V? Yeah. Okay. I don't know. All right. So if you want to outline the motion now. Yeah. So the motion is I would like to agendize a discussion of to update the city sign ordinance if necessary to allow building monument signs. With recommendations from staff? With recommendations from staff. Thank you. We have a second. All right. We have a second from Council Member Tan. When you're ready. Okay. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds recused herself. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-0 with one recusal. All right. B? I don't know if I ever get to say B very often. Council Member requests B. Sorry. It's just the order of felon. Council Member Winslow requests B. Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? it was on Pine Street before, and I don't bike down Pine Street, so I hadn't really passed it by, and I just went looking for it the other day, and I didn't look at the address. I just searched all the alleys until I found it. And one thing I was struck by that's sort of aside from all the things said about hunger being an issue is that there's a beautiful garden on one alley that was not the right alley. There's a beautiful mural in another. And this community fridge, like, stands out in this. Otherwise, it's an alley parking lot of an apartment complex that the landlord has allowed a tenant to maintain this community fridge with her own labor. And it just really adds to the life and character of the area there. And I think that it is, to me, unambiguously a good thing to have, and this is just a good element in society that I think that the city ought to be encouraging. People discuss these sorts of projects. I characterize generally as small mutual aid projects, and I'm not going to go into too much detail on that. But I think that it is a good thing to have, with the intention of really impacting our society by doing more of this sort of thing. As soon as a certain level of bureaucratic regulation is put on things, it can very quickly squash out those hopes. And that's what I'm concerned about here. And that's why I phrased very broadly offering regulatory relief for these sorts of projects so that we see that in the future we're not standing in the way of people doing good deeds, simply put. Thank you. Does anybody have any questions? At this point, we want to hold off questions until it's on the agenda. So you can make the motion if you like. I'll make a motion as written to request the Council discuss granting regulatory relief to small mutual aid projects like the community fridge. Second. All right. Madam Clerk. Okay. Just a moment. Councilmember Bennett. I am open to the conversation, yes. Councilmember Morgan. No. Councilmember Tandon. I'd like to say something before I vote on that. It's definitely a sensitive topic. And I do work in the food industry. So I understand the importance of putting the food in the fridge that a stranger essentially would take out, not knowing what the ingredients are. When was it cooked? When was it cooked? If it was properly stored or not? Those are big concerns for me because I have dealt with people where they have severe allergies in my day-to-day life. Because of those concerns, I would say no. Because it's a big health concern for a lot of people if we do not regulate something like this. Okay. it's very very very difficult to keep people safe. And that's just my vote. Because of those reasons I would... Could it be clear that the discussion would be on the city regulations, not Butte County Environmental Health, which is what deals with food safety. So that as well as building code aren't really within our... We don't have the option to discuss that. We're looking at the administrative use permit fee in particular, that the city is putting. I would respectfully remind the council that this is not a discussion item. Just to agendize. No. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. Mayor Coolidge? No. Fails 3-4. And we're... And we're... And with that we will adjourn to... I have a request. Sorry. Another request. Sorry. No, no. It didn't have to be written. So... Sorry. I would just like to agendize at our next meeting if possible, due to time sensitivity, an event regarding... An event to happen in the downtown plaza. DCBA is working on a replacement event slash fundraiser that will be replacing what used to be Taste of Chico. The new event is a concert in the downtown plaza. It would include food, vendors, beer, wine, and a lineup of musicians. In order for this event to gain maximum participation, they would like to serve beer and wine, which could possibly meet a code amendment and creation of an application for alcohol and city property. So I'd just like to... If the council would indulge me in having that conversation so we could help the DCBA do fundraising for downtown. Can I ask a clarification? Yeah. Yeah. They had alcohol at the concerts on Friday night, did they not? They did, but it was in the downtown plaza. It was in a refined thing and it can't be in the park. It has to be off on the side. And so in order to do what we are looking to do, there would be... Need to be some special permits done. Currently, the city municipal code recognizes city plaza as a park and alcohol is prohibited. Period. So how they do it for the concerts is just also... They have the alcohol sales outside of the borders of the park, typically in the street. Up immediately adjacent. I didn't realize that's why it was there. Okay. So anyways, I'm asking just to time sensitivity and booking of bands and everything else that it come back if you so obliged at the next meeting. Thank you. Do we have a second? Second. All right. Okay. Council member Bennett? Yes. Council member Morgan? Yes. Council member Tandon? Yes. Okay. Council member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council member Winslow? Yes. Vice mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. And now any other council member requests? All right. Seeing none, we will move to adjourn. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Any other council members? Any other council members? Any other council members? Any other council members? Thank you.
