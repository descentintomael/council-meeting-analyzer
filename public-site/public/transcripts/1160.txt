center.  or eric gufson.  i think you have me first  and then you get amber if that'  s okay.  we will allow it.  thanks mayor council members and  vice mayor appreciate the opportunity  to speak to you tonight.  this is a quick presentation to  take a moment to capture and give  you an update on calendar year  2023 operations at genesis  otherwise known as the pallet  shelter originally.  operations that you know and  kind of our clean up operations  and outreach engagement operations.  i will start us off with a  handful of slides and give you a  quick overview and budget and  touch on improvements we are  making now and touch on some of  the public spaces we have cleaned  in calendar year 2023 and discuss  outreach engagement operations  and we will hand it to amber for  genesis operator report.  that'  s an aerial of the pallet shelter  in january of 2022.  this is an aerial taken yesterday  so you see after two years of  operation looks pretty good.  looks very similar not a whole  lot has changed other than a few  amenities and of course vehicles  parked there that belong to  occupants and staff.  i wanted to touch on some of the  budget and this is these are very  large numbers and these capture  everything we budgeted for full  capacity of 377 occupants and as  you know we can'  t see  the number of occupants in the  we have double occupancy in each  individual pallet shelter.  a handful of them are double  occupied though there'  re some couples and friends and  roommates and i believe it'  s about 20% of the current  occupancy 20% of them are double  occupied.  i wanted to note this is not to  exceed full amounts of full  occupancy of 377 units.  it includes our outreach and  engagement and maintenance staff  and the site operator toilets and  hand washing stations that are  provided at the site and of course  utilities that we don'  t have a whole lot of control  over but we are trying to implement  maybe some solar pv off site that  might offset the genesis monthly  utility costs itself.  we'  re working on everything we  could possibly do to reduce costs.  as i said earlier the site'  s not fully occupied and we do  everything we can to come in under  budget so you can see the site  operator continually comes in under  $2.5 million in the budget in  2023 is 27% i noted it as a 27%  decrease.  what that notates is 27% under  the budget amount.  food service under budget by 35%.  city staff continues to be under  budget.  originally we anticipated two  senior maintenance workers to  support genesis operations we  found we'  re able to get by with one.  as you know through the 23-24  year plan citywide that'  s been a fantastic addition to  our public works o&m staffing  augments so we'  re able to reduce that  cost that genesis.  we'  re also currently operating our  outreach and engagement staff  with only one fte.  we'  re done with the very large  encampments the 100 or so people  at comanche creek the 120 people  at wind chime park and now we'  re really just focused on smaller  encampments so we'  ve been able to operate that  function with just one fte.  one person one full time  equivalent.  public works o&m provides direct  oversight for that individual and  of course the outreach engagement  component is also overseen by the  genesis center through their  licensed social workers so we'  ve been able to reduce those  costs as well.  one of the things we'  re working on is some  improvements is part of the big  contractual cost is the shower  and laundry requirement that is  agreement that is part of the  settlement agreement currently  those functions are contracted  out and we have a contract that  brings large trailers in on a  daily basis and provides those  services for us.  we'  re looking to insource those  functions and we were able to  purchase some sanitation units  that provide showers and we also  were able to purchase a laundry  laundry services that we expect  we anticipate saving about 50% of  those costs so 50% of 452,000  that'  s budgeted for showers and  laundry services.  that'  s a picture of the sanitation  units some of the site improvements  that we'  ve made recently those units are  there.  we had to of course include  drainage sewer connections ada ramps and surface  improvements to make sure we can  accommodate ada accessibility.  those are online and in service now  some good improvements to genesis.  they are somewhat complicated to  install it'  s not just putting a  portable restroom down it'  s basically like landing a  residential house you have to bring  utilities power water all of that to  these units those are complete now  and ready to be put in service in the  coming weeks.  we'  ve had a lot of  improvements to the !  we'  ve had a lot of improvements to You've seen these before, just some of the spots that we've cleaned in calendar year 2023. That's kind of the end of the cul-de-sac on Alba Avenue facing the State Route 99. That is the 99 bike path, if you  history history history history  history history history history  the city.  The picture on the left really  depicts the level of trash and  debris we commonly see in these  encampments. That could happen  in a matter of days. It'  s astounding how  quickly that level of trash  accumulates and of course after  your public works crews clean  it that'  s what it looks like on the  right-hand side.  This is at tigard ponds very  typical to what we see. We'  ve cleaned that area a couple  of times. A tent on the left  hand side and then we have a  clean that area up again once  that tent and some of the debris  was removed.  Depot park before and after.  Depot park we'  re currently in the  rehabilitation stages right now.  We'  ve repaired tremendous  electrical issues, tons of  irrigation issues. The next step  is to trim the trees and we'  re waiting for it to dry out  a little bit so we can get  equipment in there to trim the  trees. We'  construction in depot park along  with a half basketball court. We'  re designing those now and look  forward to delivering those  improvements here in the coming  months.  This is lindow channel. Somewhere  in lindow channel just kind of a  draw looking downward to the  channel and then the after pick  is from the channel looking  upwards. Again that'  s just the typical  amount of debris that we see in  some of these encampments.  2023 totals we removed 4200  cubic yards of debris, 612 tons  or 1.2 million pounds from city  spaces including greenways, parks  and just general city right away.  I wanted to touch on the outreach  and engagement functions. That'  s our outreach and engagement  staff member Brian Whitley  depicted in the right there  performing services in the  downtown area. I can'  t say enough good things  about Brian. He'  s a fantastic individual,  really cares about chico, cares  about the job, loves what he'  s doing and performs at a very  high level. He'  high level. In 2023 he provided  210 individual assessments  offering suitable shelter through  all of those assessments.  That includes an assessment  includes sitting down getting to  know the person kind of building  a trusting relationship asking a  series of questions and then  assigning them a shelter bed  that'  s available. It'  s quite the process and  Brian does an extremely good job  at that.  year.  The outreach and engagement  approach is shifting.  We'  re no longer face with  these very large encampments  where there'  s 100 plus people.  There'  re smaller encampments  that our intent is to proactively  jump on as soon as we see one  pop up.  We'  ll see one tent on a  Tuesday in the same area by  Thursday there'  s four or five.  I understand there'  there's safety in numbers so these you know some of these areas will multiply  rather quickly so our intent is to really proactively jump on these  locations and provide an individual assessment before they grow larger so  that's kind of we're just shifting our approach from an outreach and  engagement standpoint there are challenges moving forward as you know  counsel you know we've been in active litigation over the last on four months  now which is extremely frustrating just trying to layer in some improvements at  the alternate site to clean it layer in some some some basic rules to better  manage it and to also deal with areas that we've previously enforced and we  continue to see impacts people coming back in so you know I just want to note  that for the public and say is about as much as I can under the restrictions  that the court has given us to you know we're not really able to talk about this  a whole lot until we get a direct order or a  direct motion which we feel is coming rather quickly  so  history  I just wanted to say that for the public's benefit that we're aware that, you know,  these areas that were previously enforced and clean are becoming impacted again,  and we're playing a little bit of whack-a-mole,  and we're hoping for some resolve very soon to be able to approach that a little bit differently  and make some forward progress.  And it's, you know, we continually get objections from the Plaintiffs' Council,  that's Legal Services of Northern California, that just really, unfortunately,  it's seemingly one of the obstruct and prolonged forward progress.  So we're working through those constantly, and it is an arduous process, as you all know.  So those are the two calendar year totals that we have.  So in 2022, we assessed 331 individuals and cleaned up a little over a million pounds of trash.  In 2023, we assessed 210 individuals and cleaned up 1.2 million pounds of trash.  For a total of 541 people that received an individual assessment and were offered suitable shelter,  and then we cleaned up.  And then we cleaned up 2.3 million pounds of trash, or close to 1,200 tons from city spaces.  And again, this is not including 2024 year-to-date.  This is just capturing 2022 and 2023 calendar years.  So with that, I would like to bring up Amber Abney-Bass, which, where is she?  She was right behind me.  There she is.  I can turn around far enough.  It's always a pleasure to introduce Amber.  I've had the opportunity to do.  I do it often as we give these presentations.  And I will just say that Amber is a fantastic partner with the Jesus Center as our site operator.  We could not do it without her.  She's great.  We throw her a lot of work, and she continually accepts it and does it and performs at a very high level.  So we're very pleased with the partnership, and I really appreciate it.  And thank you for being here.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council.  Appreciate the opportunity.  I'm so happy to just update you guys.  Eric gets to talk about all the rough stuff, and I think that I get the pleasure of being able to really just help both, you know, the group that are with us tonight here in this room, but also at home, just really understand what's going on at the site.  I just wanted to provide a little bit of a background.  We opened the site on April 25th of 2022.  This presentation that you're seeing is through March 31st of 2024.  So that capsules.  And history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history  So that group is working hard to take a look at the site, provide input, and, you know,  just be able to have some impact, I think, on the experience that they're having.  Same key partners that we opened up with, which are Behavioral Health, the Department of Employment and Social Services.  We have the vendor on site that provides shower and laundry services.  AMPA's mobile medical unit is also at the site.  We have the manger clinic who focuses on providing services to people with pets that are experiencing homelessness.  We also have Narcotics Anonymous that comes out to the site.  We are currently in conversation as a result of some of those meetings with the community council to also add in Alcoholics Anonymous.  So we're excited to be starting to bring those folks out as well and into the conversation.  Just a little bit of a deeper dive.  In these groups from Behavioral Health, I think this is a common question.  Who from Behavioral Health is going out there?  What are their frequency?  What are they doing?  And these two slides are just intended to sort of break into that a little bit more.  It is not, it is rather uncommon for us to not see somebody from one  of Behavioral Health's teams during a weekday out of the site.  They're very actively engaged.  As a result of that, you can see that those teams represent 338 encounters with occupants at the site.  They provided 100 resources.  And they have been able to serve 77 unique individuals that are living at the site since we opened.  Keep in mind that Behavioral Health is a service that comes out.  They cannot compel anybody.  And so they come out.  They make a good effort.  They have a sheet on the counter that allows people to be able to sign up.  They follow up.  But they, you know, there is a space in which they have to have people come to them for services.  And this is a very good number of people that have been able to engage.  That I think that we can safely assume this number would be much lower if people were still experiencing homelessness in our public spaces.  Again, just a brief explanation of the Department of Employment and Social Services.  Those, that particular agency shows up out at the site in two ways.  The homeless and housing team.  These guys come out.  They've seen 191 clients at the site.  They've reviewed 246 cases.  And they've assessed 92 people.  For housing.  Again, an important number to see what people's intent and interests are while they're out there.  The eligibility team from DESC.  Those are really resources.  These are the kinds of things that we need people to get engaged with so they have the ability to move towards independence.  So they have been able to see 313 clients at the site.  They work on common things such as CalFresh applications.  Medi-Cal applications.  And then also we've got 121 clients.  And then we have a number of other services that we've been able to get involved with.  And we've also been able to get people out at the site who have applied for general assistance.  These are all critical services for people as they're improving their health and moving on hopefully into their own version of housing.  The shower and laundry vendor out there you can see is very busy over the last couple of years.  Lots of folks out there showering and taking advantage of the access to laundry.  The mobile medical unit from AMPA.  Continues to be out there.  Alternating Thursdays and Fridays which typically works out to about four days a month barring illness, schedule conflicts, or those sorts of things.  And they've been able to provide services to 88 people on site.  Again, this population is not a population that naturally is proactive in their physical health.  And so these are very important things to see.  We're trying to get people engaged so that they can also reduce their impact on the emergency department.  This is the clinic.  You'll see a couple slides down.  We have a very robust number of pets at the site.  So this is just an indication of how critical these services are.  You know, the people who come out and provide these services are volunteers.  And they rely on donated or leftover vaccinations and other items that support the work that you see listed here.  And so I will just say that while there have been ten clinics out there in the last two years, those folks work very hard.  And would certainly show up more if they had more resources to be able to help.  And then they also refer out to vets if they come across a more serious situation with an animal.  So this is an interesting slide.  I brought this in last year because I really wanted to be able to help tell the story.  We recognize that with the accessibility challenges of the site that oftentimes the public may feel a bit removed from the site.  I appreciated Mr. Gustafson including the slide from yesterday's aerial because I think it gives everybody an idea that we're not recycling an animal.  So I think it's important to be able to share that image and setting an example out there of what it looked like two years ago when our friends at the county and the commitment here from the city invested in this project.  And using that, the site continues to be maintained I think very well.  But this site really is a reflection of what goes on there.  And when we have or are in need of help from first responders, what does that look like?  I think it also sort of speaks to some of the behavior, perhaps concerns that our community may have.  This year, we're going to be able to share some of the information that we have.  So I'm going to go ahead and show you the calls for service.  And I intentionally broke this out between year one and year two.  We have had 200 occupants at the site, 200 or more, since February of last year.  And so this is representing a rather large group of folks.  We had 168 calls for service in year two, which was just slightly over year one.  And again, probably doubling in terms of census.  You can see there why under that medical call column.  So we're using the numbers as having AMPLA and getting people engaged in those services is really important.  The single largest source of calls that we have out there for first responders are medical calls.  Animal control calls staying obviously very flat.  We have a large number of 911 hangup calls.  I'm not quite sure what's attributing to that.  But when you look at 168 calls for service and you take 33 out of there, you can see that the cost and the need for folks to come out there  and assist the on-site staff remains pretty low.  Follow-up, meaning that there's something that perhaps the police department, the sheriff's department, we've had some CHP,  just following up on incidents.  Those could be off-site.  They could be witnesses involved in a case.  Any of those kinds of things is that category of follow-up or informational only.  Welfare checks.  We have a fair number of people who have come into shelter.  And this is typical at both of our other shelters as well.  That oftentimes family members aren't quite sure where somebody has landed.  And so they put out a welfare check.  And so sometimes they'll come out.  We'll get a call from PD and they're just wanting to confirm whether or not they're there.  That's typically the type of welfare check that we're talking about here.  Complaints.  That just means that we need some help.  And then other, I broke these out also because this really speaks to only nine of these calls are actually ones that our staff has initiated  because we have people on this site that are refusing to leave.  So I just really wanted to highlight the level of compliance that I feel like we see from folks when they get to the site.  Do have 12 incidents of domestic violence on the site.  Sharing 64 square feet can, as I'm sure we all understand who are partnered, can be a challenge for folks from time to time.  So what do all those numbers say?  We have had, since opening, we have had 368 people spend at least one night at the shelter.  Those are tremendous numbers.  We just looked at the number of folks who have been assessed for shelter here in the city of Chico.  And I think that's a very high number of folks that have chosen to come in.  As of March 31st, we had 205 occupants.  We have 101 pets.  91 dogs and 10 cats.  And we run generally about 27 to 29% double occupied.  So we do have really good numbers.  Of people sharing units.  But again, that presents some challenges at only 64 square feet.  And I previously mentioned that we have had over 200 people since February of last year.  As of today, we had 203 occupants at the site.  And I believe our available units is at 24.  The right side of the slide is really interesting to me because it lets us know when people come in, it's great that people are coming in.  We've had 368 people.  But once we get to the bottom of it, we're going to have a lot of people.  And how long do they stay?  And how long do they stay?  And how long do they stay?  And how long do they stay?  And how long do they stay? I know that this site was developed quickly and it was developed in such a way that you know We had a lot of competing interests  And how long do they stay?  And how long do they stay?  And how long do they stay?  And how long do they stay?  And how long do they stay?  And how long do they stay?  We know the longer they stay, the healthier they are, the less comfortable they're going to be if they do end up leaving the site, either by their choice or by our request.  And the hope is that those folks will want to come back and come back rather quickly.  So this sort of gives you an idea.  We have had the average length of stay is 341 days, again, against 706 days of operations.  I think those are very encouraging numbers.  We've had 254 people at the site.  Sixty-nine percent of the current occupants were there for at least 180 days.  So they spent six months at the site.  And then it just goes down.  Obviously, you can track 145 people or 39 percent were there for one year.  And then I like to see this, 78 percent that were there for a year and a half.  We're always trying to track what's the right amount of time for people.  And I think that we're just finally getting to the spot where we're.  We're really starting to see people settling, people engaging in services, people sort of getting tired of being there, which is not offensive to us at all.  It means that they've grown through that and they've just got themselves in a much healthier state than when they arrived.  And they're starting to think about life ahead of them, which they likely weren't doing when they came in.  These are always the slides that people ask about.  These are very consistent with slides if you were to review sort of the pit count in the county.  Or even just looking at the national homelessness numbers in terms of demographics.  Very consistent.  We have served 14 veterans out at the site since we opened.  And so I always want to make sure that we acknowledge them.  Case management.  We have had so far 330 unique people engaging in case management that has resulted in 232 renewals.  This is really where the hard work is for our staff.  Again, in a low barrier model, we are not able to require case management.  So this is where motivational interviewing, really building rapport, relationships being consistent and showing up is really coming through with our staff.  Everybody always wants to know when people are coming in what do they look like.  This slide will give you an idea of that.  Just under half report struggling with a substance use disorder.  And that could either be single alcohol, substance abuse, or in some cases, both of those.  We also have a very low number of occupants that come in with reportable income.  And you can see I broke this out this year to show that just 60 of the occupants that have been out at the site have had a level of income that could make them able at intake to be able to qualify for some of the affordable housing when units become available.  So that speaks a little bit to what people may think is a little bit of a trickle for people getting out into housing.  But this just shows you the complexity of what people are dealing with in order for that to happen.  So 98% of the folks out there are reporting as being chronically homeless.  This is another reason why when you have 368 people come through, you're not going to have triple digit numbers in the first year.  And obviously now into the second year of people getting into housing.  There's a lot of things to unpack.  There's a lot of things to address and get services.  But people are doing work out there.  So it's exciting.  It's coming.  It's coming.  What are expectations are based on how people are presenting when they come in.  This is another one.  Sometimes people are interested for the people that come into shelter, what's it like for them and why did they leave?  I know that there have been some questions, narratives out in terms of the, you know, the site.  Just different pieces of that.  Is the site safe?  Are people experiencing violence out there?  Are people behaving?  This will just give you an idea of the most common reasons why people are leaving.  And as in year one, that most common reason is that people are failing to return.  That means that they've checked in, that they've left the site and have not checked back in or made contact with a staff member for that minimum 72 hours.  At that time, we make that unit available for somebody else in need.  The good news is, is that generally about half of the people that fail to return to the site, they're not going to be able to return to the site.  So we do end up coming back.  Again, back to that other piece where we have to help people build muscle of how to be moving out of public spaces and being in a community like Genesis.  So this gives you guys an idea of what's going on out there.  Behavior violations, I did a brief description there across the bottom so that people can sort of understand what we're talking about.  And one of the good slides tonight is definitely the acknowledgements.  I do want to invite everybody to celebrate that we have had 18 people from this site.  And we're going to have a lot of people from this site move into permanent housing.  Some of that has been delayed by some of the affordable housing projects in town.  It's been particularly fun for occupants who formerly had services at Park Avenue, the Park Avenue Jesus Center location,  who have recently been approved for housing foundations, which is the affordable housing project that Jamboree is nearing completion on.  So we have many others that are approved for housing.  But as of now, these are the folks who have moved out and moved on into their own housing.  And we're going to have a lot of people move out.  And also, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that since we opened,  that we have had five active participants at the site who passed away while they were actively at the site for a variety of health complications.  One of those was at the site.  The other four were offsite at the time of their death.  But I do want to just take a moment and just acknowledge them as well.  And that is my presentation.  And if any of you all have questions, I will do my best.  All right.  Any questions from council?  All right.  Council Member T'N.  Thank you for bringing us this information, Amber.  You know, in the second last slide, you talked about the violence went from year one, eight incidences to 22 in the year two.  Could you talk about that a little bit?  And how you and your staff are working to control that?  Yeah.  I think the biggest contributor to that growth is really just in our size.  When I stood up here last year, we had much lower numbers in terms of the census.  Now we have had a larger census for a longer period of time.  We often talk at community council meetings what it is like for the people who came in in the beginning,  who were starting to stabilize, and how they feel a bit often disrupted by new people coming in  who haven't maybe quite figured out the site.  We do have social disputes there that sometimes do lead to violence.  As I mentioned in one of my other slides, we have a, you know, I think probably a normal number of domestic violence-related incidents.  We rely on those occupants to follow up on those.  Obviously, the majority of those are seen out of the site of staff, and so we rely on them.  We offer those folks services.  You know, catalyst domestic violence.  And I think that the Department of Health and Human Services and Survivor Services is obviously a partner that we would regularly refer to.  But I think in terms of violence, the climb there, it really just speaks to the number of people out at the site.  All right.  Vice Mayor?  I don't have a question, but I just wanted to give a quick thank you to you and your board members and to the county for following through on promising,  you know, the county for following through on promising to come out when we built this.  And I think that the staff, your staff, the numbers here are amazing, and the transparency for the public to know,  because there is a lot of money being put into this.  And we are continually investing in our community, and to see that how much healthier somebody can be when they're in an environment where they're stabilized,  and to be given that opportunity, I just think it's a great thing.  So thank you for showing everything that you guys are doing, and thank you to staff for looking for all of the ways you can to save money.  I am curious.  It just astonishes me, though, on the second year that we have more refuge than we did on the first year with like half as many people or something like that.  That just, so I don't, I wish we could find a way to not have as much garbage taken into our parks, but, and open spaces.  But thank you for everything you guys are doing.  I just want to acknowledge that.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you.  My staff works very hard.  All the credit to them who are not up here in this joyous moment being able to do this.  And I just want to thank you for that.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, thank you.  And yes, thank you to your staff.  We realize that you're the leader here, and a lot of the work comes from them as well.  So we want to thank you all for doing it.  Fantastic.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right.  And with that, we will move on to the consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda can be considered routine in nature and therefore can be enacted in one motion.  Do we have any speakers on consent?  No speakers.  Council, no votes.  Disqualification?  Entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  We have a motion.  Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Public comments.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed  on the agenda and within the jurisdiction's authority.  Council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have three.  Three votes.  Okay.  And if you, when I call your name, if you could go ahead and line up in the middle aisle.  Lynn Haskell followed by Adam Fadela.  Good evening, Council.  Thank you for your service.  And I'm just here to follow up on a comment that was made at the last meeting from a speaker  about beautifying Chico downtown 28 empty buildings with the vinyl wraps.  So I don't, you know, so people come up here with brilliant ideas and they kind of fall  on the floor.  I'm asking you to pick it up and move it along.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Adam Fadela followed by Bill Monroe.  Good evening, Council.  Thank you for serving as always.  Just wanted to bring attention to Council Member Winslow.  I'm a member of the Council for the Manchi Creek Greenway.  In light of Mr. Gustafson's presentation and Amber's presentation, camping has started  to fire back up in there.  We have volunteers from the department, Amber, that are going there every Friday doing trash  pickup, maintenance, you know, whatever, nicky-nacky things.  And then I have my friend, Liz Stewart, counting nine new camps.  So my question is, do we still have a lot of people that are going to the Manchi Creek  Greenway?  And I know that you're going to be doing a lot of regular patrolling in the greenway.  The target team was keeping it pretty close to the island, close to cleanup, the rangers  were as well.  So I have that question, and then also just wanted to bring it to your attention.  The greenway took an awful beating, as you all know.  It's a special place in my heart because I was heavily involved with many other people  to get it created.  So if you could pay attention, that would be all I would ask.  Thank you very much.  MS.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Bill Monroe.  MR.  Hello.  Thank you, counsel.  Bill Monroe, retired public health nurse.  The slides that I saw of the appellate shelter where it really is being maintained well,  but there isn't an ounce of green there.  I don't know if you noticed.  There are no trees.  There are no plants.  There are no flowers.  There's no grass.  And I think that's a very important thing.  I think that everyone involved, including the 90 dogs, would very appreciate it if there  were maybe some planters with trees and flowers.  Wouldn't be too expensive.  Have to water it.  But it's a matter of the environment and feeling good about yourself, which I think is part  of the process of moving people out of the appellate shelter and into their own homes.  And so just to I think it would be a good investment to have some of that.  But history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history  for all the people in that area  that'  s all overflowing all the  time. We happen to own a condo  with an equivalent in a place  where he is on the board of that  condo. We don'  t live in the condo but we own  it and rent a condo space. The  company who services their  dumpster insists on emptying the  dumpster at least three to four  times a week. The condo  association has to pay for that.  It'  s the equivalent number of  people living in that condo as  is in that shelter area. Either  get an extra dumpster out there  or pay to have it emptied three  to four times a week.  thank you.  thank you everybody. We will  move on to public hearings.  Item 4.1.  hearing.  to consider the 2024-25 draft  annual action plan for the use  of federal community block  development block grant cdgb  and home investment partnership  home phones. We have a report  from mary jo alfonso housing  program analyst. That'  s a mouthful. There you go.  The floor is yours.  mary jo alfonso housing program  s a mouthful. There you go.  good evening mayor, vice  mayor and council members. I'  m before you tonight to present  the draft 2024 draft annual  plan for the public hearing.  This is required for the use of  the federal funding from the  department of housing and urban  development who I will refer to  as hud. The purpose of the plan  the city is an entitlement  community for the cdbg funds and  we are considered a participating  jurisdiction with the home funds.  And funds are annually allocated  by a formula based on the  number of demographic and social  economic factors of our area and  the funds assist the city in  addressing the needs of low income  households and neighborhoods in  our community. Every five years  a consolidated plan is developed  with broad goals that are to be  achieved over the subsequent five  years. The plan before you today  is the fifth and final year of  our current consolidated plan.  And the main priority needs  include affordable housing and  housing for the city.  housing, homelessness prevention,  homelessness services,  neighborhood revitalization and  economic development.  Due to the delayed release of  the federal budget we are still  awaiting the final hud allocations.  That being said we did assume  flat funding for both of our  funding sources so you will see  that shown here on this slide.  A more detailed summary of both  the cdbg and the home budgets is  that the proposed budget is  based on the staff report as  attachment c and also included in  several places in the actual plan.  The proposed annual plan is  drafted by staff based on project  activities and goals that are  established in that five year  consolidated plan and also within  the city's housing element in  order to satisfy both federal and  state priorities. As detailed in  the proposed budget a lion's share  of the cdbg and home funding is  going towards a habitat for  humanity project which will be  getting underway. It's located on  city owned land and has been in  the development pipeline for several  years. The city has a vested interest  in supporting the completion of this  project. Next I'll go over briefly  the activities that are proposed  for the home funds. This includes  like I said the habitat for  humanity. This is at Wisconsin.  It will be five units for  homeowners. The city also is  proposing a project for the  cdbg and the housing authority  provide housing funding for  tenant based rental assistance  which is provided through the  housing authority. It's administered  through the housing authority.  We've set aside some funding for  rental development in the future  as well as a set aside for  program administration of the  grant. Proposed activities for  cdbg. There's an overall,  there's a broader range of  eligible activities. But they  are all funded through the  housing authority. So our draft  plan includes funding for housing  programs and projects that include  the sewer connection and associated  program delivery costs. We've been  doing that program for a few years  now. Also includes funding for  onsite and offsite improvements  for habitat. Housing services  which includes  the TBER  administration and then  economic activities which are  administered by the small  business development center at  Butte college. We also fund  economic development or sorry  code enforcement services and low  and moderate income census blocks.  And then program administration  which includes general program  administration of the grant.  We fund up to four  or at least four housing trainings  or workshops for community  members. And then  some funding for administrative  support for the regional COC.  And the  final planned activity for the  CDBG funding is for public services.  The funding recommendations for  these funds come from the CDBG  ad hoc citizens advisory committee.  Those members are selected by the  city's finance committee. They  hold two public hearings and the  first is to hear applicant  presentations and then present the  recommendations for the public  service funding to you as part of  our annual plan.  Where am I?  And then the committee's  recommendations were made based  on their review of applications.  They utilized a rating and ranking  sheet. Presentations were made by  the applicants and consideration  was made of the individuals that  those organizations serve within  our community. The committee came  to a unified consensus of funding  the top six scoring applicants  based on a 100 point scale. You  can see on the spreadsheet on the  left hand side, we have a  chart of the top scoring, the  top six scoring applications are  listed as receiving funding. And  in the middle right, you can see  what the proposed funding  recommendation amounts are. I  will say that because we don't  have final allocations yet, these  are proposed numbers and I'm  hoping that when I come back next  month, we'll have the final numbers  and this will all be set. But  contingency plans have been placed  in the annual plan depending on  where our allocations are.  make those adjustments in the  Outreach to the public of the  annual plan has been made through  notices in the paper. It's been  posted on the city's website. It's  been shared at different community  meetings, shared via email. We  have the public hearing tonight.  This opens what we call the 30  day public comment period where  the public can comment and submit  comments to staff. And then we  will have one final public hearing  tonight.  I'll let you go ahead and  Like I said, the draft plan is  available on the city's website,  on our housing website. In there,  you can also email housing staff  any comments that the public may  have. And at the conclusion of  tonight's public hearing, the  community development director  recommends council schedule a  final hearing of the annual plan  at the May 21st council meeting.  This concludes my report and I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.  All right, questions?  Councilman?  Yeah, so there's no organization  that's done more, well let me back up.  One of the organizations that's  done the most to help  this city deal with homelessness is  the Jesus Center. And again this year  you don't have them on the list.  Why is that?  The city didn't, we didn't receive a  grant application from that organization.  That's a good reason.  Yes.  All right, any other questions?  Councilman Winslow.  I'm curious, I mean kind of on that  vein of thought, except I did look  at the thing and I saw who applied. I saw the only  organization with the least ask,  the only one that received no funding was Safe Space.  I was wondering if there's any particular  reason why their scoring came up lower  or was that an action of the  advisory committee?  Yeah, so the advisory committee,  the members, they  there's a scoring  that's used.  Which is presented to all the applicants  when they apply. They already know  what the scoring looks like. And so  the committee  uses that when they read through applications  and score them. Staff  does kind of a purview,  review just to make sure that they  that the applicant  meets all the federal requirements.  And then everyone that does  goes through the committee.  And so after the review of the committee  you'll see the consensus  just by the scoring rate.  They rated pretty low.  There were a couple  different reasons why those four shares  of Safe Space at the time that  the funding recommendations were  given at that March 7th meeting.  There's  just, there was a lack of  background material that was needed  for the application.  I did reach out  to the executive director and offer  you know, additional  information for them.  Thank you.  I think that the scoring rubric  and that, I don't think that's something we were provided with  this year. But I appreciate the explanation.  Yeah.  It came to council a few months  ago.  Yeah, it is available on our website.  So I...  Alright.  Further questions?  Thank you very much.  Alright, we'll go ahead and open the public hearing.  How many speakers? We have one.  Alright. Three minutes. Adam Fideli.  Good evening.  Good evening again.  I want to put my  military hat off for a second.  Does everybody remember the  chicken mortgage  subsidy program?  Yes?  Madison does.  I'm glad I didn't have to  I was wondering, I don't know if this is appropriate or not at this point, but if we could carve some money out to restart that program that used to be offered by the city, used to get about 30 people a year into a home.  People that are on the edge, you know, and being able to qualify worked really well.  It was a second mortgage, you know, with no charge.  And if you kept the mortgage long term, eventually it would disappear.  It would be title.  Many people took advantage of that.  And with affordability being what it is, inventory remains low.  Prices keep climbing.  So there's a lot of people out there that could benefit if we were able to use some CDBG funds to bring that back.  And it's been gone for a long time, so I just thought I'd bring it up.  Thanks very much.  Thank you.  All right.  And with that, we will close.  Thank you.  Thank you. All right, what that we will close public hearing and entertain a motion or do we need a motion we just have to I Think this be as Mary Jo announced it begins the 30-day comment period will come back  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  pertaining to permitting of  commercial cannabis businesses.  in order to manufacture  cannabis products currently in  the city code you need a type 6  or 7 license.  it'  s been proposed on March  4 the internal affairs committee  discussed adding type n and type  p licenses and using infusion and  p as packaging to allow the  manufacturer of cannabis products  and require those businesses to  begin operations within three years.  the committee voted 3-0 to recommend  that the council approve the change  to the code as well as amend the  code to fix some typographical errors.  questions from the  committee members?  i don'  t have any questions i think i would  just point out that this is not changing  what' s happening with the cannabis  industry really in chico it was an  oversight the way that it was done the  first time and it'  s just allowing people that we  gave manufacturing licenses currently  to actually they can make the product  right now but they can'  t package it and get it out the door so  it'  s just more of a house  tidying thing than doing a drastic  ve changed anything that'  s happening on cannabis so i  just wanted to put that on the record  if anybody was concerned about that.  okay.  so you guys had any more questions?  no?  i just had a question about your  recommendations so there'  s three recommendations you  recommended us approving all three of  those?  well if you include the two types  of new manufacturing and the three  years to begin operations after the  license yeah that'  s three.  there'  s a type of graphical  letters in there.  right.  how many speakers?  we don'  t have any.  all right entertain a motion.  move to approve.  second.  second motion is seconded.  third point of  agreement.  okay council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  yes.  council member tandon.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor reynolds.  yes.  council member coolidge.  aye.  carry 7-0.  all right.  move on to item 5.2.  back to you guys again.  internal affairs committee  recommendation community benefits  agreement with commercial cannabis  businesses.  what have you guys been talking  about lately?  all right.  council member van overbeck.  you'  re going to get the wrong  impression about what i do with  my recreational products.  m already starting.  so under the current  recommendation of the  city code there'  s a community  benefits agreement that  provides the commercial cannabis  businesses pay the city 5% of  revenue currently that is payable  annually and the suggestion was  to alter the codes so that the  payments will be made 60 days  after the end of every quarter.  and the committee voted 3-0 to  approve.  okay.  questions?  so just payments coming more  often.  and quarterly.  quarterly rather than yearly.  quarterly payments rather than  monthly.  yes.  speakers?  none.  entertain a motion.  move to approve.  second.  motion on the second  item.  clerk, point your hand.  okay.  council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  yes.  council member tandon.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor reynolds.  aye.  mayor coolidge.  aye.  council member kerry.  7-0.  you guys just want to take  the next one.  just kidding.  just kidding.  all right.  bell mayor.  special planning area approach.  and we have a report from  community development director  brandon b.  oh.  mayor, vice mayor, council.  let me pull this up real quick.  okay.  thank you.  so at your february 20th meeting  as part of the approval of the  history history history history  history history history history  history history history history history history history history history history history  The area is located outside the  city limits within our sphere of  influence that means any future  development in the area would  require annexation. Our 2030  general plan has a land use  diagram and on that diagram it  identifies five areas as special  planning areas or spas. Those  areas were identified because they  have significant new growth  potential that require more  detailed subsequent land use  planning. The areas are  Belmure, diamond match,  Delmel honey run, north chico  and south Fentler. The map is  for your reference and focusing  on Belmure.  For each spa the general plan  includes a conceptual land use  plan notice the bobs and not  clean lines that follow parcels  illustrating one way the spa  could be comprehensively planned  with land use designations. The  conceptual land use plan for Belmure  includes low density residential  and secondary open space. In  addition in the general plan you  can see text taken from the  general plan on the screen and  it highlights existing conditions  but also the planning focus. I  have highlighted some key  considerations including the fact  that the area has already been  developed. Planning efforts will  focus on single family residential  development and planning for  Belmure will include the strategic  provision of infrastructure that  facilities for single family  residential development. I want to  give you context from the general  plan. The Belmure spa has  characteristics that are  significantly different than the  four other special planning areas  which make master planning less  critical or achievable. Including  first unlike the other spa's which  have more consolidated ownership  the Belmure spa includes 240  a sufficient property interest to  be able to proceed with planning  of the entire area. Unlike the  other spa's that require involved  land use infrastructure and  environmental planning the issues  in Belmure are generally  infrastructure related. You can  see sewer and storm drain lines  that are part of the city  Belmure spa has experienced very  active one acre subdivision  development under county  jurisdiction over the past 10 years.  This is a slide you may remember  from the presentation earlier this  year. These parcels will be served  by septic which makes future sewer  main installation less cost effective  and less likely to move beyond those  developments. Finally unlike the other  spa's there is no mix of residential  and nonresidential land uses required.  It is acknowledged that the area will  build out solely with single family  residences in addition to the existing  card neighborhood park and chico  unified school state. So single family  development can continue to occur in  the county jurisdiction at very very  low densities or under city  jurisdiction at densities ranging  from two to seven units per acre.  So again the most critical planning  issues associated with Belmure are  related to infrastructure. So in order  to promote council's direction of  future growth of Belmure in a  contiguous and orderly fashion staff  is recommending the following approach.  First one remove the Belmure area from  the spa policy framework shown in the  general plan. Two pre-zone again not  re-zone but pre-zone because it is not  in the city and designate all parcels  for low density single family  development. Three conduct a city led  analysis of infrastructure needs to  support development including sewer  storm drain and traffic circulation.  The estimated cost of the development  is approximately $300,000. The funding  source would most likely be general  fund which would be requested through  the budget process. However I would say  staff would look to investigate  opportunities for cost recovery from  future benefiting parcels. And four  finally city support for future  development consistent with the single  family zoning and annexation proposals  that are contiguous to the city. I'm  available for any questions but in  summary we're looking to extract it from  that special planning area and just  thank you.  Mr. Viggo, it strikes me that this  should never been designated as a  special planning area in the first  place.  I can say that's accurate.  Council member Bennett.  Ditto. That's what I remember a  conversation with you a while back  about this. But this will achieve some  of the goals that we have set out  moved forward with a new area for  residential growth which is what we  need desperately here in chico. I'm  glad to see you brought this back. I  certainly will support it. Thank you.  Mr. All right. Any other questions?  Mr. I think we all understand  how the master planning didn't happen  wasn't going to happen, isn't going to  happen. But in this I'm curious we have  recommendations to pre-selection the  Mr. I think if we pre-zone the  site all are one which does mean we'  re losing some of what were planned  opportunities for secondary open space  that are in there. We have the school  site and the one card owned site.  Do we need to pre-zone the site  before we study infrastructure needs?  Mr. Say that again?  Would we pre-zone?  I would think the pre-zoning and  the land use amendments would come  Mr. Just asking us to  designate all parcels are one  wondering  if the study of infrastructure needs  should precede that.  Understanding that oftentimes a  whole swath of low density residential  areas don'  t pay for  themselves. That'  s what I would want to make sure  . We'  re putting 300k into a study  that have the opportunity to make sure  we can adequately provide for the  infrastructure in this area.  Mr. The area was always intended  to be single-family. The shown areas for !  of acknowledging the  remnant orchards and past use  that'  s going to happen  regardless in my mind it'  s not all of a sudden  going to just pay for single  family development I showed the  figures showing what has happened  in the county already those pockets  there will be areas I don'  t  t think  we'  re going to see every  person out there move towards  subdivisions.  you say it'  s not all going to be  paved over with single family  subdivisions but once we designate  r1 that is their right basically  right?  that'  s my concern with jumping the  gun in the pre-zone.  I'  m looking at other areas of the  city that have developed under r1  s a nice one acre minimum and  we'  re quite comfortable with that.  maybe it would help to go back  to the slide showing the parcels  that are in some degree of being  subdivided it seems unlikely that  city services are going to move  north of that area.  so that doesn'  t leave much.  for example that those two large  parcels in the middle of the city  that are in the middle of the  screen towards the top it doesn'  t seem conceivable that somebody  would drag city utilities into that  area.  things will happen here fairly  piecemeal and it will be areas that  are contiguous to the city where  they can grab the sewer, grab the  storm drain it would be difficult as  city manager sorenson pointed out to  quickly having subdivisions north of  those areas that are shown in black.  so really what we'  re looking at is  what is the !  is that consistent though with  the whole site r1 should we look at  some of these areas and say r1 is  too much for it?  I know they would have to go through  an annexation process and if they'  re leapfrogging they might face issues  with lafco but it'  s out of our hands at that point.  we could do that we were just  looking at the most expedient way of  idea is throwing a whole lot of  money to do a whole lot of planning  is not going to have much of an  influence at this point.  what'  s happening is what'  s going to happen.  we either provide an opportunity to  get some higher densities in the  southern area or most likely it'  s just going to go one acre  parcels in the county.  thanks for engaging back and forth  I have some drawbacks about  blanket zoning r1 in the area.  other questions?  other council members?  I don'  t know if in that study of  infrastructure needs will they  study in that a stoplight at  perhaps when?  I'  m really worried about you'  ve got the 177 homes going in and  then there is a stoplight at  m wondering if there is a couple  more contiguous that could.  you'  re never going to get enough  people to turn left on east  avenue and play frogger across four  lanes of traffic.  you'  re going to have to go right and  come back out around and the next  one light is cusick.  if all of the developments going  back to the county we don'  t have anything to make the county  put the stoplight in or do we?  I'  m just talking about what will  likely happen.  the goal will be to put some  assumptions together based on  those assumptions what level of  infrastructure needs will be  necessary for sewer storming and  as you mentioned traffic lights  and or we also want to push east  west connections between those  very long old country roads.  great thank you.  no one else?  I concur with that.  I think it'  s a mess and has been for 20 years.  speakers?  we have one.  austin barron.  three minutes.  good evening council.  austin barron.  local commercial real estate broker  review board member.  belmere sba.  when the 2030 general plan was  adopted in 2011 these new  group areas were selected to  help meet the city's future  housing and job needs.  so essentially at that time the  council planning commission  identified these areas as  chico's best shot to meet housing  needs.  now with the other side on pause  for now we need some way to act  to encourage the development of  a home ownership housing in our  city and in the other sbas.  now from what it sounds like you  guys know belmere sba is an  absolute failure.  you know master plan in the  area is cost prohibitive and with  the multitude of owners would be  extremely extremely difficult.  so i urge you to consider the  alternatives being one acre county  parcels.  annex the area remove the belmere  sba from the general plan and  prezone the area for low density.  thank you.  thank you.  all right.  further discussion?  motion.  move to approve.  second.  motion from council member  bennett second from council member  morgan.  council member bennett?  yes.  council member morgan?  yes.  council member tandon?  the only reason i would vote no  is because of the prezoning and i  don't think we should be taken off  the table the idea this can  support a wider variety of housing  types and that's going to be a  better way to make sure infrastructure  can be provided to more of the site  in a cost effective way for the rest  of the city.  vice mayor reynolds?  yes.  mayor coolidge?  aye.  carry 6-1.  favorite set rules and ordinances for  our council.  clerk prez.  thank you mayor and council.  what i brought before you today are  four policies that staff felt it was  important to update.  and they are fairly benign and  they are very routine in nature.  and i will start with ap and p  10-1 which is the policy that  guides boards and commissions.  this actually is what started the  process.  we had a board of commissioners  who had a presentation by an  outside group and they did a  powerpoint presentation which was  awesome.  they included music.  and we really wanted to protect the  city now that we brought on a  multimedia coordinator that person  indicated if we do not have the rights  to use those songs or the music in  those presentations that it could be  copyright infringement and we don't  want that to happen.  so we are amending ap and p 10-1 to  include those changes.  we are going to have presenters and  we want to make sure that there isn't  any music or that they have the rights  to use the music that they are doing.  in addition, there are as you recall we  did a study group and a training session  and we realized that we shouldn't have  business from the floor but instead have  it be public comments.  so ap and p 10-1 and 10-10 include  those changes to include and note that  it is actually public comment when  people make comments on things that are  not in the public comment.  so we are going to have a  the policy and the policy that is  already listed on the agenda.  in addition, I brought ap and p 10-2  which is our room reservation policy.  it is one that we have used ever since  I have been here.  I also brought forward ap and p 10-32  and that item also talks about using  this facility and the televising of  items or meetings.  and wanted to consolidate 10-32 into  10-2, the pertinent parts and the  other things that we have been doing  so I am in charge of approving any  room reservations.  have we ever gone to ap and p 10-32?  so we continue to look at our policies  and look for ways to make sure that  they match what state law is, what the  council directives are, and any policy  changes.  so that is what you have before you  are some very minor housekeeping items.  the last thing that I was requesting  was to perhaps call for the council  procedures committee.  I know that is an ad hoc that is  appointed at the time you need it.  and that policy group actually reviews  any of our policies and provides  recommendations to the council if any  changes are needed.  it has been four years since we have  done an extensive review of ap and p 10-10  which is what governs all of these  meetings and guides us.  so I thought maybe if the council  chooses to take that up and maybe look  at the policy, we could do that.  in addition, just note that any time  we have anything that is changed by  state law, we will bring those policies  to you.  but this is the opportunity for the  council to look at that policy that  pertains to these meetings.  any questions?  I am happy to answer.  questions?  I just want to be clear, and I  assume this is the case, but when you  talk about having the permission to use  media, a lot of things can be used as  fair use and that is we are not  extending the bounds of the  public.  I don'  t mean fair use.  I' m not sure.  I' m not familiar with the law.  I don' t even know that our municipal  attorney would be familiar with the  fair use of copyright law.  often times an image can be used in a  power point.  even though somebody owns that image,  the use of it in the power point does  not generate any money off of it.  it' s fair use and we' re not going to  go ahead of ourselves and restrict use of media.  but history history history history history history  history history history history history history history  history history history history history history  history history history history history history history  history history history history history history history history  Typically, it's maybe fair use relates to maybe creatively amending or changing the music to something new, but not to just play it.  So there's various organizations out there that request cities to pay for various expensive licenses to be able to use their catalogs.  So I think that's part of the issue.  Thanks.  I would say along that BMI and ASCAP will chase you down.  They even call local shows.  So, yeah.  Any other?  Not to, you know, they check.  All right.  Any speakers on this?  We have none.  All right.  So, motion to cancel.  Further discussion.  Was that a motion?  No, a move to approve.  Second.  All right.  And then, does that include forming the committee?  I think so.  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So we have a motion.  Who's the second?  I do.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Second.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Okay.  It carries 7-0.  And then, if the mayor would...  choose to...  You appoint three council members  who might volunteer to sit and work with me on these policies.  I'm...  I think our Internal Affairs Committee.  Can I make a suggestion that we, since we have...  You guys did first and second.  Since we have an election coming up in November,  that we wait until the new council is seated  just so we don't have to do it over again?  No.  No?  All right.  We did it four years ago.  I sat on that committee four years ago,  and I would gladly do that.  And the reason it isn't...  I didn't recommend that it goes to...  In IAC?  In IAC is because that has a specific duty  in those types of reviews.  However, the Council Procedures Committee is an ad hoc.  It used to be a standing,  but then, because it rarely meets,  by making it an ad hoc,  you don't have to do an agenda or the minutes or anything.  It's just more of a working group.  Okay.  So there's no council appointments?  No.  No.  You have to appoint when you need it and at the time.  Okay.  Volunteers?  All right.  Dale, myself, and Madison,  if no one else is jumping, raise your hand.  Although I know Sean.  I know he's...  Okay.  All right.  So, Council Member Bennett.  Okay.  Perfect.  Okay.  Thank you.  And that is it for me.  Thank you very much, Council.  Okay.  No items after the posting of the agenda.  Reports and communications following reports and communication items are provided for the Council's information.  No action can be taken on these items under this section unless the Council agrees to them on subsequent agenda.  Item 6.1, State Manager's Report.  Mr. Swanson.  I do have one update for you on the Five Mile item.  Last Friday, our city staff met with county staff to discuss a path forward to correct the problem of the very significant back...  The back...  I think our materials have  accumulated behind five mile and  we expect to be coming back to  you in the second meeting of may  with a conceptual path forward.  that is all.  no spring clean announcement  saturday 9 to noon?  I don'  t have that one off my  mind.  I will.  I should have public comment.  spring clean 9 to noon.  see you there.  6.2 council member requests  pursuant to ap&p.  1010 our favorite.  council members may request an  item for future meeting after  seeing what the item would be.  majority of the council is  required in order to have staff  agendas.  any council member requests?  we will have a meeting  we will have a meeting  thank you very much.  with that we will adjourn and  see you back here.  we are not going to adjourn  we will go back into closed  session and then we will adjourn.  thanks for being here.  history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history
