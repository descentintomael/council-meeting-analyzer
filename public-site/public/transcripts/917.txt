I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Are we ready?  Are we ready?  Good evening.  I'll call to order the regular Chico City Council meeting of September 1st.  Please join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.  Salute and pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America  and to the Republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  We'll start with the roll call, please.  Council Member Huber.  Here.  Council Member Morgan.  Here.  Council Member Ory.  Here.  Council Member Reynolds is absent for right now.  Council Member Stone.  I hear.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Here.  Mayor Schwab.  Here.  And I would like to issue a proclamation for Listen's Falsy Awareness Day,  and if Martin Havestee could join me up front.  Thank you.  Let's stand this way.  than people at home can see.  I'll change the twist.  Whereas,  listen to Folly's rare gene-linked  brain malformation,  causing bone to have less or no  ridges and folds, making her  appear smooth, is estimated that  one in 100,000 individuals  are born with this condition.  And whereas people living with  this condition may also suffer from  hypotonia, epilepsy,  epilepsy, swallowing disorders,  developmental delays,  and more. And whereas  the destiny complex that needs  early life is impairment  in helping families successfully care  for their children at home.  The need for more education, awareness,  and support for families is desperately  needed. And whereas  it's appropriate that one day  each year she set apart from the rest  and be known as  listen to Folly over her stay.  This day shall be on September 8th  2020. Whereas, listen to  Folly Foundation for Great,  a non-profit charitable organization  wants to help support these individuals  through our continued efforts  of empowering families and  engaging community leaders.  Now therefore,  be it resolved that I, Anne Schleck,  mayor of the city of Chico, on behalf  of the Chico City Council,  do hereby proclaim September 8th  2020 as  Listen to Folly Awareness Day.  I am a citizen, patient,  care bearer, medical professional,  and all agencies and organizations  interested in supporting these families  to unite on that day in observance  essential exercises.  Thank you for bringing this to our  awareness.  Will the next crowd be  interested?  Will the next crowd be interested  interested?  Will the next crowd be interested  interested?

We are blessed that Claire does  not suffer from any of the life-threatening symptoms that Amir Shlop talked about. However,  Claire has many behavioral problems. This puts us in a weird place where she doesn't  fit in with kids with a life diagnosis, but she also doesn't fit in with her typically  developing peers. Her poor social skills and inability to control her emotions can  cause other kids and their parents to be afraid of her. I think because Claire looks like  a typically developing child on the outside, it's hard for people to understand or remember  that she isn't. She has many different needs and skills than her typically developing peers,  and people with developmental disabilities come in all shapes and sizes. Rather than  treating her children differently, she has to be a little more careful. She has to be  a little more tolerant of children to be afraid and intolerant of someone that plays differently  than them. Teach them to be inclusive. If someone's child is struggling in the classroom,  please ask questions rather than judge from afar. If your kids see you inquire rather  than exclude, they will do the same. And to the other parents of children with special  needs, start talking. Education starts with us. The more our community knows about our  children, the more inclusive they can be.  Thank you. Thank you for bringing me and my friends to it.  Next, we're going to have a presentation from the Police Officers Research Association of California.  And the presenter is Damon Kurtz, the Vice President of FORAC. Welcome.  Thank you, Council Members.  Mr. Kurtz, could we ask you to keep your mask on if possible?  I thought maybe this was a way you could take it off.  So I'll try to speak through it. Sometimes it's difficult.  So my name is Damon Kurtz.  As you announced, I'm with the Police Officers Research Association of California.  It represents roughly 77,000 public safety officials across the state,  the majority of them law enforcement.  We are a federation of associations.  So much like you have Chico POA, we have associations across the state,  roughly 930 associations like Chico who affiliate with FORAC.  And we provide a number of different services from disability insurance,  medical insurance,  legal defense, and obviously lobbying efforts with our state capital and in Washington, D.C.,  representing law enforcement.  It's my understanding today I was brought to speak on behalf of the Chico Police Department  and Chico POA regarding Assembly Bill 392 and give background on where that came from  and what it does.  I'm assuming that's correct and what everybody's looking for.  So.  Assembly Bill 392 was passed last year in conjunction with SB 230.  They were sister.  They were married bills.  But it goes back to 2017, 2018, and Assembly Bill 931.  931 was very similar to 392 in its original stage.  It didn't make it out of the legislature in 2018.  In 2019, we embarked on a collaborative approach with the legislature  to come up with something that made sense.  Often legislation is put together sometimes based off of motion and not with all the facts.  And there were flaws with the original from the law enforcement perspective.  And the goal obviously is to protect our communities, but also not put the officers in harm's way  in the process.  So how do we come up with that goal and get there?  So that's kind of what AB 392 was about.  About clarifying.  When use of force should be used.  Talking about de-escalation processes to also recognizing that there are people with disabilities  that may not recognize what's going on.  And trying to come up with other mechanisms, other strategies than just force or, you know,  the worst case, deadly force.  But also recognizing you cannot just legislate.  Sorry.  You can't just say, hey, this is the way we're going to do it now.  And so that's the new rule.  And everybody knows it.  You have to train.  And one of the things that happened through the recession in training with law enforcement in particular  is post-peace officer standard training was no longer being funded.  So most agencies were unable to send their officers to training.  There was no reimbursement where there was before.  So there was a lot of the training had gone away from the,  from the effective training of scenario-based training where, you know,  you do it over and over again and you learn from doing versus learn from watching on the screen,  a video or whatnot.  So when 392 was introduced and we went through the collaborative negotiations, if you will,  to get the bill where we all were comfortable with it or as comfortable as it could be,  SB 230 was married with that bill because it carried with it the training that affected,  that effectively came from the changes to Penal Code 835A.  So I apologize.  My mask keeps coming down.  And that training is supposed to be very immersive and scenario-based so that officers learn.  Obviously starting with the academy with newer officers, but changing the habits of older officers  that are already working the streets.  How do we get there?  And that's what SBA is.  And the next thing I'll throw to the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the next question is the  the nation where the use of force policies in other states aren't what they are here in California.  Just like everyone else looks in kind of shock at what's going on, so does our law enforcement  community here in California because we don't do the things that they do in other states and  other departments. So this is an effort to try to bring us all together to have a standardization  to avoid, you know, the worst case scenarios. It's always the goal of law enforcement to find  the best outcome possible. Often we use the word reform and we talk about reform, but law  enforcement's in a constant state of reform. It's never stopped reforming. It reforms every year.  It continues to reform. So the way we police in the 50s changed in the 60s, the 70s, 80s, and so on.  What we did last year will be different this year. It is constant and the officers are always  going to training and  coaching and  hopefully and legal updates and changing their practices, looking for better outcomes.  It's what we do. It's why we go training. We say, hey, we made mistakes here. We don't want to make  that mistake again. So we're training our officers to do something different than what they did here.  So that's really the goal of these two bills. Is there any specific questions that I can answer  regarding them?  Thank you, Mayor. Sir, how familiar are you with, and it's okay if  the answer is you're not, Chico Police Department's use of force policy?  Not terribly. I have read it. I've looked through it.  So a follow-up to that or to make it more specific, to your knowledge, and maybe you can't answer this,  but does it fall in line and meet with the unified standard that AB 392 and SB 230 are trying to provide and enforce?  So I will give the caveat. I am a police officer. I'm not an attorney. And we utilize our attorneys through both the  legislative process and also when we're developing policies. So as I read it, it appears that it is there, but I am not an attorney.  And so I would not want to give a legal opinion that it is.  So that's something we'd have to direct to him? He's our city attorney?  I would say yes.  Okay.  I have a question concerning, I guess, the writing of the use of force policies. Our city uses a firm program called Lexapol.  Mm-hmm.  So what I'd like to ask of you is how widespread is the use of Lexapol and what do other communities utilize for that in California?  In California, Lexapol is very widely used. The attorneys with that are pretty adept at law.  Bruce Pratt, I believe, is one of them. I've dealt with him personally. He's a very capable attorney.  It's designed to give...  I think it's a good question.  It's designed to give cities, counties the kind of a boilerplate, if they will, hey, this is a guideline on what you need to do, based on the previous year's legislation or whatever is going on, or best practices.  If you remember a few years back, they had 21st century policing and they sent out...and this wasn't a statute. It was a policy that was put out by President Obama.  And so Lexapol put out a lot of policy recommendations based on that.  Some are because of legislation.  Some are because of legislation.  More mandatory.  And some are optional, I guess you'd say.  They're recommendations.  And every community is going to have to craft that the best for their community.  Some policies are more restrictive based on the community and some are a little more open to interpretation.  But Lexapol is widely used and widely respected in law enforcement agencies for that purpose.  Okay.  Do other council members have questions?  Yes.  It sounds like there's money coming down for training.  Will that go to the academy?  Will it come to cities like Chico?  It could.  So some will go to the training.  I don't...does Butte still have an academy?  So it's been a minute since I went to the academy 26 years ago.  So but yeah, so there's going to be more reimbursement for cities and counties.  So when they send their officers out to training,  and it helps to do things like  backfill.  So like, you know, a department the size of Chico,  if someone's in training,  someone's got to fill that void on patrol.  And sometimes they don't have the officer do it,  and it ends up being in an overtime role or whatever.  And so it becomes a funding mechanism.  That's really where our training went was deficient during from 2008 until about just this last year when we were able to negotiate with the governor's office to put more money into post to fix these issues.  There's an expectation for all of us.  We're going to be able to get our officers to be perfect,  but there's not time for them to practice that craft.  Right?  And, you know, that the only way you do that is by training and education and making sure that they're doing it in a way that that they best learn.  Not everybody learns by reading or seeing somehow.  Some of those tactile, there's all the different kinds of learning, and we try to incorporate that in our training practices.  So, so, yes, the answer would be yes, there's going to be more.  Funding available for training for for the departments.  And there's a number of bills pending approval or signature that are being floated around in Sacramento regarding, I guess, for better word, the reform or.  Yeah, there are several bills.  I don't I haven't got the updated list of what did make it through.  I know they ran out of time with several.  There were some bills that actually I was kind of surprised didn't make it through.  Just they ran out of time.  They had till midnight last night.  That's by their statute.  And I think COVID played a big part in that.  Right?  They weren't in session.  There was a limited time for them to get a lot of these things accomplished.  Often, you know, I just want to make this statement with living with the legislature and legislative items.  Trying to take that collaborative approach is sometimes very difficult, depending on who's bringing the legislation and what they're reasoning for it is.  And having, you know, trying to bring those perspectives together is challenging at times because not everybody sees it the same way.  And they're looking at it from different viewpoints.  And sometimes it takes time to get there.  And but I can tell you that law enforcement as a whole is committed to the reform, if you will, to bring a process, bring processes.  We just want to make sure that those processes are fair and equitable and that, you know, that we're not just looking at one side of it.  That, you know, that the.  That it's a collaborative approach and it's, you know, multifaceted.  Can you expand on what you mean by fair and equitable?  So I will tell you.  So one of the bills that did not make it through was SB 731 and the decertification process.  We supported the certification process.  However, that process had a committee that was six persons from the public, three from law enforcement.  The committee was made up was to be made up of activists and other folks.  And they gave us a list.  And they gave it investigative powers to go to even look at officers that were exonerated or they're sustained to take their certificate away based on.  So it became very politically biased.  The goal is to have someone to keep if an officer is terminated because they had the wrongdoing, whatever it may be, that they look at this and they say, hey, this person shouldn't have a certificate.  You know, they may have been fired for policy violations.  Maybe nothing statutorily.  Just maybe they want to say, yeah, they could.  Maybe the guy learned his lesson.  Maybe you can go get a job somewhere else.  That being said, the goal is to make sure that those bad apples don't come back.  And we support that.  We just want to make sure that we're not going after good officers based on a political agenda.  Obviously, cities have earned a unique position of being able to implement policies of their own that are more stringent, never less stringent than what they are.  And that's what the state law requires.  Can you speak to local legislative bodies implementing additional use of force policies?  Obviously, there's these kind of eight that are floating around as standard policies to implement with regards to use of force.  Can you speak to those?  I'm not sure if I understand the question.  What are you asking?  So cities can be more stringent in their use of force policies.  And there are some policies that have been kind of brought forward.  As evidence informed policies that are related to use of force.  And the recommendation has been that cities and counties implement these policies, which obviously are more stringent than the state requirements.  Yeah, I think that there's legal challenges to that.  I don't know what they are.  In particular, if the policies are changed into a manner that  you're asking the officers to put themselves in harm's way and unable to protect themselves.  And so there's a lot of nuances that go on in putting these policies together.  And they're designed to protect both the community and the officers.  So the answer is, I guess, there's probably something there you can do.  But I imagine there will be legal challenges to that as it goes forward.  Okay.  Any other questions?  Okay.  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Kurtz, for joining us today.  Thank you for having me.  Okay.  Some notes about the meeting this evening.  This meeting is being conducted in accordance with executive order N-2920.  Attendance at the meeting.  The public may attend this meeting in person at 421 Main Street.  Speakers may sign up to speak by checking in at one of the speaker card tables located near the sidewalk on 4th Street.  All speakers will be given instructions to queue in the speaker line.  Please follow the instructions accordingly.  And all those that enter the council chambers must be wearing their mask at all times.  Remote public participation during the meeting.  The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or through the Granicus program found on the city's website.  View meetings online.  The Engage Chico Civic Engagement Program will also be available for citizen input on individual agenda items both prior to and during the meeting.  And that program can be accessed through the city's website.  Public comment will also be accepted by email and can be sent to publiccomments at chicoc.gov during the meeting prior to the close of the public comment on an item.  The public is encouraged not to send more than one comment.  The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email.  We are always evaluating our technology and I guess community participation in meetings.  I would ask if you are experiencing any kind of technical difficulties at home to please email the public comments at chicoc.gov.  That way the clerk's office will be monitoring that and can respond.  Last meeting we learned that the sound wasn't good at the lobby so we brought people up to the podium.  But the council members are not checking their social media, emails, texts through the meeting.  So the best way to get that information is by emailing publiccomments at chicoc.gov.  We will start with the consent agenda.  We will start with the consent agenda.  Consent agenda items are done, are routine in nature and can be enacted in one motion.  Are there any public comments on the consent agenda?  We did receive, I believe, 12 comments from Engage Chico and one was for item 2.1 and the remaining speakers were speaking to item 2.2.  And did we receive any emails?  No.  Okay.  Well let's take a minute to review those while the city clerk's office reads the names of the people who sent comments to us.  Comments were received from Nicole Nava, Caroline L., Crystal Santo, Jackie Smith, Rob Berry, Jessica Montgomery, Roxanne L.,  Lisa Salzman, Michelle Rutlinger, Michelle Cooper, Nicole Nava, Amy Marie, Julie Threat.  That's the last one.  And did we have any people here in person that wanted to speak on this item?  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Do we have enough time to review the comments?  Okay.  Are there any council disqualifications or no votes?  Okay.  I'll entertain a motion for the consent agenda.  Move to approve.  Second.  All those?  Well, let's have a, we had a motion by Councilmember Stone, second by Councilmember Huber, I believe.  And we will take a vote.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Will there be a motion to approve the consent agenda?  Comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the mayor based on the number of speakers.  The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda.  Let's first look at any written comments that were received.  How many on the Engage Chico platform?  Let's see.  Okay, so there were 11 comments received via Engage Chico.  I don't know, did we receive any from the public comments?  No public comments.  None of those.  And then we have, I believe, six speakers.  Okay.  So each of the speakers will be allowed to speak for three minutes.  Okay.  And we will review the comments as you read the names and have the folks queue up.  Okay, e-comments were from Caroline E., Jackie Smith, Patty Dons, Rob Berry, Robin Engel, Jessica Montgomery, Roxanne Eldridge, Chanel Fowler, Michelle Rutlinger, Nicole Nava, and Juanita Sumner.  This council had an opportunity to review the comments.  So who is our first speaker?  Our first speaker is Jeff Creed, followed by Robin Engel, followed by Rob Berry.  Good evening, council.  So I wasn't really sure what to say tonight.  I had something in mind and I kind of scrapped it after I listened to last year's meeting on September 3rd.  And I realized that everything I said last year's meeting, September 3rd, is more than relevant today, Mr. Horry.  And, you know, I know you don't like us coming in here and standing and speaking, but somebody asked me why I bother to come and talk at city council meetings  and why I take this.  Why I take pictures.  Why I post videos on YouTube.  And it's not for you guys, because you guys don't care.  You don't go to other cities to see the difference of what they're doing correctly and what you're not doing correctly.  I post it and I talk here to try and bring awareness so other people realize they don't have to live with such a high crime rate.  If you watch the meeting on September 3rd and then you go to the next meeting, you'll notice a lot of citizens came up and spoke in defense of the city council.  And the first thing they said...  They said, I've lived here for XX years.  And I haven't lived here for XX years.  I moved here in 2012.  And I travel out of the city quite a bit.  And so I think I have a different perspective of what's the normal across the state compared to Chico.  And I think a lot of people sitting here in this room don't travel enough.  And when they do travel, they don't stop to smell the roses, look at the grass, and pay attention to what the police and city are doing differently.  So I think that's a big difference.  So if you're at home and you think I'm just up here spewing BS, that's great.  I don't really care about you.  If you're at home and you think Chico is not the place you grew up in, then dig in, pay attention to what they're doing, and pay attention to what's been said in this council for years.  And you'll see that Chico's been set on a path of destruction by this city council for years.  Chico runs an unsustainable business plan.  And it's only getting worse.  I laughed for years when people said, oh, crime isn't bad in Chico.  Crime isn't bad in Chico.  Last year, 12 months ago, crime isn't bad.  And what'd they do?  They voted to remove another officer.  They voted to lower the officer to citizen ratio.  And it's already been drastically lower than the state average and the national average.  So when you have a lower average of policemen to citizens, it's not good.  And when you have a lower average of citizens, you're going to have a higher primary.  That's just basic math.  And when you can't afford to staff parks and public works, you're going to be on a path of self-destruction.  And that's basic math.  It's simple.  Go take a basic business class, and you can run this city better than it has been.  So dig in.  Look for yourself.  It's not hard.  Spend 10 minutes on the internet, and you'll see what I'm talking about.  Have a good night.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Robin Engle, followed by Rob Berry.  Good evening, Council.  Until we stop ignoring the realities of this place and time in history, in terms of our climate, in terms of COVID-19,  we will not be able to get Chico to the better place and achieve the shared goals that both sides do have for Chico.  Those goals are to live in a safe city and for everyone in our city to have their basic needs met.  At least in theory, those are goals of both sides of the political extreme spectrum.  The campfire sent, I believe, 27,000 folks to the camp.  That's 27,000 who are immediately homeless through no fault of their own.  The narrative that's been carried is that they made bad life choices.  Well, I'm sure we can all agree none of these people made bad life choices that caused the campfire.  Chico State University reported 14.7% of student body homelessness.  That's a lot.  Since the campfire.  So fairly recently, after the campfire.  And this week, I believe students who were living in student residences were given five days or fewer to vacate.  We are going to see an increase in homelessness, inevitably.  14.7% is approximately 2,500 young people.  It's a lot.  It's going to be higher than that.  We need to stop ignoring these facts.  Nobody did anything wrong to be living without shelter.  Nobody wants to live without shelter.  Let's address our housing crisis.  Let's give CHAT the okay to move forward with their plans and house people.  Let's stop criminalizing people who are broke.  That's not against the law to be broke.  Let's start acting with compassion and reason on the ground.  And we will do that on behalf of our whole city.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Rob Berry followed by Christopher Goggish and followed then by George Deeds.  Good evening.  I'd like to start by sending my thoughts and prayers to Casey Reynolds and her family tonight.  So I'm here to make an announcement.  The City of Chico stands in violation of its own ordinances as well as state and federal laws regarding the condition and status of our parks and waterways.  As a property owner under Title VIII and the enforcement agency under Title IX, through neglect of your duties, you have allowed the conditions of our parks and waterways to deteriorate to an unsafe and unlawful state.  Our waterways, including Sycamore Pool, have reached unhealthy levels of pollution and should be closed until they can be returned to a safe and healthy recreational use.  Our parks are loaded up with illegal campers, trash, needle litter excavations in sensitive riparian areas, vandalism and graffiti, and most egregiously, human waste and spoiled food.  Sadly, the state of Chico is in a state of emergency.  While these conditions impact the quality of life for every Chico citizen, it is disproportionately impacting for the poorest families who do not have access to swimming pools, country clubs, or other costly amenities.  Families cannot use our parks safely because of your negligence, dereliction of duty, and failure to abate an ongoing nuisance.  Either you will take immediate action to correct these conditions,  or,  we will obtain a court order mandamus to require you to do so.  To this end, we have established the Chico Stewards for Parks and Waterways to raise additional funds and public awareness to your obligations and to support legal action should it become necessary.  I am asking you to take the following actions, please.  Ban needle distribution and associated activities in parks and waterways immediately.  You can use your own ordinance, Banning Needles in the Civic Center as a model.  Two, enforce your own ordinances in Title 8 and 9 regarding prohibited activities in all parks and waterways.  Number three, close Sycamore Pool until you can demonstrate that the water is safe for recreational use under the current water quality standards of 200 CFUs of fecal coliform.  Do not ever allow campers to get reestablished in our parks again.  If you do not undertake these obligations voluntarily and immediately, I can assure you that the courts will order you to do so.  At this moment, the choice is yours.  Thank you very much.  Christopher Gogish, followed by George Deeds, followed then by Mike Jensen.  Christopher Gogish, followed by George Deeds, followed then by Mike Jensen.  Hi, I just want to talk about like the same thing like the homeless situation.  Hi, I just want to talk about like the same thing like the homeless situation.  You know, the last speaker was right about the trash, the needles.  I mean, there's numerous spots around town that I could need to talk to the city about having the trash removed.  It's not just the community members that could be affected by this, but the animals, you know, go digging through stuff.  Everybody deserves to have a home.  The drug issues in Chico have skyrocketed enormously since the price of amphetamine salts have dropped.  Sales, distribution, use in our plaza has come out of control.  Theft is really way up.  It's ridiculous.  I am a Chico citizen.  I have been one since the beginning.  1989.  I love this city.  And it doesn't deserve this.  And it's not okay.  There's too much violence going on.  People, certain community members believe they can just do what they want.  I've personally been assaulted a few times, and it's not appropriate.  I've personally been assaulted a few times, and it's not appropriate.  You know, I'm a guy.  I'm going to start shutting it down.  I'm not okay with it anymore.  It's not okay.  People are going to get hurt.  And it's too much.  It's really too much.  There needs to be, there needs to be needle drop boxes around town, seriously.  You know, there's a whole lot of people out there.  I've cleaned them up and I found like a hundred of them on top of a garbage can one day,  along with a, along with a methamphetamine pipe.  I found them on our benches in the plaza.  I find them all over the place.  And it's not, you know, when I was a little kid, I found a whole bunch of them when I was a little kid.  And it was like, that's not cool to see when you're a little kid.  You know, it, it screws your mind up.  You know, my dad being a heroin addict and seeing that, I know what that meant.  You know, I know what that was.  Chico's gotten kind of grimy, but really hasn't.  And it's just, it needs to be addressed.  And more than soon as possible, like stat, I'm not okay with it anymore.  People can do what they want, but they need to do it somewhere else.  It's too much.  That's about it.  I wish I was a little bit more prepared.  It's okay.  All right.  Have a nice evening.  So our last speaker is actually George Deeds.  Mike Jensen is not going to speak on this item.  So George Deeds.  Hello, Counselor.  Sorry for talking so fast last time.  I watched the video and said, oh, yeah, you probably didn't understand anything.  So anyway.  The Senators voted on that assisted outpatient treatment at 17-0.  So Gavin just needs to sign off on it.  And guess what?  Our streets just changed.  They're thinking July, the fiscal year 2021.  I think that's what Lisa was saying in that direction.  I'm going home to hang out with my parents.  So I'll be bouncing back and forth.  I've been following the political scene here about 10 years.  Whenever I started at the church over here, I started living off of it.  You know, I started.  I started this time, this journey.  So I grew up around politics.  I'm from Wheatland right here in Oroville.  And I grew up watching a lot of people in their gauge, a lot of adults do this thing, you know.  When I was in Southside, Oroville, we got together to do the drug free zone signs that we're meeting at El Medio Fire Department.  I still use a lot of the skills that I learned there here on the streets because I play on the streets, you know.  And the first thing I realized, you know, we're taught that we're the first responders.  And so when I see.  Somebody over in the park here because I want the parks clean.  So something on the ground, I ask him, hey, can you please pick that up?  And if they don't do it, well, I call it manual.  I pick it up.  I don't like to do it, but that's just something that I learned how to do.  That thing I learned was compassion.  And this is the confusing part.  See, I see somebody like Terry DeBorg show compassion.  She's over here doing all this work right.  And this side, see Angela McLaughlin.  How compassionate.  She's a great person.  She's doing all this work for me.  I've been following these two women for a while.  They're superheroes because they're doing something that nobody, nobody else is doing.  They're taking the brunt.  They're doing this.  You know, I got one more class from Chico State in a manual.  So I'm in the psych department and I'm watching, you know, they're telling us the newest data.  You invite all these kids from around the world to come over here to Chico State.  And when you start watching the town with the gentrification issue.  What about the housing in my town of Wheaton?  And they already took care of it.  You know, figure it out people, because you know what?  There's a whole lot more people that are watching than participating, which is what proven this time around.  My friends started calling me saying, how come you're posting this on different social sites?  And I said, well, you know, I tried, you know, I did.  But you see, that's, that's the thing.  There's a whole lot of people watching and there's a whole lot of people that care.  And that's what I love about this town.  For the most part, most people.  I mean, you care.  They do it in their own way and they got their own ideas, but at least they do.  As opposed to the apathy that we see.  Yeah, we got predators out here.  They're out here and they're the ones that are winning because everybody here can't get along or whatever the heck you guys are doing.  Like I said, I came around, started coming here when the Desmond stuff was opening.  So I love you guys.  Good luck.  And I'm out of here.  Bye.  Thank you, George.  Your sunglasses.  George.  I think we have to wrap this up.  Give it back.  Next we'll go to public hearings.  4.1 is a hearing to consider the nomination to historic resources inventory 1901, Gothic Revival House, 1386 Humboldt Avenue, APN 004-371-018.  And we have a report from Dexter O'Connell, associate planner.  Welcome.  Hello members of council.  As ever, it is a pleasure and a joy to appear before you.  As well as a privilege.  This is a proposal to reinstate the structure at 1386 Humboldt Avenue to the City of Chico historic resources inventory.  This structure now located at 1386 Humboldt Avenue was formally designated a landmark on the City of Chico historic resources inventory.  While it was designed to be an important resource to the City of Chico's historic resources inventory.  was at its prior location, which was at 618 West 5th Street.  It was constructed in 1883 for P.E. O'Hare, who was a hardware salesman and plumbing supply  contractor.  The structure is the only remaining example of the carpenter's Gothic style of architecture  in Chico, and as such, it is deserving of recognition.  Now, on November 18th of 2015, the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board approved  a request for a certificate of demolition for this structure.  A demolition permit was issued, and the structure was relocated from 618 West 5th Street to  its current location in early to mid-2016.  Since then, the owners have undertaken an extensive and successful restorative renovation.  A review of the structure.  After its relocation and rehabilitation indicates that it has maintained its character-defining  features and been restored to a real sense of historically relevant style that conveys  the significance of the structure and uses principles consistent with the Secretary of  the Interior's standards for treatment of historic structures.  On February 19th of this year, the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board forwarded  a recommendation to City Council.  to reinstate the structure.  The City Council recommends that City Council reinstate the structure at 1386 Humboldt Avenue  to the inventory via the specific path described there.  As always, I would be happy to try my best to answer any questions that you might have  about the circumstances.  Mr. Stone?  Did the property owners make it out tonight?  I'm sorry?  Did the property owners?  Are they here tonight?  Yes, you will hear from one of the property owners in the comments.  Okay, fair enough.  I don't need to bring that up now.  I just remember when this originally came to us as a support for fees in the move and  it wasn't something that we were able to support at that time, which may have killed this project.  So it's great to see such a fantastic revival, pardon the pun, of this building.  Any other questions?  Okay.  Let's open the public hearing.  Thank you.  And we will take a moment and see if we had any comments on the Engage Chico platform or  emails.  I don't believe we received any comments from either of those two mechanisms.  We do have two speakers, Scott and Lynn Hubbard.  Okay, very good.  So each one of those speakers could address us for three minutes.  Okay.  Scott Hubbard.  Thank you, council.  I will take a moment to thank the City Council for their support.  Lynn Hubbard will not be attending here today.  I joined in Mr. O'Connell's statement.  I just wanted to come down here and personally thank the City of Chico and the Heritage Association  for helping us in this endeavor.  History defines us not only as individuals but as a community and through the hard work  and dedication of both, we managed to preserve something special.  And while I can't speak about what happened 133 years ago, I want to say that we have  to be champions of the next generation of champions of the next generation of champions.  And I'll be respecting the champions of the next generation of champions and champions  of the next generation of champions and champions of champions and champions of champions and  champions and champions champions champions champions champions champions champions  champions champions champions champions champions champions champions  champions champions champions champions champions champions  champions champions champions  When the project first was brought to us,  we had an opportunity to,  or almost an opportunity to support you,  and we weren't able to,  and that was disconcerting to me.  So to see that you managed to get it done  and with the help of the city in some capacities  is great news.  Thank you.  Thank you, Councilman.  Thank you.  So with that, we will close the public hearing  and look for recommendation from Council.  Move to approve.  Second.  So we have a motion from Councilmember Stone  and a second from Vice Mayor Brown.  Councilmember Huber?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Ori?  Aye.  Councilmember Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  The next hearing is 4.2,  Revised Accessory Dwelling Unit Amendments to Title 19  of the Chico Municipal Code,  and we have a report from  not Bruce Ambrose,  but Brendan Fee.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  I'll try to make this quick.  On July 7th, the City Council adopted an ordinance  comprehensively amending the permit process  and the development regulations for accessory dwelling units,  or ADUs,  to be consistent with state housing law.  Shortly thereafter, the City submitted the adopted ADU ordinance  to the California Housing and Community Development Department,  or HCD, for review.  The City received minor comments,  from HCD on July 21st,  and made corresponding minor changes to the Municipal Code.  On August 6th, the Planning Commission considered the changes  and recommended approval of the proposed ordinance amendments  to the City Council.  The most substantive of these changes include deleting provisions  requiring alley improvements,  and modifying a walkway requirement for ADUs with alley access.  The proposed modifications will ensure the City's ADU regulations  are consistent with state law.  Quickly, on a side note,  I wanted to point out that in 2019,  the Planning Division permitted an incredible 69 ADUs.  2020 looks to be another big year,  especially with the rollout of a series of ADU plans,  including 13 design variations that are plan checked  and available pre-approved to the public  for use free of charge.  The ADU plans were developed using SD2 grant funds  secured from HCD.  The Council's leadership and proactive ADU direction  has proven extremely successful,  and incentivizing production of this more affordable housing type.  I'm available to answer any questions.  Any questions?  Were there, to the best of your ability,  and I'm putting you on the spot, I recognize,  and I think I know the answer is probably diffused,  but was there a particular area that benefited,  or we saw more ADUs than others in the city?  Was it predominantly around campus?  I know that wasn't the case, but was there some focus areas?  Where are we?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, honestly, yeah, a lot of it has to do with kind of the older neighborhoods  where you have those alleys and those longer lots.  Sure.  But then again, we also have folks that are now integrating the ADUs  into New Devon and Greenfield development.  Right, right.  But mostly, yeah, some of our older neighborhoods.  Okay.  And we have a map that highlights that that I could share  through the Council update if you're interested.  Love it.  Any other questions?  So we will open the public hearing.  Do we have any comments sent to us under Envaged Chico or CEC?  We will go through email.  We received one comment through our public comment emails,  and that was from Grace Marvin.  And do we have anybody here in person to speak?  No.  We were provided a copy of the email from Ms. Marvin, Dr. Marvin.  It sounds like she's asking that a standardized...  Tiny house.  ...program be used to review ADUs.  And I would be curious from staff whether or not that platform is helpful to us  and get some feedback on that.  Right, that platform is available to the state.  My guess is that we're over and above any kind of statewide reviews of ADUs  and, you know, their appropriateness.  But, you know, since she has brought it up,  if we can get it forward, I would...  then I can follow up with an email that the staff take...  give us some feedback on that.  Mr. Veague, are you familiar with the tool Smart Growth  that's provided by the state?  I'm not as...  I mean, there's lots of webinars, tools, and things that the state has available,  but I'm not specifically knowledgeable of Smart Growth as an app or a tool.  In this case, the ADU regs that we're talking about tonight  are making sure that we're compliant with the state housing laws, but...  Okay.  Okay.  Well, perhaps you could review them and just give us a synopsis of...  Oh, okay. I didn't receive the comments, so certainly I'll...  Well, we'll make sure that you receive a copy of it.  Sounds good. Thank you.  Okay.  So we will close the...  because we had no in-person comments either.  Close the public hearing.  And look for action from council, which includes reading of an ordinance.  I'll move an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico  amending certain sections of Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code  regarding accessory dwelling unit regulations for consistency with state housing laws.  So motion from Council Member Stone.  Second.  And second from Council Member Huber.  Second.  Second.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Horry.  Aye.  Council Member Stone.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Aye.  Mayor Schwab.  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  So regular agenda.  Item 5.1, Council Member Stone requests a cooling center.  This is continued from our August 25th meeting.  Right.  Council Member Stone.  Sure. Thank you.  And appreciate that the loose term of cooling centers.  Thank you.  I think it's important to note that we have two problems because we have kind of dual problems in this community.  One, we have warming centers necessary when it's cold, cooling centers when it's hot,  and then we have this mix of smoke and hot which makes it even more caustic.  I'm seeing, especially over the last heat wave when we had 108 degrees, and by the way,  for those of you that are watching your thermostat, it looks like we're going to have another 108  come around Friday or Saturday.  So we're still in this and continue to see fires around the area.  What I'd like to see is what I'm seeing communities throughout the western United States.  This is in California.  This is northern and southern California.  This is in Oregon.  This is in Washington.  With the heat wave providing cooling centers that are as simple as keeping City Hall open an extra two hours on those particular days.  When we're talking about heat, the impact isn't, I mean, it's miserable if it's 84 degrees at night.  In the middle of the night.  But you're really talking about the intensity of this 108 degrees, which is in the late afternoon, including some business hours.  Even though we have a very high restriction level because of COVID-19, because of our existing status,  I recognize that some options that are available to other communities in the state are not available to us because of that restriction.  But I'm just generally astounded as I see Rancho Cordova opens their senior center,  and the recreation centers throughout the western United States have these facilities open.  Roseville, so many other communities, communities in Santa Clara County, which were, at the time we were bringing this up, still under pretty extensive watch.  I don't know what their current status is now.  But the point being, I recognize we've bifurcated recreation facilities to CARD.  CARD handles our recreation facilities, whereas that's not the case in other communities.  But it's not.  It seems astounding to me that we can't open up the rec center or some other facility or school facility during times when at least it gets that so seriously intense a temperature  or so seriously intense a smoke condition, or both of those.  Don't mistake what I'm asking for.  This isn't a homeless provision.  This isn't a shelter for people that are going to stay the night.  This is a warming center to get people out of smoke.  This isn't for people that are, it's for people that are homeless, but every bit as much seniors and veterans and people that live alone that don't have somebody checking in on them.  Not everybody in this community has air conditioning.  And as you get older, boy, I know a little bit from experience that it creeps up on you, and you won't know you're in trouble when you are.  And so I just, I'm looking for some relief from staff, whatever it takes, that I'd like to see us, if that's what it takes, opening up City Hall from 5 o'clock to 7.  I know City Hall is from 5 to 7.  It's effectively closed on many of the days anyway.  But extending that for even a few hours, the cost has to be relatively insignificant if we're dealing with security staff.  I wouldn't ask the more expensive staff members to take their time on such an endeavor.  But I've got to believe that we're at least as good in our attempts as so many, dare I say, most communities in the western United States to have solved this problem.  And so I offer it up to my colleagues with no special lesson or tool other than I can see this working in other communities, and I can't understand why we don't have something similar or even arrange something similar.  I appreciate you bringing this up, Councilmember Stone.  And I think especially you bring up the point where we, the city, doesn't necessarily operate these centers.  CARD has rec centers.  Schools have auditoriums.  We have a lot of other things. Three weeks ago was it that I worked with City Manager Orm over a weekend trying to get some relief from the county with some of the CARES Act funding that they have received that doesn't flow to the cities.  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ... Three weeks ago was it that I worked with City Manager Orm over a weekend trying to get some relief from the county with some of the CARES Act funding that they have received that doesn't flow to the cities. And the county did decide to open up some libraries after much prodding. So I guess I would like to hear from City Manager Orm what he has done and I think to follow your lead of a couple weeks ago is not maybe perhaps to come up with a plan, but to give the direction to city staff on what could happen.  And I think to follow your lead of a couple weeks ago is not maybe perhaps to come up with a plan,  but to give the direction to city staff on what could happen.  I'm glad you mentioned that because I'm not in the business of producing shelters and facilities.  It's the last thing in the world I should be doing.  And I know there have been many efforts underway by several council members, at least, to help address this problem.  So we're not trying to take away any support of these things.  But Mr. Orme, you're excited to talk, and I'm interested in hearing it. Please.  Always happy to share, Council.  I think that you've poignantly pointed out the fact that we are uniting.  Everybody likes to look at Chico as being unique, and we're definitely unique.  In my previous positions elsewhere, we did run a senior center.  In my breadth of over 20 years of being in local government, many cities run their own park and rec.  Many cities operate a variety of facilities that would accommodate, to include libraries,  space to allow for not only community gatherings, but also for these types of instances  where there's a lot of community gathering.  Where there's an urgent need to see if we can extend a helping hand to those that are, unfortunately,  in a position that they can't find that respite that they need.  And so one of the things that I did when this came up a while ago was reached out to our community partners  and all those with facilities that could facilitate such a need and was unsuccessful  in finding any that would be able to accommodate.  So what staff ended up doing is turning inwardly.  To try to look inward to see what we had available.  And unfortunately, because we don't operate those types of facilities, we're extremely limited.  Obviously, if city council desires to ask that we open one of the current facilities that we have,  the city council chambers, the city hall, are pretty much the largest facilities we have  that are readily available and in a central location to the community.  We did consider in the past the OMB, the historic building adjacent to us.  Now that's being leased.  So that's not as available as it once was.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend either of these facilities, candidly.  But if that is the direction that council would like to proceed, we're happy to do that.  I will tell you, though, we are exploring a variety of options.  I continue to have the feelers out there saying,  are you sure there's not some availability in that facility there or this facility over here?  Unfortunately, the added complexity is COVID-19.  And it's really an interesting twist to all of this.  Just take city hall, for example.  It's not open to the public.  It's by appointment only.  And so it's not readily open as it is anyway.  But obviously, we can look at that option of extending it.  What I'm currently in conversation over, and I was supposed to have a meeting this morning,  but unfortunately it was delayed because of some issues on the other side of the phone,  was looking at the feasibility.  Is there a possibility of maybe paying extra so that the library,  can extend their hours, possibly?  I was going to be on the phone with Mel this morning, our librarian,  and unfortunately that didn't happen, but it was rescheduled, I think, for tomorrow and the following day.  So we will continue to extend out what opportunities might extend,  the options for us to extend any operations to allow for the use of a facility.  Unfortunately, we've just been unsuccessful, primarily because we don't own facilities that accommodate that type of operation.  of use. But I'm always open to pushing the envelope and if there is  something that council would like staff to proceed on moving forward with, albeit  I may not recommend it, then obviously we will do what council's desire is on  that front. So that's it from the staff operational perspective. We've  reached out, we've put the tentacles out. One of the things I'd like to do is  extend that out to the community for anybody that's listening right now and  say if you know of a facility that's able to accommodate COVID-19 and allow  for some cooling options, I'd love to hear from you. So I'll leave it at that.  That's exactly the kind of thing that I'm hoping for is the engagement of  the community and thinking differently than we are right now. And I'll give you  an example and I very much appreciate the extraordinary steps that staff has  taken and not to mention the staff hours that I'm seeing in accommodating the  public access to the facility. I think that's a great example of what we're  seeing. I think that's a great example of what we're seeing in accommodating the  public access to these meetings. But they're queued up outside and I just  thought why don't we have a queue inside City Hall? I know it only holds the five,  six, seven, eight people and there are probably great logistical reasons for  why you're doing it that way, but it's just the kind of thing that if we just  had six people that were allowed in that hall that were six feet apart, we're  providing some cooling and shelter for people to escape the elements under  these conditions. I mean this is, I'm gonna play with what's worse hot or  cold, but you know the  when it's 108 and it's smoky outside that's gonna be far more deadly than  if it's freezing outside based on our temperatures and the variation the  impact that it has for people that are frail. So even if it just meant having a  security guard there that was allowing access to City Hall and maybe first and  second or third floors or however you want to mix that and get 25 people that  can escape that those conditions, I think that's worthwhile. Reaching out to other  community resources even if they can only hold 25 people. I think that's  really important because we're a community of about 20 people we're a card  center we're in an extraordinary time with extraordinary restrictions on all of  us and so finding that needle in the thread if you will to find solutions  that will work with our existing facilities with community facilities is  exactly what I'm looking for. I agree but I wanted to add something I've had some  folks reach out to me about kind of finding alternatives and the in the with the understanding of the limitations of the  COVID-19 and one of those alternatives was the use of misters or misting  types of tents and that could be an outdoor it's not obviously not ideal to  an indoor space that's air-conditioned but could be an outdoor kind of setup  and I have not priced it out but what has been presented to me seems  relatively affordable and so it seems like an out-of-the-box kind of way to  give folks a more extended cooling space. I would say that it's a good idea to have a  more extended cooling space. I am deeply appreciative of what the county is doing and their  restrictions are that folks have to be can only be in that space for 30 minutes  and takes I believe two hours for the body to fully cool down and so as far as  heat related illness it's not necessarily preventing it and but it is  putting a little bit of a gap there so if that's something that we can look  into I'd be interested in hearing more about it. Yeah it's interesting we we  kicked that around it's at the staff level and it is an option  and I don't have the cost for something like that we did obviously put the cost  together we know what tents cost they're expensive and I've got I've got those  numbers here but yeah I think that if you're looking at a more cost-effective  and simple approach it may be this the tent with the misters so well obviously  if it's council's directive we'll look into that as well and let you know what  that looks like. I will say that this is  still a very good idea. I think it's a good idea to have a tent that's a little bit more  practical and I think we'll see how we can get through this through the !  special meeting for that but that is that's the type of facility if we were  able to pull something off that could accommodate heating and cooling and so  looking at that long-term big picture investment of the resources necessary to  do that and we're still working on that so we don't have it all put together yet  but we're still working towards those ends in addition to that one of the  things that I've done previously you know in a prior city is we actually and  we do have to there is another fire facility fire station in the road in the  future somewhere in the city of Chico up in the northerly section of the city  that's necessary and one of the things that I've seen done is leveraging the  cost of building a fire facility or any type of city facility and adding a space  for this type of use whether it be community meetings and or heating and  cooling and so just realize that is in here and that is in staff's mind as it  relates to how do you leverage the  technology that you're using to build a fire station and how do you leverage the  technology that you're using to build a fire station and how do you leverage the  dollar to ensure that because we know we don't have that type of space how can we  make that type of space and so hopefully I want to get that message through as  well I think that's really important but yes we will get back to you on the on the  tent with the misters.  Other comments before we hear from the public?  So madam clerk did we have any comments electronically?  We received 19 engaged comments and any public comments, emails?  None from there and we have two speakers queued up to speak on this matter in  person.  Well let's take a couple of minutes to read the comments from engaged as you  read the names and get the in-person speakers queued up.  Okay.  Comments were received from Lauren Kohler, Crystal Santo, Jackie Smith, Bob Caldwell,  Kirk Powell, Jessica McKenzie, Steve LaFore, Rob Berry, Robin Engle, Jessica Montgomery,  Chanel Fowler, Michelle Rudinger, Michelle Cooper, Susan Smead, Nicole Nava, Amy Marie,  Julie Threat, Margaret Hicks, and Juanita Sumner.  Thank you.  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ... [inaudible]  Umm ... [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Has counsel had enough time to review the comments?  So let's hear from the members of the public  who are with us.  Okay, so Mike Jensen will be our first speaker  and Robin Engle.  And then we each have three minutes.  Okay, thank you.  And then just to let you know,  we did receive one public comment  on this matter from Mike Trollander.  Oh, yes, okay.  Am I on?  You're on.  Yeah, 105, 106,  I mean, maybe it'll only be 104.  I'm glad you said everything you said.  I kind of listened out there.  I mean, getting next to the fire station,  that's a long-range plan.  I don't know what we're getting,  because I thought this,  I mean, we're a desperate need of facility.  I know people that live with spray bottles.  I still have a little fan.  But, you know, get more public information out.  Try to, I mean, it's,  we could have another meeting.  We could have another,  we could have a heat,  one or two more in September and October.  I didn't really prepare,  and I wasn't allowed to let her come in front of me.  But I'm glad to be here.  I recognize some of you.  Thank you for being a public servant.  I think a lot of people are kind of volunteering,  but to some degree,  we have to believe we're effective,  we're, you know, helping or whatever.  All right, that's about it.  6-1 on that other one,  that alternative dwelling unit,  6-1.  That's it for me.  I'm going to call it a go,  because that's it.  Thanks.  Thank you.  And Robin Engle.  And she's our last speaker.  Okay.  Good evening again.  I was shocked and really disappointed  to see when I signed in  to Engage Chico,  there were about 10 comments  against cooling centers,  and I can't conceive of why anyone would be  against the idea of simply helping people stay alive.  And that's what we're talking about.  We are in a record-breaking heat wave.  It's absolutely wrong and not acceptable  to hear that there,  or if we're going to hear that,  there's no place for this to happen.  That's just not acceptable.  Councillor Stone spoke well  to the realities of the situation we're in.  And I'll reiterate that,  well, as I said last week at Council,  that 30 to 40 million people  are projected to become homeless by COVID-19  within the country.  Sorry, within the country.  And those numbers will go into the thousands here.  It's inevitable.  So I know it's been said that we're not talking  about the homeless population,  but we are talking about the marginalized.  We are talking about folks  who can't afford air conditioning to stay alive.  And that's my, I mean, that's my way of staying alive  and feeling okay is to sit by my AC.  I'm very privileged to be able to do that.  But people are dying.  And our community, due to dehydration,  dehydration, sorry, and the heat,  we need to save them.  We need to stop putting this off.  And I like Vice Mayor Brown's idea of tents,  misting tents.  I think that's a great idea.  If there's no actual physical buildings  and or that should happen as well,  I think maybe we could check out,  I don't know,  I don't like to put any other entity on the line,  but there are over a hundred churches,  I believe in Chico.  There's a synagogue.  Maybe those are worth checking out too.  There's gotta be options.  There has to be options.  And it's just not acceptable to say no to this idea,  which is a mere bandaid to keep people alive.  And that's everyone in this community's obligation to do.  Thank you.  So that was our last public speaker.  Look for direction from council.  Well, I'd like to see the city manager explore maybe,  and again, all due respect,  this sounds ridiculous that we know that you have been trying.  And I want to make sure that that's acknowledged.  But the depth of our resolve, I think,  needs to escalate to the point where we're providing resources  that we didn't consider in the past because of just the intensity  and sheer threat that we're faced in this community  with multiple disasters and impacts.  So if that's six, eight people in the first floor of city hall,  I'm not suggesting that it has to be that,  but I'd like to see staff look at some other options,  whether that's vice mayor Brown and misters or what have you.  This is a deadly situation that we need to step up our opportunity here.  I just want to quickly add as an update for council  that the internal affairs committee  will be meeting in September.  I tried to get a meeting in August,  but to think and talk a little bit more on the long-term planning.  Months and months ago,  the then sustainability task force had requested that we take up  the extreme heat preparedness plan.  And so we will be discussing that at the September meeting  now that we're back at regular meetings.  And so that will be another part of the bigger picture.  So is there anything else?  I'm not sure that has to be a motion.  I guess if we're all consenting that we'd like more information  from the city manager on this in a stepped up engagement  and more aggressive response, we'd appreciate it.  Because we've already allocated funds for this.  Right.  It's just a matter of finding the, you know,  there's been comments that can we look at our existing shelters?  Can we reach out to the churches and other religious organizations?  And again, providing significant respect and appreciation  for the community.  And for the steps that have been taken to date,  I don't want that to be lost.  We just we're looking for additional resources.  So thank you.  One of the things that I do want to just make note of  is the fact that the council did authorize us to utilize the funding,  not all of it, the funding,  to ensure that we had some cool outlets for folks  to be delivered to them.  For those that are in need for service work,  for providers to help us with.  In addition to that direction,  council said staff continue to work on alternative options.  Don't drop the ball.  Continue to look.  And that's what we've been doing.  And I want to acknowledge that.  Because if that wasn't clear before to anybody else out there,  I just want to make sure it was clear.  And so if it's the council's direction,  as long as I see a majority of you shaking your head,  if the feasibility of putting up a just kind of an overarching tent  with MISTERS,  then and if we see the multiple data,  the number of days of 100 degrees coming up down the road,  then you want me to get that up,  just give me the green light.  And it looks like if I see enough directives going with the head shakes,  I think I see direction.  So thank you.  That'll do it.  Thank you very much.  If I may, Mark,  I don't want to get in the way of something that you're already,  a direction you already have.  But, you know, it occurred to me when I'm hot on the back porch of my house,  just shade and a fan.  And some mist is all I need.  I certainly don't need to be inside of a tent.  So I don't know that being inside of something is necessary.  I think shade and mist is a great combination for keeping people cool.  So there, you know, a tent may technically be overdoing it.  But anyway, it's up to you, not me.  But I thought I would just add that.  I'll be clear that I actually agree.  I thought tent as a top.  A shade structure.  Yeah.  And that's what I took from it.  Yeah.  Thank you.  So it's 720.  Would council like to take a break or continue on?  Fine.  Okay.  Very good.  Item 5.2 is amendments to the Chico Municipal Code relating to abandoned vehicle abatement.  A report from, well, it says Tony Lindsey, but you're not Tony Lindsey.  Well, I'll throw this back to Tony Lindsey next time.  Sunday and Monday.  All right.  So we've got some time.  Good evening, Mayor Schwab, Vice Mayor Brown, Council Members.  The focus of the ABA program is to remove abandoned vehicles from public property  and also assist private property owners in removing abandoned vehicles.  Once the public makes a report of an abandoned vehicle,  code enforcement strives to tag that vehicle within three business days.  Once tagged, the last registered owner is notified,  as prescribed in the California Vehicle Code.  Our current waiting period per our municipal code is 30 days.  The amended ordinance before you will reduce that waiting period to 10 days,  complying with state law and surrounding jurisdictions' municipal codes.  After a waiting period, the vehicle may be towed.  The California Vehicle Code provides for the immediate towing of vehicles  that meet specific health and safety.  The vehicle may be towed if it is not in a safe place,  and if it is not in a safe place,  The ABA program is funded by a $1 fee collected with each annual vehicle registration.  Over the last five years, code enforcement has abated an average of 190 vehicles annually.  These are some examples of some of the vehicles that we tow under the ABA program.  Director Lindsey and I are available for any questions you guys have.  Questions?  Would you mind introducing yourself?  Yes.  I'm Charlene Durkin, Code Enforcement Officer.  Okay.  Thank you, Charlene.  Questions?  Thank you, Charlene.  Thank you.  How many comments did we receive online?  Okay.  Just a chance.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  We received nine comments on Engage.  I don't believe we received any under the public comment side.  And I believe, although I'm not sure, did Mike Jensen leave?  He did.  Okay.  So we do not have any speakers in the queue.  Okay.  Would you please read the names of the people who submitted comments?  Patty Dons.  Rob Berry. Patty Dons, Rob Berry, Jessica Montgomery, Kim Dietz, Meshachar, and I. Michelle Rulinger, Susan Smede, Nicole Nava, Julie Threat, and Juanita Sumner.  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  As counsel had enough time to review the comments.  So counsel is being asked to make one second.  Okay.  To adopt an ordinance and to read that, please.  Sure.  I'll move an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 10.52  of the Chico Municipal Code relating to abandoned vehicle abatement and amending, adding or  repealing provisions in Title 10.52 of the Chico Municipal Code for the Administration  Enforcement by the City's Code Enforcement Division.  So motion, is there a second?  Second.  You can have it, Council Member Huber.  Okay.  Thank you.  A motion by Council Member Stone and second by Council Member Huber.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Horry?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  Okay.  Item 5.3 is confirmation of department head contract and report by Mr. Orme.  Yes, Honorable Members of the Council, thank you very much.  Ms. Cannon unfortunately couldn't be with us this evening, so I have the privilege to  be able to give these reports to you as long as they don't fog up too much.  On the first item that you see before you, it is confirmation of an appointment of a  deputy director of public works engineering.  As you know, Director Ottavone has been tirelessly looking to fill the positions within his engineering  department and I will tell you, he has a great success in filling this position.  Section 605 of the city charter does say that the appointment of department heads, which  are subject to confirmation by the city council, and I will tell you that we've gone over  and above that and we would bring any even deputy director positions to council as we  did with Ms. Martin and others who have come forward in other departments.  So for transparency's sake more than anything else, an acknowledgement.  David Gianco holds a bachelor's in science in mechanical engineering from San Jose State  and he is licensed as a professional engineer with the state of California.  I've been very impressed.  I've engaged with him on a few occasions already and I will tell you his background  is exactly what the city was looking for.  Not only did he serve our country honorably as a captain in the Air Force, but also he  too worked for Caltrans District 3, which we're all very familiar with, in addition  to working previously for the California Transportation Commission.  So he's got an extensive background in particularly transportation projects and as you very well  know, we have been doing exceedingly well in getting grants for transportation projects.  And his expertise will come right in hand for the city into the future.  Now pursuant to how this all rolls out with regard to these types of contracts, I have  to say certain words in order to ensure they get into the public record.  So I will iterate those words for the council.  I am proposing to enter into an employment agreement on behalf of the city with David  Gianco as the deputy director of public works engineering.  And I, as the city manager, am also proposing to appoint David Gianco with an annual salary  of $125,000.  And as city manager, I'm recommending the city council confirmation of the appointment  of David Gianco as the deputy director of public works engineering.  With that, I'm happy to accept any questions and thank you for your consideration.  Questions?  Okay.  Thank you.  Did we have any comments submitted to us online?  And we have no persons here to speak to it.  Okay.  So we'll look for council direction.  Move approval.  Second.  So a motion to approve by Vice Mayor Brown and a second by Councilmember Schellman.  And I was incorrect.  We actually did receive two comments on Engage on this item for this contract from Kim Dietz  and Juanita Sumner.  Okay.  Thank you.  And I'm sorry, who made the second?  Thank you.  As council review the comments.  Okay.  Take a vote, please.  Councilmember Huber?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Orry?  Aye.  Councilmember Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Six characters?  Aye.  Okay.  Next item is item 5.4, another confirmation of department head contract.  Yes.  Honorable members of the council, I think I would have taken this one from Ms. Cannon  anyway.  It's really an honor and a privilege to be able to come up here today in pursuant to  the same section of our city charter 605.  The appointment of department heads needs to come for confirmation before the city council.  And this time you are looking at the appointment of our chief of police.  And the confirmation of his contract.  I've already given a speech on this a number of weeks ago.  And so I'm not going to reiterate that entire speech.  But it's an honor and a privilege to be able to bring before you a confirmation of our  next chief of police, Matt Madden.  He served the Chico Police Department since 1997.  An amazing steadfast career of excellence.  More than 27 years in total of law enforcement experience.  Dedicated 27 years.  And he's served 23 of those here at the Chico Police Department.  He's leveraged his skills in so many varying areas throughout the department.  I tried to find an area where he didn't serve in a sworn position and I couldn't.  From patrol to detectives to field training to SWAT to detective sergeant to watch and  tactical command, administration.  You already know over the past three years he's served as the deputy chief of police.  I will tell you it's an honor and a privilege to be able to have him here this evening.  And I believe that his family is here as well.  And it's my hope that you will confirm this appointment and then I will share with you  kind of the next steps once that vote is taken as to what you can expect to see after that.  So with that, I would humbly ask for your confirmation of this appointment.  Do you need to read that specific language again?  You know what?  Let's do that.  Thank you.  In compliance with government code 54953C3, I am going to make the statement of what needs  to be read into the record.  I, as city manager, am the person who is going to be reading this.  I am proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Matthew Madden as Chico's next  chief of police.  And as city manager, I am proposing to appoint Matt Madden with an annual salary of $170,000.  And as city manager, I am recommending council confirmation of the appointment of Matthew  Madden as the chief of police.  Thank you, Ms. Mann.  Okay.  So does council have any comments or questions?  Were there any public comments on this item?  We received four comments.  One was from the board and the engaged Chico component, Rob Berry, Michelle Rutlinger,  Julie Threat, and Juanita Sumner.  And do we have any members of the public here tonight that would like to address us?  We do not.  Does council need any additional time to read the comments?  So we'll look for action from the council.  Motion to approve.  Oh, we have a contest here.  You can have it again, council member Huber.  Okay.  Thank you.  No, you take this one.  Move approval.  I'll second.  Council member Huber?  Yes.  Council member Morgan?  Yes.  Council member Horry?  Aye.  Council member Stone?  Aye.  Vice mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Yes.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  Okay.  Okay. And next, City Clerk Presson will swear in Matt Madden as Chief of Police.  Okay.  So, Honorable Mayor, Mr. Council, I know that tonight is very special, not only for the city, but also for Chief Madden.  His wife, Jen, is here. I believe both sons made it, Sean and Kyle, but if not, one of them didn't make it.  And his daughter, Morgan, is here as well.  And what we're going to do before the swearing in is allow for Chief Madden's daughter, Morgan, to pin him with his new badge.  So, here we go.  Thank you.  Okay, I'm going to try to do this without crying.  His mother swore me in in 1992 when I first got elected, so it's an honor to be here.  You can raise your right hand and repeat after me.  I do solemnly swear.  I do solemnly swear.  That I will support and defend.  That I will support and defend.  The Constitution of the United States.  The Constitution of the United States.  And the Constitution of the State of California.  And the Constitution.  Against all enemies.  Against all enemies.  Against all enemies. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Against all enemies.  Against all enemies.  Against all enemies.  Against all enemies.  Against all enemies.  Against all enemies.  And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I'm about to enter.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Thank you Dave.  And thank you my fellow students.  Thank you Mark for the opportunity again.  And council, just know these are difficult times, but I have faith in your police department.  I have faith in this wonderful community.  I've served and honorably here for 23 years and I look forward to doing nothing more than  to continue my service to this city for the remainder of my career and do everything I  can to continue to make Chico beautiful, clean and safe.  So thank you.  And one more word.  I just want to acknowledge my son Kyle couldn't be here today.  Uh, he's gone.  Uh, he's a, uh, firefighter with Cal fire on the helicopter in Vina and they they're  out on fire.  So his captains, uh, had made plans to get him down here, but unfortunately they got  busy.  And one other person I want to just note is that my old buddy, Robert Smith is here with  me.  He's been a good friend and confident for me since we were little kids.  And I look forward to, uh, to, uh, our friendship, uh, lifelong friendship.  So thank you again.  It's an honor.  Chief Madden.  Yes.  I'm appreciative that you have confidence in us and in your, um, in your officers.  I want to let you know that we have confidence in you.  Thank you.  That means a lot.  I appreciate it.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Could we have a break?  Let's take a 10 minute break.  Ready?  Call the meeting back to order.  We're on item 5.6, consideration of designation of voting delegate for the League of California  City's annual conference.  Ms. Presson.  Thank you, Mayor Schwab and Vice Mayor Brown and the rest of the council.  This is a standard practice.  We do this every year.  The council gets to designate a voting delegate.  If it wishes to send someone to the League of California City's annual conference this  year, it's held on October 7th through the 9th and it's going to be in Long Beach.  And if there is a designee, then that person would be the voting delegate and can participate  in some of the other things and vote on behalf of the city's interest.  So I'll turn it back over to you to see if you would like to send someone this year.  And if so, please identify them.  Once you have done that tonight, then I will forward that on to the League of California City so they can prepare the paperwork.  Just really quickly, this is an in-person event.  I was going to ask the same thing.  If you'll allow me to interject, I'm on the board of the League of California City's and represent the Sacramento Valley Division.  The conference was going to be in Long Beach prior to COVID-19 regulations.  It's now a fully online.  Much more accessible.  Program that you can enjoy from your from your own office or your living space.  But it will be all online.  And I want to highlight that because I'd like to accentuate the opportunity to my colleagues.  I take significant value in the annual conference and most everything that the League of California City's does.  And I'm an active participant in many, many different capacities.  So if there are those that would like to join me, I will be at the conference and I'm happy.  There's nothing particularly fantastic about being a voting delegate since I'm going to be there.  I'm happy to serve in that capacity.  But by all means, I'd love it if all of my colleagues were joining me at the annual conference.  I'm guessing the fact that it's going to be online will reduce the fiscal impact.  Vice Mayor Brown, you were the delegate last year.  Yes.  Yeah.  Can you speak a little bit about that experience?  Yes.  So what I will say is that the experience of attending the conference was invaluable,  not just to kind of create collegial relationships with other folks who are serving in other communities,  but to learn so much while I was there.  The voting component of the conference happens at the end of the conference.  And so for whoever is the delegate, that person has to stay a little extra time to participate.  Last year, I believe that it was only one.  I believe that it was only one item to be voted on.  So it's, you know, it's an experience, but that's what I'll say.  The conference itself is really the most valuable experience.  Questions before we take public comment on this item?  Looks like we have at least four people unengaged.  Yes.  Any email?  No.  No emails.  And anybody in person?  No.  Okay.  So please read the names of the people that sent us comments.  Jackie Smith, Michelle Cooper, Nicole Nava, and Julie Three.  Everybody had a chance to read the comments?  I'll entertain a motion.  Okay.  If Vice Mayor Brown is open to it again, I would make a motion to designate her as the  delegate for this year.  Open to it.  For sure.  Are you attending the conference?  I will now.  Okay.  Well then I'll second the motion.  Okay.  So we have a motion from Council Member Huber to designate Vice Mayor Brown as the City's  voting delegate.  and seconded by Council Member Stone.  Council Member Huber? Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member Ory? Yes.  Council Member Stone? Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown? Aye.  Mayor Schwab? Aye.  It carries 6-0 with one absence.  And I was just going to ask Council Member Stone,  do you know when they'll be sending out revised information  so that I can get that out to everybody?  In their letter that I just received  that's part of the staff report,  it said these procedures assume that the conference  will be held in person at Long Beach Convention Center.  As planned, should COVID-19 conditions and restrictions  prohibit the league from holding an in-person conference,  new procedures will be provided,  but they don't give a timeline.  We've been provided with that information officially.  The decision came down.  Okay, so maybe I can look to see that,  and I'll get that out to you.  Great.  Yes.  I attended last year for the very first time,  and I'd like to know about how we can attend virtually.  Perfect. Thank you.  Okay.  Item 5.7 is Council Member Ory's request, Annie's Glen,  and this was continued from the 825 meeting.  Council Member Ory.  This item was authored and requested by constituents,  and I have the three requests are specifically from them,  and well thought out, I thought.  And if we could take them sort of individually,  I think that the first concerns,  specifically with Annie's Glen,  after our last discussion,  would be in the hands of city staff and city manager.  If he wants to comment tonight on that, that'd be fine.  But I would, I certainly don't see us tonight  making any kind of directive concerning Annie's Glen.  I would also like though to discuss the other two items.  Perhaps Mark, if you want to comment now or not.  Always happy to comment.  So, yeah, with regard to Annie's Glen,  it's one of our biggest concerns,  along with,  all of Lower Bidwell Park and all of Lindo Channel  and all of Comanche Creek.  There are a number of areas being impacted,  and so I will tell you that working with  our police department, our service providers,  and just a vast array of individuals  in conjunction with our homeless solutions coordinator  is gonna be essential to getting a solution to this.  One of the things that we found we can't just do  is go in and kick everybody out.  And we are working on a strategic initiative  to help manage this situation.  And it doesn't happen overnight.  Obviously the directive was just given last week.  And so staff has been diligently, as a matter of fact,  the last meeting before I came to this council meeting  was with regard to items surrounding this.  So from a strategic perspective, we are looking at the long term,  in addition to the interim solution,  we are looking at the long term solutions.  And we are very close to having some solutions.  However, none of them are easy.  If you would like for Deputy Chief Aldridge  to speak to how the police has been engaging on that front,  I know that they've been doing a diligent job  with regard to ensuring that the space from the shoreline  is being abided by to the best degree possible  with the resources we have.  But he's here if you would like to hear  how they're doing on that front.  But our goal is to get folks into a more healthy environment  and out of those spaces.  So that's staff's goal, but we don't have the plan  perfectly thought out yet.  So...  Sure.  Okay.  Deputy Chief Aldridge, if you want to speak to that,  that would be appreciated.  The chief's out celebrating.  Yeah.  Right.  His first duty was to delegate me to do this.  So thank you for having me.  Thank you for having me up here,  Honorable Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council members.  Just this week we had a meeting with some service providers  and city staff to talk about some of our options.  And right now, as the city manager alluded to,  we have to be strategic about the way we go about this.  We cannot, just because we've removed the council direction  and placed it back on the city manager,  just go in and be heavy-handed.  So we want to be a compassionate and professional organization  in the way we handle this.  So we brought together Joey Amaro with the Torres Shelter,  our staff, the new Homeless Outreach Coordinator, Susie,  and we talked about a way to systematically work through  this issue at hand.  And really the first issue we dealt with is that there are  50 beds available in the Torres Shelter right now.  Now, the only problem with that is that we have the need to test  folks for COVID before they are allowed in the facility.  Obviously, you know, we know why that is in place.  The problem with that is that it takes, you know,  five to seven days for a turnaround on a test.  And so when you're trying to get someone off the street and into  housing and you have this mechanism in place that we have  to work through, it just, it's problematic for us.  And so it's just another problem.  And so we're working through that.  And we're working through the portal that we're having to  figure out how to work through.  And one of the options that came through was, you know,  the potential for rapid COVID testing.  And we're trying to figure out if that is something that is  available to us and how we fund that piece through maybe some  leftover funding with the CARES Act or if it's, you know,  something that we can use with public health or just local  contracts with the hospital.  So we're working through those situations right now.  That's kind of the piece that we're hinging everything on right  now is how fast we can turn around that COVID test.  And if we can really turn that around quickly,  I think that we'll be able to get someone housed,  enter the shelters, and then start to solve some of those  problems in those high visible areas that our communities take an  issue with.  So Council Member Ory's request was about Annie's Glen.  We've continued to go through there on a daily basis.  We've been very patient with our target team to make contact  with the folks that are in there.  And we've given them options.  We've let them know what we're working on.  We've been very compassionate with them.  We're being, you know, very patient with allowing them to  move their items when we ask them to stay within that, you  know, that 50-foot distance we've identified away from the  water line.  And so we've got a good relationship going right now.  Everyone knows what the plan is.  We've made that very clear.  And we hope that, you know, moving forward,  the options that we've worked on Monday will come to fruition  hopefully within the next week.  And we'll have a better answer for you in terms of how quick we  can turn around this COVID test, get those folks into the shelters,  and then start solving the problem a little systematically and not just  go in and try to bring everybody out at one point and try to put them  in a shelter when we don't have the ability to do that right now.  So, again, I just want to say that, you know, everything we're doing  has been with the utmost of compassion and professionalism, and we have  a strategic plan to systematically deal with that.  It's just going to take a little bit of time as we work through these  small pickups that we have to deal with.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Deputy Chief Aldridge, I appreciate your report today, and you're  providing some background and understanding as to why it's so  important that these things can't happen overnight.  I'm especially glad that that message is getting out to the public because  what I'm hearing from the public is that's not what they're hearing from  staff, and I know that's not the case.  I know you're attempting to relocate as much as possible, which really is  not exactly in your task or shouldn't be in your task in the first place,  my personal opinion, and not because you're unwilling or incapable, but  it's a tremendous draw on resources.  So I appreciate you stating that just the way that you did, that these  things take time, and we're trying to place people as systematically as we  can.  There are other restrictions that are outside of our control, and if that  message can continue to get out through all of staff, it will help with a lot  of the misinformation that we have throughout the community about what's  really happening in those waterways.  Thank you.  Deputy Chief Aldridge, so is what you're saying specific to people at  Annie's Glen, or is it city water?  You're talking about this program applying to people citywide.  So just to clarify, the issue we're talking about, you're talking about  COVID testing and getting folks into shelter?  Yes.  That's across the board.  We're specifically talking about Annie's Glen now and how we're dealing with  that, but across the board, if we want to take someone from the five-mile area  and move them into shelter, it still applies.  It's not just by location.  It's citywide that we have to abide by these rules with the toilet.  We have to abide by the rules with the public health guidelines, and we're  keeping everyone safe, and we're not spreading potential COVID around the city.  Great.  Thank you.  And I appreciate your rhetoric on this topic.  I think it's important that we sound compassionate, and I appreciate that  you've been very clear about that.  I think you've added that to your rhetoric.  Thank you.  Other questions?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  To move on, the other feedback we got was the prior response to a fire near Annie's  Glen.  I don't know if the Chief is here.  Yes.  Okay.  Chief Standridge, if you could please make your way to the main hall.  It was almost comical to hear the neighbors describe our largest ladder truck, probably  the largest ladder truck north of Sacramento, taking quite a bit of time getting into the  area.  And I've read the Chief's explanation of that.  Perhaps all that would be helpful would be to have that explanation more widely distributed.  On the other hand, I seem to remember that we were acquiring smaller fire trucks for  service in the park, and wondered whether or not a different response to Lower Park  fire other than the truck that we're right now assigning to it.  I'm certainly not going to micromanage that.  I'm sure I've been able to reach your response.  But I thought it would be an opportunity to discuss the difficulties of us providing fire  protection in the park.  So I'll address your first question.  Our protocols are the closest unit, and so the truck has some water capability that we  can utilize for rapid attacks on fire.  So we've been able to get some water.  We take the closest unit to respond there, get a size up, and then address the issue  as quickly as possible.  If additional resources are needed, then the other resources come from different areas.  So with respect to vegetation and wildland fires, we utilize a complement of different  resources to include our fire engines and our Type 3 wildland trucks, which are out  of Station 5 and Station 5.  So we'll talk about that later.  And then we'll talk about the configuration for the truck.  So it takes time for them to get over to anywhere in the city, so the closest unit will usually  pick it up.  I can't speak specifically.  Usually the truck isn't tasked to a vegetation fire, so I'd have to look back at specifically  why they went.  If it came in as a structure fire, that would dictate that they would have responded to  that as well.  Our responses to vegetation fires in the city, in the core of this city, we don't have any  is pretty rapid. We have pretty good access and we have some specialized  apparatus as well as the UTV that we can utilize if we have some really difficult  areas to get into. It boils down to the boots on the ground and getting in with  tools, water packs, hose lines to get in and actually extinguish the fire as we  as we get to it. So our biggest concern right now is on the eastern edge of  where our highest risks are are what we would either be moderate to high to high  risk areas. We've identified those through our evacuation zones and those  are what we want to concentrate on with respect to helping mitigate the human  activity in there that could cause fires from escaping and getting into the  vegetation and light grasses that can spread those fires rapidly. Hopefully I  answered your question.  And it's my understanding you met with the neighbors like the day after with the  mayor?  I've spoken to a number of the neighbors that reached out to me directly. We had  crews talk to some of the neighbors the day of the incident and so we've maintained  contact with them as to their concerns. One of the things I've tried to do and I made  the presentation to council last year, last July, because of the concerns about a  potential fire coming through the city.  And indicated that the lower park and the lower greenways are less concerning because of the vegetation that we had the fuel load the orientation of the topography and the wind patterns that are here dominantly north-  south. So it doesn't have that tendency to throw through in a concentrated area and areas that would  move their fire.  fire. It's not to say we couldn't have a fire like we did in Annie's Glen that could potentially  get into the lighter fuels, move up to a home, catch the fuels that are the fences and shrubs  and so forth that people have in their homes and eventually get into a house. It's conceivable,  but it's not as big a concern as I would have on the eastern side of the city.  I can work with the city manager. The response you gave to Mark a bit ago explaining this  could probably be provided to the neighbors? Correct. As they've reached out independently,  I've given them the same information that I just indicated to you as well. Thank you.  Other council members have questions? Yeah, Chief Stambridge.  Yes.  So which department cites and enforces infractions that have to do with campfires? Is that your  department or is that the police department?  No, we handle the administrative citations through the code enforcement. I work with  Tony Lindsey, who's my de facto fire marshal, so he handles that end of it. So if somebody  has an illegal burn on their private property, then we can do an administrative citation.  If it's a fire, we can do an administrative citation.  If it's in the public right-of-way, it becomes a criminal issue, and so we've referred over  to PD, and when they have the resources available, then they can come out and handle it. The  biggest challenge we have is actually finding a responsible party, and that's not always  easy. What we try to note in our reports is anything factual. Was there a homeless encampment  nearby? Was there a witness?  Yes.  That can indicate who actually started the fire, how it started, and so forth, but we're  very reluctant to just cast aspersions without definitive information. We can just note the  facts as we see it. So it gets challenging in terms of even finding an individual that's  responsible for setting the fire and then providing information to PD, then to try to  come back and locate that individual if we have somebody as a person of interest.  Sure.  Do you happen to know what the penalties are for an open fire, open campfire infraction?  I don't. I'd have to look that up. I'm certainly happy to get it to you, though.  Okay. Thank you.  Okay.  Other questions or comments?  Okay. Thank you.  Okay. Thank you.  The third part of the discussion from the neighbors is actually the reason I asked that this be continued over, even though we had the other action. continued over even though we had the other action. The fairgrounds' response to disaster has been incredible. It's been  Umm ...  Umm ... from the Orville  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  and still continue to be very proud of the fair,  recognizing that they have a mission  more than just being our agricultural exhibit  and district fair.  But it is a state facility.  It's not well known, I think, in the general community  that it is a state property, that it's policed by CHP,  that the governing board is appointed by the governor,  and there is a responsibility.  We have these entities that we very much need to assist us  with emergency response to our current disaster,  the university, the schools,  the recreation district, and the fair.  And I know that these are folks  that we're gonna have to continue to work with  for many years.  And so it's hard to,  to step up and demand for our constituents what's necessary.  I understand the reluctance of any of those entities  to open up their facilities,  and we've mentioned churches too,  because they can refer back to one government dictate  or another that would excuse them from doing this.  But it just seems to me that in this particular facility,  that we need to ask,  in the sternest manner possible,  that we find some way that this facility can be used  to assist us with the homeless  that are subject to extreme heat,  will someday be, shortly be,  the monsoons of November and December will come upon us,  and in this COVID environment.  And we've heard tonight,  it was an eye opener to hear that we can't use beds  that are already open.  So maybe it's not effective of our time  to talk about opening up more shelter beds,  but they're needed.  And we need to figure out how to get folks  into the shelter beds,  but also to create space for camping, space for shelter,  space perhaps even for tiny homes  in a facility like the Fairgrounds.  And so what I think is needed,  and I think it's important,  is a specific ask of the Fair.  I can imagine the Fair even now,  hearing that Ori has brought this up,  it's like, oh, you know, the heels are getting dug in.  But if we can explain,  and if we have a specific request,  that we're not talking necessarily long-term.  If we can come up with a timeline, I think that helps.  If we can identify specific areas,  even though the Fair right now,  the Fairgrounds is being used as a fire defense personnel,  you know, there are perhaps the backside  where the RVs are currently parked  or a facility or two that may be available.  I don't know what happened to the old armory  that was a school.  I haven't been there.  I haven't made an assessment of what's available,  but what I think the council needs is that dialogue  where it's not just, no, there's nothing, you know,  no vacancy, but if we can work with them  and find a space there that is available,  the RV space, of course, have septic and water,  which is two of our biggest needs.  And so what I've been told is that a mere request  doesn't do it, that to able to engage  a state facility at the highest level,  that we should make a official formal request  citing the emergency situation.  So my request is that we do make that formal request  with the assistance of the city attorney  in a form that would trigger an emergency response  by a state-owned facility and assisting us with finding  alternative space that's designed for this kind of use.  And if it turns out at the end of the day that there is  no workable solution, that's fine,  but I think if we get a specific ask by working with the fair  and finding out what's available and putting it in a form  that allows them to, and us, to use the,  you know, these unique circumstances to get us from  where we are today to where we want to be,  that we do need something in the short term  that allows us to respond to the encamped homeless  that are subject to COVID in a safe  and hopefully economical manner.  So when you talk about specifics,  it may be that we would like to have an area  that would shelter or permit camping for 100 people, say,  for a specific period of time.  I don't see the fairgrounds as the absolute final solution.  No.  And I would guess that we would get much more cooperation  from the board if we specify a time and conditions  of what we want to do.  And we've also been told that the state's paying fairly well  for them to house the fire defense folks,  and they might ask the same of us.  So I think the negotiations can be friendly and effective,  but I think that they,  I would like this council to make that request,  not a specific request,  but just the fact that we want that dialogue  and that we want it under the terms of an emergency.  And then we'll work from there.  Questions, comments?  I just have a question for the skipper.  Would housing this under the auspices of an emergency  somehow be different from the dialogue  and the emails you sent to the fairgrounds  and the state already?  Aren't you just kind of taking a red stamp and going,  oh, now it's an emergency  and repeating the work you've already done?  I mean, I understand where Mr. O'Rourke is coming from.  I just want you,  if we're just sending you back,  back to the well and ask for things  that they can't deliver or don't want to deliver.  Yeah, it's a good question.  I asked myself that same question  when this got on the agenda,  and it may benefit us.  Having a formal letter from a recognized elected body,  from the mayor of that body on behalf of the council,  you know, I think it may.  In my conversations with the state,  I was on the phone again today with the governor's office,  and,  you know, I advised them that this was on there,  and the council may make a determination  to send a formal request.  And candidly, he said exactly what you said.  We need a determinate number of how many individuals  and the period of time,  and that would help us in that evaluation.  So if council does proceed with this authorization  to send the letter, it may benefit us.  I don't know for certain, but I would recommend, as,  as Council Member Horry eloquently stated,  we need to have a little bit of specifics in that letter,  and then allow for that conversation to continue.  I've already connected our homeless solutions coordinator  with some individuals that the governor's,  one of his deputy, deputy secretaries,  deputy cabinet secretaries,  connected me with two individuals in their housing unit  to dialogue further,  but a formal letter from the council may benefit this,  obviously Council Member Horry's been a part of that board before.  He understands the inner workings a lot better than I do,  and so it may very well benefit us.  So, to answer your question.  Thank you.  Yep.  Are there questions before we open it up to the public?  So how many individuals have sent us messages?  So via Engage Chico platform, we received 21 comments  on this item.  And,  did we receive any public comments?  Checking.  No, we did not.  And we do have one speaker in person.  Okay.  And the comments, Debbie,  would have been on all three aspects of the?  Correct.  It would have been on the, just the whole item.  They didn't break, they may have broken them out.  I haven't read them all to see them.  Okay.  All right.  Can you please read the names of the people who sent us?  Comments.  Yes.  And I will note that it's on the last four pages  of the comment section.  For some reason, they're out of order  when the report was generated.  So we have Cry Bear, Lauren Kohler, Caroline E.,  Crystal Santo, Jackie Smith, Jody Taylor, Danielle Mutes,  Philanita Betterchuck, Rob Berry, Robin Engle,  Jessica Montgomery, Kim Deets, Michelle,  Michelle Rutlinger, Michelle Cooper, Susan Smead,  Nicole Nava, Kimberly Berth, Amy Marie, Julie Threat,  Margaret Hicks, and Juanita Sumner. Okay.  Will there be next time?  Will there be next time?  Will there be next time?  Will there be next time?  Will there be next time?  Will there be next time? [inaudible]  All right.  All right.  Ms. Council had an opportunity to read all the comments.  Okay.  All right.  So we have one speaker, and that's Robin Engel.  Yes.  Okay.  Good evening again.  I had prepared a totally different talk, and I'm just going to give off the cup now,  because I really, really appreciate that you've been so thoughtful.  And tonight feels like there's a more kind and gentle approach to the challenges that we're having in Chico,  and I really appreciate that.  I am so relieved and glad to hear from you, Mark,  that there won't be any just getting, you know,  ousting people from Annie's Glen.  That will not be happening.  I have spent a fair amount of time doing outreach with the folks who are living at Annie's Glen,  at Comanche Creek, at different parts of the park.  I also spent a fair amount of time interacting with Silver Dollar Fairgrounds  in the aftermath of the campfire.  Helping a young man just survive emotionally, physically, and always.  And so as a social worker, too, I'm kind of speaking from that perspective.  It's the more that we respect and show integrity for other human beings,  the more able they are to achieve their potential.  And it's really nice to hear about,  about a more kind and gentle approach.  And I've seen from these people, I've been treated so beautifully and so generously.  They've offered me food when I go to give them water or a sandwich.  And they've been, helped me pick up trash without me having to ask.  They've offered to help me pick up trash.  They get up and help pick up trash.  And when you treat people with respect and kindness,  they,  they return that.  And they feel better about themselves.  As a therapist, the main issue that I help my clients with  is a sense of worthiness versus worthlessness.  And when people are treated like trash and they're discarded or criminalized  for simply trying to survive in the best way they can with no resources,  then we don't get the best from them.  So I'm, again, I'm just really glad to hear this shifting of the narrative.  And there's no easy solutions.  And there's, obviously, I can't cover everything I want to say within this short amount of time.  I don't, I have to say, I think that a letter about a silver dollar is worth the effort.  I don't have hope in that.  I know it's been mired.  That property's been mired in tensions for years.  I didn't have a great experience with them.  And from the young man and others,  I talked to who stayed there in the aftermath of the campfire.  It wasn't positive either.  So I just want to say that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So we'll look for direction from counsel.  I would move that we send a letter to the fair board  citing the emergency situation  and asking for an immediate response.  As to any availability of the fairgrounds  to assist us with providing shelter for  those homeless impacted by COVID  and the extreme heat.  Second.  And that would be cc'd to the governor's office?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  So, Mr. Ory, is this motion only really addressing item number three of your list?  As of this motion?  It sounds like you're just,  all you're talking about at this point is item number three  from your list of three items that you...  Right.  I'm only asking for action on the fairgrounds.  I think we...  Yes.  Thank you.  Council Member Ory,  is there any desire to put a time limit on it?  Or do we give discretion to staff to frame that?  Or...  Timeline.  Timeline on submitting the letter?  No.  But you had mentioned that this would be a temporary use  and that that might be a way to kind of collaborate.  So, is there a time limit that you have in mind?  Your question's, I think, above my pay grade.  It's, you know, how long?  I don't know.  How much of the facilities that we'll be able to have access to?  What kind of facilities?  I don't know.  I know that we've tested the city staff,  and they've been very supportive of us.  I think they actually volunteered that.  And I hope that this is one of the tools  that they'll address in the next couple weeks.  What I don't know is how much it's being used.  And I think that's what I would hope  that the city staff would do for us  as we address this letter  is to figure out what's available.  It's actually on both ends.  I'd love to know a count of how many...  encampments, how many people are encamped in the park.  I don't know if we have a number.  I don't know if it's 300 or 100.  But I also don't know yet what would work best.  And I know I'm going on and answering more than your question,  but I get it what the fair board's facing.  I was told that just recently,  they evicted the final RV from the campfire three years ago.  And I can imagine,  the idea that we suddenly are going to house,  you know, hundreds of folks.  But I think as we get more specific with them,  if we can actually have a dialogue with them,  not a question of if, but when and how,  I think that this is something  that needs to be available to us as a community.  Thank you.  Any other discussion?  We have a vote.  Okay.  City Clerk.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Ory.  Aye.  Council Member Stone.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Aye.  Mayor Schwab.  Aye.  Carry 6-0 with one absent.  Okay.  We'll move to reports and communication.  The following reports and communication items  are provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken under items,  under this section,  unless the council includes to include it  on a subsequent agenda.  Do we have a city management report, Mr. Orem?  Yes.  Honorable members of the council,  just a couple of quick items.  I want to make sure that,  I know the council's aware of these,  but I want to make sure the public's aware as well.  Meter enforcement.  We received a letter from the downtown Chico Business Association  requesting that we look at the possibility  of putting meters back in order and enforcing them.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  Umm ...  start enforcement once again.  And so the meter enforcement will be back in gear.  You'll have to feed those meters when you're in front  of businesses or on the street,  but when you're in a city parking lot, it'll still be free.  So we're kind of meeting everybody in the middle  on this one and hopefully that'll help the community.  But I want to make sure that that's out there.  Press release will go out tomorrow.  If I could, please.  Does that include the parking structure would be free?  That's a great question at this point in time.  Yes, I think it would be,  but let me get clarity on that one.  It's a, yeah, it's a park, it's considered a parking lot.  So yes, it would still be free.  It's only the on street that we're focused on.  The other item I wanted to make sure and touch base on is  there were a stack of items that obviously council  was working towards and engaged in.  We've been able to get through a number of them  over the past couple of meetings.  But one of them I wanted to make sure that you're aware of  is that Governor Newsom did sign a ban on the sales  of flavored tobacco products.  I know that was an item that this council  was very interested in evaluating.  And so it looks like that one's been done.  So I just want to make sure council's aware of that.  And so it's likely staff won't have  to put that on the front burner anymore.  It can kind of sit back there because the state has moved  forward with that law.  That happens a lot.  Yeah.  I mean, if I may comment on how great I think the council  and staff have been being proactive on issues  that eventually the governor signs,  whether it was renter protections or plastic bag  bans or all kinds of things.  We have taken the charge on this and then had the governor over.  And so I think that's a great way to push it statewide.  Thanks.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  And then finally, one of the items  you approved earlier today at 2.1,  I got an interesting idea from a community member who  said on your neighborhood park naming, maybe in the future  you can kind of see if we can create a program where maybe  a school, a local school in the area can help choose some names.  And it comes to the city and the city  comes and recommends one of those top five  from the students.  Just looking at some of those more creative community  engagement opportunities.  And I just wanted to make sure that you're aware of that.  I thought it was a great idea.  It's a good idea.  And maybe we can look at deploying that at a future date  when we have another naming of a community park.  And so with that, that's all I've got.  So yeah, thank you.  OK, good.  We'll move to council member requests.  Pursuant to APMP 1010, council members  may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future  meeting.  After stating what that item would be,  the majority vote of council is needed in order  for staff to agendize.  Council members may also submit requests  in writing.  We have two requests in writing.  And after we hear those, we'll hear any verbal requests.  So item A is council member Orre submitting a request  to discuss allowing a card room in downtown.  I need to recuse myself because I  have a leasehold on property at 247 Main Street  in the heart of downtown Chico.  Council member Orre, you take it away.  My interest in asking to consider further consideration  for a further agenda item on this  was the promise of revenue.  Got to know John pretty well during the campaign  four years ago.  We are on a mission.  We are obviously on very different political spectrums.  But it seemed to me that if there was an opportunity  to generate between $50,000 and $100,000,  I don't know if it's pie in the sky,  that that in our times needs to be considered.  So that's why it's in front of us.  I guess I have to admit I have some kind of nostalgic bias  and that I may not be, you know, I very much would like to be a  part of that.  I would like to hear what others' experience is.  My wonderful father raised 14 children.  One day a week he escaped the home and went to Gardena  and played cards.  He told us he was making car payments.  He was successful enough.  I don't doubt that at all.  And my wonderful brother who I just lost spent his last three  years in cancer living for the opportunity to play cards  at the local casino.  But maybe there is an element here that is not compatible  with the downtown.  I don't know.  Somebody today was describing the card room on Hilltop  in Reading as a friendly city accepted gambling  and entertainment.  And I don't know if Hilltop is necessarily a downtown.  And maybe that's the idea is that we keep our card room  on the edges of town.  But it just seemed to me that if it really is a revenue  generator and is a spot in the downtown that is accessible  to parking and away from some of the core areas of downtown  that it could be considered.  Thank you.  Any questions from council?  Do we take public comment individually on these items?  How many comments do we have in the engagement?  Will there be a complimentary complimentary complimentary  complimentary  complimentary  complimentary  complimentary  complimentary  complimentary  complimentary  complimentary !  complimentary  the  complimentary  proposal from John Scott, if not recently, a couple weeks ago. I might not be aware of that, but...  Let's take a moment to review the comments on the Engage Chico platform before we continue discussing.  So one public comment on the email was from Mike Trollander and the comments are from Jody Taylor,  Daniel Mutz, Lanita Federchuk, Rob Berry, Jessica Montgomery, Michelle Rutlinger, Michelle Cooper,  Gary Vertel, Julie Threat, and that's the last one.  Thank you.  Has Council had time to review the comments? Any other questions?  I just have a comment. So I voted against this when they wanted to put it at, I think it was 3rd and Main.  We got a lot of feedback from people, well this isn't the kind of people we want in downtown, da da da da da, you know, the typical NIMBYism thing.  I think the DCB got involved a little bit as well. Since then, Mr. Scott has operated the card room over by wherever it is off of East.  It's a fairly run and clean establishment. There's no problem with the police department. So I'm voting yes to hear it.  I mean, I know we have the proposal, but that all has to come back. I'm not saying yes, this is a thing, but I do try, doesn't always work, I do try to say yes to councilmember requests to talk about things.  And I think it's worth discussing.  if for no other reason I don't know what downtown's  gonna look like if Chico State closes in spring  and we're gonna need all the help we can get.  Any other questions, Council Member Hubert?  Yeah, just to be frank, I'm not thrilled with the idea.  However, I'm moved by your story about your dad.  That actually, I appreciated that.  So I will vote to hear it even though I don't feel  like I'm particularly excited about it.  I'm gonna vote to hear it as well.  I definitely want more information and to dig into it  and I feel the conversation is worth having.  I saw so much opposition from the DCBA and Chamber  that I mean, I'm not opposed to the discussion, I suppose,  but because it sounds like we're gonna have the discussion,  I think I'm gonna oppose it just to make that mark.  It's not enticing to me, but I can generally support  the discussion and my colleague wanting to bring this forward,  but it's just in all seriousness,  I don't know how I can get there,  but since it sounds like it's going to pass,  I appreciate my colleagues taking that effort.  And with that, I'll entertain a motion.  I move we agendas.  We have a motion on the floor.  Yes, Mr. Orme.  With the motion and the second, just for clarity,  it's just for conversation or discussion between staff  and the council, not necessarily to authorize a permit.  I just making sure.  This is a request to agendas.  Yes.  Okay, just for the record.  Yeah.  So we have a motion on the floor from Council Member Orme  and a second from Council Member Huber.  Further discussion?  All right, let's call the roll.  Council Member Huber.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Orme.  Aye.  Council Member Stone.  All the respects, nay.  Okay.  Vice Mayor Brown.  Aye.  And Mayor Schwab is recused.  So that carries four with one no,  one absence and one recusal.  I would hope that this doesn't take priority  over some of the other longer pending items that we have.  We'll process that quickly, Carl.  Okay.  Thank you.  Next item is Council Member Stone  is requested to discuss needle, waste and cleanup.  Okay, thank you very much.  Again, this is harking back to a request  that I originally made in March of 2018,  remade in April of 2018.  It was died a slow and ugly death  at Internal Affairs Committee in June of 2018.  We tried to liaise with the county,  which was the outcome of the Internal Affairs Committee,  on this specific issue,  dealing with needle, waste and cleanup.  And what I said then was,  we know we have an errant needle problem,  again, March of 2018.  North Valley Harm Reduction Center didn't exist  until I think later on in that year.  To just bring your mind back on what this request was.  We have an errant needle problem.  I've seen some needles in the wild.  I suppose many of us have,  for those that have done creek cleanups in the past.  We know we have a problem.  There are organizations that contract  to clean up this needle waste.  And I've seen some of their marketing proposals.  But more importantly,  I know that there are communities throughout the country  that have been successfully administering it,  whether it's through volunteer efforts or contract services,  or using, if they had a needle exchange,  that organization being specifically set aside  with a budget for that specific cleaning.  And I don't care.  What I know is, in 2018, we asked for,  what other communities are doing to clean up waste?  And now when I look at that,  I can see all of the cities in 2018,  throughout the country,  that were addressing needle waste and needle cleanups  as a municipal function.  Again, not an exchange.  And as part of that,  what I had suggested the city look into,  because this was my own concept,  was a cash redemption value for the needles themselves.  That didn't seem to go far.  Nobody else had done anything,  and we weren't going to be blazing the trail on that particular issue.  The bottom line, cleaning up the needle waste in the community  or making sure that it is administered  was the central effort that I was looking for.  And now that we have a larger problem on our hands than we did in 2018,  and we couldn't get any successful outcomes  from the coordination with the county,  we still have the problem of needle waste,  and it needs to be addressed.  And we know Santa Cruz, a community in Massachusetts,  communities all over the United States  that are addressing this and successfully addressing it  without being budget breakers.  Also in 2018, as we were discussing,  sharps containers within the community  where we can depend and know  that people are probably using in those areas based on debris,  providing...  steel containers.  This is something we've brought up before.  Council Member Huber, I know that you and I have talked about this in open session.  And I just, as I see other communities  that are having success like this  in community after community without being budget breakers,  I'm befuddled as to why we can't do something similar.  And there are a lot of proposals out there,  and again, I'm not the expert in this field,  but I'd like us to get some experts in the field  either here or to talk to us about this.  And we will take the opportunity to address  how other communities are addressing that  and implement those solutions.  We've been sitting on this to some extent.  We've had some other distractions as well.  And challenges in incorporating other jurisdictions,  whether that's CARD or the county or somebody else in these efforts.  I'd like to see us redouble the efforts  and take a look at what wasn't in the Internal Affairs Committee report in 2018,  those things that were happening in 2018,  and 2019, and 2020 that have been successful.  Because they do exist, and they were existing in 2018.  And I'd like to see that and how that might work in our community.  So this is just a request to agendize.  That's the intention of the request.  It's almost a repeat of what I did in 2018.  And so I'm looking for council support to agendize this  and have staff bring forward a report.  Does the council have any questions?  We received comments on this.  Yes, under the, or through the Engage Chico platform,  we received 18 comments.  And I don't know, did we get any?  No public comments via the public comment email account.  And we do not have any speakers signed up to speak on it.  Okay. We will review the comments as you read the names of the people who submitted them.  Caroline E. Crystal Santo.  Jody Taylor.  Danielle Mutz.  Lanita Feddarchuk.  Rob Berry.  Jessica Montgomery.  Roxanne Eldridge.  Dustin Bargis.  Kim Dietz.  Michelle Rutlinger.  Chanel Fowler.  Susan Smead.  Nicole Nava.  Kimberly Burke.  Amy Marie.  Margaret Hicks.  And Juanita Sumner.  Does council have time to read all the comments?  I think we have a little bit more.  Okay.  So we have a few more comments.  Let me know when you're ready.  All right.  So is there a motion?  We have a motion.  Is there a second?  I'll second it.  Any other comments before we vote?  Seeing none, if we could have the vote, please.  Yes.  Council, I'm sorry.  My mic was not on.  Councilmember Huber.  Aye.  Councilmember Morgan.  Yes.  Councilmember Orry.  Aye.  Councilmember Stone.  Aye.  Councilmember Brown.  Aye.  Councilmember Brown.  Aye.  with a resolution for council consideration  called the Medicare for All Resolution,  and I'd like the council to discuss  endorsing the resolution.  It's presented or sponsored  by the Butte County Healthcare Coalition.  I think it's worth our commitment and our time,  and so I'm requesting that we agendize the discussion.  I'll move.  Second.  Questions?  Who was the motion made by?  Council Member Stone.  Okay, thank you.  And Mr. Huber, did you have a question?  I saw you put your hand up.  Okay.  Any other questions?  All right.  Can I have a vote, please?  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Ory?  I've consistently asked us  not to consider things out of our purview,  like state propositions  and other things that we've counted on,  so to be consistent,  I've had to throw away the !  Umm !  Fred Davis took the fall for the action of annexing the mall.  He really wasn't all that in favor of it, but the council pushed him to it.  But to make that work and to sweeten the deal, we shared sales tax with the county.  I think naively we thought it was a one-time deal,  but it had been now in place for how many years?  And so it's been suggested that we could vacate that decision.  I don't know if that's true.  I don't know consequences of doing that or the mechanism,  but I would like to agendize a discussion of reverting to standard sales tax distribution.  And...  Um...  ...  I don't know how to better phrase it.  I'm sure those in Finance Committee and others would be able to do it better for me,  but I think the understanding is that right now we're over and above standard practice.  We're committing, what, a fourth of a cent?  Can you remind me what the distribution is?  Yeah, I think it's half a percent, or is it a quarter, Chris?  Five.  Oh.  Five percent, sorry.  Yeah, five.  It's a...  Yep.  Yeah.  And going forward, given the vulnerability of our economy and of our budget,  I think it ought to be discussed.  I'd like to know whether it's a real thing or if it's just something that we're committed to long-term.  So that's my request, that that be agendized for discussion and a report from the city staff.  Would you like that at Finance?  I'm sorry?  Sorry.  I was just going to say, to clarify, the mall was the only mall back in the 80s, the North Alley Plaza Mall.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As we call it, the old mall.  The old mall.  Yeah.  The teeth mall.  Do you want to send this to the Finance Committee, or do you want that here?  It would eventually come back here anyway.  I don't know if it's even viable before we put any more time into it.  Okay.  Okay.  And if it ends up being a discussion at budget time, which is only a month away.  So I'll move to agendize the item.  Is there a second?  Okay.  So the motion by Council Member Stone, second by Council Member Ori.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Ori?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  Council Member Ori, number two.  I learned yesterday that the final appeal on the lawsuit, City v. Ori and MTJ,  and Mulholland v. City Council, were finally litigated.  The appeals were dropped, were rejected.  So all...  All parts of the litigation that started over three years ago by the council previous to ours  has now been fully shown to have been a wrong decision,  a decision that was rejected by the courts,  a decision that, in my memory, rejected the city clerk's recommendation of how we should proceed with...  with the referendum.  And it cost us a lot of money.  It cost us well over $100,000 by the last time we had an accounting.  I think the public needs to know what the cost of that decision was.  So my motion is to ask for an accounting of all city funds that were spent to support the litigation against the referendum  and to ask our...  our attorney if we have any recourse on recovering those funds.  Questions?  Is there a motion?  So moved.  Second.  Okay.  So I have a motion by Council Member Stone and vice...  and seconded by Vice Mayor Brown.  To clarify the motion, the motion is to...  have a report on the costs of the...  the litigation and both monetary and non-monetary  to the Council and a discussion of that expense.  I couldn't...  It's so muffled, it's hard.  Monetary...  I think I... I restated your... your motion.  But you also included advice on whether we have recourse in recovering the funds.  Yes. Yes.  Thank you.  Whether there's recourse as well.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Orry?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absent.  Okay.  And then Mr. Morgan.  Thank you, Mayor Schwab.  So in light of our approving a discussion to clean up needle waste, I'd like to make  a request.  We agendize a discussion to draft whatever is necessary to ban needle distribution in  the future, be it land use, permits, whatever.  Make it impossible if we're going to go around cleaning all this stuff up.  We need to not revisit this.  And I'm happy to draft said letter explaining if agendizing it is possible.  Questions?  Is this a request to agendize a discussion about whether or not to have a ordinance?  You don't expect an ordinance in front of us as we're discussing?  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Is there a motion?  I'll make my own motion to attend.  I'll second.  We have a motion by Council Member Morgan and a second by Council Member Huber.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Orry?  Aye.  Council Member Stone?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Brown?  Aye.  Mayor Schwab?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one absence.  Okay.  Any other council members with requests?  Seeing none, we will prepare to go into closed session.  Are there any public comments on the items for closed session?  No.  No.  Okay.  And are there any council members with qualifications?  Seeing none, we will adjourn to closed session.  closed session or recessed closed session.
