 All right, everybody. Good morning. Just a quick introduction. My name is Dale Fletcher. I'm the building official deputy director here at the City of Chico. Brendan Feig in the back. He's the director for community development. He was instrumental with helping us get this set up for everybody here today. Same with Ron Beeler. I will welcome Phillip Henry in just a moment. Just kind of want to do a little house clean first. So I mentioned real quick, restrooms, parking, if you came in and you didn't hear, we've asked that the local police be light on parking tickets because it is pay when you park here in our area. So if you do happen to get a ticket, please let us know. You can contact me directly. And if you have a pen handy, I will give you a phone number and an email address. So it's dale.fletcher at chicoc.gov. I always want to go org or gov, so I just want to make sure Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg So if you are looking at certification or recertification, you would want to get the preferred. But these would go for the non-preferred provider. We just didn't have enough time to get that all set up for today's event. So it's my understanding that Phillip has had that in the past, and he may want to talk about that in the future. But hopefully, if this one goes as well as it looks like it's going to, maybe we can do another one on the building code or another code addition, and then bring in some more CEUs. As far as eating goes, I just want to make sure that right around lunchtime, we're going to be breaking out of here. There's some maps that are on the table if you didn't already get one. It's wonderful. I'm fairly new to Chico, and I can say firsthand. The food in the area is fantastic. It's really good. And the downtime vibe, you might say, everybody's super friendly. So if you have any questions, I mean, don't be afraid to just ask, and somebody will point you in the right direction. So it's a lot of fun. It's been very enjoyable for me here. I also want to say thank you to, obviously, City of Chico for bringing this together. We've got the Valley Contractors Exchange, and we have the Chico Builders. Association and the Butte County Development Services were all instrumental. Again, our IT or IS department and everybody else that's volunteered to be here today to help us get this program going. I just want to say thank you. So right now, I'd like to go ahead and say welcome to Philip Henry. He was kind enough to come up here and help us out to talk about the significant code changes. We know every three years we get hit with... Usually... A mountain of information that we have to take in and, you know, then put it out in the field for everybody, with our designers, developers, inspectors. We're all trying to work off that same code cycle. And we also like it when we can go from one jurisdiction to another and we have consistency. I think that could be frustrating for a lot of folks. And so it's kind of nice where we can all join one forum and then actually talk about things that we're seeing in our areas. And... Hopefully cross boundaries without any issues. So... Philip is a building official right now for the city of Helena, I believe. Okay. And then... Or St. Helena, yes. He's got 16 years in the building and safety industry. He's been... He's got quite a large resume of certificates. Fire inspector, accessibility, DSA, access specialist. Also holds a degree... A degree in construction management. I could go on and on because there's quite a list there and I think it was on there on the flyer. But I'd let Philip know that... I'd let him kind of talk about a little bit of his background and some of his passion. Maybe how he got into this industry because that's always interesting as a code official how we ended up here. Designers, I know you have a lot of school that you go through to be able to, you know, design homes or commercial buildings. It could be a very... It could be a very long and tedious journey. Code professionals, as you can only imagine, it seems to be a dying breed. We just don't have that many young folks coming in through the ranks right now. So it's kind of nice to be able to share this information with everybody. And then hopefully we can get some more people coming into our... What we enjoy being code officials. So anyway, at this time I'm going to go ahead and hand this off to Philip. Again, welcome everybody. And I hope you enjoy. Thanks, Dale. Appreciate it. You bet, Philip. All right. Yeah. So as Dale said, I'm Philip Henry and I will tell you a little bit more about my background in a second. This slide here, we're going to talk about these codes. This is the California codes. But let me just say that mostly I'm focusing this on the residential stuff. So there's a lot of things like when we get to the electrical code, there's some things that are going to apply to it. So I'm going to do commercial and just want you to understand that. But I'm going to primarily focus on residential. In our city in St. Helena where I'm the building official, our primary work is residential. We do do some commercial stuff like any city does. But by and large, mostly it's residential. So that's what I was going to focus on. I will say too that I put this together from an inspector's perspective. I'm a building official, but I've been a building inspector and I still do building inspections. And so it's kind of what my passion is. I know from looking at the list we probably have some plans examiners and some contractors and stuff here. But I'm going to teach this from an inspector's perspective. Now, just because you're a contractor or a contractor, plans examiner doesn't mean that you're not going to get something out of this seminar because all this information is good and it's on the code. It's requirements that we're going to have to comply with starting in January. So as far as my background, let me see if I can get this thing to work. So as I said, I am the building official. But before I started in St. Helena, I started as... in the construction industry as a general contractor. I still have my General B license with California, although it's inactive right now. But I built primarily single family homes. That's what I mostly did. Did a little bit of commercial work, but mostly residential. And then I moved to Arizona and took a job with the city of Yuma. The city of Yuma is a pretty good sized city, about 110,000 in the summer. And then in the winter, we have pretty much people from all over the country come there. We call them snowbirds. And the city would grow to about 250,000 in the winter. So I got used to making lots of right turns. And you don't dare go to a restaurant because you'll wait in line for hours sometimes trying to get in. So, but with that came many opportunities working for the city because we are such a large city. I saw a little bit of everything, commercial. And we did fire sprinkler inspections for the fire department. We had over 100 trailer parks, so lots of mobile home inspections and that kind of thing. Then I came back to California about eight years ago and took the building official position in Porterville. And so I was in the Central Valley and then the last five or so years up in St. Helena, which is the Napa Valley. So we're wine country up there. But as part of my experience, I'm also in the fire service. So I currently volunteer for Napa County Fire. And I'm sure you folks have seen some of the firestorms. We're right in Paradise's backyard and some of the areas up here. So you guys know what I'm talking about. You'll see some pictures that I've taken of some fire incidents that we had in our neighborhood. We had a fire in our neck of the woods. In fact, we had two major fires in 2020, both the Glass Fire and then the Hennessy Lightning Complex Fire. Both of those fires, I was on duty and fought. Generally what happens is when we have a big fire, while my full-time job is the city, our city shuts down. And in the case of the Glass Fire, literally fire around the entire city. So I spent 27 hours in the fire department. I spent 27 hours on the Glass Fire running a water tender and trying to shuttle water to different places. And I was on an engine for the Lightning Complex Fire. So as a result, because of my about 25 years experience as a firefighter, along with that, I see a lot of things in the field that either work or don't work or are issues. I'm always looking from the fire perspective. And so... I'm not sure. And so... A lot of times I'll ask contractors, if I see a new piece of material, I'll take it. It's non-scientific test. But I'll take it home. And I'll try to burn it and see how it performs and just get some ideas on some things. So anyway, that's a little bit about me. So this disclaimer, you guys can read it. It's in your handout. Just the idea is that if I say something in this code presentation, it's my interpretation of the code. It might be helpful. I would interpret it in St. Helena. That doesn't mean you have to interpret it the same way. And we have that. The code allows for a little bit of local interpretation. And I'll give you an example of that. This is probably kind of a silly interpretation. But when I was a contractor out in the county, I would build a house. And they didn't care if I ran the TMP down to the garage floor. That was fine. And then I built in one of the cities within that county. And they said, oh, no, you're not putting the TMP down on the garage floor. You're taking it outside. So same code. We're all on the state code. But there's a little bit of allowances for interpretation because you'll see in the code, the code has a lot of wordings like approved electrical box or approved location. Well, what does that mean? That means what the jurisdiction allows. So in the electrical code, when it says an approved box, if that jurisdiction does not accept that, it's not a legal thing. So if it says a box, it's not approved. So just be aware of that. So there's sometimes some differences. And Dale mentioned we'd like to be consistent. That's not always easy to do from inspector to inspector or jurisdiction to jurisdiction. I know in Napa County, all the jurisdictions we try to get together. And we call it the Napa Valley Coalition, Building Officials Coalition. And we try to get together. And we try to be consistent so that contractors can know what to expect. But that doesn't mean that if you go over to Solano County, they're going to abide by what we do in Napa County, for example. But basically, overall, it's the California state code. And we should, for the most part, be the same. But there might be some little nuances. So just be aware of that. So what we're going to cover today, a big part of it is the residential code. But as you know, when we build a residential house, we have lots of other things that go into a house, electrical, plumbing, mechanical. We have our energy code. We have the green code. So we're going to talk a little bit about all of these. Okay. I just wanted to take a minute. I don't want to spend a lot of time on this. How do we get our codes? So, you know, I hear as a building official, it's kind of amusing. People say, oh, so it's the St. Helena's building code. No, it's the state code. It's not something we write, oh, I can propose a code change. You could, too. You know, a contractor, a designer, anybody along those lines. But anybody that's a stakeholder can propose. And it goes through a process. And so, you know, we're going to talk a little bit about that. But generally, though, the three big code agencies that we get our codes from, International Code Council, NFPA, they do, they write our electrical code and, of course, our sprinkler requirements. And then IAPMO, which is the Plumbing and Mechanical Officials Association. And out of that, we get the California Plumbing and Mechanical Code. But, you know, we have a lot of other things. But ICC does their own plumbing and mechanical code. It's just that California adopts the uniform codes from IAPMO. And then we tweak it with our local California amendments. So in California, everybody adopts the state code. It's a little different down in Arizona. It's kind of the Wild West. When I was down there, our city adopted the international code. And we adopted codes that we wanted. Like I think we adopted NFPA. And, you know, some jurisdictions would adopt the international fire code or some other code. So, you know, there was not really consistency throughout Arizona. When I was in Arizona, I think we were the first city to adopt the energy code. When I first went to Arizona, there was no insulation inspections, which was unusual to me because I came from California building houses. And I always had to do insulation inspections. I got there. And, nope, we don't have an energy code. But here in California, we adopt Title 24. And so everybody has to work off the same code. The local body, either the county supervisors or the city council, adopts the code. Hopefully, if you're part of a jurisdiction, your jurisdiction has already gone to council because we're kind of getting late in the year. It's best to go earlier. We get our codes printed in July. But it's not usually possible. It's not always possible to get all your local amendments together and send, you know, get that into an ordinance to adopt because once the city council adopts it, there's a 30-day waiting period. And then hopefully that's been done by end of November or early December and we have our code ready to go in January. Any local amendments, those have to go to the California Building Standards Commission before they're enforced. And every code cycle, those have to be sent in even if you don't make changes. We did a couple changes in our local amendments because of the wildfires that we saw. Our fire department wanted a few additional things, mostly with defensible space. And we saw some things that weren't quite working as well as they should have. So we kind of tightened up on that. But those local amendments will go to the Building Standards Commission. And then a contractor will go to the City Council. And then a contractor can come into your town. They can go online to the Building Standards Commission and see what your local amendments are. And those are all enforceable if they're listed with the Building Standards Commission. Okay, so this is the California Residential Code. You know, a big change in the code is the aging in place. And so for years, the Residential Code, you could just build the single-family home. There's no ADA provisions required. And not until you got to multi-family or commercial, maybe a hotel or something, did we really worry about accessibility. And now we have this new section for aging in place. And, you know, the truth is, is if we get old enough, all of us are going to need some of these helps. So we'll talk about that. And then there's a few other things. Okay. So we'll talk about some rewritten sections and some new stuff. So we'll try to cover that. Let me just say that you guys may see a code change or know of a code change that I'm not covering. It's impossible to try to cover everything that's changed in six hours. So I won't spend a lot of time on the definitions, for example. Although definitions are important. I'll give you an example of why definitions are important. We do need definitions. When I was working in Arizona for our city, our city had, it was a zoning issue, so it wasn't really a building code issue. But our planning department had a requirement that if you built an accessory structure, you had to either have it attached or eight feet away. So some guy came and built a patio structure and had it like one foot off of his fascia board on his house. And the planning department looked at it and said, nope, it's not connected. It needs to be connected or attached. And so he took a piece of rope and he tied one piece of rope to the house and one piece to the patio and said, I'm attached. And I meet your requirement. And so we all ran back to our code books and everywhere we could find looking for what the definition of attachment was. And, of course, there wasn't anything. There is now. I think if you go into U-Mobile. I think it was planning and zoning definitions. There is a definition for attached and it doesn't include a rope. So definitions are important. And I've been challenged before I one time wrote a correction on crawl space. And, you know, in my mind, attic was crawl space. And the contractor said, uh-uh, crawl space by definition is under floor. And, you know, I went to the code and I was like, yeah, you're right. Okay. So that's the definition. So we need definitions. It helps kind of take away the argument in some cases. But I won't cover all the definitions. There are some new ones in here. I may throw one or two in, but we're not going to really dwell a lot on that. But the code changed the definition, or not the definition, but the purpose. Just the wording, it kind of says the same thing, but they said we want to offer a reasonable level rather than the minimum requirements to safeguard public safety and firefighters. And the truth is, you know, a lot of times we're thinking about people getting out of the building, and that's important. If there's a fire or some kind of incident going on in a building, we want to make sure people get out safely. But also as part of that, firefighters are going in. You've got to think of the first responders that we're going to go in and try to save property. We primarily try to. We try to save life, but part of our mission, too, is property preservation. You know, unless the building is completely gone, like this picture here. This is a picture of me backing up one of our firefighters. This was in Napa County. We're contracted by CAL FIRE for Schedule A services, and then the county volunteers back up CAL FIRE. And this was our contractor. We were a CAL FIRE shop for Ranger Unit, and inside that shop was two of our county water tenders that we lost. So I think this was about four years ago. The building was complete lost when we got there. It was going too much. But, you know, if it's just a working structure fire inside a room, we're going to go in there. We're going to stop it. We're not going to sit outside and wait for the building to burn down. And if we go in, we're always worried about, you know, is this building going to collapse? So that's what we're trying to prevent. And hopefully, if we do that, we're going to be able to save property. We're going to do our job right as code officials or contractors. We're going to make these buildings safe so at least they stand up for a few minutes. I mean, nothing's worse than getting on scene. And then, and I've been to a couple fires where literally pulled up and then just watched the roof collapse. And when you see that, it's kind of sobering. It's like, whoa, okay, we were just about ready to go inside. So anyway, just be aware first responders are going inside. We're exempt from permits. We don't deal a lot with storm shelters. The code put this in. Be aware this code is written for the nation. Essentially, ICC writes this for all states. And then we do some local amendments here in California. But the basic document is the international code. And so they put in storm shelters. So if we were in Oklahoma, yeah, there's a storm shelter just about in everybody's backyard. And we don't deal with it so much here. But that's what that is. I guess, you know, you have to meet a certain standard there, but you don't necessarily need a permit. And then the one that might affect us is if you're in wildfire country, we're now looking at accessory structures. And this gives us some language. And the reason is because, well, you know, we might not be as concerned about a little 10 by 12 shed burning down. But the issue becomes is once that shed gets on fire, it's producing heat and sparks and everything. and especially if it's close to a structure it may burn down or start another structure on fire so the code has now given us a little bit of language that even if it doesn't require permit if it's under the 120 square feet we're still going to want it to be non combustible construction so just be aware of that so permit expiration the code changed this actually changed a couple years ago hopefully any of you that are working with the jurisdiction that you were already aware this state law changed I heard that a lot of this came about because of the fires we were having and I came to Napa Valley in 2017 and I was there about a month and we had a couple very large fires one was the Tufts fire and burned down it burned started in Calistoga and burned all the way over to Santa Rosa in a matter of a couple hours it was pretty unbelievable to see something like that and when it got to Santa Rosa in addition to burning down lots of commercial buildings and houses along the way it got into a subdivision coffee park and I think it burned down like nearly 3,000 homes well as you can imagine with that many homes being lost and everybody's getting their insurance companies that pay up and then trying to get contractors there's no way we had enough contractors or probably even building materials to rebuild these homes right away and some of the people were saying that they would have a permit finally and before contractor was on board and they started building their house the permits expired because historically we've always had you know the 180 day six months so the state said you know what let's give them a year I think they tried to initially do this for two years but one year's what came so now it's all new language that's in our code so and then the codes now talking about digital format we're allowed by the building official there's a new state law that goes into effect depending on the size of the city that cities are going to have to accept digital or online permitting and submittals and then if you're a smaller city like the city I'm from probably I think we get another year or two and so but just be aware this is kind of the new thing is that we're gonna eventually be able to submit everything online we're probably not there in the smaller cities but a lot of larger cities are already doing a lot of online permitting so so! Stop work orders this section was completely rewritten the big thing there was if there's an emergency that exists the building official doesn't have to require or doesn't have to give written notice prior to stopping the work but I would just say be careful with that as a building official I always want to get a hold of the property owner and let them know what I'm doing I I I! Greg failure to comply there's some things that have been just kind of reworded here but generally everybody understands if you disobey a stop work order that's that's not a good thing just going to get further code enforcement one of the definitions that changed for the residential code or was added was the pv ground mount california has for a long time had that if you did a roof mount system there was no oversight so we pretty much saw about 99 of our solar systems the pv systems are go on some kind of a roof structure the code came back and added this ground mount i mean we saw these this was a picture i took in porterville of course this was like a big you know utility project where they were generating power for the local utility but occasionally you see some ground mount solars go up i was in yuma one time and so in yuma for longest time pv solar permits were never looked at by planning and it's that way in our city now we generally if it's roof mounted nobody nobody really looks but if i see a ground mount come through i always run to our planning department ask them if they're interested in looking at it um i had one in yuma that um i got the uh inspection on the list went out there it's a mobile home park um right in the middle of this guy's carport was this six foot hole by six foot and probably five feet deep and i looked at it and i was like wow right in the middle of the carport this is your footing for the ground mount he goes oh yeah it's a monopole and then you know i looked up and on the roof of the carport it's like this two foot or three foot diameter hole that he had cut in the roof structure and so i'm thinking hmm but it was all approved i had an approved set of plans that he had done the footing to the plan um i probably should have asked a few more questions i was just a little amused by it i've never seen anything like that in a carport structure it just struck me as odd and so i signed off his footing and i left and that trader park was right on avenue b um and yuma avenue b is like the main one of the main thoroughfares and our planning and building director was coming down um avenue b one morning i think she said she just about spit her coffee out when she saw what was there here was this big old monopole that went up and this huge solar array that when the guy tilted it up, I mean, it was shading the neighbor. The neighbor's got no sun. And so, of course, we got complaints from all the neighbors around. Boy, they were mad. And so after that, we had to send every solar, had to go through planning. But I think they finally convinced them to kind of tilt it down a little bit so it wasn't standing up. But, I mean, you could see it for like a mile. It's a big old thing sticking up above the rooftop of the carport on this mobile home. So anyway, but we got this new definition now. So you may see some ground mounts. I think we just had one submitted in our jurisdiction. Somebody's putting in a ground mount on a residential house. So something to be aware of. Intermodal shipping containers. So this is a picture I took right in our jurisdiction. This is an ADU. And since this one came in, we've had about three or four others that are in process. That you're talking about. So there's a company down in Southern California that takes these shipping containers and they outfit them as housing. And I think there's an apartment complex that I saw over in Las Vegas made out of these shipping containers. But it's now in our residential code. And they basically just direct you over to the building code, mostly to make sure the engineering's good. These things are pretty stout. I mean, I know there was some questions. I went to a training down in... Los Angeles maybe about seven or eight years ago. And they were talking about these. And some of the jurisdictions were real concerned. But I think these things are... They're built like a tank. So I don't know that we're worried about it crushing or something unless there's some kind of damage or deterioration on it. But I think these things will stand up, especially for a residential house, single story. But anyway, there's some provisions for these. And they're going to probably become more popular because everybody's trying to figure out how to... You know, build the better mousetrap. And, you know, cheaper, quicker. And it is an instant home. These guys came out. They poured the footing. And then they brought the four sections and just put them together, welled them up, and away they go. Wind design, we have some new language about... Mostly it's talking about cladding and metal roofing. The code said they lowered some wind speeds. They were just saying that some of the wind speeds across the U.S. have kind of decreased. And... But because the wind speeds have declined, does it mean that the code is not going to up some things in the cladding? We'll see that later on because we, you know, we're not expecting maybe the building to blow down in a windstorm. But I remember when I was in Yuma, we had a couple of wind events. It wasn't uncommon. Sometimes a wind event would come through, a microburst of wind would come through and break down Interstate 8. And it'd take down billboards. We had an RV park where a couple RVs rolled over. And I remember one subdivision, wind came through, and I think about 40 of the homes, a lot of the comp shingles had blown off. So, you know, we don't want, if there's a 50 or 60 mile an hour wind, that we lose half our roofing products. If there's a way to make sure we can keep these on, we want to do it. So, anyway, some information about the wind design there. Irregular buildings. This is a new section in the code. It's really just another item in this section. This is a house. You'll see a slide. This house burned down in the glass fire. They're rebuilding it now. This is not a perfect example, but I just happened to be doing the inspection when I was looking at this code change. And so on the other side of the house, which you can't see in this picture, it's flat. It's at grade level. But you come down on the, you know, around the back of the house, and you'll see a lot of things. And it just slopes down the hill. And so the code just wants you to be aware if you start to meet some of this criteria, the one in five on a slope, and then where the tallest post starts to exceed seven feet. In this picture, I could barely stand up in the crawl space down there, so I don't think it met the criteria. But just be aware, if you're in hill country in your jurisdiction, there's some new language on this that you can't use. You may apply to your project. Water heaters. So if you're in Seismic D, are you guys in earthquake country up here? You guys get earthquakes? Okay. We have them in our neck of the woods, all in the Bay Area. And interestingly enough, when I was in Yuma, we were in Seismic Zone. I was there one of the years. I can't remember. maybe like 2012 we had a 7.1 earthquake started in Mexico so we were susceptible and it shook it just about shook my house down and we don't want water heaters turning over the big thing here is the code for years and the residential code talked about you know bracing the water heaters that is now moved to the plumbing code maybe that's where it belonged not really a lot of change just be aware I remember when I was in Yuma we're in earthquake country we were in seismic D and we would require a water heater company to you know put these straps on and but you could go to Phoenix and there's no earthquakes there so if they got a contractor that came out of town they were kind of shocked like you mean I got a yeah yeah you got a anchor it so anyways if it applies to your area make sure you enforce it story height so there was a little change you know I think it's a little bit of a change but I think it's a little bit of a change but I think it's a little bit of a change but I think it's a little bit of a change here on the language the big here on the language the big thing was is and I don't know if I have a pointer on this yeah so you won't be able to see the red dot but anyway the rim joist and their floor joist added some space there and the idea was the code was trying to accommodate for that and so 13 foot 7 inches is the maximum it's still it's just basically kind of lining up with the 12 foot maximum wall set and the room was centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered This section's been completely rewritten to clarify requirements. So there's been some changes in this. So for years, with a townhouse, the biggest issue is there's a property line. And if we have one unit catch on fire, we don't want to affect the whole row of houses. And so the code is always historically required that if one unit caught on fire, it was basically designed and built that that unit could burn completely off and collapse without affecting the other units. So you typically had like these lightweight clips that you would put up at the top of the roof or the walls to connect them to the next unit. But if those clips melted off, it would allow that wall to collapse in. And so some of that language has changed in the code here for units that are fire sprinklered. Now, I know that's not an issue here. I don't know that this is going to change how we do business too much here. California sprinkler is everything. I don't know of a jurisdiction where you can build a new townhouse and not have it sprinkled. But when I was in Arizona, we were not allowed to have sprinklers. In fact, our governor at the time when I was there, Jan Brewer, when the housing crash kind of came in, what was that, 2007, 2008, the state passed a law that said if you don't have a code currently that doesn't currently require sprinklers, you can't adopt a code. And they were doing that because they thought that to add sprinklers to constructions, construction costs would have further exasperated the whole housing downturn. So I think like Scottsdale had, by local amendment, said we sprinkle everything. But, you know, by and large, the rest of the state of Arizona did it. And there's still a lot of states that don't enforce a sprinkler code. So you can go out and build a house, no fire sprinklers required. But I don't think we see that here in California. So and then they gave some. A little bit of a relaxing on the fire sprinkler piping. So for years, we always had intumescent caulking around the fire sprinkler piping. The idea was that if the CPVC pipe melted, then that intumescent caulking would fill that gap. And so that's gone away now that it's, you know, if it's a water filled sprinkler pipe, we don't need to. Do that. Common walls. So this was where it said, you know, automatic sprinkler system. If it's provided or not provided. But I think we're going to always have sprinkler systems provided here in California. If you're building one of these kind of structures. Two family dwellings. So they kind of just clarified this. This kind of goes back to the whole property line or not. And the commentary. That I read on this is if you have a duplex and there's a fire, the fire doesn't know if there's a lot line or not or a property line. I guess in other parts of the country, you can buy duplex where you're only buying half of it. Similar to like a townhouse. But here in California, a duplex is one owner. But we still want fire separation. And the fire doesn't know that there's, you know, one owner or two owners. So there was a little clarification that we still need. Fire separation on two family dwellings. We want as best as we can. If there's a fire, we want to compartmentalize it. And hopefully only affect one family. That doesn't always happen. By the time we come in with our fire hoses and spray about 110 gallons a minute, we usually flood the place. Or there's smoke damage. But if we can, we want to contain it to one unit. So we only displace one family if we can. That's the best. That's the best case scenario. And this was the exception about the sprinkler piping filled with water. It still needs an approved material, but doesn't have to be the intimescent caulking. Dwelling separations. Don't tell any of the contractors here, but for a while, the code pulled out self-latching. They put it back. So I think way back in the UBC, when I was a contractor, I always had to build a house with a fire. And I had to build a house with a fire door between the garage. That was self-closing, 20-minute rated door. So self-closing, self-latching. And the whole reason for that is if that door doesn't latch and there's a fire in that garage, that door is going to push open. Fire builds incredible amount of pressure. And the last thing we want to do is push that fire through the house. I've been to some fires where there was a car fire in the garage at like 2 in the morning. The fire burned the garage and the car inside. And the fire burned the garage inside of it to a crisp. I mean, it's practically melting the metal roll-up door off the front. The house is fine. Nothing in the house. That's what we want. Because while the garage is all burned off, the people are still living there. We don't want to displace people. So when I was in Yuma, I remember we were on the, I want to say the 2003 International Code, and they had taken out self-closing. And our building official said, don't tell anybody. And they were all just doing it. We didn't write it as a code. We wrote it as a correction. All the contractors just kept doing it because it had been historically in the code. And then apparently they took out self-latching and now they've put it back. Self-closing, self-latching. It should be there. Sometimes the code makes a mistake by taking something out and we figure, oh, that wasn't a good idea. So we come back and put it back. Foam plastics. Foam plastics. So R316 has been in the code for years and years. Just be aware of this. It seems like every year, or not every year, but every code cycle, we get a little more information on this. And I think the reason is because we're, you know, as our industry changes, wood products are less and less, it seems like. We're always getting these products that are not necessarily wood-based. And so just be aware as a building inspector. And if you're a contractor. Just be aware. I went into a house in Yuma. It was really tall ceilings. This custom home. I had signed off the drywall inspection. Came back for a final. And I saw some detail work like this. In fact, it was like some crown molding that was, I don't know, like a foot tall. And I was like, holy cow. Where'd you get crown molding like that? And the guy said, oh, I got a piece of it. And he picked it up and it was this piece of styrofoam, a couple feet long, but it was a piece of it. And I was like, oh, wow. And this is in the bedroom? He goes, yeah. So I started scratching my head. I'm like, we can't have this. You start violating 316, R316. The issue is, is if this stuff catches on fire, styrofoam, take a styrofoam cup, like a coffee cup, and just light it on fire. It puts out black toxic smoke. It burns like gasoline. It's a petroleum product. It's made with petroleum. It's made with petroleum products. We don't want that in our bedroom, of all places, in a sleeping room, where this stuff, if it ignites, it's going to start dripping down from the ceiling. It's going to be igniting everything around it. And so, yeah, we don't want to make a bad situation worse. So, yeah, just be aware of that. So in that case, on the one in Yuma, we didn't make him tear it out, but our building official bought off on allowing him to coat it with some intumescent paint. Like a fire retardant paint. That's not always really a good idea. It was one of those things where we just kind of, you know, held our nose and allowed it. But at least we tried to mitigate it. But, yeah, in a non-sprinklered house especially, that's really bad. That fire, once it gets going, it's going to really gin up. So just be aware there's some new stuff that's come into the code on foam plastics. The exceptions have changed in the mechanical ventilation. Mostly this is being driven by the... Mechanical code and energy codes. And so just be aware of that. We'll cover these in the... Mostly in the energy code. So... Let me also say, I built in some breaks into this. And so hopefully you guys... We don't go too far to where you guys feel like you need a break. I just will say, you know, we're all adults here. If you guys feel like you need to get up and use a restroom or something, go ahead. But I... I do have breaks built into this. And I've been to many of these code trainings. And unfortunately, code... I try to make it as lively as I can. And I'll tell you guys some stories and maybe show you some videos if we get a chance. But, you know, I understand. Especially early in the morning, I'm nodding off even after having a cup of coffee. So if you need to stand up, you won't bother me. But we'll try to give you plenty of breaks so you guys can get up and walk around and make sure you're still alive and all that good stuff. So this ceiling height, there was a little code change here. I don't know if this is a perfect example, but this is a house that was being built. And they just added this number four, which talked about if you have some beams or girders that are spaced three feet apart, that they can come down into the finished width as low as 78 inches. This one was above the door. The door is typically 80 inches. So this one wasn't an exact picture. But you might see something like this. Kind of a low ceiling. Anyway, just be aware the code, for whatever reason, has allowed this. Glazing and wet surfaces. So this was an interesting code change. So I'm trying to remember what code. I think it was the 2016 code change where they rewrote this and it took away the wording adjacent to a tub or a shower space. And so the argument became if... The window was not adjacent to a tub. And then this picture, this tub is adjacent to a window. So this one is no question. But if my tub was over here and my window was over here, the question became, does that window need to be tempered or safety glazing? And I was down in Porterville and a contractor took me to task on this. And then I contacted ICC and they gave me one of their official commentary or renderings on it. They said, no. The contractor said no. The contractor is right. It doesn't need to be. Even though the reality is if I step out of the shower or the tub onto a tile floor, my feet are wet. I'm going to slip. If I slip, I'm going to reach out and I'm probably going to put my hand through this window. We don't want this big old shard of glass to cut my arm off. So that's why we always wanted safety glazing. Well, the code took the language out to where we couldn't enforce it. And now they've come back in the 2022 code and they've said, no, if it's adjacent to it. But it kind of gave a little stronger meaning to it. So anyway, you guys see another issue in this picture that might concern you? Any inspectors? What's that? Yeah, very good. So it's funny. You see this stuff all the time, especially in custom homes. I don't know what it is. Somebody's got to always have a ceiling fan or a hanging light fixture, like some kind of chandelier over the tub. Now, the code does say. If you're three foot horizontal and eight feet vertical and that all encompassing zone, if you're outside of that zone, you know, no problem. And I think this light fixture did fall outside of that. But I mean, it was just like when I first walked in, I see that I go, oh, wow. I wonder if that's going to be a problem. So make sure you pay attention to that. The big issue is, is we don't want someone standing up in a tub. They're completely wet. So they are a perfect conductor of electricity. And if they reach up to a ceiling fan, they decide, hey, I want a higher speed. Now they're in contact with metal, especially if it's somehow energized. Yeah, they're going to have a problem. They're most susceptible to being electrocuted. You know, we get away with a lot of sin because, you know, I don't know if it's just luck. You know, after being an inspector for 16 some years, I've done some crazy things. I try not to, but I'm the type of inspector that I've got to touch stuff. I look at electrical boxes and it might look okay, but I grab stuff. And I can't tell you how many times I've grabbed onto a ground wire and had it just pull right off in my hands. It's like, holy cow, you guys didn't torque this thing down. Neutrals see that all the time. Sometimes, you know, you just see stuff and you, so I touch stuff. So one time I was working. You know, looking at this electrical installation and the homeowner was standing there. And he didn't say nothing to me. And I'm working with, you know, I had my screwdriver pulled off the dead front. And I saw a loose connection and I thought, oh, I'm going to tighten it up. When I went in there to tighten it up, I contacted something that was live. I thought the panel was off. And it sparked. And so the whole time I was in there working on the live panel, the homeowner, I'm like, hey, this is live. I thought this was off. He goes, well, he goes, I thought you knew what you were doing. You're the expert. And, but the reason why I was, you know, touching stuff that, and not getting electrocuted, I had some DeWalt, you know, work shoes on that had the electrical shock hazard rating. And, you know, we build up calluses on our fingers that, you know, we don't want to damage them. You know, we build up centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered Okay, emergency escape and rescue openings. So there was a lot of stuff that was rewritten, and then there's also a new definition, or the definition was rewritten on this, and it just kind of clarified. So the big issue is, okay, so there's a whole bunch of wording in here. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it. So there's some allowances for a basement, existing basement. If I have a basement and I'm trying to convert it to a sleeping room, probably the window is not going to comply, and so the code allowed that. I remember when I first started inspecting, I would go out to these homes that were built in the 70s, and you guys, I'm sure, have seen them too. In the 70s, for some reason, the window was always up here. It's always like five feet off the floor, so it's this narrow, real long window. And, of course, that doesn't comply with today's code. If there's a fire, people need to climb out, and I'm not climbing up something that's five feet high off the floor. And so, you know, the code came back and made some allowances for existing windows. Now, you still have to meet the requirements, but just be aware, the code has kind of built in some language over the last couple cycles, where when I was inspecting in Arizona, we had none, and I actually had a remodel. They tore off all the drywall, and I said, hey, you got to lower down the cripple wall, because they were replacing windows. I'm like, you know, you're going to buy a new window anyway, so lower the cripple wall, and they fought it with the building official, and he came back and said, no, they don't need to do it. So, okay, fine, but just be aware that if you have an existing window now, the code has now some language saying, as long as you don't make the window smaller, and it doesn't reduce, the existing egress, that it may be okay. So, the biggest thing in the emergency escape rescue opening definition is they went to the net clear size, and they started adding this wording about minimum. So, again, if I go back to my example of the 70s, we all had these metal frame single pane windows, and the track was like literally stuck up, maybe half an inch. I remember when I was a kid in our house, if it got a heavy rain, water was always coming over those tracks, because the weep holes were always clogged. I didn't know it as a kid, but my mom was always laying out, you know, paper towels on the windowsill. But now, if you look at the windows we build today, we're building with these, you know, vinyl windows, and to hold that glass in, I mean, holy cow, the track is two inches high, or you may see that with these wood and vinyl windows. Right. So, the code is coming back and making sure that you understand when you measure, you're measuring from the net clear opening. So, you're actually going above the sill to, you know, to what that clear opening, because if I have the window track sticks up two inches, and my windowsill is at 44 inches, I may be past the clear opening. So, just be aware that they kind of clarified this. And, you know, when I was building houses, we always, as long as we had 44 inches or less to the top of the sill, we were good. Generally, you'd want to, you know, frame it at like 43 or 43 and a half, and then you'd put a half inch window stool, you know, wood stool on top of that. So, anyway. Window wells, a little bit of rewriting, but generally, the code has not really changed. We need nine square feet, and we need, you know, the window or door to be able to fully open. If it's a window, usually it's a slider, so it slides, but you need three feet out and, you know, that nine square feet. So, just be aware of that. I don't know how many people have basements put in. In Arizona, we had a few, so this became an issue. Ladder steps, the ladder steps can, you know, encroach into that area. And then dwelling additions. This is a little bit of change on, you know, just allowing if you have some existing windows kind of clarifying some things. I don't know that there's, you know, earth shattering changes here. And then it does allow as little as 22 inches of height and 20 inches of width. You know, typically, on a new construction yard, we're looking for a minimum 24 inches and then five square feet for a great floor 5.7 square feet within that opening if it's above or below grade stairways a little bit of changes on this they were just saying that you know the exceptions were you know the stairs don't have to meet the requirements if it's not serving a building a porch or a deck I don't know where that would apply on residential but you may find a situation so anyway or stairways leading to a crawl space so maybe somebody was really focused on that making sure someone you know if you had a set of stairs that went down to a HVAC system typically we're just thinking of someone maintaining it we're not thinking of the general public or you know somebody that lives there regularly going down there so it's probably okay if it doesn't meet the exact letter of the law stairway surfaces so the code talked about one in 48 units it's basically a 2% slope this is very similar to commercial we don't want more than 2% slope but there was a new exception added and that's where you know if we have a surface that's going to get rain water on it this was a stair landing on a parking lot and it was a little bit of a challenge to get it to the ground so we're going to have to build a parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking spot right next to the parking residential code is starting to look a little more like chapter 11a of the building code those of you that deal with multi-family housing you'll start seeing more of this and then a new exception on the ramps just basically mirroring the stairs that they don't it doesn't need to comply if it's not serving a building a porch or deck again i don't know where this would apply if they had like a loading dock or something but i don't see that in residential but anyway it's there in the code and then some changes on guards and window fall protection but this was mostly just on the the standards it wasn't really i don't think there's a lot of change and basically we need some fall protection if you have a window that's really low sill and we i still hear occasionally on the news where you hear a little toddler flops out of the window that's what we're talking about you know if i've got a window that's you know that's really low so we're not really centered centered centered centered you know, 12 inches off the floor, a little toddler is going to fall out of that, especially if the other side of that window is more than six feet, you know, it might be a couple of stories up, not going to be too good for the kid. And I, I think like five years ago, I heard of on the news, a kid in Fresno flopped out of one of these windows and died. So we need fall protection. And, um, it's been in the code for a while. I don't think there was a real big change other than they're just saying, you know, make sure that the clear opening matches. Cause we're thinking in terms of a fire, if there's a fire in this building, we need to still get people out. We don't want our toddlers flopping out the window, but if there's a fire, we need to get out. Um, and, um, so just be aware of that. Make sure the fall protection doesn't prevent someone from getting out a necessary bedroom window if they have to. And you have to get out in a fire. Um, you're going to come out some way or you're going to die. Um, I remember, um, this is years ago, but when I first started in the fire service, um, so maybe about 1987, 1988, I knew nothing. I was a kid. I didn't know anything about construction or codes, but I went to a fire here at two o'clock in the morning, a two story house, whole first floor is involved. Just this flop fire is roaring, you know, cause middle of the night and we still go to plenty of calls even back then. And still today, uh, people either don't have working smoke detectors or they have no smoke detectors. So I'm centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered just completely dented because they jumped out of the second floor onto the hood of the car in the driveway they were fine i think they had a few you know bruises and stuff but they were fine they jumped out because they couldn't get downstairs anymore so this is a real thing we need to get people out and most of the time it's you're sleeping you know if we're awake and the fire starts in our house or any kind of building we're usually aware of that pretty quickly not so much when you're sleeping yeah most of the time you don't realize it until it's too late then you can't get out and that's not the time to try to figure out how to get out of a out of a structure at that point shut off valves so with the sprinkler code i think this has kind of always been in nfpa 13d but it's in the residential code because this document is essentially reprinted in 313 and we just want to make sure that somebody's not able to turn off the sprinkler separately from the house water so the idea is if something goes wrong with the sprinkler system we want them to shut off the entire water to the house so they're not living there using the toilets we want them to get the sprinkler system fixed i went to an inspection not too long ago i don't know it's about a year ago and i walked in sprinkler at home i walked in and you know part of my inspection i'm checking for smoke detectors and i walked into one bedroom and the smoke detector was there but i looked in the center of the ceiling and there's a plug where there should have been a fire sprinkler head and i said hey where's your sprinkler head and the gal that lived there is like oh i don't know there was a fire a few years ago and never got replaced so since i got out of the inspection i called the fire marshal it's like hey um i'm just doing a inspection over here what happened he goes oh yeah he goes there was a fire there about three four years ago he goes they only replaced that i go no no nobody followed up so anyway um we don't want that we want people to have sprinkler systems working they don't they don't do no good if there's a plug in the in the pipe has to have to have a sprinkler head smoke alarms um so this change here is just recognizing that if you have a height difference i come out of the hall at like eight feet and then suddenly i go to the other side of the hall and i'm like oh my god i'm gonna go to a you know an open ceiling that's like 12 feet off the floor um i'm gonna need a smoke detector up high and the big reason is is if i have a fire in this living room heat and smoke rises first first thing it does is going to go up to the high ceiling and then it's going to build across and then slowly build down well that's going to be a delayed detection to to finally build enough smoke it's going to fill that whole ceiling that upper ceiling before it starts um into the hallway and activating you know by then i've got such a roaring fire um people are probably going to be aware of that but before the smoke detector sounds so we want to get a smoke detector up high so they added this number five just says if you have more than 24 inches of height difference coming out of the hallway add another smoke detector carbon monoxide alarms there was an exception added said um alterations of you know or repairs the mechanical system that are not fuel fired so if i have a heat pump i don't need to check for a carbon monoxide detector not sure how this is going to affect us here in california because you're going to see later on to the presentation california is driving us to all electric anyway so i know there's still a lot of fuel fired um devices out in the in the field but eventually the idea is we're going to get away from that go to all heat pump technology so maybe this carbon monoxide alarm requirements not even um it's still applicable but it'll be less and less maybe as time goes on foam plastic r316 they added this the big thing here is just be aware the energy code is really driving us to do all this um you know foam insulation um under the roof deck so people do this closed cell insulation just be aware that there's a requirement for them to meet this minimum fire rating or you have to cover it with sheet metal or you have to cover it with sheet metal or some kind of building material um if if it burns i did a little search and i think it was um jm man's field said if their um spray on insulation was more than four inches thick it got outside of the parameters so most of the time if they have a two by four truss they're just going to fill that three and a half inch thick they're fine then you don't need to do anything but just be aware if they you know or got a um ceiling uh framed with two by eights or something they're filling the whole thing probably not going to see that because this stuff's pretty expensive but just be aware you might ask the contractor or the insulator if they have this uh fire test that's been conducted we're again we're just making sure that this is not going to gin up a fire this stuff here that we see behind um stucco this stuff burns because it's not very dense it burns like gasoline and so um every now and then you'll see a contractor put that stuff up that's a big no-no but if it's the sprayed insulation contractor gave me a piece and i think i told you guys at the beginning i like to burn stuff i took my little propane torch and put it on this and as soon as i took the fire away the flame away it stopped it wouldn't keep burning so this stuff is so dense and thick um typically and i don't know who the manufacturer was on this but you know kind of made me think that hey this stuff is not not going to burn it's going to burn it's going to burn it's going to burn it's going to burn it's going to burn it's going to burn it's going to burn it's going to burn it's going to burn Greg Greg Greg If you're in an area like in Yuma, we would get two or two and a half inches of rain all year, and we usually got it in July in about 15 minutes. Probably not as big of a deal because we still made them like silicone caulk around that, but if you're in a rain area like in St. Helena, I get like 38 to 48 inches of rain a year if we're not in drought. Yeah, you're going to have this wood start to decay, so just be aware they put that in. So they talked about structural members, form of buildings, balconies, porches. Again, just wood protection, make sure it's not, you know, no woods in contact with a basement floor or somewhere where it's going to be subject to water or termites. Some stuff on live work units. It's in the code, but it's not something we're going to run into all the time. Occasionally you see this. This is where they have a... retail shop below and maybe an apartment up above or something like that. Those are live work units. I saw a few of them down in Arizona. I haven't seen any in our town. Solar energy, R324. This section has some new language because we, of course, have these building integrated PV panels. This is where the whole roof is covered with solar. Tesla's doing this. The big thing here is, you know, with the fire department, we want to leave the three-foot aisle. We want to leave the three-foot aisle open for them. Occasionally we see on a lower roof over a garage, they'll have a bedroom window in front. We don't want somebody jumping out of that bedroom window on the solar panels. And this has that exception that if the whole roof is covered with solar panels, there's no way to avoid it. So you don't need the emergency escape opening pathway that was required if it's, you know, traditional panels that we see. Okay, here's the big change for the code. This is something that we're going to do. This is something entirely new in our code. This is aging in place. So anybody that has dealt with ADA things, I'm a certified access specialist with DSA. And so I look at a lot of this stuff with, you know, commercial buildings and Chapter 11A for multifamily. But voila, here it is in our residential code. So you build a single-family home starting in January of 2023, which is fantastic. And then a few weeks away, these requirements kick in. So what happened is the state asked the Building Standards Commission to look at this, or HCD to consider what changes that they would add. So Senate Bill 280 basically triggered this requirement. And here it is in the 2022 code. So what we're starting to see is that newly constructed buildings have to comply with this. New R-327. And you're going to end up seeing backing for grab bars. You know, this is a picture of a commercial bathroom, which is, you know, what we would normally see in a commercial bathroom. You're getting set up to put some grab bars in behind and on the side of the toilet. So it talks about the exceptions. Of course, multifamily buildings are going to go under Chapter 11A, or if it's public housing, it's going to comply with Chapter 11B. But single-family homes have to comply. So the reinforcement for grab bars, we need at least one bathroom on the entry level. So if it's a two-story building, we're going to catch it on the first floor. Find a bathroom that you can add these. And then if there is no bathroom on the entry level, then we're going to put one on, you know, a bathroom on the second floor. And just be careful on this. I've had people, you know, been doing the ADA thing for a while. And people always say, well, hey, no wheelchairs getting up to the second floor. Why do I got to do a bathroom to ADA? Well, you know, wheelchairs aren't the only thing we're expecting up on the second floor. You may have a person that's using a walker or cane, and they still need the grab bars. So don't get locked into this thing about, you know, it's just for somebody in a wheelchair. It's for all disabilities. And so, you know, the code can't capture every disability out there. But if somebody has some kind of physical disability, yeah, they may be in a wheelchair, may need, you know, room for the wheelchair. But they're going to need grab bars. I remember the last five years of my mother's life, she was pretty much confined to a wheelchair. But before that time, she was using lots of grab bars and things to hold on to. And then got to the point to where she couldn't really walk around. And so, again, like I said earlier, if we live long enough, we're going to need these features. So it's probably a good thing. You know, we're going to still hear some arguments, people like, you know, hey, why do I have to do this? And I'll be honest with you. If I was trying to build a house and I was in my 20s, I wouldn't understand this. The older I get, the more I understand it. So but we don't have a choice. California now requires that. So reinforcement has to be solid lumber or other construction material that's approved by the enforcing agency. Here's one of these kind of gray areas. So if you come down to St. Helena and you ask me, hey, can I put a strip of metal there? I may say yes. But if the enforcing agency up the road or down the road says no, we're not allowing a strip of metal. We're not allowing a strip of metal for backing. Don't tell them, hey, St. Helena said it was okay. This is one of these gray areas. Whatever is approved by the enforcing agency, we talked about that. There's a little bit of gray area. Now, as the enforcement agency, you should kind of be open to some things that are going to work. But we are looking for these bars to withstand a couple hundred pounds in any direction. So we can't have them just fall off the wall. So it has to be, you know, sturdy enough material, strong enough to hold it. But if they come up with something reasonable, we'll take a look at it. Reinforcement should not be less than the two by eight nominal lumber. And then we're going to locate those somewhere between 32 and 39 and a quarter inches above finished floor. And the reason is because your bars are going to go somewhere between 33 and 36 inches off the finished floor. That's the height that the code is given. Why? Because the water closet reinforcement shall be installed on the side wall and the back wall. So, you know, you're going to have one bar behind the toilet and one on the side. Shower compartments, we're looking for some reinforcement for some bars in the shower or a bathtub. And then there's some exceptions. If the water closet is not placed to a side wall. And we do have a shower. We have that sometimes where we're just not going to get a side bar. So then we have to start looking at can we get one mounted to the floor, maybe a fold up bar or something. And then reinforcement shall not be required for wall framing for prefabricated showers. If that shower already has some grab bars, you'll sometimes see the fiberglass tub enclosures or shower enclosures. And they've got a couple of bars built into them. That's kind of a no brainer. So bathtubs with no surrounding walls where wall panels do not permit installation of reinforcement. But then again, we're going to try to look at maybe some floor mounted stuff. So. And then the documentation of the grab bars. We're going to want this information installed or rather put into the maintenance manual that the green code requires. We hand that over to the homeowner so they know where the reinforcement is. They can later come and add the bars. So again, we're just doing the reinforcement. No requirement to add the grab bars. You can put in the grab bars if you want. But no requirement to. This is going to be a big change because this is going to probably catch a lot of people off guard. The receptacle and switch heights, any control heights, we can't have them higher than 48 inches off the finished floor. And that's to the top of the floor. That's to the top of the box. Or lower than 15 inches from the finished floor measured from the bottom of the box. So you need to catch that in rough-in. Don't go in after a frame inspection and try to catch somebody on final and say, hey, none of this stuff is going to work. You want to look at this at rough-in. So they can be higher. They just can't be lower. When I was building houses, I used to set all my receptacles at like 12 inches off the floor. That's over with. Now they're going to come up higher. And then thermostats, switches, any kind of operable device, we're looking at 48 inches maximum above finished floor. And so in rough, we're just looking to the top of the box. So just be aware of that. There's some exceptions. So if we have a dedicated receptacle, floor receptacle, or you have something in a ceiling fan or light, I mean, that's kind of a no-brainer. It's going to obviously be higher than 48 inches. But if we have a dedicated receptacle, floor receptacle, or if we're going to violate the code for receptacle spacing because, you know, we have a window that comes all the way almost to the floor and we need to get a receptacle in there, it's going to be lower than the 15 inches. But we're still going to put the receptacle. Okay. And then effective, this comes mid-code cycle. So it's not required initially in January like the stuff we just looked at. But then we're going to look at an interior door. Effective July 1, 2024, one of the bedroom doors. It doesn't say this, but usually, you know, if you're picking a master bath to do your grab bars, you probably should look at the master bath for widening the door. And essentially, the code talks about a 32-inch wide door in the 90-degree open. That's basically a 3-0 door. You're not going to, by the time that door opens and sticks out with the door stops, you're going to end up with the 32-inch net close. So it's a clear opening. I don't know how you're going to do that with less than that. Maybe a pocket door, maybe a 2-8 pocket door, it all slides and still gives you the 32 inches. But generally, a swinging door is going to be a 3-0 door. And it's just about getting somebody in, either with a walker or wheelchair, you know, some other kind of assisting device. Doorbell buttons. I don't know if we've run into this. Because to be honest with you, everybody's doing these ring cameras. And a lot of times, they're putting this stuff on after we leave. I mean, it's just reality. The house gets finaled and they add this stuff later. But if you see one of these at final, just be aware that if they're adjusting it for the camera, which probably most people are, because they don't care that the doorbell is a little higher. They want to capture whoever's at their front door on camera. But just be aware. The code says the doorbell button has to be 48 inches. And if they've got a camera that they insist has to be at 5 feet or 6 feet, and that button's going to be too high, then they have to add another doorbell button. Okay. So that's what that little thing says. You guys ready for a break? So let's stand up. And then let's take about a 10-minute break. And so let's start back at about 5 after 10. All right?

Yeah, so that's kind of become the trend from, I think, the world record. The computer apps are engaging. Rappers can't write.

I was surprised. The location is really not related. It's a long time. So it's kind of a new construction. So... I was wondering. I can see the driving system condition. And that's the same as the Yeah. It's also I should have a definition of construction is. Does that mean from scratch? So now we're going to have to probably look at these You have to be able to And I'm totally on board with this. Yeah. I just steps and opening Right here, because I'm Yeah.

And so I started looking around and I know that you guys had a problem with that. I was required to put a backup drain. So I started calling the designers and contractors. I said, hey, if you're going to flush out and put a backup drain, so if one of them comes out of the window or something, it starts backing and this other drain is going to flood. And so that's where we mitigated that. Well, that's the frame that's going to flow in. And then, you know, maybe we're being a little overcautious because that means we can barely get more of a trip out of this. Here's the thing, without flowing up, if you close your eyes to, you know, right off your chance, look down there's five gallons of water in the tub. Because it was that much water coming out. We're now getting all the water going to the station. The shower heads are producing very, very water. And then, too, everyone is doing water-breaking in the entire floor now. In the bathroom. So we're probably okay. But you're trying to, so we're juggling with what is the, the trailer, which is the water. And then, you know, the All right, well, thank you. Yeah, you have an answer. I'll maybe look at lunch if I remember to. And then, you know, ask your 30-year-old. Okay. And then, you know, sit down there and voice it. That's a great question. That's what we need to do. It's going to take a couple of minutes to question. How are we going to voice it? You may need to produce an action statement. So that would be a good question. And then, if you're in another family, you can look at it. So this is really important from a definition. So it was, you know, there's a lot of pre-publishing of that expression in your case. Greg Greg Greg Yeah, so, um, the energy of the community, the relationship, the people's life. Yeah. Right? Yeah, that's correct. Yeah, so it looks like that people just kind of are just going to go back to the punk smith business for a couple of years. Yeah. Yeah. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're up and running, and so we get everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, are you part of the 11th? Yeah, 11th is the summer season. So, when you get to the coast, it's often against the time zone. I don't think I've been to the coast in two or three years. Two or three years, I'll say. I think you can go back and increase firepower versus the Yeah, so you can go in for two. Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg Greg I'm going to start with the executive. Well, it's like everything else in the structure. I'm starting to tackle the issues. So I'm watching a lot of changes. Every time there's major changes like that, it's the contract. It really ticks because it's like, we've always done it this way, and now you're doing this. It's not me. Yeah, it's one of the things. I know one person from our area, it's not too much in our area, where you are making the most changes, we all have stuff in our chapter. But I was wondering if you could talk about the and the way you do it. We're not open-routing. Yeah, so we're going to do it privately. We're doing it. We're going to do it. And then we're going to put the title on the agenda. And then if you talk to the people, they are going to be here to start. So we're going to have to do it privately. So maybe you'll have to do it.

All right, you guys ready to get started back again? Let's go ahead and start back up. All right, during the break, I had a couple really good questions. And I don't know the answer completely to this. But, you know, as with any new code section, sometimes we got to work the bugs out as to how it really kind of fits and how it's going to work. And so maybe each jurisdiction is going to have to look at this. And maybe some of you already have, those of you that are working for jurisdictions. But one of the questions that I was asked was, with the aging in place, does that apply to additions? And I don't. I don't know the answer to that. The code section says new construction. And I guess it's going to go back to the definition. And I brought to town with me my code books, but I don't have with me here in this room the residential code. So maybe I can get that at lunch and check on that. But it's just something to be aware of is that, you know, would that aging in place apply to an addition? Maybe. I don't know. Sometimes the code is really clear and clearly states additions, remodels, new construction. And other times it says just new construction. And be careful because definitions mean different things sometimes depending on the code you're in. We'll maybe see that in the energy code update. So I did the same presentation, the Reader's Digest version, to our local contracting community in our town. And I had a contractor challenge me on one of the sections that changed when you re-roof about insulation. And the wording was something to the effect of roof replacement. And he goes, oh, well, that's not going to apply to half of the jobs we do or more than that. He says, we're not tearing off the whole roof structure. And I had the energy code with me. And I said, let's look at what the definition of roof replacement is. And when you look it up in the energy code, roof replacement is I'm taking off the shingles and I may or may not change the roof sheeting. So that's just a re-roof. And so, yeah, when he saw that, he was like, oh, so if I re-roof, I may have to do insulation. I said, yep. It was something I dealt with down in Tulare County because we were in climate zone 13. So when it gets brutally hot in the summer. Yeah. That heat doesn't dissipate out of the attic. It stays hot all night. You know, you climb up in your attic on a summer day at 8 o'clock in the morning and it's over 100 degrees up there sometimes. And that's the issue. Now, when I came to Napa Valley, we're in climate zone 2. You know, we get a lot of the coastal air. We get inversion layers. We do get hot sometimes. But generally, we're pretty mild climate. So if you're rubbing up against the coast, those requirements maybe not are triggered. But as you get to the hotter climates. But what's interesting is you're going to see some of the energy code is now saying, hey, even in the coastal climates, we're going to have to start looking at this stuff like maybe cool roofs or, you know, we had radiant barriers added in climate zone 2 that I was doing down in the Central Valley but wasn't doing up in Napa Valley when I first came. And then all of a sudden, the last code cycle, radiant barriers required. So that's that foil-based sheeting. And then you're trying to reflect the heat out of the attic is what it's trying to do. So anyway, some good questions. I don't know that I have all the answers today. But something to think about. With any new code change, we're always getting something where we're going to have to think about how does this really apply. And so hopefully I'm giving you guys enough information that you guys can start talking about it. The ones that are in building departments, how are we going to enforce this, that kind of thing. And do more research. Nobody has all the answers. This new section, we're going to talk about energy storage systems. This stuff is so new and changing so rapidly, nobody's going to know all the answers to it. And you know what? We're going to find out some stuff here as time goes on of things that maybe we weren't doing quite right and that we need to, you know, be really concerned. So R328, the storage systems, Tesla Powerwalls, when I was down in the Central Valley, they started becoming, I guess, popular. I started seeing one or two installations. I knew nothing about it. So I was kind of learning with everybody else. And, you know, there may have been some requirements in the electrical code for batteries. I remember when I was in Yuma. Somebody put... I remember putting in a solar system and some batteries in a closet. And that was, I don't know, maybe 2007 or something. I had never seen something like that. But I was given the ticket to go do the inspection. And, you know, I'm trying to think, like, you know, what are the requirements? But now we're getting a whole bunch of code language that, you know, we don't want batteries in a closet or in a living space. And especially these Tesla Powerwalls. So... There's a lot of code changes on this. A lot of new language. Because these things can start on fire. And regardless of what Tesla tells you, because it's interesting. Tesla is this manufacturer. I'm not... Nothing against Tesla. I personally don't have anything. It could be any manufacturer. But it's basically the lithium batteries. But I happen to know the Tesla representative. Him and I get along real well. And he just assures me up and down. Hey, this thermal... Run away. It's never going to happen. He gives me all the data. I'm reading it. It's really good information. It says, you know, we have so many safety features built in. Well, that's all fine. I've told you guys I work for the fire department. And about a week ago, I'm listening to traffic on my pager. And we're all on the same channel. Most of the fire department's around. And I heard up in Calistoga, structure fire. So, I'm tuned. I'm tuned into that. Because, you know, hey, maybe they're going to request us. So, I'm listening. And first engine gets on scene and says, you know what? We got a battery, a storage, energy storage system. And it's smoking like crazy on the side of the house. Now, they were able to cool it down and prevent it from extending to the house. No problem. It was probably, you know, a small system like this that you see in the picture. But just be aware of these things. What happens is... Once the thermal runaway starts, it gets going. It can't stop. And it just keeps preheating the next cell next to it. And it's off and running. And this is something to pay attention. Now, this is related to residential. But just be aware that Tesla puts out a mega pack. I don't know if you guys know those. But I had one proposed in our jurisdiction. And so, when I first got it, the first thing I did was I called our fire department. Like, hey, do you guys... Do you guys want to come over and look at this? I've never looked at one. A mega pack is basically a bunch of these batteries put together. It's about the size of a small delivery truck. You know, like a two-ton or five-ton truck. It's a pretty good size. And the thing that I was concerned about is, hey, if this thing gets going, is this going to blow up at this business along Main Street? Is it going to take a car off of Main Street if it blows up? Because I saw a picture from a training that I went to. They showed a picture of a garage door where there was... I don't know if it was a Tesla Powerwall, but some kind of battery system. And something went wrong. And it blew the garage door right off the garage. And blew it across to look like a park across the street. So, just be aware. Nobody was hurt, apparently. But, you know, if something goes wrong, they can go wrong. So, anyway, I got this mega pack, you know, submitted to our city. And I went and met out with the property owner. And he was showing me where they were putting it. I started getting a little more of a comfort zone because it was way at the back of the property. And, you know, there was the Napa River back behind that. So, I started thinking, hey, if it's going to go somewhere on this property, there's a good spot for it. The whole time, you know, both the contractor and the property owner were touting how safe these are and how great they are. And so, we went ahead and permitted it. I tried to... We pull in every requirement, including... I went and got our 2022 book because they were putting in this huge solar system with it. And I don't remember the size, but there's a bunch of new sections for very large solar systems. And I tried to pull some of those requirements out of the 2022 code and say, hey, I want these put in for this. And they responded back and they said, hey, that's only for 300 gigawatt systems. And we're 290. So, it's like, okay. You know, so it's just funny how the contractors and designers sometimes push back. But anyway, just be aware. This is a big thing. Well, interestingly enough, on the Megapack battery, after I sounded all the concerns, you know, I'm one day watching the news. And I don't know if you guys know where Moss Landing is down in Monterey County. PG&E has a little generating facility there, Moss Landing, along Highway 1. And... And... And they have a bunch of Megapacks that they installed. The very same product that we were going to get in our town. So, right along the highway. And one caught fire. And, you know, they had to issue a shelter in place. They closed down the highway in both directions. So, it's terribly disrupting. This thing burnt for three days. North Monterey County Fire said, hey, we were instructed by PG&E not to put no water on these things. So, they just let it burn. They let it burn out. So, just be aware. If something goes bad, it can go kind of horribly wrong. And, you know, you can't put water on these things. You need a lot of water. Usually, it's tons of water to put them out. You got to really cool them down. If you don't have a good water source, you know, you're probably better off not even trying. You know, our fire engines normally carry like 500 gallons of water. And that's not enough. You get some of these, you know, certain fires like... You know, batteries or, you know, when I started in the fire service, if we ever had a VW bus catch on fire, I think the blocks are, I don't know, what is it, titanium or something. We'd go on a vehicle fire on one of those. Once they get going, you just need a ton of water. You're going to drain your tank and hopefully have a hydrant or something to hook into. So, anyway, you can't get them out, but it's a lot of water. Anyway, this new section has come in here to help us understand the dangers of these things. And hopefully, if we start following... some of these parameters, we can get, you know, some mitigated risk factors. We can try to make them a little safer because I think a lot of them were going in where there was just no real oversight. I probably wasn't paying attention like I should have. So, the energy storage system has to be listed and labeled to UL 9540. And if you have, you know, a big system like we had on the mega pack, there's the 9540. The 9540A, which actually asked for a real-world fire test. So, but generally, the residential, you're just looking at the UL 9540. Typically, these are pretty small systems. People might have like a couple of these. They're in this picture here. These are 13 and a half kilowatts. So, together, you might... Two of them might have 27 kilowatts. But the code is starting to restrict them to about 80 kilowatts. Maximum. And then in one place. And then, you know, if we have them installed outdoors, which is preferable, or a detached garage, you know, we're not as concerned because if that catches fire, you know, we're not going to displace a family, maybe not put somebody in harm's way. So, the spacing, the code requires now that the units should be not less than three feet apart. And that... In the previous picture, that was an installation where they just put them right together. I saw that a lot, where you'd see two or three just stacked right together. This is an installation on a house that we just did. They're doing an extensive remodel on it. You can see they're already complying with the code by setting them three feet apart. And that's fine. They wouldn't have been required necessarily when we permitted this. This new code section wasn't even here yet. So, it was the exception? The exception that it's in the manufacturer's instructions that says they can go... Yeah, if I had... Well, you have to be careful on that. So, generally, in the code, it says we follow manufacturer's instruction or the code, whichever is more restrictive. So, I'd have to think about that. If the manufacturer said, hey, I can put them right together, and I had a code section that said three feet apart, that's going to cause me to think about that a little bit. Maybe I'll end up getting there and allowing it, but I want to know why the manufacturer says that. Generally, the manufacturers are going to side on the error caution and are usually more cautious than the code. So, usually, it's the manufacturer is usually more restrictive than the code language. But again, at the beginning of the code, the code has always got language in there that, hey, if one is more restrictive, we're going to go to the more restrictive, or if we have a specific or general, we're going to go to the specific. And so, yeah, I'd be interested. I don't know, to tell you the truth, if Tesla or some of these other companies have rewritten some of their installation instructions in the advent of the new code. They probably have. Maybe we'll start seeing that. But I will say, this was not something that anybody was looking at because I actually had a house in our jurisdiction that was built off-grid. And off-grid is, I'm not connected to PG&E or whoever the utility is. I don't know who you guys have up here. Probably PG&E. But, so they wanted to be separate from PG&E. And so they built this house, pretty good size house, all LED lighting and all that stuff, really efficient technology. But they had, they had like 12 of these power walls. And then the whole roof was covered with solar and then a backup generator. And so, yeah, the house just sat there and ran by itself. No utility power at all. But it was in a detached garage and they just stacked like 10 or 12 of these right all against each other. No spacing at all. So, you know, if I'd have done that today, I would have looked at that a little closer. And I probably would have questioned if it was over 80 kilowatts. Because that's the other thing. And pretty soon you start stacking these up. I think it's about five or six at 13 and a half kilowatts. And you're going to be outside of that 80 kilowatt range. So maybe we need to look at the install a little closer. And then we want to look at the location they're going in. Preferably detached garage outside is great. Most of these are rated, you know, for outdoor. I don't think I've seen one that said it needed to be inside. They're all NEMA 3 or NEMA 4 or something. So they're meant to be outside. I think the big issue is if they're in direct sunlight, the hotter they get, they're going to maybe shut down. Probably once they reach about 125 degrees, they're probably not going to work very good. So there is something about them being in a shaded area. So that's why people want to put them in a basement or in a garage or something. But preferably if we can get them in a detached garage, or an accessory structure outside, if the thing just starts smoking, you know, that's better than being indoors somewhere where it's going to capture that smoke and heat and then maybe transmit it to the living areas. So they can go inside, but we just need to, we're going to have some requirements for that. So they talk about if you're in an enclosed utility closet or basement, then you're going to want to start looking at the garage. So if you're looking at, you know, 5'8", type X drywall, of course we can never have these in sleeping rooms or, you know, places like that. So energy ratings, installation of the ESS units. So each unit shouldn't be more than 20 kilowatts. I don't think I've seen one that's been larger. Normally they're like 13.5 to 15 kilowatts, but maybe somebody would build a big battery. 40 kilowatts within a utility closet or basement or 80 kilowatts out in an attached or detached garage. 80 kilowatts on an exterior structure or 80 kilowatts outdoors on the ground. That's kind of the limitations. So just be aware of that. Because again, if we end up, you know, like the mega pack, like we saw in Moss Landing, if you guys Google that, you'll see it on the news. Yeah, we don't want a fire and then have to shut down half the town for three days. That can not be a good thing. If they're going inside a, you know, garage, then we're looking for, you know, this fire detection. The big thing here is so, you know, smoke detectors are generally not allowed in garages. Smoke detection, you know, the issue is I think especially depending on the type, if it's photo ionization, they're subject to dust and then they start getting false alarms if they get dust inside there. So generally we don't want a smoke detector in a garage. Manufacturers say that. I think their code says that in R3-14. So we're looking for heat detection. The issue becomes is finding a heat detector that has a high enough heat rating that's going to meet this requirement without getting these false alarms because you can get pretty warm in a garage. We had, I don't know, this last summer, for some reason there was a heat spell that came through our town and I think it hit like 115 or 117 degrees, which is really unusual for our neck of the woods. And we had a couple fire alarms in our fire jurisdiction. My pager went off and I didn't go on the call, but the engine, you know, the company that went out there was just telling dispatch, you know, you're going to keep getting alarms because it's right under the metal roof of some, you know, wine crushing area, wine crush area or something like that, it's at a winery. And it's just under that metal roof, it was reaching that temperature, I don't know what the rating was, 135 or 140 degrees for this heat detector. It was just activating it and it was functioning fine. It just got so brutally hot. The big thing is we don't want a real low rating, like this kitty, I forgot what it said, I bought this at Home Depot. It was a pretty low rating, I think it says, well, it does say 135 degrees. And the issue is if we start getting a bunch of false alarms, what people do is they just go pull the detector down and we don't want that. So we want detectors in place, we want them to work when they need to and hopefully people are not defeating them. But somebody will come up with a detector that meets the requirement, I'm sure. Then we want protection impact. We need to make sure that they're not going to drive their car into it if it's in a garage. So there's a whole bunch of stuff about this. Unless we raise the battery pack up, if you've got a car that comes in and the hood's three feet off the ground and the battery pack's four feet off the ground, I'm not too worried about they're going to punch into the wall before they punch into the battery pack. So there's some exceptions if it's up off the ground and the garage door height doesn't allow a big monster truck to get in there where they might have a taller profile that would hit the unit. Otherwise, you're going to just look at maybe a ballard or something, some kind of protection post in the garage or put it outside of the drive aisle. So there's some information on that. The code actually has, I think, some diagrams that you guys are going to want to look at, kind of see how these things should be placed. So lots of impact protection options. Make sure you guys read those. Ventilation. Most of these, like the Tesla Powerwall, are typically saying they don't need to be ventilated, but if it was certain types of battery products, they are going to require ventilation. Electric vehicle use. So we're going to see this in the electric vehicle. Electrical code. Everybody's getting an electric car. And we're going to actually see where the electrical code, you know, we're expecting to either charge our electric vehicles or we're using our electric vehicles to power the house. It can go both ways. Kind of some new stuff coming out. Documentation and labeling. Just have to make sure that you have all this information for the homeowner so they know that they should only have qualified people working on it. And then finally, if you have systems that have highly toxic or toxic gases that are released, then there are some provisions for that. And should it be in an R3 or R4 occupancy. Okay, stationary engine generators. R329, this is an entirely new section. I'm sure you guys deal with it too. In our neck of the woods, we have what PG&E calls power safety shutoffs. So if the wind comes in, it's up to 15 miles an hour and it's a hot summer day, it seems like they shut our power off. And I'm, you know, joking about that. It's probably more than 15 miles an hour. But there's literally been some days where they go, power safety shut off and we're looking around. The trees aren't moving. There's no wind. But they had them forecasted, so they shut us off. And then when they shut us off, that would be okay if, you know, once the wind event was over. But PG&E says they need to check all their lines. And that takes us to the next step. And that's the day or so for them to fly around in a helicopter, make sure none of the lines have fallen down. And so they can't just flip the switch back on. They got to make sure the system's safe before they turn it on. So as a result, everybody, at least in our town, has been buying these generators. I mean, we've got so many generators that are installed now that half the time, I don't know the power's off other than if a traffic signal's out because the rest of the town is all lit up. Everybody said, hey, power safety shutoffs. I think we had two or three of them. People got mad. And they were like, I'm not sitting here in the dark for two days. And then if we had a wildland fire like the Glass Fire, there was some people in our city that were without power for 30 days. And so, yeah, people are getting generators. We're seeing a lot more of these. It's good that the code is starting to address this because before, while we had some stuff in the electric code, we just didn't expect every house to start getting, you know, a generator. And it was kind of like the wild, wild west. There was actually, and we'll talk about a little bit in here, the code kind of tightened up, I think. But we were just having everybody was either installing a stationary generator or a portable generator. They were trying to put these interlock kits in, and some were not so good. One, I got into a, I don't want to say a fight, but I got appealed on it, and I won the appeal. But it was a mess. There was a lot of arguments on it. And it was an unsafe install, in my opinion. And so we just didn't have a lot of code language. We're now starting to get some code language to try to regulate some of this stuff. Because, yeah, you don't want somebody plugging in and back feeding and then killing a lineman. So as a fireman, you know, we go on wires down calls. And I remember earlier this year, I don't know if you guys know where Silverado Trail is, but, you know, middle of the night, we get a call. We had some kind of a wind event, and it laid over like three or four power poles. And so wires down across the road. And so we closed the road in both directions. And PG&E came out. And PG&E drove up and down the road, pulling every switch they could find. And I don't know. We were out there from like 2 o'clock in the morning to, I don't know, finally PG&E came around 4 and said, I can't shut the thing down. I can't isolate it. He said, I don't know what's going on. So somebody probably up off of Silverado Trail had a generator that probably didn't have a transfer switch. I'm guessing because if you feed power back to PG&E, the transformer doesn't know it. PG&E sends in power at, you know, I don't know, 7,200 volts and steps it down to 240 so we can use it in our house. But if I pump 240 volts back, I'm going to hit that transformer. It's going to step it up to 7,200 volts. And so I'm going to have live power lines down the road. And, you know, PG&E and any utility, they don't trust anything. So they don't touch anything or deem it safe until they know it's safe. And he couldn't get this isolated for whatever reason, this little section. So anyway, just be aware. You know, we want to prevent that. If that was the case, that it was being backfed by a generator, we don't want that happening. You know, some of those houses are going to be backfed. Some of those are like a mile or two off the road. You know, we go up these little rickety roads. So you can't see the house. You can't hear the generator running. It's out in the country. So anyway, just be aware of that. So stationary generators, connection to one and to the premises wiring shall be by means of a listed transfer switch. And then I threw in the California Fire Code because the California Fire Code really addresses portable generators. Because I think we were having such a big issue. Everybody wants to pull a generator out of their garage and then just hook it into their service out front. And so the California Fire Code has a whole bunch of language on this. And of course, you know, they want the generator listed. So, you know, the generator has to now be listed. And then it talks about, you know, you have to have a, I think, the next slide you have to have a, well, maybe back here. One of them I thought you had to have a portable or a fire extinguisher close by. They talk about, you know, they can't be so close to a window that opens. So they have a whole bunch of information. Any doors or windows that open, you want them at least five feet away. And then extension cords, if you're using extension cords to connect to portable generators, that's fine. It just has to comply with GFI requirements. And section 603. And then it talks about connection to the premise wiring. And it says if there's, you know, power from a commercial source, meaning the utility, then you can't use these back feed receptacles. And we were seeing this all the time. People put in this little 30 amp receptacle and then put a little sliding interlock kit on their service. So, you know, the main breaker goes in. The generator goes off. And the generator breaker goes on. And then when you slide that little interlock kit up, then you can turn your main breaker on, but your generator breaker, 30 amp breaker, has to be in the off position. So the code is kind of enforcing, like, hey, this has to be done through a listed transfer switch. And so getting away from the interlock thing. And so, and that's a good thing because sometimes people defeat that code. And then, you know, if that little interlock kit or if that, you know, dead front comes off, then you can have both switches on or in the, you know, position that's going to feed back power. And we don't want that. Okay, stationary fuel generators. There's a section on that. I don't know if we're going to see this, but the code is just recognizing new technology that's coming. And then R337. Probably some of you are dealing with the wildland interface. So R337 deals with that. And they added this new section about trees, shrubs, and plants. This picture here, by the way, I don't know if I told you guys, all these pictures in this presentation are pictures I've taken, with the exception of one or two. But this is a picture I shot. This is at the St. Helena Hospital. This was during the glass fire, the 2020 fire. And this fire was roaring. And they told us, this is about 630 Sunday night. So the fire started, I think, around 330 or 4 o'clock that Sunday morning. And they told us, when the fire came to this part of town, they said, whatever you guys do, try to save this hospital. It was getting late in the evening, and they said, we're going to have to ground the aircraft. So they said, we've got a very large air tanker, a VLAT, coming. It's going to drop retarded behind the hospital. And then it's up to you guys to do what you can. And so we had like 100 fire engines lined up along the main road there. We were sitting in the parking lot here, and this fire just comes sliding down Sanatorium Road. And this news guy, if we have time, I'll show you guys the video. This guy in that white van, he all of a sudden realized, him and a couple others, that he was not in a good area. And he started running when this fire was coming down. The noise of this fire. I'm sitting here with our fire chief, and he's seen a lot of stuff in his years. He's like 65 years old, and he was just like, holy cow, Phil. He said, I just have not seen fire behavior like this. So it was kind of interesting to see this fire come down. We did save the hospital. One of our crews told us it was the first time they hooked into a fire hydrant to fight a wildland fire. Most of the time, we're looking for water sources. We're pumping out of pools and septics or whatever we can find to work it. water. I'm joking about the septics, but we try to find water wherever we can. And we had hydrants at the hospital and we were fighting some serious fire. So anyway, but the idea is with the plants and the shrubs and the trees, this is all fuel for the fire. And if we can get a species that reduces how the fire behaves, let's do it. So we shouldn't be having like these pine trees and stuff with lots of sap. And some of these things just go up like a Roman candle. It's like, holy cow. And if you have a wind, it's like a firework show. After this fire burned through, we went up the road. They told us to start putting out some of the hotspots and the wind would come up and it just shower us with embers from some of these pine trees that were burning. And yeah, we have enough knowledge now that if we can put certain types of oaks that don't have the sap and the resin. And then they're very resistant to first of all starting on fire. And then if they do start on fire, they're not going up like a can of gasoline. So anyway, we want to pay attention to that, especially around the vegetation around the house. I saw a bunch of houses in our jurisdiction where even like ground cover, some of these vines that were on like these retention walls within a couple feet of the house, which is literally burned. This fire here, I saw vineyards on fire. Green grape plants on fire. That's pretty sobering. You know, usually our vineyards are kind of our areas of protection, kind of the natural breaks. This fire, holy cow, it was burning up vineyards. So anyway, just be aware there's some code sections now that are giving us the ability to enforce certain vegetation. We want to try to give a fighting chance. This is a picture just up above the house. We're going to try to give a fighting chance. We're going to try to give a fighting chance. We're going to try to give a fighting chance. We're going to try to give a fighting chance. We're going to try to give a fighting chance. We're going to try to give a fighting chance. So yeah, you want to go to one of these two places, the Northwest Extension publication. You know, UC California has done a lot of research on structures in the wildland fire zones, and we know what works. We know we can do things through building materials and defensible spaces, you know, we're not going to stop every house from burning down, but we can do some things that will certainly reduce it and hopefully save a bunch of houses. Yeah. Will it stop the green code? Because the green code has limitations on how much water vegetation can use. Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know entirely the answer to that. My thing would be then don't plant vegetation. That's kind of tough. I know that the struggle we have, and I don't know if you guys have this up in your areas, but the struggle we have is people like privacy. They like lots of trees around their houses, and they don't want to be seen. That has that mentality has changed after the last two fires, both with the Hennessy lightning complex fire and with the glass fire. Because now there's some areas that you can drive by that you go, holy cow, I didn't even know there was a fire. You know, there was a house there before, but you can see it because people have taken away the vegetation. When I was on the Hennessy Ridge fire, so I was one of the first in engines up to that fire, and we couldn't get to it. It was burning in the middle of this canyon, and so it's like 630 in the morning, and we were trying to get to the fire. We never did get to the fire, so the fire finally came to us. The wind started coming up pretty good, and they told us to hold the fire at the edge of the yard and we would get to the fire. you know this road and the fire just came right up the um um up the hill there and there was like five of us engines parked there cal fire had one of their wildland engines down below and so they saw what the fire was doing i'm up on the ridge i couldn't see it um but i knew something was coming because when they started sounding the sirens when you hear sirens you know okay oh something's going bad and then i could see a bunch of people starting to run around i'm holding um you know the fire hose and sure enough this fire just came right up the ridge it sounded like a jet airplane um burning and it just shot right over the top of us and so before i could pull my hose around the engine um it was like half an acre involved on the other side like okay the fire jumped so we tried to put it out and it was off and running our battalion chief said guys we lost it so get out of here and it was kind of after that you know one of the guys said hey did anybody get that on film it's like well you're not thinking of filming that when this stuff's happening but um you know there were some areas where it was so overgrown that when the fire was burning through this thing is like shooting flames in the air you know 30 to 50 feet near you're not stopping it sounded like a jet airplane coming and then later in the day we got uh put on some structure protection at this one guy's house and i was like i don't even think we need to be here because the fire was creeping up the hill he had all the grass cut down to like you know two three inches and then he was like oh my god i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i'm gonna die he had all the trees limbed up to eight feet above the ground the fire just slowly creeped up the hill i took some video of it i was just like boy if we could have everybody's property like this the guy had his whole property done properly but some of his neighbors didn't and so um yeah on his property we're sitting there watching the fire the other properties we're in a firefight for our life so anyway um vegetation is very important um we shouldn't even have that just because it's so high and we're not going to be able to get it up and centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered centered the code we you know talked about accessory buildings and so just be aware we're gonna try to enforce some more ember resistant and ignition resistant materials chapter four and I may need to speed up a little bit here so we cover everything but by the way before I go on what time are we gonna take lunch 12 12 o'clock okay all right so we'll probably have another break in here before then but we'll see how it goes okay so chapter four foundations so just be aware that some of the footing sizes have been reduced from what previous code additions had again we're talking prescriptive code so you know if you have an engineer that determines you need a larger footing for the load or your soils engine! engineer determines its soil that you know needs a larger footing or deeper footing this is prescriptive code but one of the things that changed to was foundation waterproofing for years and years we've always done six mil you know this six mil vapor barriers and the code is changing to 10 mil saying hey some of this thinner plastic can end up tearing and then you lose your vapor barriers so so the new code is now going to require 10 mil for under foundations or if you have you know you're trying to protect around basement or something like that so under concrete slabs 10 mil and then And deck loads, the 2022 requires deck loads to be designed for snow loads if applicable. So if you're in snow country, you're going to want to look at that. Just be aware that that's going to be a requirement. The code's also going to allow some taller post heights for 4x4 and 4x6 posts. You guys can kind of read through some of this stuff. For fasteners, Chapter 6, I think the big change here, so hopefully everybody was nailing their king studs into the header. I always did, but maybe we didn't. It was probably more of a footnote than actually in our table, but table. 602.31 added item number 12, and now gives a minimum number of nails from your king stud into your headers, and then hopefully you have trimmers under that. And then there was also some fasteners changes that kind of aligned with what the building code. So the building code had a few more options than the residential code. So not like a lot of big change here, but just kind of made the two codes consistent. And then there was some modifications for field nailing. So historically, the code has always talked about a 6 and 12 nailing pattern. So 6 inches on the edges and 12 inches in the field. I don't know that this is going to be a big change because at least in our area, it seems like the contractors, I can't change your mind. If you tell them 6 inch nailing, they nail everything 6 inches. Most of the time, they're like, oh, that's a good idea. They're putting too many nails. But I think the recognition of the code that, you know, we're shooting gun nails. And so I saw like maybe three, four code cycles before we're here to now 2022. They talked about the gun nails. The shank thickness has changed. And I know you can buy some air nailers now that will shoot the thicker nails, but that's the issue. You know, when we used to hand nail stuff years and years ago, you know, a box nail was, you know, the true two and a half inches and a full eight penny. I mean, it was a thick shank. And then we started getting these gun nails and they're thinner and they're a little shorter. And so there was some wording I want to say back in like maybe the 2008 international code that started saying, you know, if you're using gun nails, the 0.113, you have to do a higher nailing pattern to make sure that you're getting the same shear value. Out of that. And so now the code has just come back and said, you know, do six inch nailing everywhere. And then and that's for wood structural panels as well as the roof sheathing. And and then there's some allowances. If you have 110 mile an hour or less wind design of three inches, maximum of three inches. On center nailing for alternative fastening. I don't know how many of you guys run into people using staples. I've never seen it in California here. But when I was in Arizona every now and then I'd run into somebody that wants to shoot these, I don't know, nails and they have to have a certain crown. I had to get out the code all the time because it was so infrequent and look and go, is it the right staple? But generally if they're using staples for the roof sheathing, they're going to be putting off. lot more of them. It's not the same as a nail. So just be aware of that. So some wording on that. I don't know that these are like huge changes. This change here on the location of the brace wall line. So I'm a little bit amused about this because I used to ask our plans examiners years ago, well, where's the brace wall line? You know, because you're always allowed this four foot offset. And so again, we're talking prescriptive code. So the prescriptive code, if I take the residential code, I can build a residential house. And if I do it to this prescription requirement, I'm good. I don't need any engineering. And so we would get into, you know, the code starts out that you want on each corner, you want a brace wall panel. And then no further than 20 feet in between. I think it used to be 25 feet center to center. And then they changed it 20 feet to edge to edge. It's basically pretty close to the same measurement. Then you're good. But if you look at this little picture that I drew here, the code allows for a maximum of a four foot offset. And so you can have somebody that would take this brace wall line if they decided, and I don't think, I don't know if my pointer's going to work. You guys. You probably can't see it, but it doesn't show on the screen. But anyway, you take across that brace wall line. And if you choose the interior wall, that's less than four feet and call that the brace wall line. Then according to what I read on this, some of the designers were saying, Hey, that's my brace wall line. And then on this little box up front, they weren't putting any brace wall. So it was kind of a violation of the principles of bracing because the bracing, you want to brace all the exterior walls. That's where we're trying to shoot for. And so anyway, there was maybe some little bit misinterpretation on this. And so the code just kind of cleaning this up and saying, Hey, you know, we want the brace wall around the exterior. That's what they're trying to determine or trying to clarify. All right. And then it's a little bit, a couple of changes here. I don't know. We're in design category D. I don't know if anybody has a seismic A or B. I don't know if that's anything out here or C, but there's some sections on that that just kind of clarify some continuous sheeting and brace wall panels. You know, some of this stuff has been in the code for years. If we have a brace wall panel in seismic D, we have to start on each end. So you're starting at the corners. And then again, not further than 20 feet between panels. And then there's some exceptions to that, that, you know, I can locate a brace wall panel up to, I think the code allows 10 feet. If I have a hold down on the, you know, corner that's going to rock up. And so the leading edge, if you will. And that's what this language at 602. 10.5.4 can begin no more than 10 feet from each end of the brace wall line, as long as you have this hold down device of 1800 pounds. And so anyway, just be aware that this is all prescriptive. If you have an engineered house, maybe totally different than this. So this is prescriptive design. Okay, chapter seven, water resistant barriers, not fewer than one layer. So this is a very important part of water resistant barriers. And so there's some language here. You know, I guess this is really important in an area that gets lots of rain. When I was down in Arizona, we didn't get a lot of rain. And so it was always a battle to try to get the water barriers put in right or the flashing around the windows half the time people did it incorrectly. And, you know, sometimes they just kind of shrug their shoulders, like why are we even worried about this? Because we hardly get rain here. But in our neck of the woods up here in California, it's probably something we should pay attention to. We don't want water intrusion into the structure, starts to rot out the studs or the, you know, sole plate and stuff like that. So there's some new language on that, some new standards that they've added. So just be aware of that. The code talks about, because this is the international code, it talks about the energy code that the International Code Council puts out. And we need to proceed that with our California energy code. And if you look in the international code, none of the energy climate zones match up to California. So just be aware of that. Need two layers, a 10 minute, grade D paper minimum. Okay. So for soffits, this goes back to wind design and cladding. Just to give you a little bit of a sense of what the Just be aware again, like I said earlier, you know, we're not necessarily expecting a building to blow down in a windstorm. A lot of times we're designed adequately, got plenty of, you know, brace wall panels and that kind of stuff. So that's not the issue. But I think we sometimes forget about the cladding and different building components that, you know, okay, the building didn't blow down, but, you know, half my roof blew off. Well, that's not good. I mean, especially like I mentioned, you know, in Yuma, we had a windstorm come through. It wasn't even that big of a wind in my opinion or estimation. You know, if you have a 50 mile an hour wind, 40 of your homes in your subdivision should blow off. And now all your homeowners, it was a fairly new subdivision. And the contractor, you know, half the time they go, well, you had a one year warranty or a two year warranty. So, and we don't cover for acts of God. So anyway. It's the code is just recognizing, hey, take a look at this stuff. So we don't have a windstorm come through and blow off half our siding or our metal roofing or something like that. Chapter eight, roof ceiling construction. There was a little bit of new language here. One of the things was is with fire rated or fire treated plywood, fire retarded treated plywood. There's a new standard that. Is required for testing and. And then they want to make sure that you're not trying to use paints, coatings or stains. Some of these treatments as a method of protection required for this section. So generally, if they're requiring fire treated plywood, you can't just go get some fire resistant paint into mess of paint and say that's good enough. I'll just coat it with paint. Code doesn't allow that. And then it talks again about the testing, some new testing methods for the structural panels. Ridge boards. So there was a little bit of language that was written on here. I, you know, I've been a contractor for a little while and I always had nailed off stuff real well. The code just kind of comes back and I don't know if they are just clarifying some things, but we were always using color ties or something to. Um, make sure that our. Buildings are not pushing away because as you know, you get a pitched roof, it's going to try to push out the walls. And, um, so, um, you know, the code kind of came back and, um, clarified the stuff. Hey, you want your ceiling Joyce fastened to your top plate. I think I always did that. Um, but, um, I got a picture here. Um, I'll push through to that. Oh, and the ceiling Joyce, you want to have them lapped. Um, and then you want to have them. Um, to provide a continuous tie. Some of this stuff is, you know, we've been doing for years, but maybe, you know, it wasn't clarified in this code, but here was a picture of the house that these two pictures are side by side. It looks like one picture, but it's two pictures. One's from the inside of the garage and one's, um, on the outside and the walls were literally pushing out on this garage and the whole front of the roof was dropping down. Um, you couldn't tell it by driving by, but this guy. Decided to do a remodel on his house. And the contractor pointed out to me, none of the ceiling Joyce were nailed to the top plate and there was no collar ties in this. Um, and this had been permitted for this garage, um, 20 years earlier. So whoever did it, you know, I'm not blaming the inspector. I'm just saying, you know, I don't climb up on a ladder and check that you've put in some nails into your ceiling Joyce. I mean, I just, I try to look as much as I can. But I don't look at everything. Um, and yeah, I just shake my head at that. What contractor would just put some ceiling Joyce up there? The contractor says, as soon as you pulled down the drywall, a couple of them just fell over. Nothing holding them. They're just, you know, laying up on top of the top plate. So anyway, uh, there's some language in chapter eight addresses that, uh, roof ventilation. Um, so there's a lot of stuff that's, you know, kind of related. To the energy code. Um, cause again, we're trying to prevent the heat from building and attic spaces. Uh, usually once it gets trapped in the attic space is going to take a long time to dissipate. And so, um, there's some stuff there. And then of course, um, Vince in the wildland urban interface. This is very important. If you're in a wildfire country, you guys got to enforce this stuff for these vents. Uh, on that glass fire I was on, I witnessed firsthand. And, um, we were doing structure protection. We had a Cal fire crew kind of around the corner from us. And they said, um, Hey, we have to go get fuel. And so, um, you know, the fire looked like it was a still ways off and they said, we're going to go take off and go get fuel. And they ran up to go get fuel at base camp. And they came back about an hour later and the house they were sitting on, they said was entirely charged with smoke. And, um, so, you know, it wasn't too much longer. That this house was just fully involved and it must've been an ember came in through an attic vent. Um, there was no other explanation for it. And I just think to myself, there was embers flying around that day, like crazy. Every time we had the wind gusts come up, it's, you know, like a shower of embers. And, um, and you know, you just think how silly was that? Um, something very simple, like an attic vent could have prevented this house from burning down. And we don't have the resources. We're lucky if we were able, especially on the glass fire, the whole state was on fire in 2020. So we were way outgunned, undermanned, but you know, we had as much help as we could get. In fact, um, you know, the Calvary came in like the end of that week, but for like a week, we're working with what we had, which was not a lot. And so we had hundreds of homes threatened for fires burning, seemed like every direction. And so we were outgunned. And, um, Um, But we were doing the best we could. And, um, you know, if there is a fire, a lot of times we can't stop it. Once the house starts on fire, you know, a normal structure fire, if we get a normal structure fire, we're getting like two or three water tenders, like five engines. We're getting an army of people for one house on fire. But when we got a wildfire, it's burning every direction. We don't have that. We're lucky to have one engine and you got 500 gallons of water. Um, so if the house gets really going, you're not stopping. It's just, okay, we lost this one and we're done. And, um, you know, to lose a house like that over, you know, some vents, we have the technology. Now, fortunately what's happening is the private sector, um, through the insurance industry is, um, well, most cases they're saying they're not insuring anymore. But if they will insure you in our town, I've seen lots of people retrofitting. We're seeing, um, a lot of, um, the ember resistant vents being added to homes. Um, they're putting on metal roofs because they're telling me the homeowners are saying we have to do it because the insurance company won't insure us. So, but if we're having a new house built, let's make sure this stuff's getting in here. We have, you know, code sections to require it. So if you're in the wild urban interface, um, we definitely want to require it. So at the beginning of the, um, presentation, um, this was the house that burned down. This could have been from ember intrusion. This was a guest house. This was a house up in the glass fire, um, in our jurisdiction in the city. It burned down. The stucco walls are still standing. Um, we were able to save the house. The, we drained the pool in order to save the house, but the guest house was lost. Um, we had a lot of that where we were able to save the main house, but the detached garage or a guest house would burn. It just either didn't have enough water or not enough manpower to save the whole property. Uh, building integrated, um, photovoltaic products. Um, so the code in chapter nine, you know, on roofing materials has some information on that. Just recognizing the new technology. We're starting to see these in our town. I took this picture of a house that just, um, recently got this Tesla roof. Um, I think we've had about maybe, um, eight or 10 of these so far installed in our town. They seem to be starting to get pretty popular, cover the whole roof and photovoltaic panels, essentially. And then roof mounted solar systems. Um, a little bit of language on there about the UL listing. Um, chapter nine on wind resistance for metal roof shingles. Um, some standards there to meet. And then classification of photovoltaic shingles. And then chapter 10, fireplace accessories. I don't know if we had an issue with this. But I saw this in the code. They have to be listed and labeled. Okay. You guys ready for a break? Um, so let me ask you guys this. Um, sorry. My Apple Watch is going crazy. Um, you want a break for lunch now? Or you want to take a short break and try to keep going? What do you guys think? I talked to I.S. Oh, because they're recording us? We'll keep going. Let's take a short, like, five minute break so everybody can, um, stretch their legs. And then we'll come back and we'll do, like, um, you know, 40 minutes. And we'll quit at noon. Okay? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . And then, uh, you know, the YouTube channel, when Jason was on the search, he was up in the middle of the place, and he was like, oh wait, he's like, oh my god, where am I? And so we were in the middle of the search, and we were like, oh, yeah, we're down in the middle of the search. And I was like, oh, that's going to be the same time we got to have these in the search. So we were like, oh, yeah, we're going to have these in the search. And then we were like, oh, wait, we should have these in the search.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. you know we're human we can sometimes get locked into that see something being done a certain way and you so when you see something different you go the knee-jerk reaction is like hey that's probably wrong and then you have to go back to the code and you find some little footnote or exception like hey that is fine the code says it's okay so just be aware of that but it was a good question because i'm sure that would have come up in our jurisdiction i would probably looked at that and said hey do i need to enforce this on addition if somebody builds another master bedroom or bathroom suite do they have to do the aging and play stuff and no looks like just new constructed buildings so anyway okay electrical code in my opinion the three codes that have the most changes are the residential the electrical and the energy code related to residential of course that's what we're talking about so the electrical code has a lot of changes to it and i think that's a good thing to do and i think that's a good thing to do a lot of changes i couldn't cover everything but i'm trying to cover again the big ticket items the stuff that we're probably going to see every day in the field and if you're a contractor the stuff you're going to have to contend with lots of more gfi requirements and then some other stuff like surge protection even if you change out of service you're going to see you got to have surge protection so anyway there's some pretty significant changes so we will start looking at that so the scope of the code added a couple items marinas which i don't know if anybody deals with you know watercraft it is important because you know there's the recognition of people what do they call it electrical shock drowning esd or something like that there's a term for it somebody's in the water and they're getting an electrical charge and it's basically giving them a lot of energy and they're getting a lot of energy and they're getting a lot of energy and enough shock that is contracting their muscles they can't swim they're drowning because they can't move and so we don't want that to happen so there's definitely some requirements in the electrical code and this scope of work kind of brings in hey boat yards watercraft marinas things like that we're going to need to look at that make sure we're not electrocuting somebody that jumps in the water installation used to export electrical power from vehicles so this is new because again this is changing so quickly you know typically i was thinking okay you know the state wants us all to drive electrical vehicles and i'm sure you guys have heard the news and you know i'm not trying to take a political opinion on it but you know the state says hey we're not going to sell gasoline powered engines here and i don't know what is it by 2030 or 2035 or something our governor has said we're all got to drive electrical vehicles so any new vehicles sold after whatever the date was got to be electrical vehicles so i'm thinking you know you know i'm thinking electric vehicle chargers we're going to start seeing these you know all over the place we already do at least in our jurisdiction um seems like every winery or every retail place has um car chargers our city puts them in the college has some i mean they're they're everywhere um but the code is recognizing too that if my power um goes out at my house i can just go to my electric car in the garage and plug a cord in and i can start powering maybe my refrigerator or my lights and um and there's a slide in here i'll show you a picture a guy in our jurisdiction he bought a you know one of the ford f-150 lightnings it's all electric ford pickup and so i was kind of interested in it and he started showing me it and he he brings out this cord he had this cord that they had provided for him he goes oh yeah he goes i can and plug this right into my house. So if I'm not charging my truck, if the power goes out, I can start backfeeding my house. So anyway, the code is recognizing it. The truth is, as an authority having jurisdiction, I'm just wondering how many people are going to come to us and say, hey, I'm putting in a car charger infrastructure to backfeed. Probably not going to see a lot of permits in private residences. They're supposed to, but that doesn't mean they always, there's no way for me to know if they're doing that. But the code covers it. Laundry areas, definition, they added this. And again, I said I wasn't going to talk a lot about definitions, but just be aware that every code has added some definitions, this code cycle. And so if you're looking for a specific definition, it could be important because sometimes people will question something and like, hey, is this? Is this a crawl space or like the example about, you know, what does attached mean? And obviously we must have had, you know, somebody got challenged on what's a laundry area. Well, now the code puts it in there. And because if we know what a laundry area is, now we can know where we need to put GFI and arc fault and all the requirements that follow for a laundry area. And then, so in chapter one here, 110.14, you know, this is nothing new. We need to torque our, our terminations. But the reality is, is half the time people don't. I still find lots of loose connections. I told you before I grab onto wires and sometimes they fall right off. And the code always talked about having, you know, a basically a torque wrench that you could verify this. And so just be aware that they're starting to add some more language to try to make sure that we're getting proper torquing. So I think it's really important to keep in mind some of the ways that you can work it out. On a grounding connection, it's only important if the worst case scenario happens. And unfortunately it does. You know, we had one of our local banks caught fire. I was sitting at home one Saturday evening and I heard, you know, my pager start to chatter and sure enough, we, you know, up in St. Helena, there's a structure fire. So, and, And after I went up there, it turned out it was a pretty warm day, and it was late in the evening. But something went wrong. They had, like, this 20-ton air conditioning system on the roof. Something went wrong, and it was on this 125-amp breaker. And that breaker did not trip. It just held on for dear life. I don't know if you've ever tried to reset a 125-amp breaker. The spring is huge on those things. I mean, like, you pull it off, you feel like you're breaking the plastic switch before the spring's going to give. So to kick a 125-amp breaker, not very easy. But it's even more difficult and not going to happen if you don't have any grounding. There's no way to clear the fault. So something went wrong in the system. There was no grounding conductor. And so this thing just started melting down all the wiring and started a fire on the parapet. And pretty soon, you know, it was a pretty active roof fire. And, yeah, that bank is... It's still not back in business today as a result. I mean, it did severe damage to water damage and everything. You know, it's just horrific. So, you know, if we have a, you know, a bad situation like that happen, we want proper grounding. And we want the terminals, you know, tight so they get good continuity. Otherwise, it's not going to clear the fault. And so then bad stuff happens. We're going to end up with fires. We're just going to sit there and arc and spark. And look like a welder welding, you know, because there's no way to clear the fault. And then you have the other situation where you have ungrounded conductors where I've seen where they haven't been tight. You know, I went and did a... We don't do schools here in California. In Arizona, we had schools. They were all putting up the carports with the PV on top. And so we didn't have DSA in Arizona. So our city would do school inspections. And so I went on a Saturday one day to look at this. And I saw this huge PV system being, you know, connected on the line side tap. And so, you know, we had Arizona Power was there. And we had a third-party listing agency. And I was there. But right at the breaker, I forget. It was like a 1200 amp breaker. Right where it connected the terminal, it was that conductor was just completely, you know, burned down. Just because it was... It was, you know, a loose connection. Just sitting there heating up. It's bad continuity. And all it is was a torquing issue. And so fortunately, there was enough wire there that the contractor was able to cut off a little bit and get a good piece of wire and still make it work. But anyway, just be aware of that. We see that all the time. Just stuff not being tightened down. And sometimes they tighten it down and come back, you know, a little while. When you have the heat and cold, you know, contract and expand. Certain metals are more susceptible than others. You know, copper is usually pretty good once you torque it down. But just be aware. Sometimes you got to come and retorque stuff. So means of identifying grounds. This was kind of always been in the code. Maybe they just kind of clarified some things. But we don't want a black conductor being used for grounding or neutral. The code says number six. Smaller. You can. It has to be factory covered. Colored. If it's larger conductors, they can phase tape them or recolor them. But generally should be factory colored. So black, like in this picture here, should have been green or bare. So there's a little bit of language here on that. I don't want to spend too much time on that. But 200.6 has been in the code for years. And. Just be aware of that. Sometimes people get a roll of green wire and want to wire everything in green. That's not permitted. Colors mean something. Code is clear on that. We want to know what's a grounded and ungrounded conductor. Okay. GFI requirements. So dwelling units. The code. It used to have. If it was an unfinished basement, they dropped the unfinished. And now it's just basements. So basements, regardless of finished or unfinished, are now required. It's hard to have ground fault. So that was a change. And then. There was this exception in the. In the code that was added for listed locking support mounted receptacles. Or ceiling fans, something like that, kind of mimicking other parts of the code. Indoor damp and wet location. This was added. So. I had a house that. I made him do GFI. I asked him. I said, hey. So I said, what is this room? And the guy said, well, it's where the homeowner is going to wash his dog. It was kind of between the house and the. I mean, between the kitchen and the garage. Kind of like a mud room. And. But there was like this sink there. And. So the code now is put this right in there that. Hey, if we have a wet location, like a dog. Or pet washing. Area. We want ground fault. Anytime you're around water. And I think I. He didn't argue with me. I just told him. Hey, if that receptacles within six feet of the sink. And you know, if they're going to wash their pet, they're going to want to. You know, use a hairdryer to dry the dog off or whatever. That's fine. We just want to make sure. Somebody doesn't get electrocuted. And you guys understand what ground fault and arc fault. Two different things here. I run into this all the time. People. I hear all kinds of. Crazy things. But. You know, ground fault. We're trying to prevent someone from being electrocuted. An art fault. We're just trying to prevent fires. So if I have a circuit that is arcing and sparking, it's not electrocute in anybody. But that's going to eventually result in a fire. I went on a fire call one time. Long time ago. Maybe 20 years ago. People came home from. The movies. It was like 11 o'clock at night. Called us out. Said. Hey. The smoke in our house. We don't know what's going on. So we came out there. Sure enough. A little bit of light smoke in the house. I took our attic ladder. Pop my head up in the attic. Acts just charged with smoke. But we don't see no fire. We don't know where the fire is. So, you know, we carry on our engines. Some pretty cool equipment. One of them is thermal imaging camera. So we got that camera. And you can point it and. It identifies, you know, areas of heat. And sure enough. We. We pointed at the. In right in the living room. This light fixture. And it was showing that it was really hot. So we went. Got a ladder to pull this light fixture down. And the light fixture literally just came falling down in our hands. A little bit of attic insulation came down with it. And that ceiling joist was completely charred. Sitting there just smoldering. And if those people would have been asleep or gone to sleep. That would have been a working structure fire later that night. I mean. It was just sitting there ready to go. Well, what the issue was is. Something was going on inside that box. You know, it was an older house where, you know, they tried to take 40 conductors all into the. You know, you see these old houses. It's like 40 wires coming in everywhere. And they're trying to jam it into this, you know, four inch electrical box. And so it's probably, you know, overfilled and no way for it to cool down the conductors. But it was sitting there heating up. And that breaker. A regular breaker is just going to keep feeding power. It senses it as a load. It might have been arcing or sparking. Might have been a loose connection. And it'll just keep feeding it until there's like a direct short or something that tripped a breaker. But an arc fault breaker would sense that right away. And so an arc fault breaker would trip. And so arc fault. We're trying to reduce fires. And probably over time with all the new houses being built and remodels that we're seeing arc faults going in. You know. There's going to come a point in time where I'm not going to get called out 11 o'clock at night for some incident like that. Because we're going to have less fires. And that's the idea. The code, of course, allows if I put everything in a metal raceway. This is another idea that is I think is terribly misunderstood. Because I'll go into houses. And the contractor will run a piece of Romex from a regular breaker out in the panel to, you know, first. Receptacle. And he'll put an arc fault receptacle. Well, you have an arc fault at the circuit from that receptacle on. Maybe after that receptacle is arc faulted. But the code says if you're going to do that, you have to get that in on the rough end. You have to get in a metal raceway. It could be MC cable or conduit. And the idea is if something goes wrong with that wiring, it's going to melt down in the metal raceway. But it's not going to spread to the combustible materials. It's not going to start to structure. It's going to start to get the structure on fire. So, you know, we had a house built, I don't know, it's probably four or five years ago. And the guy was all worried about I think it was like electromagnetic fields. And so he wired his entire house out of MC cable, metal boxes everywhere. And I told the contractor, I said, you know, after looking at this at rough end, I go, I don't think you have to do arc fault. I think you're fine. He goes, ah, we're going to put them in anyway. And they put them in. But it wouldn't have probably required it. Because if you're in a metal raceway and everything melts down, you're fine. So just be aware that if you think in those terms like, hey, I'm trying to prevent a fire, you'll sort of understand, you know, I got to be in a metal raceway to that first ground fault. Or I got to catch it right at the panel box. I got to have an arc fault breaker to stop that arcing and sparking or, you know, overheating of the conductor. And then GFI, you know, like I said, that's just preventing me from getting shocked. Hopefully before that electrical power passes through me, that GFI is working correctly and it's going to trip. So if it senses any kind of a bleed off of power between the neutral and the hot, it's going to think, hey, the power is feeding through a human body and it just trips it. It's done in a millisecond. So GFI to prevent ground fault, arc fault. Arc fault is to prevent fires. And the code, especially this latest code, it just keeps expanding, you know, more GFI requirements and sometimes we'll see the arc fault kind of expanding. I think at some point we're going to see the code just require everything to be GFI and everything arc faulted. We're not quite there yet, but pretty close. So the big change here is so historically the code has always said 125 volts, 55 volts. So if we had 15 or 20 circuits, we were going to GFI if they were in the right location. So, you know, kitchens and bathrooms and garages and so on. Well, the code changed in 2022. It now says it's through 250 volts. The significance of this is when this code first was written and this came in the 2020 NEC, the National Electrical Code, we see this code change a couple of times. And then we see this code change a couple of years later because we don't put it in until the 2022. But it meant air conditioners. It could be a sump pump. It could be, you know, garage plug for a air compressor or welder for somebody that's kind of a hobby person. Anything 250 volts would have had to be ground faulted. But I had to update my slide because, well, including the 250 volts. So, you know, the code says that if you have a kitchen range, we'll talk about that, and your, you know, clothes dryer and on and on. But there's a slide in here and we'll get to it. But the whole GFI on the air conditioners, there's been a little bit of pullback from that. We'll talk about that when I get to the slide. But, yeah, just be aware. So in the 2022, the code says, and this picture, this probably is going to meet that requirement. If I'm within six feet of the sink, my range has to be GFI'd. But the 2024 NEC is now in print. And this six-foot rule went away. It just says if you're in the kitchen with a range, you've got a GFI. So just be aware that eventually, no matter where that range is, but right now for our 2022 code, if you're within six feet of the sink, so if your range is close enough, you have to GFI it. Okay. Yes, sir. I don't think they have one of those button areas that talks to the . Yeah. So like is that a water source or a sink? Yeah. Probably. Probably could use that rule. Yeah. I haven't really thought about that. But probably. Yeah, that would be within six feet. I mean, it's not a sink, but it's within six feet of the water. Water directability. Yeah. What the code panels are saying is that, you know, a lot of these appliances, as they age, the grounding of the metal frames is not, you know, holding up. And so that appliance is plugged in and got some pretty high voltage. And if something goes to ground. So with the air conditioners, I know they said the reason why they were including air conditioners. I'm trying to think of when this happened. It was a few years ago. A kid jumped over a chain link fence. I think he was doing something he wasn't supposed to, but don't quote me on that. It was a kid, apparently like a 12-year-old kid jumped over a fence. He's touching the chain link fence. And when he jumped over to the other side, I think he was in somebody's yard. He wasn't supposed to be. But when he touched the air conditioner frame, the condenser, he got electrocuted. It was energized. And it killed him. So that's why at least the commentary I've read is they said that that brought about this change. It's a real thing. My brother is an air conditioner contractor in Arizona. And he called me one time and he said, hey, he said, I got called by a realtor. They're trying to sell this house. And they said, air conditioner is not working. We don't know why. Can you come check it out? And so he said he went up there. And he carries, you know, a bottle of refrigerant. It's usually refrigerant, you know, a little bit leaked out or something. And he's got this little bag of tools. And he said when he laid the bag of tools up against the, you know, metal housing of the condenser, he said he thought he saw it spark. And he kind of caught him off guard. And he thought, hmm, that's strange. So he went and got his electrical tester. And he said that thing was fully energized. And so that tells me no grounding conductor. And it was in the city that I used to work at in Arizona. So he called me to give me trouble. Like, how do you guys approve this? And I said, well, I can tell you one thing. We don't approve that. That's probably an air conditioner that went in without a permit. But, I mean, that's just silly beyond, you know, the whole permit issue. It's like shame on the contractor that did that. No grounding conductors. No way to clear that fault. That electrical or that metal frame sits there alive and just waiting. It's fully energized. Just waiting for someone to come touch it. And if you catch the right circumstance, again, if we touch it, if we're wearing rubber-soled shoes or something, maybe we're not going to get electrocuted to the point of death. But, you know, a little kid playing in the backyard might be running around barefooted or it's hot summer day. There's spraying water everywhere. Yeah, they're a good source for electrocution. So anyway. Okay. GFI locations, basements, we said finished or unfinished. They added this. Bedroom receptacles within six feet. Six feet of the sink. And same with hallways. I would have already enforced that six-foot rule myself. I don't know why they added this. So if somebody has a wet bar sink in a hallway or a bedroom, you might see that in a, you know, custom house or something. Not so much a track home. But just be aware. It should be GFI. But if there was a sink, I would have already used the six-foot rule. Anything within six feet of a sink I would have probably pointed to. Indoor wet and damp locations, we talked about this. Possibly pet washing facilities. And then it says the AHJ, the authority having jurisdiction, will determine these locations. So the heating and air conditioning refrigerant outlets or equipment outlets, you know, we're supposed to have a receptacle to service within 25 feet. So it's required for all outlets, whether it's indoors or outdoors. Now, I think historically we're kind of looking at if it was outdoors, we would GFI it. If it was in the attic, maybe not so much. Exterior outlets, so all 125-volt through 250. The exception was for lighting outlets. And those are covered under another section. But, again, I said this is, you know, this could be for a septic pump or a sump pump. It was for AC condensers. So if you read the 2022 code, the 2022 code, as it's printed, actually says don't enforce the air conditioner requirement until January of 2023. Well, you know, that was going to hit our code for California because we had started enforcing the new code in January of 2023. But NFPA has since issued this temporary amendment. And they pushed it back to 2026. Because apparently they're having trouble. So September 1 of 2026 and the new 2024 NEC that's been printed has the same wording now. So we don't need the temporary amendment. We've got the actual written code says don't enforce this until September of 2026. I think they were trying to get the air conditioning manufacturers on board before. 2023. But it wasn't happening for whatever reason. The issue is, I guess they said there was a subdivision out in I think it was Georgia. It's been a few months since I read this. I think it was in Georgia. They had 40 homes. And they started doing this because the NEC for 2020, which is a lot of other parts of the country, have already adopted the 2020 NEC. And so this particular jurisdiction in Georgia. Was requiring them to ground fault all the air conditioners. And of the 40 new homes in the subdivision, like 38 of them, the breakers were tripping. And it would be like right in the middle of the summer. It's really hot. It's humid. And the argument was made that, hey, this is actually more dangerous for especially an elderly person. Because, you know, most people don't. It's sad to say, you know, if your air conditioner stops working, you'd think that most people would run out to the breaker and make sure the breaker hasn't tripped. Check that first. But I guess nowadays most people don't know that. So they call an air conditioning service guy, take them a day or two. Meantime, they're sitting there sweating and suffering in this, you know, brutal heat. So NFPA said, hey, don't enforce this until January of 2023. And now they've pushed it even further forward. But it will be for everything else. So just be aware. 250 volts. So now you've got to buy a two-pole GFI breaker. And I don't think those are cheap. But, you know, it's like, you know, we would look for those if you were installing a spa. Now we're going to be looking for them if you put in a range or something else. Yes, sir. So what you're saying is that that's going to require this? Yeah, this is the 2022 California. You're looking for that and the service now. Yep. GFI breaker for the two-pole. Yep. For the AC. Well, not for the AC, but everything else. Eventually, after 2026, if they get it resolved. But it will be for everything else, like a kitchen range possibly, an electric dryer, clothes dryer. If I'm plugging in a welder out in my garage, you know, to a receptacle out there. Because we have that all the time. They put it in and I get told, hey, the homeowner is going to use the air compressor here or a welder. Well, 250 volts. Now it's got to be GFI'd. Yeah. Or if they're putting in a sump pump. In our town, the water table is like at 10 feet. In the middle of the summer, people's basements fill up with water. We can't dig a pool in our jurisdiction without the hole filling up with water. So water is an issue. So lots of people have sump pumps. They're all going to require GFI if they're installing new ones. And there was a question back there. I was just going to say, the water and the air equipment. I put it in. They should see the owners. Right. And put it in GFI. And that's probably the problem. Yeah, that's the issue. So they're not able to figure that out. So it doesn't trip for no reason. I guess the unit kicks on and it trips it. Yeah. So however that issue is going to be worked out, I don't know. Maybe they're going to do some kind of a surge protector in the unit. I don't know what they're going to do to fix it. Yes, sir. Just a definition question. So you're talking about a plug in? No, that's not correct. So if you look at the definition of outlet, it's any outlet for an electrical. It could be a smoke detector, a receptacle, a light switch. It could be a light fixture. That's why if you see this exception for required lighting outlets, I might have a little flood light out in front of my garage. And that's saying don't GFI that because it's covered under a nut. I'm going to go to another section. But it's not requiring it. But yeah, any outlet. So that's the misconception. I've run into that all the time. Mostly with the arc fault because people will say, well, that's a receptacle. That's not a smoke detector. I'm like, no, no. The smoke detector, you put a box up there that's got electrical wires to it, that's an outlet. That has to be arc fault because it's in a bedroom or in one of the required locations for arc fault. Which arc fault is everywhere except for bathrooms and garages now. So it's basically almost the entire house. So yeah, an outlet is a lighting outlet, a receptacle, a smoke detector, anything that has power to it. Yeah. Yeah, if you look at the definition in the electrical code, yeah, I always think of, I thought like you, you know, outlets are receptacle. But that's not the case. Nope. Okay. So our subpanels. And we're going to break for lunch here in a couple minutes. But our subpanels are going to grow. I took this picture of the house that got remodeled. Not only did they have a service panel that probably had this many breakers. But, you know, you're having these subpanels that are like five feet tall. And the reason is, is because, you know, all the extra requirements with GFI. So for a long time, we couldn't find, you know, if you had a smaller panel, you could get quad breakers. I could get a, you know. Two pole quad breaker. So I'd have maybe a 30 amp two pole and a 50 amp two pole. And it'd take up those two breaker spaces. Well, if I go to GFI, I don't know that we're going to have a manufacturer that has, you know, a quad breaker that's GFI. I think that's coming because in this next picture, this guy had a challenge. I felt bad because he did this remodel. And, you know, people miss it on their plans. But they get to final. And then I say, hey, where's the arc fault for this? And he goes, oh, and then they'll usually argue. The first thing they say is, hey, the panel is old and doesn't have the room. And I say, well, that is not an excuse. So I told him, I said, you got to get some quad breakers and double up like the AC in the dryer. And so buy some space to put in these two arc faults. Well, when I came back for the final, he goes, hey, I found one of these mini twins that was arc faulted. I think it was GE that made it or something like that. Anyway, so there's a manufacturer out there now making the mini twin. But still, just be aware that if you're an inspector with all the arc fault and GFIs that were required now, the first thing I do when I go to a Russin is I say, where's your electrical panel? Because I don't want to get into the situation where they've got like 12 or 24 spaces and they got about 40 circuits. There's no way you're making everything fit. So I just, you know, stop them right there and say, you're either adding a sub panel now, because we don't want to get to final and then tell them that. Because by then you've got, you know, you're going to not only have the contractor mad, but usually the homeowner is mad by then too. And they think you're, you know, throwing some requirements on them that are silly or whatever. So catch it at Russin, you know. We want to look at this stuff at Russin. If I see a panel like this that, you know, that thing went from 4 to 5, or 4 to ceiling practically, I'm like, oh, okay. I'm not too worried about if we're going to have enough room. And we were fine. So anyway. Okay. So we're probably going to stop right here. It's in the middle of the electrical code. But we'll take lunch. How long is lunch? Okay. So be back here at 1 o'clock. And we'll try to wrap this up. We'll try to get everybody out of here somewhat at a decent time. So.
