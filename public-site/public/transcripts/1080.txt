 All right, we'll go ahead and call to order the regular Chico City Council meeting here on September 20th, and we will start with our invocation. Welcome. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I ask for your prayers. Almighty and merciful, everlasting and loving God, Chico City Council now meets to join the strengths, the ideals, and the desires of the many gathered here seeking a common cause. We all want a good life in this city. We all long for safer streets, happier homes, better schools, and well-educated citizens to lead rewarding careers, to enjoy our families and marriages, to provide loving care for the elderly and infirm, and to lead lives that honor you and honor one another. May the Council have a meeting of minds, an agreement on its ultimate goal, a vision shared among their number, a common hope for future things, so that all may agree on the ways and means to be employed to achieve great things together. Our best hopes are met only in you, so may we walk the paths of peace and harmony with gracious and honorable manners and patience to seek and to see more clearly the steps before us, and with one heart, begin again tonight. Our highest praises and honors. Go to Chief Matt Madden, retiring this week, with hopes for a great long life in retirement. We also pray for wisdom in the selection of his replacement. We know you are watching, and in the grace and comfort of your spirit, we rest our desires and dreams. This we pray through your grace and mercy, knowing that you are always more ready to answer than we are to pray, and you are ever willing to give us more than we can. And we desire, or deserve. Father, we pray this in your most holy name. Amen. Beautiful, thank you. If you'd please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. Pledge of Allegiance. Absolutely. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.аетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетаетает to address the council on any item listed on the agenda should first complete the speaker card found at the back of the chamber and then turn it into the city clerk on my left on your right speakers are taken in the order the cards are received and once the speaker is called no additional cards will be accepted and we also ask that you not applaud or boo anyone so we can keep everybody speaking and feeling that they can state their opinion without feeling intimidated at all and we will move on to a closed session announcement from city attorney vincent ewing thank you mayor coolidge the city attorney city manager city clerk and staff met with council in closed session to discuss the items set forth on the agenda on item 2.3 a discussion occurred no action was taken 2.4 discussion occurred no action was taken 2.5 no discussion no action 2.7 discussion occurred no action was taken that concludes my report on the closed session items it's already up there all right you got a really good city yeah city clerk they take care of us and i was wondering if council member michael bryan you got a really good city yeah city clerk they take care of us and i was wondering if council member michael bryan please chief come down and join us as well we're going to say a few words first as your predecessor thank you mr mayor so the mayor has a more formal statement that you can make in a moment i have a more personal one so matt she bad and served as my deputy chief through some of the more significant events of this city's history and our police department could not have navigated those without his skill and his competence and i want everyone to know that i want you to know that matt and as a now sitting council member the road has not gotten any easier for us you were not not given an easy path we do not pick our paths of leadership but we have to navigate those paths and i want to tell you as both your form ofаетe Chief and is now a City Council member how proud I am of you and how you've navigated those paths, these difficult challenges that none of us anticipate or ask for, but have to walk, and you walk that walk with great integrity and competence. And as your former Chief and as a City Council member, I want to thank you personally and humbly. Thank you for your service of nearly three decades to this community. Thank you, Matt. All right, now we'll do the long official. You guys all get a little history here, too. So, for over 26 years of service, it's amazing. Chief Madden, a graduate of Paradise High School, went on to graduate with the 79th class of the Butte College Law Enforcement Academy in October of 1992, holds a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, is a graduate of the Sherman-Millard School of Law, and a graduate of the! Chief Madden later became the department's narcotics detective and moved to the detective bureau in the main office. During his career at Yuba County, Chief Madden served as a field training officer, a member of their special enforcement detail SWAT, and marijuana eradication coordinator investigating legal marijuana growth throughout the county. During his time at the Yuba County Sheriff's Office, Chief Madden was awarded the Silver Medal of Valor. The California Senate. State Firefighters Association Medal of Valor. An accommodation from the California State Senate. Chief Madden and his wife, Jennifer, had strong desires to return to Butte County to raise their children, so he applied to the Chico Police Department and was hired in July of 1997. Chief Madden held a variety of positions within the Chico PD, including field training officer, special weapons and tactics team member and leader, detective in the criminal investigations division, street crime sergeant, detective sergeant, watch commander. He served as a lieutenant, administrative lieutenant and deputy chief and ultimately police chief. Quite a climb. On April 1st, 2022, Chief Madden became interim city manager. We certainly appreciate his leadership during that time. He spent several weeks in the position before returning to police department to finish out his career with almost 30 years in law enforcement. Chief Madden was awarded the Chico Police Department's Medal of Courage in 2000 and again in 2013. In 2006, he was awarded the department's Medal of Courage. He was awarded the Chico Police Department's Medal of Merit and was selected as the Chico Police Department's Officer of the Year. During his career at the Chico Police Department, Chief Madden has earned seven Class A commendations. After honorably serving in law enforcement for over 30 years, Chief Madden will retire on September 30th, 2022. Chief Madden's commitment, dedication and service are held in high regard and it is the City Council's desire on behalf of all the residents of this community to continue to serve the community and to continue to serve the community. We are very grateful to Chief Madden for his commitment to the community and to the community to present him with a certificate of appreciation for his many contributions to the City of Chico and this community. And this is where you get to say a few words. Thank you. Well, as you can hear, Chico Police Department was very, very good to me. I had just an amazing career here. This community was good to me and it was a wise choice to come here. You know, there's a lot of people to thank when you have a career like that and there's a lot of mentorship, a lot of leadership above you to guide you as you go through your career. And I was lucky to have that in my life. I mean, really, thank you. The first people I want to thank is my family. My wife and I will be celebrating our 29th wedding anniversary here in a few short months. And most people don't realize that our families serve alongside with us. They sacrifice a lot to be married, to be a child of a police officer. And so I've got a lot of questions like, what are you going to do after this? Well, I know what I'm going to do is I'm going to spend the rest of my life making up for the house time and honoring my wife and my children. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. So I'm looking forward to it. of those challenges, just like we've done day in and day out for years and years. You know, I want to thank former city manager Mark Warren for giving me this opportunity to lead the department. It was absolutely my honor. But it's a team effort, folks. You don't run a department this size and go through and deal with the things that we've dealt with in the last four, five, six, seven years, some of the most crazy times in my 30-year career. You don't do that a lot, and it takes a lot. And so I appreciate that, and I appreciate Mark Warren and his support of the department. I wish you the best, Mark Sorensen. I would look forward to working with you. You are a strong leader. His stoic leadership and his intelligence is going to serve the city well. The department directors and staff, deputy city manager, city clerk, Vince, and all the directors. Thank you so much. I did get to spend a little time downtown, and it really brought me perspective to see what each one of these directors, and even you should keep standing. A little cop fire thing, you know. I didn't get in there on the last time. But no, seriously, I got to really get to see from a city manager's perspective all the work that goes on and really broadened my perspective on the day-to-day operations to run a city. And so thank you. Thank you for your friendship and your support, and I wish you all the best. These are fine men and women leaving your city. And finally, to the men and women at the police department, I'm going to miss you. And I've been trying to think about what it is I love about this job, and it's not uniforms, police cars. It's sure not the facility. It's the people. And I've gotten the opportunity for three years to work with some of the best people around me. And they're going to be here. We set off a couple years ago to build a strong administrative team, because it starts at the top. And we did that. And so our administrative team is probably the best I've ever seen in 30 years. The future is bright for your police department. They have some significant challenges ahead of them. You know, we continue to see legislation and things that come out that are going to hamstring on. And they're doing the best that they can. But in 30 years, I've seen the pendulum swing one way or the other, and it better start swinging back, folks. I'll just tell you that right now. So with that, I wish you all the best. Thank you so much to this community. It was an honor to serve you. What an incredible, unique community in Northern California. And this place is special. And I think we all realize that, everybody in this room. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. So thank you all. and Godspeed, G.O.B. All right, thank you everybody for coming for that. We really appreciate you being here. We will move on at this time to the consent agenda. All matters listed on the consent agenda are to be considered routine in nature, can be enacted in one motion. Do we have any speakers on the consent? Okay, no speakers on the consent. Any council disqualifications or no votes? I'd like to abstain from item 2.4, meeting minutes. Okay, any others? All right, entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. Motion by the vice mayor and second by Council Member Brown. Take a roll. Okay, Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye.

This time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or is determined based upon the number of speakers. Council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have, I believe we have five. All right, three minutes. All right. James Hutchinson followed by Jeff Sloan. Part of me is sorry to be here today. But here's what's happened. Last couple of times I've addressed you about Murphy Commons and problems that were going over there. Most of you know what's been happening in that area now. We're not talking about the cleanup, the cleanup that suddenly there was more than they thought was there. We're talking about crime, violence, death. We have a man dying. A man dying right there on a pathway to Marsh Junior High. We have a camp that's right there. On a Thursday, last Thursday, a young man and several other students were trying to get to school. Two black dogs come charging out of where there's a camp right there. My dead horse slew. They're panicked because these dogs are coming at them. These dogs have been problems before. The week before, police officers showed up there. And these police officers had a dog. One officer showed up, had a dog. What happened? The two dogs came running out. Within minutes, three police cars come charging up to his rescue. He didn't get out of the car. His dog didn't get out of the car. There was no immediate threat. This young boy was trying to get to school. That's all his crime is. He's not the only one there. There's another boy on the other side of the street that can't go because the dog's chasing. The dog's chasing after a young woman on a bicycle. She barely gets away. That dog's right at his heel. Two people behind us stop. They're smart enough to freeze. And they're sitting there like, hey, what do we do? What do we do? So I suggest that you do the right thing. The young boy had a cell phone. I said, call 911. Call the police. That wasn't my first temptation, believe me. My feelings about this police department, I think I've made no. I have no respect for him. None whatsoever. But I tried to get this boy to do the right thing. And I talked to him about what he needed to tell the dispatcher. He didn't know. He didn't even know that it was a dead horse slew there at the bridge. Okay? He had no idea. But he wanted to get to school badly. So he calls the dispatcher. He calls. Okay. He makes his phone call. He gives the information out. He does a good job of it. And we sit there waiting. Nothing's happening. Waiting. Police officer's in trouble. Immediately got help. He didn't. We have a whole situation going on here. We have a dead body sitting out there. Shan Lennon, 29, his mother Colleen, comes from Pennsylvania out here. By the way, the boy, the next day I talked to him, he said, did the police come out? I waited there. No police came out. No police came out to help him. What do you think he's going to think now? And tell his friends about the Chico police. They're like the people in Texas. Jeff Sloan, followed by Addison Winslow. Four police chiefs, including you, Mike, and several detectives all met with the D.A. after confirming extensive criminal... misconduct of school district top officials. The FBI was brought in hoping they could bring federal charges. But we were up against a statute of limitations. Since your initial investigation, my teacher wife has been fighting for her life. One staff member after another got cancer. Most died instead of having a fighting chance with early detection. Here is the superintendent's e-mail and board secret e-mail discussing concerns that people... were being poisoned in classrooms and how they weren't going to share those concerns with those affected. No one warned them. There is no statute of limitations for that. You trusted only a few of us, Mike, that the FBI was investigating the school district. Someone however leaked off the top staff and there's a secret district e-mail worried that you and the FBI were closing in on it. The only ones who could have tipped them off... were the same people with access to the city server. Your detective confirmed a city administrator was an accomplice. We found the checks in the secret accounts. You saw those. They wrote about trashing and deleting and worries of being arrested. This despicable document is by an assistant superintendent and the board president to expose you and your officers who are standing in this room to illegal and deadly toxins. This email from staff is of the routine and extensive dumping of toxins under classrooms for years. Their staff kept a list of who died of cancer, who was about to die, and who they wanted to die. There's another email from the superintendent discussing a solution by bringing multiple guns and multiple shooters to PV, Marsh, or Marigold and firing away. Another by a superintendent in current, board president to trash toxin-related material being requested. This isn't the Gambino family. It's a school district. Your city administrator contacted me to say that all hell had broken loose within the city offices when they learned that the complicity of a city administrator getting huge under-the-table payments while also being paid by the city without anyone's knowledge. We requested public record emails knowing the potential of criminal charges. Those emails were erased. We went after the district server. The backup server had its emails erased. This council can order a forensic expert to retrieve those emails. Every criminal attorney will want to know the cases this rogue employee worked on, and any environmental expert would demand to know the half-life of every toxin that was dumped. Thank you. Thank you. Addison Winslow, followed by Jessica Giannola. Hi. I'm here to talk about something going on in an apartment complex in North Chico. It's called Panama Springs Apartments. And it's mostly studio apartments and then a little bit of what you might call workforce housing. And this summer it was purchased by a corporation from Roseville called Beck Asset Management, LLC. They first issued a letter to everybody saying, hey, we're your new management and we're going to be great to you. And they said that they're looking forward to making it a wonderful, wonderful place to live. And then they issued eviction notices to everybody in the complex. And they say it's going to be following major renovations, they're going to sell the place. And it will be removed from the rental market. Most of these tenants here are clients of behavioral health or through the Veterans Administration. Almost all of them receive Section 8 subsidies. So the housing authority was able to help them to clarify to the landlord that all those eviction notices for the Section 8 tenants were illegal. So they've refiled 90-day eviction notices. Still some of the legal responsibilities are unclear. And fortunately there are some agencies working with these people to allow them to have their rights enforced. But I think that what people need to understand when looking at this is almost all these people are looking at facing homeless. One of these guys I moved in when I worked for CHAT two years ago, he had brain surgery. He was on the street for about four years. And he's been housed now for two years. He's done nothing wrong and he's looking at becoming homeless again. And they have all the services. They have all the services that are available in our community to them. And they are still looking at being homeless. This winter in November when their eviction notices expire, there really is not a plan not only to house the people that we have on the streets right now, those who are perfectly willing to receive all the services available to them, there just does not exist the housing and the city has no apparatus to protect people from becoming homeless. So I am proposing for you all to consider measures you can take to prevent this. And there certainly are measures to at least prevent something like this from happening in the future. And one is a number of cities in California have it. It's called right of first refusal. It's an ordinance that would allow before multifamily properties are sold to somebody like an out of town corporate asset manager, they would have to offer them to local organizations like CHAT or CHIP that are dedicated to solving our housing crisis. And I think that would benefit our community, prevent things like this from happening on a much larger scale. And there certainly is that potential there. Thank you. Thank you. Jessica Giannola followed by Nicole. Nicole Nava. Thank you, Council. I'd like to just support Addison's comments here that are reflecting the needs of our community. I think that as a city we should be looking for these opportunities where we're preventing homelessness from occurring, as we can see how difficult it is to get someone placed once they are unhoused on the street. So another issue that I'm concerned about, and it's related to our unhoused crisis, is we have people that are trying to get into the Pella shelter. And the process is very difficult. It's extremely difficult for people to get in there. And I know we have a site, we have a count on our page that says how many available beds we are. And it's a little disingenuous to say we have this many beds, but we have people who aren't using it. When it's not really an open door policy, people can't just go up and say I'd like to be here, interview me. There's a completely complicated process with that. And so when people are interviewed or they are moved from encampments, they are pushed around our city. They're pushed into neighborhoods and parks. And still, everything that's been existing the past few years or longer, it still continues on. And I don't see any changes because our methods aren't changing. We have people who are landing in parks. We have 50 or more people who have no toilets, no hand washing, no garbage receptacle. And that's hard. On them, it's hard on neighbors who are dealing with the trash that might be floating around. But think of the public health aspect of that number of people around that don't have a toilet to use. Where are they going? It's going to be going on the ground. It's going to be going into the waters. Rains are here now, so that's washing into their communicable disease. We have hepatitis A. People will have coronavirus. They'll have the flu very soon. So here's opportunities. Where if we were doing a better job at identifying safe locations with toilets, with hand washing, with garbage receptacle, we could reduce those impacts to the community. So if someone in an account has those communicable diseases, you can imagine it's going to go in the rest of the community, right? They're not a separate world. There are still people. And with the city, we have volunteers who have been trying to pay for these services. But they're running out of money because often these volunteers don't have very much money to begin with. They've asked the city to provide these services. If there's a lot of people and we have nowhere for them to go yet, then the city should be responsible for providing that porta potty, that garbage service. So that helps the entire community until we have somewhere else. And then we do need to have those doors open with the pallet shelter because they would be filled at this moment if they were. Thank you. Thank you. Nicole Navez, our last speaker. Good evening, council, city manager, department heads. I'm Nicole Navez. So I know all of you are very plugged into what's happening in the community. And one of the things that you know has been near and dear to me is getting people mental health help and addiction treatment. And I know this is city council and that some of that, of course, would be purview of the county and the state. And I know we have care court that was signed off by the governor but not specifically funded. And so we may need to look at some of that. And I'm also trying to do some collaboration and explore some things with the county as to can we get some kind of specialized focus on the situation going on with the overdoses. It has spiraled out of control which was pretty predictable in my opinion. We've been highlighting some of the risky behaviors and other things going on. And I am going to harken back to the needle giveaway that is still underway but is in a brick and mortar building. And the needle giveaway is the needle giveaway that is still underway but is in a brick and mortar building. I've been doing research again. I do this every once in a while to check on the statistics related to acute hepatitis C, HIV, and check on the harm reduction model that the local provider likes to refer to that they used as the model and impetus to implement this program. What I don't think a lot of people maybe are grasping is that it's well and good when you're doing a harm reduction model, but you also have to assess the risk to other individuals, and you have to assess maybe a down-the-line risk to those very individuals to whom you're trying to prevent harm, right, and for whom. And so what we have here is we've had this spike and things going on. You have people who maybe never would have tried shooting up that they're getting needles. And they're not just getting a one-fifth. They're getting as many as they like. They're out in public spaces, and they're dying. That is where a plethora of these are happening. When I went to check statistics with the California Department of Public Health in their syringe exchange program, it was a little disturbing to me that with our county data, there was only, like, one data set available. It was very odd to me because the numbers for the hep C were missing. Right. And that's the same for the acute data. And that is the same at the California Department of Public Health. So I put in a public health request, and I just want you to know that it was very clear that the overdoses are outweighing any harm reduction being done to this very small population of people. And I'm talking, like, this many maybe that were prevented from getting the diseases. So I would just say we may need to pivot and meet with the experts and get a team together. And try to start triaging things a little more aggressively, or we'll lose more of our community members. Thanks for your time. Thank you. All right. Thank you, everybody. We'll move on to item four, public hearings. Item 4.1, public hearing of the 2021-22 Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report, CAPER for the Federal Community Block Grant and the Home Investment Partnership Programs. And I believe we have housing program analyst Mary Jo Lanzer. Welcome. Thank you. Hi. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members. I'm Mary Jo Lanzer with the Housing Department. As a condition of receiving our federal funding through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which we refer to as HUD, the city is required to prepare and submit a Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report. Which I will call the CAPER at the conclusion of each program year. And the purpose of the CAPER... There we go. The purpose of the CAPER is to report on the progress in carrying out the city's five-year strategic plan for both the CDBG and home programs, as well as reporting on specific achievements of our annual action plan and the city's actions to further fair housing. The full CAPER report was included with the agenda and is attachment A of the staff report. My presentation will be a highlight of the uses of the funding starting with the HOME program. HOME , , , , , , , , , , , , , , unit affordable housing project on Park Avenue at the former Jesus Center site, and also supporting the development of phase two of North Creek crossings at Merriam Park, which is a 54 unit multi-family affordable housing project that is currently under construction. The City maintains a continued partnership with the Housing Authority and participating social service providers that allows us to assist 21 households last year through the tenant based rental assistance program. The program provides up to 24 months of rental assistance to qualified households who meet program requirements and work towards self-sufficiency. CDBG funding was used for small businesses through training and counseling services that are offered through the Small Business Development Center. The program exceeded their goal and successfully counseled 206 low and moderate income businesses and 53 of those were newly served workers. The City's funding also supported connecting five low income households that are inside the City's nitrate compliance area to City sewer. We continue to see increased cases of code enforcement and that work coupled with other City improvements and services is expected to arrest the decline in the area. Public service funding was provided to Chico Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto Instituto and of those, we funded seven different agencies to provide public services related to preventing, preparing, and responding to COVID. The funding has gone to support seniors and disabled with in-home assistance and meal delivery. We've also supported transitional housing for homeless to quarantine. The funding has supported housing through CHAT's Master Lease Program, provided homeless outreach, and also operational funding for the city's pallet shelter. Of the seven agencies that have been funded, we've assisted 871 individuals to date. That funding is ongoing, so you'll see different reporting later years. And as part of the CAPER, we have to report on fair housing. The city does work with a partner to provide a fair housing workshop. There were actually two workshops that were provided last year, but I only had data for one of those. And so 26 individuals attended those. There's also referrals that we get to our office that we assist individuals, and those can go to the state or federal for investigation. And then all of the information is on our website and printed on brochures for the public to be available. And in closing, the full CAPER report was included in your agenda. It was available on the city's website. A public comment. A public notice was published in the Enterprise Record on September 4th, which encouraged public comment for tonight's meeting. At this time, we haven't received public comment, but if there are public comments received tonight, those will be incorporated in the report before it's submitted to HUD. And upon the close of the public hearing, it's requested that council approve the submission of the report to HUD. This is the end of my report. I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have. All right. Questions? Thank you. No, thank you. All right. We'll open the public hearing. How many speakers? We don't have any. No speakers. Close the public hearing. Entertain a motion. Yes. Madam Clerk? Clerk? It's a public hearing, so I would recommend going ahead and taking the points so the comments can be incorporated into the report. Into the report. Okay. Come on up. So it's just related to the whole HUD thing. What I'm wondering if I could... Hold on a second. Just a second. Start a clock for me. Oh, sure. Start away. Okay. I will beat that clock. Okay. Okay. So I am wondering if with the HUD construct, my understanding when we talk about affordable housing is that if you have something like CHAT or some other structure like that that has a communal kitchen, that that disqualifies them for HUD funding? And I was hoping that was not true because to me then when you have private donor dollars going to something like that where maybe we could spread more love around if they were able to somehow... Yeah. ...amend that rule so that they would be entitled to do that as well as other entities that have communal kitchens. It seems to me that would open up a lot of opportunity, but that's just a thing. And I did not dig down deep to know if that was fact. That was what was floated to me by one of the providers quite some time ago. Maybe it changed. So I'm just throwing it out there that if that is indeed the case, it would be fantastic if we could figure out a way to advocate as a city, county, whatever, to get in there. to get in there with HUD and flip that rule around because I would love to see more people get some help and housing. Thank you. That's it. All right. Now we'll close the public hearing. Entertain a motion. Seeing none on the mate. Okay. Motion from Council Member Morgan and a second from Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk, you can take the roll. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. Thank you very much. Moving on to the regular agenda, item 5.1, consideration and approval of the budget policy amendment regarding POST training reimbursements. And I believe we have a report from Barbara Martin, our administrative services director. Welcome. Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of council. Thank you for your time this evening. Before you tonight is a request to add budget policy D1E1 to the City of Chico budget policies. In discussion with Police Chief Madden, we were talking about the concern over increased costs and quantity of mandated trainings, most notably from the Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission, commonly known as POST. POST is a state-run agency that outlines required and recommended trainings for peace officers in the state of California. And in turn, these training costs are reimbursed to the government agencies who employ these peace officers. Each year, City of Chico estimates an amount of revenue and associated costs with these trainings, and these amounts are included in the city's general fund budget. Often these trainings are costing more and becoming more numerous over time. With that, the city can receive higher than anticipated revenue from the state as payments for these trainings. In discussing this with Chief Madden and City Manager Sorensen, we believe the most efficient way to manage these costs and the revenue associated with it, should they occur for the police department, is to give the city manager authority to approve budget modifications that increase this revenue and the associated training budget equally by any amounts over what is currently budgeted for the revenue amount. Any modifications that are approved in this manner will then be reported in a new section in the monthly budget monitoring. The budget is the amount of training reports you receive. This is something that we're doing that we talked about during the budget cycle as well. This is the amendment that's before you tonight for consideration, and I'm happy to answer any questions. All right, questions? Yeah, a couple of questions, though. The report confused me a little, admittedly. So essentially what we're talking about here is, rather than the POST reimbursements going into the general fund, they would be going back to the police department, is that correct? Well, yes. I'm missing something. Currently, for example, this year we have $20,000 in revenue budgeted for POST reimbursement from the state. That is equal to an amount that's in the police training budget, among other things, for those costs. What we're proposing is that if we receive $30,000 in revenue from POST, which would be still in the general fund, we would just like to be able to increase their training budget by that amount, because the extra costs are expended in their budget line. By $30,000 or by $10,000? By $10,000. Okay. Yeah, anything above what we've already budgeted. Okay, that's helpful. Okay, so rather than this money going into the general fund, it would be the difference would be plugged back into the police training budget? Correct. But what it's doing is offsetting extra costs that we didn't anticipate in the training budget. Got it. That makes complete sense. Yeah. All right, thank you. Yeah. All right, further questions? All right, seeing none, do we have any speakers? No. No speakers? Entertain a motion? Actually, just really quickly, the only authority we'd be giving at this moment is to offset the additional costs in the training budget, not to plug in additional funds. No. Got it. Thank you. I'll make a motion to approve. Second. We'll have a motion from Councilmember O'Brien. We have a second from Councilmember Morgan. Madam Clerk, take the roll. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Bryant? Aye. Aye. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right, item 5.2, fire apparatus sole source purchasing authority. And I believe this is from Public Works Director Eric Guffsen. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Council, pleasure to speak to you tonight. Debbie, I do have a presentation. Just bear with me. I'll queue this up real quickly. All right. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. Get it on the floor so we can hear it. those yet and we just got an updated build schedule of first quarter, hopefully first quarter of 2023. So these supply chain issues that we're faced with are impacting all departments that fleet services services in all departments in the city, not just the fire department, but we're at a pretty critical state with some fire apparatus purchases that we need an additional tool in our toolbox such as SolSor. So fleet services has partnered with high-tech emergency vehicle services since the early 1990s. High-tech is an Oakdale company located in Oakdale, California and supplies custom-built fire apparatus for the west coast. We've administered countless notice of inviting bids, NIBs, where high-tech was the lowest responsible bidder. The latest one was in 2019 when we replaced a 25-year-old type 1 fire apparatus. Fire apparatus are distinguished by type, type 1 being the typical engine that you see, pumps 1,500 gallons of water per minute, typically has a 7 to 750 gallon tank, and from there, they go to like a type 3 as a wildline engine and a type 4 and 5 as kind of a brush rig, smaller engine that you'll see. So they're classified in types and type 1 is your typical standard fire engine that you see as a first responder out of one of our fire stations. During that 19, or excuse me, 2019 proposal scenario, we received three proposals. The first one was from Golden State Fire Apparatus, which is a Pierce dealer for 740,000. Fire Apparatus Service, which is a dealer out of Southern California for 662,000. And then High Tech Emergency Vehicle Services out of Oakdale was the lowest proposal at 661,000. So they're traditionally the lowest responsible bidder in most of our bid scenarios. High Tech continues to be the most cost-effective vendor, and their parts and service support is impeccable, which is critical to preserving optimum run time. There's been a handful of examples where warranty repairs were needed, and they've got a same-day service scenario where they employ a handful of retired firefighters, and if we have a big repair where it needs to go to their dealership, they will put them on a Greyhound bus early in the morning and pick up the fire apparatus and drive it back same day. So impeccable service that is hard to achieve with other dealers. It's critical that the fire department has reliable standardized apparatus that could be easily maneuvered between shifts and fire stations. As you respond, you know, multiple calls, you're running multiple calls through a shift, you know, 3 or 4 in the morning, you really rely on that muscle memory where that valve and the pump panel needs to be in that same place, no matter which apparatus you're on. So standardization is really critical to the fire department's operational needs. As stated earlier, procurement has been extremely challenging due to supply chain and material shortages. We're looking at traditionally we had year build times and fire apparatus purchases, now we're faced with two and sometimes three year build times. So it's completely changed the landscape. A lot of those lead times have led to extreme delays that make it difficult for vendors to hold pricing through the entire procurement process. Our procurement process takes a long time. It's a spec writing process. We form a spec writing committee with the fire department and fleet services and confirm the appropriate specs to meet the operational needs. Typically it goes through a bid period, an order period and then the manufacturing period which is in most cases a year. Now we're looking at 2 and 3 years. So pretty long process and hard for vendors to hold pricing through that process. And these delays have really impacted the fleet services division's ability to timely deliver apparatus to meet the operational needs of the fleet. needs of the fire department. So with that, we're looking at a few ways to streamline that procurement process and sole sourcing high tech is one of them. So we're requesting sole source authority to streamline the procurement process, confirm the best possible pricing, and really ensure standardization for the fire department. This is allowed through our Chico Minimum Code 3.08060. That basically states that bidding procedures must be dispensed by the purchasing officer through traditional means such as quotes and bids or B, such procedures may be dispensed by the purchasing officer when the purchasing officer determines that one of four, an emergency exists which requires that an order be placed with the nearest available source of supply. Two, the amount involved is less than 10,000. Three, supply service or equipment can be obtained from only one vendor or supplier. And four, the supplies or equipment including but not limited to communication system, traffic signals, parking meters have been uniformly adopted or otherwise standardized. So that's key for fire apparatus. And in this case, we feel that sections B1, 3, and 4 apply. So with that, I'm seeking council approval to sole source procurement fire apparatus including parts and service support from High Tech Emergency Vehicle Services, Inc. for a period of 10 years. And I want to also say that this doesn't box us into only procuring from high tech. This just gives us another tool to use. We'll still do our due diligence and make sure we're getting the best possible price on the market. We can still do a bid scenario if we need to. A lot of times we take advantage of cooperative purchasing. We're a conglomerate of agencies, forms a JPA, puts a bid out, you know, creates a lot of buying power because it's multiple agencies. We see this in Southern California a lot, say for police cars. They create some buying power. We're able to piggyback those bids as long as it's been competitively bid at some point within the process. So we'll still have all of those opportunities. Just this gives us another tool in our tool bag. So we're going to do a lot of bidding. We're going to have a toolbox to use to really help us deliver fire apparatus that's needed for the fire department. Concludes the presentation. I can answer any questions. All right. Questions from Mr. Goffson. Quick question. Just to kind of paraphrase so that I'm making sure I'm understanding because I had a few questions, but I think you answered them. Essentially, what we would be approving here is to bypass the going out to bid process by giving you authority to work with this company to save us time in that process. Is there any downside to it? I don't see any downside at this point because we're not locked into only using them. It just gives us a tool to do so if we choose, if that's the best possible path forward to try to get. We're in a situation where we go through a bid process. Historically, they've been the lowest responsible bidder. We're going through that process and another agency, a Roseville for that matter, orders three or four engines. Well, now we're three to four years out before we will get ours. So we want to be able to do that. So we're going to have to do that. We're going to have to be able to streamline that process and get a build date as quickly as possible. Council Member Bennett. So I can't pass this up. You're asking for a 10-year provision for this special situation. You're going to remain here for 10 years to watch over this? Absolutely. Okay. I hope so if you'll continue to have me. All right. Any other questions? Do we have any speakers on the side? No. No. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. Motion. Motion. Okay. Do we just have a speaker? Yes, Jessica Giannola. All right. Come on now. We'll delay the motion and move forward with the speaker. Okay. Really, the last question kind of answered a little bit. I was concerned about the 10-year requirement. And it kind of to me looked like it was a 10-year contract where we'd be blocked into whatever that would prevent us as a city from exploring other options that might be more financially beneficial. So it sounds like that's just like a process is aligned to continue working with them. And we can still look for deals where they are. Okay. Okay. Technology will change a lot in the next 10 years. So that was all. Thank you. All right. So it was a motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds seconded by Council Member Tandon. Correct. To authorize it. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Go back. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Item 5.3. Come back on fire apparatus purchasing. Mr. Kepson. Thank you. One more quick presentation. Just a couple slides on this one. So this is actually a purchasing request. So we have three. We have three apparatus that are due for replacement this fiscal year and were approved through the budget process. Two type one fire engines that are 25 years old and then one ladder truck that's due for replacement. So on the slide here, 2019 fleet services went through a procurement process as mentioned previously to replace a 25 year old type one engine. We purchased a 2022 high tech type one for $661,116. And that's the apparatus pictured on the right there. That shows the purchase process. Procurement process has started in the beginning of 2019 and we just took delivery of it spring of this year, 2022. So as mentioned, there's two type ones that are also 25 years old that are due for replacement this year. And then one ladder truck that's 20 years old that is due for replacement. We have a 20 year life cycle typically for fire apparatus. Once fire apparatus reached that 20 year life cycle, operational maintenance costs increased dramatically. Parts availability becomes extremely scarce. That's what we're facing on the ladder truck. And then technology surpasses the current vehicles. We kind of have a graph that we manage where you have a high procurement cost for a fire engine. Maintenance costs are low and you amortize that procurement cost over the 20 years as maintenance costs rise. Then you try to connect the sweet spot where they intersect and that's when you want to replace them. And typically for fire apparatus, the City of Chico is 20 years. But we've been able to push a handful of these out because of a low cost of ownership. And that's why you see some that are 25 years old. So these were identified through the fiscal year 2022-2023 budget that was approved end of June. And considering the high inflation costs that we were experiencing at the time, again, just in 2019, we locked in pricing through a bid proposal scenario at $661,000. I knew they would come in a lot more. So we budgeted $824,000 each for the Type 1 apparatus. Several years ago, we purchased a tiller ladder truck. And this older truck that is a reserve truck that we are going to replace now will be replaced with a tiller, not the traditional ladder truck. It will be replaced with a tiller that meets the fire department's operational needs. And Fleet Services agrees with that. Lower maintenance costs, better maneuverability through the city. And ladder trucks alone are basically very similar in cost to a tiller truck. So last time we purchased a truck 1, which is our current tiller truck, our current tiller truck is 1.2. So we budgeted just under 1.4 for this one. Unfortunately, costs are coming in even much higher than anticipated. For the Type 1s, they are coming in at $955,000. So we have a little over $131,000 shortage for each Type 1s. And those are high-tech apparatus. High-tech does not make a tiller truck. So we're looking at a pierce to match the existing tiller truck. So we'll have two within the city. We used to have three, but we consolidated the fleet down to two ladder trucks, which is pretty common to serve a city of our size, a little over 100,000. So the pierce product is coming in at $1.9 million, unfortunately. So we have a budget shortfall in total of $831,449. So what we're asking for is city council approval to use occasionally, you know, we do everything we can to manage our budget. We manage our budgets accordingly. And thankfully, in the last few years, we've had a general fund balance at the end of the year, savings, if you will, or some leftover dollars once we close the books. And in discussions with our finance director, Barbara Martin, our administrative services director, Barbara Martin, excuse me, we expect a small savings this year, general fund savings. So I'm requesting permission or approval from council to use the general fund savings to fund the budget shortfall of $831,449 for the fiscal year 2022-2023 apparatus purchase requirements. We do look at other options. Do we delay purchase, which will be problematic because we're no longer really able to support the ladder truck. It's extremely hard, if not all impossible, to find parts for that. It's 20 years old. And same thing with the type 1s, they're 25 years old. So they're becoming increasingly difficult to support. So I wouldn't recommend pushing them out any further. We looked at some lease options, but considering where interest rates are going, we're going to spend a lot more over time if we finance our lease apparatus. So our recommendation at this point is to purchase them outright and use the budget savings from fiscal year 2021-2022 to fund this year's purchase. That concludes the presentation. I can answer any questions. All right, questions? I have a couple. No one else did. What's the estimated? We're still closing the books for the year, so we don't have final numbers, but we are anticipating that it will be well over what the requirement is here. I can't give you a total number yet, but I would say that we would have at least $1 million in savings that we would be able to apply. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. So it's looking good so far. All right. It's pretty slick. And then ladder trucks. So you mentioned that we had three in the back. So how many? So we only have two at this point, correct? We only have two ladder trucks. Okay. So the other one was retired, the third. Yes. Okay. And it's replacing the second one. We'll still only have two. Right. No, but when we had the third, when did that drop off? It dropped off. Yeah. We did a kind of a fleet optimization exercise and it was just low use, costly to maintain. I just can't remember when it happened. Do you remember what year it was? I don't know. Three, four years ago, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Any other questions? Any speakers? I have a question for the city manager. Just because we're talking about general fund money. I understand operations and maintenance would like us to approve this. You're all right using that money there as opposed to somewhere else? Yes. You know, unfortunately, these apparatus, when they get to be that age, you run the risk of having them literally fall apart on you. And particularly when we're looking at two, three years easily to even get the replacements. It's not worth the risk. Okay. Thank you. All right. Any speakers? Yes. We have one. Jessica Giannola. All right. Three minutes. All right. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. If we have a fire, which at some point, you know, we will, it just happens. And I suggest that we work towards that third. We may not have used it much in the past, but I'm thinking looking forward, it's a good idea to have that third one too. So when that time comes up. So definitely this is an appropriate use of our funds and protecting our city and the people living in it from these fire dangers. Thank you. All right. Entertain motion. Move to approve. Approve. Clear. Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Council Member Morgan. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Okay. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Moving on to item 5.4, ratification memorandum of understanding Chico Police Management Employees. And for this, we have... Interim Director of Human Resources and Risk Management, Amanda Patton. No. Oh, yeah. Pardon my heart. Pinch-inning tonight. Pinch-inning. Ms. Patton is not feeling well tonight, so I'm here to propose this for you in her place. Back on the last council meeting... First, thank you, Mayor and Vice Mayor, members of council. Back at the last city council meeting, we provided the memorandum of understanding for the Chico Police Management Group. This includes... This encompasses our police lieutenants and captains. Tonight, we are asking for ratification of the MOU. The MOU runs through June 30th of 2025. It estimates a cost of $438,000 over that full three-year period. And I'm here to answer any questions. All right. Any questions? I have a couple questions. Council Member. Yeah, just a few for the good of the public. As I'm reading through this, I'm noting a 5% slightly retroactive increase across the board. Another 5% increase in 2023. So that constitutes a 10% salary increase between now and 2023, correct? Yes. And then there's also a 5% increase for those in this unit who receive post-advanced certifications. How many employees does a post-advanced certification pay increase apply to for the unit? I... Would have to defer to our police unit, but I'm assuming that most of them have that because this is in an effort to continue that post pay that they received as CPOA members. They no longer receive it as management employees, so it's carrying that forward. Did you want to answer that? Chief? I believe the number's eight, but we do have a new lieutenant coming on or has just come on. So I'm not sure that he... He actually has that, so it may be seven. Okay. Thank you. So what we're looking at over the period of three years is 15% increase with a 6% CalPERS pickup, resulting in a 9% salary increase net for the unit. For the members that qualify for the post-it. For the members that qualify. And that's not the entire... Because of the... Yeah. Got it. Post pay. Does this agreement look similar to any other agreement that we've approved so far? It's similar to CPOA. CPOA had a similar increase, except they did it across the board, 5% initially. And then they did a 5-3, 5-3 swap is what we call it. And then the only other agreement that's come through recently is our SEIU members, and they received a 4.5 and a 4.5 over time. And SEIU represents the lowest paid staff in the city. Is that right? There are operations and maintenance crews. And yes, some of their members are of the lower paid scale because they're entry-level positions. Thank you. Appreciate that. That's all my questions. Okay. All right. I've got one. Yes. So are our police management employees, our CPOA group, way overpaid in terms of the city, or are they pretty much on average in the state? I believe they're on average. I don't have that data personally. It's an HR question more. But I believe, I think the intent, at least from the CPOA side, is we're having a recruitment and retention problem that we have to address, and that's also... We've had a problem throughout the state, so that's where we've been addressing those issues. All right. Thank you. Mm-hmm. All right. And the speakers? One. James Hutchinson. All right. Pretty much decided that I won't hit the technical arguments that I had intended to address earlier today. But what I would like to ask of this council, is that you've had a number of items that are showing up here, MOUs. You've had the Narcotics Task Force late for the due date that that was supposed to be done. You've had the housing element late. We have this MOU coming out retroactive. And we're not hearing any explanation why these things are late. I'm not blaming you for doing anything wrong. I'm not saying you did anything criminal. But what I'm concerned about is that you're not explaining it to the public. I talked to a woman who... When you were talking about the annexing, to watch this on TV, what I said about her particular Amante area. And in it, she was very happy to that. But she said it's very hard when things are not explained, when they assume that everyone out there knows what you're talking about, or why it happened. I know in the case of the Narcotics Task Force thing, my video was wiped out. Nobody could go back and look and see what I said about it. It's gone. Okay? So, but that's a small thing. These people are at home watching you. And they would like an explanation. I would just please in the future, if there's a reason for something being late, lay it out. I worked for a fair housing agency once that was doing a rental survey for a city. During the middle of Proposition 4, 2013, we were interviewing owners and managers. You can imagine what was happening. It was a federally funded program to do this. I know what it's like to deal with very hostile situations that seem impossible. We did it, but it wasn't easy. And it's not easy for you. But I would like to see you make an effort to try to let us know what's going on. I'm asking. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. That's it. Entertain motion. I will move to approve. Does this need to be read verbatim? No. No. Just. No. Thank you. Second. We have a motion from Council Member O'Brien. A second from Council Member Bennett. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? Nay. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Vice Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Moving on to Item 5.5. Council Member Brown requests presentation by Butte County Local Food Network. I can't believe it's 7 and we're almost done. Thank you, Council, for approving to agendize this item. I included a written report, but I'll just give you a quick overview and try to make it quick for you. The Butte County Local Food Network recently presented the results of their baseline. Butte County baseline food assessment to the Board of Supervisors. They're doing a lot of really cool things in the community and have received a lot of support for those efforts to promote local food source. I wanted to request a 15-minute presentation, hopefully at our next meeting, if not the second meeting in October, similar to what they provided for the Board of Supervisors. That's with the effort of keeping the public informed about what they're doing, keeping us informed. and you can read the assessment, which is linked in my request, but I can assure you their presentation is gonna be more entertaining and highlight the important findings. So, hopeful that you'll support it. Thank you. All right, do we have any speakers on this item? No. Any speakers, entertain a motion? I'll support this. Second. Thank you. All right, Madam Clerk, particular. You're welcome. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries seven zero. All right, thank you. Item 5.6, items after the post of the agenda, six reports and communications. The following reports and communications are provided for the council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. 6.1, city manager's report. Mr. Sorensen. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. No report. All right. Item 6.2, council member requests. Don't anyone run away? I've got one if no one else does. Pursuant to APMP 1010, council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting. After stating what the item would be, a majority vote of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council members may submit requests in writing. I have a question. I do have a request, but if you want to go first, you're welcome to do it. Mr. Okay, fire away. No, go ahead. Yeah, this is based on the letter that we received from the group titled Pamela Springs United this week, a group of tenants that were recently evicted by an asset management company who purchased the property that they're living on. You had a little bit of overview from a speaker from the floor. They wrote a letter. They requested some support. I know that staff is doing a little bit of work on this. I would like to simply bring it into chambers and get an update from staff on what they are doing, reference a couple of things in the letter. Basically, I'm requesting you agendize a discussion about the letter and the issue it addresses, what staff are currently doing to address it, what's possible in terms of city intervention, and what policy solution like right of first refusal could look like for future instances, specifically where affordable housing is threatened as it is here. So it's time sensitive. These evictions are currently underway. So within the next couple of months, they're gonna be activated. So I was hoping that we could have that discussion at our next meeting. Ideally. Thanks. All right. Oh, and that's a motion to agendize. All right, we have a motion. Do we have a second? Okay, motion dies for lack of a second. Any other requests? All right, actually, I have a request, and it's based upon a meeting. I think it's a meeting we had in regards to the airport and procuring flights, or at least bolstering our journey to acquire flights. One of the issues, and Mr. Gofferson, you can jump in at any point on this as well, is that the renaming of our airport and billing it as more of a regional operation is certainly necessary to procuring the funds, so it's more of a matter of getting it officially Instituted Government Government Government Government Government Government Government Government Government Government Government Government Government Government to do that. So just like further discussion by the council at the next meeting, and I can detail it out a little bit more for us. But did I miss anything, Eric? Mayor Coolidge, I think you covered it perfectly. Okay, nice work. The best I can do from memory. So, and that's motion, second by Council Member Tannen. Madam Clerk, do you take the roll? Council Member Bennett? Yes. Yes. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tanden? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Sure. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-2. All right, thank you very much. Right, item seven, move on to adjournment. We will adjourn at this time. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you.
