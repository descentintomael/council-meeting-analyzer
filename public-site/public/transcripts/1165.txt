Thank you, Mayor, Vice-Mayor, members of Council Thank you for your history thank you for your time this afternoon. As I turn things over to our presentation actually just that was a really nice summary of all the things that's happening in the city of chico under your policy direction and then city manager sorenson's direction all the things that we've accomplished and we are hopeful that this proposed budget continues on that trend and continues doing the things that you want from us and guide us to be doing. City of chico proposed annual budget for 24-25. The first thing I want to say is that throughout this very many slide presentation and presentations from all the department directors if there's any questions along the way please ask, please let us know. We want to make sure that everybody's getting the information they need and any questions are being answered along the way. As we get started I want to talk about the city of chico foundation. A few years ago city council adopted some city vision and goals that are the priorities of the city. We try to through this budget and through our daily processes at the city to always keep this in mind and always keep these at the forefront. With that not a big on reading slides but I do want to kind of reiterate all of these things as we get started. First and foremost balanced budget. City of chico in the best possible way. We have a balanced budget and adequate reserves due to sound fiscal policies and stewardship. This continues this is something that is of the forefront and something we have over the past 12 years. We strive for this and we continue to do that here. Infrastructure. The city's infrastructure is strategically designed to meet the needs of the community. The city has housing strategy that is Public safety continues to be an important goal fully staffed and funded with complete integration creating crime reduction and a feeling of safety. Housing. The city has successfully implemented a comprehensive housing strategy to meet the diverse needs of our community. Again another important piece of the puzzle to make our city a successful city. The city offers an efficient model for development is focused on business success and is seen as a destination for business growth and innovation. An important concept to keep this city alive and vibrant and continuing in the positive direction. And then finally desirable place to live. The city is committed to making chico a desirable place to live work and recreate due to the city's commitments to its parks and community. Again that is important for all citizens and all of us here in chico. You can see all these symbols that are on the left side of the of the statements that continues to be a theme throughout all of the presentations you can see how these different things that are come up are attributable to these different focused pieces. Now on to the budget itself. We have some new pieces to the budget. As you know we have a new digital budget book which we will give you some highlights of. We have a couple new funds and then some budget policy changes. We will go through this and give you an overview of what is new and how you can see things this year in the new budget. First the digital budget book. As city manager Sorenson pointed out we have a new clear gov system. I just want to reiterate his thanks and his acknowledgment of the staff at the administrative services most notably Amanda McGar who is our budget and treasury manager. She has really spearheaded this whole process and has made this a We have a lot of information on the budget and we hope it is a user friendly and easier way to navigate the many pages that is our budget book. She is going to come up and give you the low down of what is new in it and how you can navigate it and what you can look for and how to go about doing that. I will leave it to you. thank you barbara. Everyone' s favorite topic. Hopefully by now you have had the opportunity to play around in here a bit and take a look. It is definitely a different look and feel to what we are used to in the past. With this being our first year implementing the software I wanted to take a moment to point out a few of the nuances that we are actively working through. I will go ahead and get started. In the budget overview tab these are the different as you would see in your binders the different sections tabbed out in here. This is where we are starting with the five year fund projections. When you look at it looks like it is cut off on the side here. If you go to the bottom and scroll down you can see a lot of the tables like this. There are some formatting issues that we are working to have cleaned up for the final version. With time constraints this is where we are right now. Hopefully most of that will look We have a section for operating budget specific to each department. There are a few differences compared to what you are used to seeing as far as expenditure data down here. The city clerk and council are combined in all of these numbers. Usually they are separated so we are working to get those separated with some data mapping behind the scenes before we finalize the final budget. The debt service is included in here. When you take a quick look it looks like expenditures are significantly higher than they are. That' s not truly the case. It' s because the debt service numbers are showing here and they haven' t in the past. Similarly with engineering with their department it' s looking like their operating expenditures are lower which is not the case. The budget is not really comparing apples to apples. s skewing things a little bit not necessarily comparing apples to apples. All of these adjustments are background mapping things we' re working on for the final budget. I wanted to point those out because at a quick glance it could look like it' s less here if you' re looking at the summary when that' s not truly the case. Moving on to capital there are some nuances with this that I wanted to point out. Capital summary by fund is the best section to look at every capital project that is included in the proposed budget. It' s separated out by fund but it lists everything that' s included. If you click on the one year plan there' s a mixture of projects that are not actually included in the budget that will have cleaned up before the final. It' s a little misleading in that way but it' s cool in a sense that you can go down to a link if you want to look at the project. If you click on the hyperlink it' ll give you information such as the project manager, a full description of the project, what department it' s in, fund graphs on the different funding sources and then you can click on these breakdowns to get all the information that you need. When there' s multi-funded projects you can go down a little bit further and it will give you all that data for that specific project. I wanted to point that out. Will that show you the request made by the department versus what was granted in the draft budget? The best thing to show that, here there' s the unfunded capital. These are all the requests that were made by departments that didn' t make it to this stage. This list here is going to give you So some of them I see that there' e requests made and then the amount granted is just less than that? Yes. Some of them are partially funded so they request $3 million but we give them $1 million. So that will be partially funded. There' s notes on them specifically looking here, the radio technology replacement. That was one that was partially funded just because of the resources we have available. Likewise, if you want to just look or focus on what is new in the budget you can look at the new capital projects list and this shows all new projects created for the 24-25 budget. There' s a little bit of clean up to do in this area for the final version but overall that' s what it looks like here. Some verbiage changes. It' s still referring to a 10-year plan here and we' ll fix that. So can you go back to the spot where you were first? The capital summary by fund? Yes. I' m trying to follow that. Yours looks different than mine. If you scroll down. Is there? All the way to the bottom. Okay. m just trying to see where was it that you could actually click on each of the individual projects? That' s the one year plan. That' s what I thought. I' m just trying to find that again. Good deal. Those blue hyperlinks will take you to the description. Just lost it. Thank you. Appendices, not a lot of changes here. There' e some formatting cleanups we' re trying to work on for the final Nothing we can do about that on our end. But we are working with cleargov to get that fixed for the future. That' s where we are right now with that. Then lastly for the successor agency, not a lot of change there except for the fund listing. Unfortunately we can' t separate different funds to have them all listed with the successor agency. So if you' re looking specifically at the RDA funds you' ll have to go to the funding summary tab down to the bottom here. You' ll see the fund summaries there. It' s one of those nuances with the software that we had to do a little adjusting there. With that, overall the goal is to be transparent as possible and provide easy to read information to both you and the public. I think this software is one step closer to getting to that. We hope you' re overall happy with it. Then I will go ahead and go back to our presentation if there' s any questions. No questions? I just have a quick comment. I accidentally found out that it was interactive just by accident. Once I found out you could click on any number of items and it pulls up the details. That' s pretty darn cool. Thank you. The point is to give a high level overview if that' s what you' re looking for but also to be able to drill down on the detail if you need it. Thank you. Now we' Back to Barbara. Ultimately the goal is to make it so that every kind of reader has the ability to get through it and find out what they need, whether it' s graphs or whether it' s numbers detail. Different people see things in different ways. We' re hoping that presenting it in that way will be beneficial to all. Now, moving on to our new funds. We have new fund 11 you will find on page 57 is the fund size. This is the fund size summary. And then in the capital it' s page 288. You will see all the projects that are in there. This is our fire victims trust fund. This is the dollars that we received due to the impacts from the campfire. We have received just over $21 million in proceeds so far. The projects that have been deemed allocated in here are based on the needs assessment that Director Ottoboni presented to you previously in a city council meeting. We are not going to be able to do that. We are anticipating to receive a little bit more in dollars at the end of this year, but we have not put that into the projections as of yet just because you never know how that goes. So that information is in there and I' m sure Director Ottoboni will expand on that when he comes up later. Fund 394 is our other new fund. This is the permanent local housing allocation fund. This is funding from the state that is intended to be ongoing for under the current state. The budget is for the unmet housing needs for local communities. We have that in the budget on page 136. It is funding some operations in the housing related area and that will be discussed later as well. Now I' m going to go on with some budget policy changes. We go through this every year. I just want to make sure that you all are aware and that you approve of the changes that we are proposing. There' s a number of changes. The first one, section D1C and then section E4K, those are related to each other and based on our retirement reserve section 115 trust and our CalPERS pension reserve funds. I' m going to go through those last because I need to explain a little bit how that goes. And then I' m going to go through these other ones real quick so you can see the language and see what we' re proposing to change. The first one is just establishing a policy for the fire victims and the fire victims in the community. We are going to use the fire victims trust fund. City Council made a decision on March 19 that this was, that these funds were going to be used to offset the impacts on the city of Chico due to the campfire impacts. This is establishing that policy and also saying that we will not be using these for ongoing operational expenditures. That' s kind of in line with our general policy that any one-time monies, we' re not going to put it towards operational ongoing costs because then you have to find some place to fund it later. And if we do end up doing anything for an ongoing operations, we were going to have to explain how we' re going to fund that going forward. And then there' s a few HR cleanup, human resources cleanup items that I' ull go through. One is about advanced step appointments. There' s some language in the budget policies that if there is somebody who is hired at our general rule is that if it' s at any federal level, it' s a thing higher than the midpoint on the pay schedule, it needs city manager approval, special authorization. We need to make sure there' s budget available, we need to make sure it' s a justifiable reason, et cetera, et cetera. This generally was referred to based on the 14-step pay schedule. As you know, we have removed the 14-step pay schedule from some of the MOUs. So this is just adding the language that it' s either step C on the seven-step schedule or step F on the 14-step pay schedule. So we all know that. t know where we' re going on that item. And then we also are deleting the language that is talking about the double-step appointment. This was specifically because of the 14-step and because of the two-and-a-half-step increments and that sometimes we were in need of doing a double-step as a 5%. We' re removing that language, as again I said, because we are now going back to the seven steps and that there are 5% in between this language. So we have to make sure that we have a language that is not being protected. And then we have to remove that language, which is becoming obsolete. And then removing some language about being paid in quarter dollar hours, hourly employees will be assigned a title based on our current pay schedules and will be assigned a step within that pay range. So the quarter dollar increments does not apply. And then we have some ability to appoint hourly exempt and classified employee. appointments and sometimes those people come with some expertise that we may need to offer them some more benefits than what the general hourly employee would be provided and this is language to be able to have the city manager authorize these ancillary benefits and then there would be a separate employment agreement that would define what those would be. This is kind of the exception to the rule. This isn't something that we generally do. And then we have interns and training appointments section in there and that we have agreements with federal state local agencies to do certain kind of work. Sometimes those programs don't fund things like workers comp and that sort of thing so this is our ability to add the cost of that and for the city to assume that those costs should those arise and that's not paid for by the other agency. Do you want questions as we go along or save them until you're done? Please ask, yes. Okay, just really quick on the city manager appointee type position. Can you give an example of what that would be? And it's not anything that we're currently using right now if I'm not mistaken, right? Yeah, that one. The exempt. I will ask Chelsea to talk about that. A good example of that would be, for example, a contract for our animal services manager. It's a position that's considered exempt. It's not hourly exempt but it is exempt and it has historically come with its own set of negotiated benefits. So each contract with each animal services manager is exempt. The history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history on the human resources side, we're just cleaning up some language on hourly exempt pay rate increases that we have the ability to get authority from the city manager to increase the pay rates for these employees should their like titled unit get a pay increase on their pay scale, then that will be addressed with city manager approval. And it's kind of a, this is a may, not a shall, because sometimes hourly employees are just hired, and so maybe we want to keep them at a certain rate before we move them up. But it's just giving the ability to recognize that if the going rate for their position increases or decreases that we have the ability to change that. Okay, going back to the budget policy change for the reserves. We have established some ability to move surplus funds, and anytime the general fund has a surplus at the end of the year, we come back and we have a defined set of parameters that gets distributed first 50% to the pension stabilization trust fund, and then to the public infrastructure replacement fund, and then to equal shares to these replacement funds. This is the language that exists now. We were proposing to add this language at the end of it. Basically, and you'll see in a few minutes, we are gaining a bit of money in the reserve fund. So at the point that we are to us, to where we want to be in that desired reserve, we want to the ability to reallocate those funds so that instead of 50% going to the pension stabilization trust fund, once that is fully funded to where we want it to be, then we will take that out of the equation and put 50% to the infrastructure replacement fund, and then 50% in equal shares to the replacement funds as outlined in here. Okay, can we go back to that? Is that? Yeah, one prior. So it basically be taking out the 50% allocated to the section 115 trust fund. Yeah, I just want a little more time with that. Sorry. Yeah, that's fine. Um, and then the pension, the stabilization trust, what is that top out at? I'll show you just a second. Okay, so the next slide. I'm jumping ahead. It's a two-part budget policy shift for you. Okay, in the past we've had some funds actually come back to council for further, go back again. So, one time revenues and budgetaries had cost savings, have sometimes come back to council for additional decisions. Mm-hmm. So when do we technically push this forward? This is after we close the books and after we have our audit. No, but I mean the policy. This was a few years back. Okay. Yeah. I don't remember it necessarily being outlined in that particular way. Okay. Okay. So we are wanting to establish the desired reserve for these two funds. Okay. So we have fund 903 which is our, which is what we pay our unfunded liability payment out of every year. We receive dollars in from charges through payroll costs that gets into the fund and then out of the fund we paid our, we pay our unfunded liability payment every year. And then we, the second piece of it is our section 115 pension stabilization trust fund which is basically funded at this point either by discretionary funds, discretionary choice. Okay. Or by the city council, city manager or by this policy of 50% of our surplus will go to fund this fund. So what we are saying that once we get to the point where we have what is equal to one year's, the highest one year unfunded liability obligation according to the most recent CalPERS actuarial valuation report that that is our desired reserve. And that once we get to that point then we will be able to fund this fund. And then we will reallocate the surplus funds as described before. So each year we get, this is just not intended to see all the numbers here. We get a, we get an amortization schedule from two different plans. We have a miscellaneous plan and then a safety plan for the CalPERS. And we, and it outlines kind of like a mortgage payment each year, an amortization schedule of what we owe for our unfunded pension liability. Okay. This is representative. This is representative of our most recent actuarials as you can see in 2030. Between the two plans our highest year is in 2030 and the highest payment amount will be $18 million. So that is what we are proposing our desired reserve is at this point. This changes every year. The actuarials change every year but this is what our goal is for 24-25. Not saying that we are there but just that that is what we want to be. So as you can see. As of the end of 2023-24 this is the two funds combined. So that green number is the two funds fund balances put together. So as of the end of 2023-24 we are projecting to have just under $14 million between the two funds as fund balance. And then next year with what we are estimating from payroll charges and then what we pay out in unfunded liability payments we are estimating to be just over 15 months. Now the desired reserve is $18 million. So we are not there yet but we are anticipating that in some years time we will get to that point. But that we want to have a policy out there so that we aren' t just saving money into oblivion but that we have a plan for whenever we get to this point. I understand not saving money into oblivion but at the same time too what' s the harm in having extra dollars in the fund? I mean it' s a good question. I mean it' s a good question. I mean it' s a good question. There' s not a harm having extra dollars in the fund and we will always have hopefully more than what the desired reserve is. It' s just being able to reapply those monies to other reserves to other infrastructure because the public infrastructure fund would get those monies etc. etc. It' s just instead of saying and it' s always discretionary. So instead of saying we will do this transfer of 50% surplus. Sure. So now we' re going to say we will do this other equation and it' s up to the city council if you guys want to change that at any time you can. It' s just establishing a policy and a target. I get that we' re paying it over years but obviously paying it ahead of time too and having the money there ahead of time is a better position to be. I know a lot of cities aren' t in that position. Absolutely. And this money would still be there. We' re not going to take this money and use it for anything else. I understand that. It' s in there so we would have a place for it to be. And in the worst case scenario is 18 the high? I mean could we be at 20 or 23? It' s going to be higher. It just depends on what the investment returns are. We' ll probably see in this actuarial I would not be surprised if the target goes up because they haven' t met their interest rates. Yeah. I mean they have a little bit better boundaries in terms of what they' re investing in now. But. Yeah. Okay. Maybe we can note that for a discussion as we move forward. Sure. Okay. And that' s it for the budget policy changes and I' m going to take any other questions about that. Before we move on. Barbara. Yeah. I' m looking in the budget for this particular item. Is it in? Where is it? It' s in the appendices. Thank you. Yes. I think it' s a C appendix. Budget policy changes? It' s basically the budget policies with the edits in it. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. You know maybe if we can make notes if my fellow council members are willing. If we can make notes of areas that you' d like further discussion on. You know as we move forward as we move into the final draft. And then we make a notation now. Yeah. I think that' s probably the best way to do this. If there' s particular items that you want to discuss more. Discuss it like after the presentations are done? Well after the presentations or our next meeting or whatever it might be in terms of particular you know areas that you' d want to bring back for discussion. I think that might be worthwhile. It' s always hard to manage this from the business side of it because it' s you know at what point do we stop and tell you hey let' s go back through this make a motion. You know. So I think if we notate it and then council members notate it and then we bring it all back in terms of individual discussion items might be the best way to go. Mr. City Manager are you okay with that? Sure. Okay. Yeah. Let' s roll through it that way. So just on that one pension reserves I' d like to you know bring that forward for future discussion. But if anyone else has anything just shout it out during the meeting and we' ll be able to kind of make a note and then come back with everything that we had maybe want to take a little closer look at. And something like that if you want to just not accept those changes for now we could pull it out and then at a future council meeting. Yeah. And that' s what I mean. You know if we end up scheduling a special or if we end up just doing that on the June 4th or whatever it is. Not a problem. So we can group them all into like one motion at the end that we' ll have discussed these things further. Yeah. Yeah. Pull them out and then we can wrap it into all one motion. I think that' s the best way to go. All right. Okay. And then finally Ms. McGar already talked about the new software and where you can find new capital projects but this is an additional summary about that and what where you can find that information. Now I' m going to move on to the five year projection. This is something that is in the budget document. I' d like to go over it. It we use this as a tool so you can see kind of where we are headed what we know right now and what we anticipate to be doing going forward. It' s in the budget document page 38. Okay. And then history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history different revenue sources that the general fund receives. As you can see with our sales tax and our district sales tax, that represents about 55% of the revenue that we receive and then a distant second is our property tax revenue. The district sales tax is the measure H funds and the sales tax is our 1% Bradley Burns sales tax amount. With that, it's been a little bit challenging to follow sales tax in recent years. With the campfire and then COVID and then economy being what it is, it's been a little bit of a jagged line over the last few years. This line represents what we know and how we have completed the years up through 2022-2023. We saw a 5% decline in sales tax from the year before. This doesn't take into account that we received measure H funds that brought the dollars up. It's just the general overall sales tax value. This is what we are estimating general for this year and for next year. We're estimating as of just the other day, we had a meeting with our sales tax consultant and we're looking at history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history the property tax is a little more predictable as you can see over up through 2223 we generally the line is generally goes up in a much more smooth and much more higher trajectory. With that I will pare this down but this is kind of the beginning of where we look to be and where we are. The first call I will budget. The bottom column is where we estimate our year this year to end up and then the proposed budget and then projected throughout the years. The bottom line is our net operational income or deficit before capital project expenditures and that' s an important line to focus in on because that' s telling us whether we are structurally balanced at the end of the day. First our revenues as you can see we are showing that we are going to be spending income for the next year. The big change that we have is in our settlement proceeds. This number right here this is a one time thing it makes it look like we have a 17% loss for next year in revenues and it' s really not. We knew that was not ongoing that' s a one time money that' s just a one time thing that we are planning for. With that if we took that out of the equation you would see that number that 17% decrease would actually be just under 1% increase into next year and that' s really just where we thought it was going to be which is kind of a flat revenue projection for the next year. We have another payment coming in probably in this year correct? Yes it' s 2 million or something. 6% and then a possibility of some payment in the 24-25. I' m not sure. There' s a lot of guessing. I' m not big on guesses so I' m trying to be conservative about that sort of thing. You will see most of the items are going up you can see utility users tax is going down slightly that revenue trend going down is really attributable to our telecom UUT. Some years back we lost the ability to tax cell phones and as you know most people just have cell phones these days so we can kind of continue to see the tax from that utility going down in years and then the other utilities are really looking to be kind of flat for the next year or so. And then on the other revenue items just to kind of outline what those are that' s our business licenses, our fines and forfeitures, charges for services, interest accounts, and so on. So that' s kind of we have anomalies that come in this year and then we kind of have general items that we budget for each year after that. And then taking that total revenue and looking down at expenditures, the salaries and benefits portion, that is all in the out years accounting for what we know as of right now in terms of CalPERS changes, benefit changes, all the benefits that we have in the out years. And then we have some general MOU union contract changes that we know coming forward so those are all estimated in those dollars that are outlined there. And then some general increases just for cost increases for the different lines that are there. And with that, just want to highlight that we are in the positive in every year going forward. The $23 million that we have in the out years is going to be the same as we have in the past year. But history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history was to go away, we'd have to make some big decisions, but it would not be the impact that it would be if we are using that completely for ongoing operational costs. Okay. And I had a question about that. Does anybody else have questions right now? Mr. Winslow, go ahead. Just seeing that you're getting at the end of like a big summary, I was wondering if you could explain in some simple terms, like how we showed up with like an over $30 million deficit and then how the timing worked out with that. And I think that's related to what you mentioned about the apparent steep decrease in engineering budget. And I assume that's related. That's a little bit different, but that's my next point. Thank you for queuing me up. So maybe before you take his, mine might be a precursor to that. So in looking at this, so we're basically preparing for the possibility of, you know, the Measure H going away. And I understand that by having a reserve of around $24 million. It's not the reserve, that's just operational. Operational. Yes. Understood. So once we find that out, are we going to readjust all these numbers? No, because. So our bottom line is going to be at that ending cash balance of $4 million, because what the operational, So what we're not, what the costs are not accounting for are all of our capital improvement program costs that we have, that we are, basically that's the majority of our Measure H funds is in capital improvement costs and in the settlement proceeds as well. So as you can see, this is where this number, you'll see the net revenue deficit of $31 million to the negative. As you can see, we are anticipating that our cash balance as of the end of this year is going to be $35 million. That is utilizing, you know, the cost of the history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history dollars. This is taking the dollars we know we have and allocating them for the most part as you can see in the line up there capital improvement projects we have $42 million worth of capital improvement projects just funded by the general fund dollars for next year. I want to point out this assumes we hire all of the proposed positions where if measure h were to go away that would change that outlook dramatically. There are positions proposed to be added in police animal services an entire new tree crew some park maintenance probably one or two other things I'm forgetting at the moment that are not scheduled until January 2025 specifically so that doesn't happen until we know where we are. When I look at the measure h fund salaries and employee benefits and there's just under $5 million that's not going to happen until Those are the positions that are pending the November election schedule? In part there are some that are already there for example last year some community service officers got assigned to measure h. The police increases in there too. Bottom line there are several things that it would change our trajectory if we were to lose measure h. I know we have had a lot of because you would have they said 400 municipalities go out of business. I tend to agree with you but we have to plan for the worst. I understand. I would like to see us when it fails. I would like to see us obviously come back to this maybe at that time. I just want to reiterate that we' re not using the funds. It' s not money that' s just sitting there. It' s just we' re not using it in ongoing costs. I get it. We definitely have only to the end of the year we' re going to have $4.6 million which is what we want to have at the end of the year. Makes sense. From all of the general fund funds which includes general fund proper measure h, settlement proceeds and everything. We' ve allocated all but that $4.6 million to the federal fund because we want to have a allocated to the items that are priorities and things that we' re doing that the citizens want us to do for those funds. Makes sense. It' s not sitting there in a fund waiting to see what happens it' s just allocated in one-time uses so that if something happens we have an easier time. We can pull it back but that pivot obviously won' t happen until November or December. Correct. It wouldn' t even happen until next fiscal year I believe until 25 or 26. December of 25 is when the tax would stop happening. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. It would make the hard decision not even harder. Sure. All right. Any other questions on this section? Do you want to go back and revisit h in January? I won' t be here in January. Excuse me. You guys can. Yeah, certainly. I mean, I think it' s worthwhile discussion to outline that for the future, sure. I' m sure that it will be a priority once we know what the election results are. If they' re not to our favor, it will definitely be a priority of having that discussion and what our plan is going to be. Gotcha. All right. Yes. Thank you. And just to wrap up the five- year projection, as you can see on the bottom line, every year we are looking to be where we want to be in terms of desired operating reserve. We have a little bit of discretion in terms of our other financing sources and uses. You can see that we send money out to different funds, mainly for reserves, mainly at the top of the other financing uses to our emergency reserve, so that remains fully funded. We have a little bit of money coming in from operating grants, et cetera, that we know about. But this is just really you can see that we have many different areas where the general fund supports replacement. We have a lot of funds that are going to be going to the airport, so we have a little bit of money going to the airport in 24-25 to balance that fund, et cetera. And then finally, just to reiterate, we are fully funded in our emergency reserve fund. We have just, we will have just under $12 million in there as of the end of this fiscal year, and then next year we're projecting that fund into we expected to have just under $12.3 million, and so we have this reserve, and then we also have the pension reserve that I talked about earlier. So we definitely have money for a rainy day, something that we don' t expect to come down the lane. what was the first number, 12 point? the emergency reserve? yes, please. so at the end of 24-25 we will have just under $13 million, or just over $12 million. okay. And then just to give you kind of a general, this is kind of a rough look at how we have funding by city council priority. This is throughout all the budget and what we have planned for next year. wait, let me interrupt. because I think addison' s question. so one example of what caused that distortion, for example, the fire victims trust fund, $21 million, and then we have $21 million in revenue this year, we' re not allocating until next fiscal year. right. so there' s an example of $21 million that fell in this year, but we' re not allocating until next year. so that' s why you see that erroneous reporting of a $31 million deficit spending because we didn' t spend the $21 million the year it landed. had we allocated it in the same year, you wouldn' t look at that as a distortion. mm-hmm. but isn' t it sitting there as a surplus then as we had this $20 million in revenue and we didn' t allocate it? yeah, that' s the ending cash balance that you see. yeah, so we' ll go into next year with anticipated. yeah. $35 million and then use some of those monies to fund what we have planned for next year. yeah, so the report should actually be that we have $35 million. well, it should, yeah, and then the report using a budget that we' fund balance and referring to it as a balance sheet. and, yeah, underreported the cash on hand at the city by 32,000%. yeah. we should plug that in a little like summary in the start, you know. okay. so just going back to this real quick, we' re about 53% in infrastructure, 30% in public safety. 7% is our desirable place to live. a lot of these things, you know, a lot of the things that we spend our dollars on can go into many categories. this is just kind of putting them into certain places. 5% into housing and then 3% into our balanced budget and 1% into economic development. so. this is not just the general fund. yeah, because housing' s in there. yeah, this is throughout all of the, you know, the city. we get a lot of comments about that we are 75% public safety, but that' s just really the general fund. and the reason why the general fund funds things like public safety to the extent that it does is because there' s no other available funding sources for something like that. so that' s why it is so heavy in those areas. just maybe a note on that in the future that we use different colors, not just shades of green. i tried. it did not like me. i tried. i agree with you. because it' s hard to tell what' s what. i know. i 100% agree with you. and i couldn' t change it without changing the whole presentation. so i said forget it. okay. now we' ve talked about kind of giving you the summary and where we are as the city. and now we' re going to go into the department presentations. and each department director will be coming up and giving you kind of highlights of what they' ve done, where they' re going, and what they' ve requested and what' s in the budget. in their different areas. can i make like a little request for some pie charts in the future that i think would help for the public? one is like that same thing, the funding by city council priority, but just for the general fund. and then another is measure h. i think we had that last year for measure h. it was easier to tell where all the money' s going than it is here. you might as well do three. you have a third one you want to pie chart? no. i mean you can do. yeah. i' m fine with the two. and that has been in the budget previously. so we can have those. yeah. thanks. more questions? the more we say pie, the more we might get a pie. ask for more. yeah. okay. everybody ready? on to the next. all right. okay. administrative services. again, our main goal is to provide you with trustworthy information, transparent information, accurate financial reporting. make sure that what we' re doing with the city' s finances are safe and accurately reported. make sure that we' re making sure that our internal controls are in secure order, that we' re monitoring our cash flow and make sure that we have adequate cash for all the different things that the city does. and then also supporting our city as a whole with our computer network systems, etc. this is our mission to serve the citizens of the city of chico and city departments by providing accurate, efficient, and timely information. information services and support. this goes for both the finance side and the information system side of things. this year we have a $5 million just over $5 million operational budget requested and the personnel costs make up about $3.5 million of that. you' ll see that these dollars are a little bit different than in the actual budget book. again, that' s because all of our city debt service is included with administrative services which is our lease payments for the different equipment that we have and then also our sewer bonds that we have. we have a lot of other things that go out. all of administrative services has 31 positions. and then I will stop talking after this slide. this is just what we have requested as a department and what is in the budget for the new year. we have three hourly positions, two interns and an annuitant. the interns are students that come in and help us in a variety of ways and we hope that we provide them some ability to kind of serve the of get an idea of what it is to work for the city and work for our departments and then our annuitant we have a retired annuitant that was our payroll manager and we have her back to on a part-time basis to help us with some software upgrade information and also she was an expert in our background parts for our financial software on the payroll side so she's doing some special projects there so all right so the interns are actually just paid employees right yeah they're they're paid part-time yeah okay just you know I hear intern I think free we mean underpaid right yes I was an internal I'm citing get paid yes sure McDonald's I get it okay we have a couple non-recurring operating items we are just completing our finance system upgrade and our timekeeping software is then is the next thing the version that we have is vintage 2018 I believe and they're basically telling us you've got to do something or we're not going to support you anymore so this is to get that upgraded and to a supportable version and then a lot of our items that we've requested kind of cross departments as I said we're internal service information systems does a lot of work and we're going to be doing a lot of work with the different departments to assist with some of their technical upgrades and things and you'll see a lot of these things and in our budget but also they will be mentioned with the other departments the fire come hard wire upgrade that is the headsets that go into the fire trucks so that so that they can communicate with each other their end of life and need to be upgraded and so that is for that piece of it CPD is for a Chico Police Department we are going to be hosting a lot of servers over at the police department and we have run into some issues with the with all of the heat that comes off of the servers and the computers in there that it gets too hot in the rooms and it causes some major issues especially in the summer so this is to upgrade the AC system in those server rooms and then the UPS the uninterruptible power supply this is an upgrade so that over at the police department so that their computer systems should there be a power failure we have continuous history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history

history history time will make it so that all of the city employees that use radios can use the same system once they officially move over to p25 the people who don' t have these radios will be able to communicate because they' re on the old radio system. This would be our public works department or our vips or our cso' s et cetera, et cetera. Again, this is anticipating ads over time. so that' s coming out of your department' s budget? well, it' s general fund. our department includes radios so do not open any. okay. information. little did i know. vice mayor. this may sound really silly but do all employees not have cell phones? they have cell phones but the radio traffic goes through. we' re talking police, fire, public works. i got police and fire. and the vips. this is just for police, fire and vips. and public works. it comes out of administrative services because they' re in charge of radios. the is department oversees all i think my and probably some of my fellow council members share this thought and you might have originally too. shouldn' t that come out of police' budget? it does by way of allocations. it will come out of an allocated fund and again many of these things i' m touching on right now will probably be addressed in the different departments. we are the internal service department. that' s the total amount. there' e not additional amounts. s just a request from asd and from our radio department. that' s why it' s here. makes sense. our department will be the manager of the project. tower improvements at the fire stations where there' e some issues with radio coverage and communication services at some of the fire stations. this will help with that and make it so they can communicate with dispatch and etc. more effectively. we are going to be establishing conduit to the security gates so we can have a better ability to secure the water pollution control plant. right now it' s just needing some modernization in that area. this is to be able to do that. the fire mark alert expansion this is just additional dollars that will be allocated to that project that has been going for a while. again this is a fire support station item. i' m sure the chief will expand on that and give you more information about that. it' s the way they are dispatched in the different fire stations. finally our last two we have the cad system upgrade. this is an ongoing project. that $50,000 is to add tablet command which is for the fire department as well. some of the cad system items that are in the software aren' t conducive to the fire side of things as well as they are to police. this is to bridge that gap and give them more ability to do the things they need to do. cloud dr and ops dr is disaster recovery. as time goes on and as our needs and as our systems expand we need more ability to push things off to the cloud and save them should something catastrophic happen here on site we still have backups and ability to push things off to the we need to pull that information from the cloud should that come up to be. with that I' m done. should I take any questions? thank you. the clerk next. come on down. you' re the next contestant. thank you mayor and council. it' s an honor to stand before you. our strategic goals for the city clerk' s office really is to make sure that really interact a lot with what the council directives are and the policies. every action you take ends up becoming a legislative action and we take great pride in ensuring the integrity of every action. what we have coming up for 2024 through 2025 would be our election this November. it' s for four districts. history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history are included in all agendas. In addition, because the council policy is that anything that the council does at our council meetings carries over to our board and commission members, we'll be working with staff once we identify that new program process, and we'll be training staff and our board and commission members to use the same process. That uniformity allows for our citizens who are at Bidwell Park and Playground Commission meetings or the Planning Commission meeting to understand exactly how it's going to work at council meetings. We're also going to be training, preparing training sessions that we're really excited about. And one really important area, and thank you again, council, for the multimedia coordinator position, we're identifying technologies that will allow for continued and greater public access. Our role in the city clerk office is to actually be that conduit and to help our citizens access local government services. And so, we're going to be working with our city council to understand how we're going to be able to get information out on our website in addition to videos and also to help implement the communication plan. I think that that is real important to help assist with that. Debbie, did I read somewhere that you were in part of, I think what you're talking about there, with greater public access, would film internal affairs and finance committee meetings? Other meetings like that? That would be a council policy change in the past, for the past 24 years, and doesn't mean that it has to remain that way. The council has wanted the committee meetings to be more, to be less formal and to be able to be more interactive. But there, if you did do that, you would need to move into this room in order for it to be videotaped. So, that was the other thing is that we don't have the technology in conference room one to actually videotape. So, it would kind of change. You would put the committee up, and again, it would be up to the council if they would like to do that. Okay. We are going to continue this next fiscal year on the implementation of the records management program, something that the city has never had, which I'm incredibly proud of the work that staff has done on it. And that's staff across the board. We have people working diligently to protect the integrity of all those legislative actions, historical information about our city. They're all working diligently to get it into our programming and be in compliance with our retention schedule that you adopted. We're also going to conduct the 2024 biennial recruitment. That will be for all new board and commission members and for those whose term is going to be up. So, we're working on that, and then we'll be working on a training session. So, we're excited about what this next year brings. Okay. So, I think it's really important about our mission, and that is to, as I mentioned earlier, about the integrity of city government and to ensure our citizens are informed by having access to documents, access to council meetings, to videos, those kinds of things, and having an accurate recording of city council proceedings, as well as commission and committee meetings as well. So, our funding source is the general. Our streaming video, anything related to meetings are through the PEG fund, which is our public access funding source through Comcast, and those are dedicated funds, can't be used for anything else. And so, that will also be used for when we take over the actual Channel 11 broadcasting, which I believe I updated the council on recently. It indicates I have four and a half positions. I actually have five, but we're sharing with the city manager's office, one of my staff members, and so far that is working well, and we'll continue in that light. In terms of anything that's different in my budget, we really may have a little bit more for dues for all the positions that need ongoing training and certification, as well as bringing critical. But overall, history-making history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history the city clerk' s office and that would include for the actual measure if we have to have one. That is what I have. Do you have any questions about what' s going on in the city clerk' s office? thank you. we will do a couple more departments and take a break before we will see. thank you. before fire. before fire. before eric. we were at him mercilessly on that point. eric takes it pretty well most of the time. city manager department I won' read through these even though I' m sure council member morgan would wish me to. thank you. item 3 provide fiscal leadership to the city and to the organization. I hope you' ve been impressed with the presentation so far and see how much thought and effort we' ve put into trying to navigate whatever comes our way over the course of the next year. item 4. what did I do? item 4 is an area where we a new city management plan which I have shared with the council to improve our citizen engagement much like the city clerk. We streamlined social media by combining pages and improved more and with more frequent content and separately after the meeting after you' ve had a few days to digest what we' ve said so far I' ll give you some really interesting statistics on our amazing increase in engagement on social media. A new city website that works compared to the last website and a new ai chat bot that is very impressive with its ability and accuracy to find answers and we' re still working to improve it. Of course the mission which you' re very well familiar with the budget requested should be extremely close to last year I think the primary increase is $119,000 for the county' s sobriety treatment from opioid settlement funds. Highlights, lost park redevelopment we continue to work with csu chico on redeveloping that accumulation of parcels we have encountered some turbulence with some recent changes to the surplus lands act that we' re having to navigate a solution for we' ll update you on that at some point in the future. Cannabis we' re on our second year of most of our licensees and that program is going very very quickly. very well and I can tell you among our sales tax generators that was really a bright spot I can tell you that. Then our economic development efforts we continue to work with a variety of different organizations in our community with some very successful economic development efforts. With that I' ll turn it over to human development. ve got one. questions? no. Quick one, lost park redevelopment when do you think we' ll see something preliminary just anything informationally? that' s a loaded question and that' s probably going to be a closed session discussion. Because of some complexities in the surplus lands act that we' re having to navigate and we' ve would definitely be a closed session discussion. Gotcha. Okay. The shop local campaign, was that under city manager's office? It was. Yeah. I'm just curious now that it's over if there's any insights or something from that. It's obviously hard to say exactly the impact, but I will tell you that when you look at adoption of the Get It in Chico campaign, the area that did have the strongest adoption was our downtown area, which as you saw the last quarter sales tax results had the biggest growth in our community as well. The campaign itself, all of the assets that were done as part of that, we own those assets. We can continue to use those assets even though the payment for the campaign is basically over in June. It doesn't mean that we as staff can't continue with the messaging. I think it was very successful in terms of people really getting the thought about thinking about local first. I'd be curious for more economic development initiatives in that tourism campaign and such. Maybe another time, or you could go off if you think there's something good to bring us. I appreciate that, Council Member Winslow. In fact, I look forward to in July coming back and talking to the council about what is planned for this next fiscal year in terms of Travel Chico, Team Chico, and visitor services. If there's specific questions you'd like me to address today, I'm happy to do that. Otherwise, I look forward to giving a presentation in July. I think I'd like some more information on that. On the economic development side, too, I get a lot of questions from folks in the community. We have an update planned. Without any budget increases? Yeah. Actually, a slight reduction in personnel. I still can't get that jingle out of my head. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Chelsea, you're up. I think we should stop before fire, though. No offense to the chair. Hello. Good afternoon, Mayor, Council Members. Happy to stand before you today to talk about the growth of the human resources and risk management. We're going to talk about some of the initiatives we've accomplished and what we're hoping to do in this next year. Who does the... Thank you. Our strategic goals create and enhance strategic partnerships within the community. One of our key partnerships that we've developed over this past year and moving forward has been with Butte Community College. We are working with them closely to launch an internship program across all departments, including our police department. So we are very excited about that partnership to get folks that are interested in municipal employment into the city to see what we're all about. Enhancing the employee experience. I think this is key for one of the statistics I'm going to give you in just a minute. We had bring your... bring your... family-to-work-day about a month ago, and it was hugely successful. Thank-you to Council-member Bennet and Mayor Coolidge for coming and participating in making that a special-day. And then retaining-talent-through-growth-opportunities. We have really-work-hard-over-the-last-year-to-identify-positions- that-make-sense-within-the-city- for-growth-opportunities- and then have also really identified key areas to train staff on and provide training that will keep them interesting and engaged with the city and that includes partnering with our police department to provide staff with pepper spray training which we issued certificates for which was it was great training we've partnered with our fire department to provide fire extinguisher training which was very informative and a lot of fun and aed training as well and then in the future we are next week holding a de-escalation training we're looking forward to that and then we're also holding a personal self-defense training as well and our primary target our initial target group for the self-defense training is going to be our public works department who is out there in the parks and encountering folks that you know might be a little bit more aggressive than what we're used to so those are some of the initiatives that we have going on one of the things that we are most pleased with it's a statistic that shows I think that people are starting to talk about the city of Chico is as a good place to work last fiscal year the average number of applications we received per job was nine point two five so for each job we flew we received an average of nine point two five applications this fiscal year we're at thirty five point seven applications per job so we've more than tripled the number of applications per job that we are flying so we're very pleased to see that but that's an average of all jobs across the board so while a thousand of them might be for firefighters you might only get two to be an admin in payroll okay but year over year you know we typically fly very similar jobs each year yeah so you know it is a good statistic to point to for us no it's great thank you so all of those initiatives and things that we're doing go to our initiatives for a fiscal year twenty-four twenty-five and you know really are digging in as much as we can to enhance the employee experience and get the word out that the city of Chico is a great place to work and I'm history m happy to answer any questions you may have. questions? We will take a break. Sorry. was that dinner we opened? that' s our dinner. It' s our lunch and dinner. I' m missing two. I' m missing one. I' m missing just one now. All right. Go ahead, chief. I can' t see what I' m doing. I know. There we go. I don' t want to give away too much. All right. Well, good afternoon, mayor, vice mayor, council members. It' s a pleasure to be here again. This is my seventh presentation. Yes, I' ve made it seven, well, six years, but seven budgets. So I do want to express my gratitude for supporting the fire department in the last six and a half years I' ve been here. And getting us incrementally closer to being sustainable and much more, have much more capacity and capability than we had in 2018. So very appreciative of the support we get from the council. So enough sucking up on my part. And we' ll go into the strategic goals. These are the general ones for the fire department. Six goals. Attain long-term and sustainable staffing solutions. And we' ve taken an incremental approach to achieve that up to this date. And we' ll continue to make those requests as needed. Update on the fire department's Our radio and communication systems. Barbara Martin spoke about it briefly. About the new radio system, which we are really happy to get because we should have much better reception and coverage over the city. Creating an effective planning process for facilities and maintenance. And again, we' ve been working with Eric and his folks on that process for building and replacing two stations. And getting station one remodeled. And again, effective fire fleet maintenance and capital replacement. We' ll talk a little bit about that. Eric will touch on it in his presentation as well. But again, we' ve made significant strides in that regard. A risk reduction program in alignment with our mission. And then finally, a training program that' s best predicated on best practice. So we' re always evolving to meet the challenges as they evolve as well. So our key initiatives for 2024- 25, secure funding for fire station six. We' ll be presenting that plan to the city manager and then we' ll go from there presenting it to the council. We' ll be initiating and hopefully completing the emergency operations plan for the city. And then adopt our standard of cover and present the fire department strategic plan for the next five years starting January of 2025. So our mission is pretty simple. Provide the highest quality fire rescue and emergency services to our Chico community in a caring professional manner. And I' d be remiss if I didn' t talk a little bit and give praise to the members of the Chico fire department. They are an incredibly dedicated member or firefighters. And one of the things that make us really unique from other fire departments is the vast majority of our workforce live here in Chico. So they have an invested interest in how the city grows, how it's operated and so forth. And so that makes us a really unique fire department. We don' t have firefighters coming from. coming from an hour away commuting into the city. So it' s a really great attribute because they take a lot of pride in what they do for the city. Our total budget requested is a little over $19 million with personnel dominating at almost 16,000. Currently we have 68 positions and we did not add any for this year' s budget as well. So these two budget options aren't necessarily fire specific for us but wasn't in our budget. They're actually in fleet and in IS and Barbara spoke to one and I'm planning to go into a little bit more detail about Mock Alert. But the two new engines are a big deal. This will complement the other two engines we got funded last year along with the new tiller truck and then when we put the new engine at station six in 2022. So we're going to be working on the new two engines. With these two engines we will effectively have rotated out all the older engines on the on the on our in our department and we'll all be on new chassis and engines going forward. So that's a big that's a big lift and we appreciate the council approving those. And then station alerting system I'm going to go into a little bit more detail. It's a much bigger thing than just simply station alerting. It has a lot of functionality that it has to offer. It's tied to other technologies and I want to highlight those because it's a it's a really vast improvement in the way we dispatch and get information to and from the crews. Areas of responsibility. Emergency response obviously. Emergency management and pre pre incident planning. Fire code enforcement. And public education and outreach. And those are all the cool pictures that we have. And I hope that helps support that. So 2023 was a really busy year for us and it didn't like done I mean I was putting all this together and we really had a heavy concentration on new new technology and software being implemented and it was not by design. It just happened to be a coalition or a coalescing of all these programs coming together. Unfortunately all at the same time. And one of the big plans or implementations we are in the process of doing so implemented phase one which will entail two aspects. One is implementing the text to voice module. But then that required getting the module boxes for the individual stations and then hooking it into the current infrastructure. So that would be the wiring and the speakers. What is really interesting about and helpful for us as a fire department is it automates the toning out of engines and is a much more efficient and quicker process. For a couple of different reasons. And I'm going to play a little sound for the old dispatching. Hopefully. Perhaps not. It's really cool. So we have a couple of things that we can do. I did actually. Thank you. I think I did. Well, I can assure you. It's a lot different. Can you mimic it some way? I can just do beep, beep, beep. The way the old system worked it had a pre-alert where the dispatcher would get on and say engine six, engine five, blah, blah, blah, structure fire. Then they do the toning out to the stations. And it had a pre-alert where And it had to be sequential because it couldn't activate all the stations at one time. Then they would come back with the information structure fire one, two, three, four, main street. And then that ended the transmission. That process, the one I would have showed you if I had checked it earlier, it was about a minute 40. The new system is about 30 seconds for that same transmission. So what that does is it allows the dispatchers to take They can take out their The cad notes are the computer aided dispatch program that goes out to the crew so they know what they are anticipating. They can take out their calls for service. So there is a lot of capacity over the aggregate of a year that the dispatchers now don't have to do those notices and follow on information. The other aspect to this is tied to the cad to cat. Our computer aided dispatch software, we implemented one with cal fire and it works reasonably well. We have some ticks now and again. But overall it has been a really beneficial program for both cal fire and us. So what happens is those cads are connected so that the information gets transmitted in both directions. So when cal fire needs a unit for one of their incidents, they automatically tag that unit as being the closest one. And now with the mock alert it comes into our system and it automatically dispatches our units without having to have the dispatchers do that. We are implementing a cad to cat interface with a beauty ms and we are hoping for the same functionality. We are on the last leg of that so we hope to have that done by the end of this year as well. Or this fiscal year. Which is the second point we want to make. We have a lot of work to do We have initiated it. The beauty ms cad to cad. We had it running and unfortunately our guru of cad took a three week vacation and he did not actually get it approved for the fire department. So I am not happy that he took off and went to europe without me. As barbara talked about tablet command is our command and cad overlay. And it allows us to have more functionality than we currently have with the cad system. The cad system is generally speaking police centric cad system. So the tablet command is a work around for us to utilize it at its best and most optimal. And so the tablet command will be implemented here in the next several months. One of our really big changes was changing our records management system to what is called image trend. It is a really big change in history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history And then the state local or the EMS agency also uses it as well. So it has some interoperability that's helpful for us. I have three in there. Apologize. It's actually two new apparatus. We'd ask for three. And as I said, that's a big deal for us to get those additional apparatus. And last year we facilitated the building of the three apparatus you put in the budget last year. So two of the engines are being fabricated now. We hope to have them in the fall. And then the tiller of the ladder track should be here next year. Again, with the budget modifications last year, we added a fire prevention position. And way. The fire marshal, it's a management position. And we have seen significant improvements in the capability and the consistency in our fire prevention group. And he's done an amazing job taking that and turning it into a really effective and efficient group of prevention professionals. We initiated a new standard of cover. These typically happen every five years. It's a best standard. It helps us identify what changes have occurred within our environment. And you can imagine over the five-year plus years that we had the previous standard of cover, we've had a lot of changes in the city, not to mention within the fire department. So we want to reevaluate those, identify the gaps, and then work towards putting those into the strategic plan, which is our department plan. And how we want to pursue a drug safety plan. And how we want to change history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history level here in the city and then tactics or strategies for us to address those issues. And then finally, we're finalizing the Station 6 design and we'll be bringing it up to council after that and then strategize how we can look to build Station 6 for an area of the city that is desperately needing fire coverage since Station 42 closed in 2017. There you go. I feel like he could have imitated that pretty well. I know, I think he could have too. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure the sound quality is. The other one, it sounded really cool. This is the new Teller truck. Just to give you an idea, we had designed this a little different design than the current truck. So it took several months for us to go get those plans put into place. Modifications, once we got it to the vendor, the manufacturer made some additional changes. We finally got. We got those approved and we're in the process of moving it into the queue. It's in the queue right now and waiting for it to be built when, like I said, it'll probably be the first quarter, second quarter of next year that we'll see the Teller in service. And that's the preliminary design. This is the before design that will be presented, showing you from the least expensive option all the way up to the, the most optimal and what it would mean to us in terms of capability and having adequate space to store apparatus, reserve apparatus, and cross-staffed apparatus. So this year's goal, fiscal year's goals are work with IS, as we've been in the past, upgrading all our fire radio and communication systems to the PTA. We're going to be using the P-25. Complete phase two of our alerting system. And this part of it will be changing out or replacing all the infrastructure within the stations, with the exception of station one, which was already built with the new wiring and speakers. So now the other four stations will get that as well. And it should address some of the issues we've had with mock alert trying to integrate with an older, more modern infrastructure. Secure funding to build station six to improve our response times in the northeast and northwest areas of town. Complete our standard of cover. Complete our strategic plan. Complete the revision for the emergency operations plan. And that is all for me. Do you have any questions? Questions? Thank you. All right. Hold on. Chief? I'm sorry. Truck's going to be gray and red? We're going all to the new scheme that station six or engine six has, which is a gray over red. Okay. Yes. And then do you have anything in your budget for just notifying people? I know we have the county evacuation plan in terms of numbers. Do we have anything in there to inform local folks about that? No, there's nothing in there. Evacuation notifications and evacuations themselves are handled under PD and through dispatch and then boots on the ground. So that would be a question you might want to ask. I'm thinking more about just the education about which particular zone that you're in. The wildfire plan that we have is an operational plan. It isn't an evacuation plan for the consumption of our community because it can change depending on how we're doing it. And we may change even the boundaries depending on what different changes may occur as well. Okay. So we don't, we don't, the, the, that's an operational plan. The actual evacuation plan is integrated into the police evacuation plan that they have for the entire city for different, different events. So it's dynamic in that nature. Yeah, I know the county has one that doesn't make certain. Correct. For a single incident. Okay. So it's a very diverse community. You can do that when you have multiple incidents or you have a very dispersed community. It gets much more challenging to build evacuation plans or zones that would effectively be or be effective. So the plan that PD put together gives us the opportunity to overlay those and they have, they're more micro in nature. So it allows them to be dynamic if they need, like, for example, a hazmat. Sure. If it's for a train. And depending what the, what the hazardous material is and the conditions would dictate where we would want to evacuate or do protection in place. So we, we get with PD and define that area and then that's how they go about the evacuations. Okay. All right. Thank you. Quick question. Yeah. Yeah. Is the dividing of the fire and PD dispatch still an issue? Is there anything that's under consideration or where's the status of that? It's on hold right now. We're going to go back and readdress it once dispatch is stabilized from the loss of so many dispatchers over the last year. So it's just right now we're just trying to get the, the core of the dispatch center set up. So the mock alert, the CAD to CAD were efforts to try to reduce the burden on, on the dispatchers from a fire standpoint as well. So it's all interlinked. Great. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Thank you. Well, unlike the fire chief, this is only my second presentation for a budget and I think we are ready to give you. A great budget plan here. First off, mayor, vice mayor, members of council. Thank you for letting me be here today and continue to be the chief and provide this budget proposal to you. To the city manager and his staff for helping me with the new system. Amanda, Barbara, thank you very much. Appreciate it. It has been a learning process. That's for sure. So the police department, I do want to acknowledge the first things first, as we take up a large portion of the fire department. We have a lot of funds within the general budget. And I recognize that. And so my goal is always to provide you with, with things that I know we need to build out the police department for the community. And not ask for too much. But we have a goal of building out our police department to ensure that we have, as our number one goal states there, to provide a safe place to live, work and recreate within this community. And I think that the way we're working with the city, the city of history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history the city and we' re working towards some ideas there but the most important thing we' ve done to start to reduce those fatal accidents and bring some education enforcement back to the city is build out our traffic unit and that' what we have started doing effective yesterday Monday we' started putting people back in the traffic. As the staffing levels have started to come up thanks to all of you we' able to start back filling all of those special assignments and I know that is one that we get the most complaints on. As we build out that traffic division you will definitely see some accountability brought back to the drivers on the streets within our community to make it a more safe environment for everyone on the streets. Not only are we going to do the enforcement side but we' re also going to do an education side that' s important also. DUI education stuff some teen driver education type things and then one thing we' administration. One thing that' s not listed in there that is extremely important also is the engineering side of traffic and working with brendan and eric and their staff to ensure we identify those issues within the community on our streets that can be changed up from an engineering standpoint that we include that also. We always have a commitment to our community we try to engage with as many things as we possibly can throughout our community and as a matter of fact I typically only get about a day and a half off a week because I' m going to something on a day off friday saturday or sunday and it definitely is something I enjoy and something our police department enjoys engaging in. So there' s many different types of engagements that we do whether it be a traffic related education piece on DUI' s. We' things like driving a car or using your cell phone when you' re driving or out in the public to go into a car show and showing some of the equipment our taxpayers fund for us and explaining what it' s there for those are the types of things we have to do national night out coffee with a cop all of those types of engagements are very important to the community and they want to engage with your police department and that is definitely something that is a high priority for me and we will continue to do as many of those as we possibly can. I' the last goal there which definitely is not one of our last goals in the police department is maintain that transparency internally and externally so that we can get that support from our community show them that we' re doing things the right way every single time and if we' re not we' re correcting the issues holding ourselves accountable holding each other accountable and making those changes where we know we need to make those changes. The four tenants of our police department are the ones that are going to be the most important to us. We' procedural justice are listed right there. The voice respect neutrality and trustworthiness those are things we teach from the beginning in the academy and we push that throughout the careers of each employee within your police department until the day they retire. Definitely something our community expects of us. Some of the things we want to do here in this next fiscal year with your assistance and the budget we want to finalize is to last piece of our rems dispatching system and integration of the evidence system so we' re in line with the rest of the agencies in the county. We have been on a different type of evidence system that joe morrelle obviously started it all up back it' s probably been about 15 years now somewhere in there. So not as long ago as I thought about or more actually. It' s been a great system for us but since we' ve changed over to the new rems project one of the last pieces we' ve looked at is the property and evidence piece for it and it definitely is something that' s different than what we' re used to but we feel like it integrates well with all the other county agencies integrates well with the product we have in dispatching and so we want to just kind of finalize that project and move all of our evidence based system over to that same project that we started in dispatch. As you all know our police department is literally crumbling our history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history! history the first step we need to do is a needs assessment for the police department to determine what is it we truly need based on the current size and the projected growth into I would suggest 30 years or maybe even 40 years in terms of the money you' re going to spend on a new facility it needs to be a long-term projection my life will probably be over by the time another new building will be built beyond this one. Definitely something we' ve been working hard on internally in terms of identifying what it is we truly need for police department and working with city manager to get some steps in place to hopefully mitigate that issue. The automated license plate reader program expansion has been something we initially wanted to do we knew there was a budget for a certain amount so we built out the way we could afford and now we' ve built that out and watched how it works the fruits ve come to bear as you saw in the wonderful budget video that louis put together we had 63 million hits on the small amount of or I' m sorry detections on the small system that we currently have with over 20,000 hits meaning that' s vehicles that are associated to crimes people that are missing people that are wanted things of that nature we' the system we' ve also assisted other agencies including oakland pd with their homicide of their officer solving their case with our camera system I can tell you story and story and story about how that system has helped solve crime so our goal is to build that out. does that automatic license plate reader does that tell things like registration to or more minor issues? no it' s very specific to what that vehicle is wanted for it doesn' t run the registration to determine is it an expired registration or anything like that if it' s a stolen vehicle then that says this is a stolen vehicle and give you the information on it. that' s good my sticker hasn' t come in yet. no it' s definitely not something like that but that is a great idea. I have a question related to this you said 20,000 hits which is I just did a quick thing on my cell phone it' s 55 a day so how do you possibly determine that that is a stolen vehicle and how do you possibly respond to those? that' s the challenge is we may get a hit and just not have someone available. it' s just the nature of the system. you have a list of things that you' re looking for and this doesn' t tell you it' s a wanted murderer as opposed to a stolen car. no it does. there' s a priority within the 55? absolutely if there was one that hit that said there was a murder suspect in town we' re going to drop just about everything we' thank you. thank you. I have a slide on the alpr that I' ll get to that will be more specific. our mission what is the mission of the chico police department to create a safer chico and improve quality of life by partnering with our community and providing dedicated service I think that is something that I have shown is my true goal in terms of partnering with the community we' ve been doing a lot of engagements that bring folks in and we' and then partner with those community agencies to solve some issues out there in our communities. funding sources we' re a general fund and grant fund funded only. you see that our budget requested is a little over 41 million with the total personal cost of a little over 33 or a little under 34 I should say. and then currently we have 193.18 I' m not quite sure where that .18 person is I' m trying to identify it this morning and I can' t quite do it. I think it' s probably derrick who' s the officer that just went into traffic on Monday and he' s 5' 4 trying to get on a motorcycle that' s 5' 7 that should be interesting to watch I did order some training wheels but we should be good. just joking derrick I know you' re watching. but the point is that we' and the point is that we' one eight we do have a lot of hourly employees that work over at the animal shelter I have a couple that work at the main station and so that point one eight comes out through some of those hourlies. what' s new in 2425 we have some professional services things such as our we have a project that we' ve been working on for several years now and we' ve had to expand that quite a bit because of the growth in the police department and then the desire by our community to have complete transparency of what every employee that works out in the field is doing so we' ve put them on animal control officers every community service officer so that it' s being recorded everything that' s in the jail when they do transportation to the main jail every police officer in the field all the way up to the watch commander or lieutenant who' s out in the field everyone' s wearing body cameras now and so that costs right those projects cost so we have to increase that project funding in order to keep that type of transparency out to our community. we have some crisis negotiation software subscriptions that we want for our hostage negotiation team and we have some!! many years and that is just a software subscription that they want to add to their repertoire then we have the evidence here we go sorry one slide behind we have that property room module I was just explaining to you it' s roughly $52,000 for that switch over and then the strategic planning a planning consultant I' ve never done a strategic plan in the organization I' ve done unit level planning but I think it' s important we bring someone in who understands how to build a long-term strategic plan for the police department and so I' m looking to bring in a consultant for that ability. With growth in your police department, I' budget comes with growth in different areas of the budget. The training budget we requested that $24,000 increase that' s just to cover the cost of growth within the police department. It' s a nominal amount for the amount of growth we' ve seen in the organization. Definitely want to keep sending people to training. Uniforms and equipment these are all line items. We' ve had to have a little bit of inflation growth with each of those line items. With all the officers we' ve been sending to the academy ammunition has the expenditures on ammunition has gone up. Different types of expenses for evidence supplies and the shredding requirements for all of the documents that come out of the police department. Canine food and supplies that' s just pure inflation right there. The food and supplies have gone up. The Astronomically range supplies same things. This is one we' ve not really focused on too much in the past that we need to start focusing on is the animal control vet expenses. We' ve always utilized donations to take care of animal medical care. I don' t think that' s a great way of doing business because once those donations don' t go to the vet, they' requested that we start funding that so we ensure there' s a plan in place to pay for that medical in the situation of no donations coming back in to cover it. that' s enough for one vet visit just so you know. I don' e don' ow if you' ve been to the vet lately. that was just within the operating cost that covers our canines. The next one here is actually the animal shelter. I' ve been to the vet for a couple of years. I' a year. I' ve been to the vet for a couple of years. I' m a vet for a couple of years. history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history shelter can keep up with the issues they' re seeing from their side books periodicals and software these are just some of the subscription services they use for the adoptions and putting out information to the community on the animals we have within the shelter and these are all the increases we are seeing with inflation with the! And then here' s the one I was speaking of veterinary expenses 44,500 is what we' ve estimated it would cost us out of pocket if we didn' t have a donation so there' s a high likelihood that those donations will continue to come in and we' ll have money left over at the end of the year I' d rather have that money left over at the end of the year and then we' ll have to ask you for money I feel it' s important we' re responsible and have that money ready for those animals in case we don' t get that. don' t tell them you have it though you don' t want to tell them you have it. transparency is one of my goals and then we want to get them into the 21st century of how they operate with the adoption events they typically use pen and paper so they want to get some ipads and have some internet programs that they utilize for those adoption events so fairly nominal cost to have them be able to operate that from an internet based system instead of pen and paper. that dog on the screen there is up for adoption if you want any of you want that dog. one thing I do want to go back to real quick here and just kind of highlight real quick we' ve been doing a lot of work on the adoption of the animal of the week and we have been doing that for almost six months now and I want to thank the city manager for allowing me to waive those fees every week on that animal of the week I can tell you that has been a tremendous success there' s only been a couple animals that we' ve put through that process that have not been adopted so it' s working out great. so staff and the community staffing requests as we projected out growth needed in the police department I believe what I submitted to the city manager was quite a bit more than this but given the budget constraints that have and the potential with measure H issues I believe this is absolutely appropriate for us to take a look at in terms of what we should be looking at with police officers. the grant for the school resource officers that were currently funding through the tobacco grant that would help us absorb those three and continue to hire the three that they would have taken away from us. Helps absorb that and build us out to 112 sworn police officers including the rangers. Animal control we had two animal control officers for over 25 years we haven' t built out that t built out in a long time so adding two of those for the amount of calls they handle every year is appropriate and then a records technician to help out with the systems within our records division. then the request from the animal. if I could stop you if you could go back to the last slide. what' s your thought on the number three? reasonable I know you' re filling a lot of positions right now. yeah. I think this is responsible this is a responsible build out right now. given what we are potentially forecasting into the future of our economy and measure h. do I want more? absolutely I want more. I think we need to add 30 more. I think we need to add 30 more. I understand that costs a lot of money and we need to plan that out and it takes time. Am I happy with what the city manager has recommended? absolutely. I can tell you the ask was seven and then when you calculate out the payroll and benefits, cars, equipment it adds up pretty quickly. we do need bike cops. I think we' re actually going to have one or two. we just filled out our target team which is going to allow us to have the DTA bike team here come up real quick and also putting the rangers back into the parks. nice. target is ready for that. I had a conversation this morning with the lieutenant who manages the detective bureau and target and all of that. those conversations are going to be happening this week and assignments may be. it' s coming. you' re seeing the fruits of the labor we put in to get to this point. it' s going to start happening really fast. how many vacancies are still unfilled? well technically I' ve got people identified for every vacancy we have. we have nine graduating from the academy here in two weeks. we' ve got four in the training program right now and I have two laterals that have been in the academy for the past year and two vacancies that are due to start also. technically we don' t have any vacancies. last year I remember when I did a ride along officers weren' t assigned to beats. everybody was roving. is that still the case? no. when you start to fall below if you have five beats and you only have four cops obviously someone is either doubling up on a beat or you decide to make everyone what they call a rove unit. typically when we do that it' s a north rove, a south rove, an east and a west rove with the freeway splitting us and another major artery like east first avenue or something like that. we no longer we do have roves but it' s extra. right now we have five beats. we have six minimum six officers assigned to each team. each person will get a beat and then you would have a rove that goes around the very, very deep in paperwork. yeah. okay. the animal shelter the request there was registered vet tech. we' ve had one vet tech for forever there. so the amount of either spays or neuters other medical procedures that those vet techs do. the one that we have right now is a! it's just not enough she can't keep up so we're having to utilize other vet services outside that cost quite a bit. if you've ever had recently if you've had to take an animal to the vet you know how expensive it is. it's out of control. so definitely need that position to assist with the massive number of animals that come in and out of that shelter every year. and then the new capital projects the police facility study. we've had a lot of people come in and out of that I don't need to beat that dead horse anymore. you know that it's 40 years old this year. it was built to be a 20 year building. when it was built it was for 70 employees. and right now you just saw that we have 193. some of which are over at the animal shelter. but over 160 people come in and out of that building all week long and it's just 10 pounds of potatoes in a five pound bag right now. it's time to look at a new facility. so the capital project request for the 360,500 is for a consultant to really start to dig into what it's going to take to build us a new police department. and I don't know a lot about building a police department. I'll be honest with you. I've read a lot about what it takes in terms of time. but I'm definitely not an engineer. I'm definitely not a person who knows how to construct that kind of stuff. so definitely need someone who knows how to do it. and I think this will help us take those next steps. the handheld radios one of the things we've always run into is we don't have a reserve of equipment. we haven't historically had a reserve bank of equipment. so when something breaks it's like okay go borrow that person's until they get back to work and then you give it back to them. so we want to be able to build in a contingency of equipment specifically the radios here if one breaks we can just reassign another one to an officer and not have to take it from someone else and share. the idea there is to have a contingency of radios not only for ourselves but also for the outside agencies that may come into chico and need to help us with a critical incident or some sort of catastrophe. we're going to be on the encryption based radio system here pretty soon. if agencies come in to help us and they can't operate off our system then we have to have a way to communicate with them. this would also allow for that to occur in those incidents. this is the capital so the first year we're looking at a $226,000 project that helps us buy nine radios immediately and then years two through five having that money set aside to start replacing radios as they age this helps us plan for the future of these radios that are about $10,000 a piece they're not cheap. vehicles we'd like to have four of those as the city manager just alluded to it costs a lot of money to buy equipment for those positions and this is money that i would request for those patrol vehicles but then it would be shifted over to eric's fleet for his account for purchasing and build out of those vehicles same thing with the transport van the current van we have is in the shop non-stop i don't quite understand why that thing breaks so much but it does and then the reserve van that we have is on its second engine i believe maybe even its third by now as a reserve van and so we we're going to have to replace that and then we're going to have to replace that van and then we're going to have to replace that van and then here pretty quick an administrative vehicle and then some community service one community service officer truck we did add one last cycle and with the build out plan of the cso's we need to add one more so this is just that future planning into that project the current evidence freezer you see there it's over 23 years old that thing it just broke last week and repaired and we're going to have an emergency call out i believe on it and then i'm not quite sure if they were able to repair it yet but i know that they were purchasing some little temporary freezers to to house the um or store the evidence that was potentially at risk within that but that thing's really old it does require a lot of maintenance and so our goal is to let that thing just keep going until it just dies but to set aside some money each year to build a vehicle that's not going to be able to! range each year should do it. Our service firearms this is one of the areas that you know as in my previous budget modification i'd requested for the rifles to build out our rifle stock same thing for service firearms kind of relating to like the radio need when one breaks where do you get one to have a lot of evidence for that if it breaks or you know if we have officers involved in officer involved shootings we have to take their weapon as evidence but then we'd like to issue them a replacement gun immediately so that they're not without one so that creates a problem we don't have enough on stock or when we're hiring people at the rate that we're hiring and then the lag time for getting those weapons from dealerships takes a while so we want to out have some on hand and alleviate that problem so or relieve that problem year one 36 000 allows us to buy 10 up front with all of the required equipment for it and then years two through three allows us to slowly buy more to have on hand for those replacements the current crime scene cameras i purchased when i was a pretty new sergeant 10 years ago so when they told me they wanted to replace them and said it was the same cameras said absolutely we need to do that so year one 2 800 buys new cameras and then years two through five setting aside that amount helps us to replace it at year five here's the license plate reader request you see it helps us install three new cameras it has a subscription fee that comes with it plus the different ways to do that we want to add the existing subscription fee that we have we want to add them to some caltrans right of ways in order to do that it takes an engineer to work with them so I went to director out of money and said I need some help with this project what is it going to cost us to have your team do it with caltrans and so the amount that was estimated was roughly 50,000 to do that design in coordination with caltrans history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history building and build out would also be an additional 145 for a year. Any questions on that? question about the firearms procurement. $36,000 you' re going to buy 10 firearms am I looking at a glock there? The glock with the optics is $1,000 and you' re going to buy 10 of them which is $10,000 how do we get to $36,000? the request is to buy 10 with the optics. right. the optics I don' t have the break down of the cost here. I do know that the gun is $1,000 and I don' t have the break down of the I would have to get back with you on the details. those sig optics deals are a couple hundred bucks. I believe it' s roughly with the gun the optics I' m trying to think if that includes I think it also includes the web gear for it because it' s a specific holster with the $3600 weapon. I apologize I don' t have a specific number there but I can definitely get that. your third bullet says you' ve got optics to retrofit some existing firearms so that' s probably part of it. if you could get back to me because that number doesn' t add up. I apologize this screen here is cutting off in the dark there I didn' t have any history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history the equipment we have on hand that you approved for purchase with the budget modification we are wanting to set aside a capital project to replace that in ten years. Those robots both of those together with all the equipment was a little over about $103,000. We want to set aside money for replacing those in the future. We think they have about a ten-year life cycle is what we have learned about them. We have a lot of future. Building out a ten-year capital project. I know we don' t do ten years anymore but we can roll that from what I understand. The idea would be to set aside that $103,000 every year for ten years to replace them after the end of ten years. Then any changes that come to them in terms of cost we would have to just absorb throughout that s a maintenance need. Our personnel have the tactical vests with different ratings for calibers of firearms that expire every five years. Those vests have to be replaced. This is an ongoing capital project we have had for many years. The only request is to increase it by $2,000 a year due to the inflation. Mr. Chair? lastly our uniform safety equipment I would like to keep the account that we created this year to absorb those increases in unknown uniform and safety equipment purchases. I think that the way we designed it absorbs those overages for us to keep from having to come back and ask for a budget modification because we' ve overspent in that category due to the hiring. If we keep the current line item that we have for safety equipment and this new one for uniform and safety equipment in addition it allows us to absorb any of those purchases for increased hiring throughout the year. With that I will answer any further questions you have. on the uniform safety equipment the uniform allowance. I remember talking about in labor negotiations the uniform allowance is that in addition to the uniform allowance or is that actually what we' re talking about? we set a particular uniform allowance. the way uniform allowance works they currently get paid out for their uniform allowance that' s anything above and beyond their initial build out. When we hire someone we buy everything for them. From there if they want to get a uniform they can get a uniform that is a little bit more more expensive. When we hire someone mid-year and put them through the academy we have to buy all of that equipment for the academy. If an officer tears a uniform shirt because they got into a fight we replace that. Any kind of replacements throughout the year or additional equipment throughout the year that we need for hiring or damage. It' s a lot of work for us to have on hand for those unknowns that happen to us when it comes to uniforms and equipment. You anticipate probably not spending all of that usually? This would be the first full year that we've had it because the last cycle we created it mid I believe it was mid-year Barbara. It' s kind of tough to say whether or not we would have savings or not. I don' t know yet. All right. Any other questions for the chief? Thank you, chief. Madam Clerk, just a question. So originally did we talk about going until 4 or going until 5? We put it in that we could break at 4 and then we would do closed session at 5. But again it would be it's not locked in. It would be up to the council. Does it feel like we're about three-fifths of the way through? Keep going. So it's up I mean it's 3.39 and I know you have three presentations left. And then a discussion possibly. So. I will seek opportunities to go quick. Appreciate that. Eric coming up. But wait a minute. That came from a planner. All right. Mr. Reid. I'll leave the rest of my time to Good afternoon. Mayor, Vice Mayor, and council. Again it's a pleasure to be here. Director of the City of Chico. We'll receive the planning, housing, code enforcement, building, and GIS divisions. So while CD's responsibility is to touch on all of council's goals, I believe the three primary goals are housing, economic development, and creating a place to live. To support these goals, the community development department has identified a number of its own strategic goals. Things like ensuring general plan and land use regulations are consistent and quickly evolving state housing and land use legislation. We seek to expeditiously process development applications in accordance with global state and federal regs. Plan and administer affordable housing programs and funding. Provide up-to-date GIS data and information. Ensure all new constructions consist of the quality of the community through enforcement of local and state codes and regulations. So let's just start with the planning division. Planning has eight positions and a total budget request of approximately 2.7 million. At its core, planning seeks to implement the general plan and apply the city's development standards to proposed projects that ultimately help the city meet its jobs and housing goals. In addition to serving city council, planning staffs the planning commission, the architectural and geostoric preservation board, MAPIC vice-chair, and the city advisory committee, zoning administrator, and the climate action commission. This requires significant coordination in building agenda management, application commission communication, public noticing, community engagement, and ultimately providing an open and transparent decision-making process. So I'll just share with you the development activity continues at what I consider a high pace. We expect to have more on the same in the upcoming year and that the demand for single-family and multi-family housing continues to be very strong. The planning department is deeply involved in Chico's second special planning area, the Barber Yard project. This infill brownfield project proposes approximately 1,250 residential units as well as 180,000 square feet of commercial and office uses. The required environmental review is nearing completion and I expect for planning to be going before planning commission and council later this year. Long range is also very active. The division recently completed a rehaul of the city subdivision ordinance to ensure consistency with state law. We continue to promote the city's free pre-approved ADU building plans that we created utilizing money from the state. This year's initiatives include what I refer to as the residential readiness code amendments that implement all the commitments we made to the state through adoption of the housing element as well as priorities from this council. All of them are intended to streamline permitting and also promote housing production. Also per council's direction the city will pursue the pro-housing designation from the California Department of Housing and Community Development, which I believe will support the grant funding for housing and capital projects. We will move on to the housing division. Funded by non-general fund sources, housing has three positions and a total budget request of approximately $550,000. Affordable housing is the primary focus of this division. The city receives funding from HUD and coordinates with affordable housing developers to implement goals identified in the city's housing element as well as within the approved HUD consolidated plan. You are still on housing division. I was going to mention I recall a couple of discussions about using some measure H funds to support the housing division. I think we floated like a grant writer or something that would be useful but I think it was non-specific as to what exactly it would be used for. But there is no recommendation on using any general fund dollars for the housing division? Not at this point. I think there were some discussions about revisiting the measure H money at a more appropriate time and we are sure that will be available. In addition we are having some transitions in the housing division. mention that the housing manager will be retiring this summer. We are doing an over hire right now to bring in a housing analyst and looking to promote our current housing analyst to the housing manager position so we can get some training done. Again I would like to stabilize and get the housing division up and I don' t think we will miss a beat but I want to go through that transition and then I think a good opportunity would be when the measure H money is up for council to consider maybe utilizing some for housing. I will leave that to you. Mr. Veig in your opinion are we missing any opportunities to get grant money for affordable housing because of lack of staff of grant writers? It' s a hard black and white yes and no. No I don' t think that we' re leaving anything on the table right now but sure with more resources there' e more opportunity to try to pull together more options. So maybe. Okay and I believe we did. Does any history history history history history history history history history history particular part of the funding to come up during the budget discussions. It' s something we' ll definitely need to do as we move through this. I want to highlight last year and again a big accomplishment was getting the housing element over the finish line the council adopted it state deemed to complete so I appreciate all your hard work on that and us coming back to you. Meanwhile affordable housing production continues at a clip that we' ve seen in the past. Both city funded projects for a total of 160 units were completed at the north creek crossings of merriam park. 38 more units at the foundation or 1297 park will be coming on later this month. Three additional city funded projects utilizing cdbg disaster recovery funds made available due to the camp fire are now under construction. When complete by the end of 2025 there will be an additional 183 units of affordable housing. Also additional money for cdbg disaster and disaster tax credits allocated to projects from brief county in chico that will be another 462 units. Sorry for all that math but let' s get to the fact that approximately 1400 new affordable units within the span of five years. I want to highlight this because it' s unprecedented it reflects the availability of state and federal money but also incredible hard work and dedication from your housing division. Finally there was a precursor acknowledgement of a new fund for the project is under permanent local housing allocation. Staff will continue to apply for those funds and they have been being used to support emergency shelter operations. I see those numbers and they' re huge to me but without some frame of reference it' s hard to know how spectacular they really are. There' e nothing to compare it to. There' e other cities. I think if we get at least.! Not now it doesn' t have to be during the budget but at some point. Something we' re very proud of and we' d love to share. I' d love to know how many marysville is pushing through yuba city so we can see how much better we' re doing than our neighbors. A lot of it comes from unfortunately the disasters experienced in this region but it' s gone a long way towards helping us help meet some of our arena goals for this housing development cycle. G.I.'! I' supported by a number of enterprise funds with some general fund support two positions approximately $375,000 request. G.I. S supports every city department whether it' s staff answering questions from the public or field crews maintaining city facilities or updating 911 dispatch information for police and fire. G.I. S also provides critical information for chico unified calwater pg e and others for their master planning purposes. Last year G.I. S requested funding for a new central portal to house our city' city to put these G.I. S up in the cloud in order to lower renewal costs increase user accounts enhance use for field staff and control updates and ensure uninterrupted service. That transition is complete and now work is underway to train staff and the community on how best to utilize this enhanced functionality. Again I want to thank you guys because it made a big difference and it' s a very successful capital project. On the building department or division it' s entirely funded by private development. 16 positions and a total budget of $1,000. request of $3.3 million. As you know construction activity in our community is vital to economic development as well as housing production. Ultimately the building division is responsible for ensuring the safety of the community through ensuring compliance with california building code. I will share right now that one of my biggest challenges as a director has been filling vacant building positions with qualified and experienced staff we' re of course competing head to head against other jurisdictions as well as consultants that often pay more but I want to give a special shout out to the board of the city of chicago. We have successfully filled all positions in the building division with incredibly talented and competent individuals and there' s a changed culture and honestly people now want to work at the city of chicago building division. We really turned the corner and it' s exciting. The building continues to see steady growth in both residential and commercial development. Last year 145 single family, 46 multifamily and 41 accessory dwelling units totaling $5 million. We have a total of 652 new units and I' ll just say a similar pace continues this year and I think my message is that there' s a lot of building going on and the city of chicago is clearly open for business. In addition to keeping the trains running on time this year the building division is leading a comprehensive update of the city' s online permitting system to enhance both internal and external use. We' re going to be finalizing the user fee study update that will require us to come into council for adopting new fees for again applications and things of that nature. And we' And then three they' re investigating an expedited over the counter plan review process for smaller projects. For code enforcement primarily funded by the general fund has five positions requesting $800,000. Approximately code enforcement plays an important role as you all know in maintaining and improving the community' s well-being by responding to resident concerns and addressing complaints before they fester into larger issues. I' d like to just quickly share some impressive code enforcement stats. In 2023 there were 340 code cases opened. 98% were closed voluntarily. That incredible volume was accomplished with three code enforcement officers and one supervisor and doesn' t acknowledge the incredible annual benefit of the programs they also oversee including weed abatement and drop and dash. Also last year code enforcement abated over 340 abandoned vehicles. And as you also know 2023 and continuing this year code has been highly involved in the active role of citywide and camping cleanups in the city' s open space. And also this year you' ve seen Charlene here a couple times but I want to just highlight again thoughtfully implementing council' s recently adopted shopping cart retrieval ordinance and I mention that because I think we' re all seeing the benefits of that effort throughout the community. To conclude with regard to new staffing requests for the upcoming fiscal year CDD' s only requesting I say only but promoting an administrative an existing administrative assistant to an administrative specialist for building properties and building The second is promoting an existing office assistant to an administrative assistant both of those are intended for personnel retention which is a clear priority for community development. And also for building adding one new inspector position but the building division currently utilizes four employed inspectors and one contracted inspector. This effort would bring that position in house allow for cross training and help for things like plan review when times are slow for inspections. So that' s my conclusion of my presentation. Thank you. All right questions? Mr. Ritt. So we had a conversation just recently and my thought I remember the conversation we had about this possibly using some measure H for affordable housing support and enhance affordable housing. But with the complications we' ve seen with H it' s my intention at this time if it does happen that that we can do is that depending on what happens is to request agendizing further conversation about this in January or February so we can take a good look at it then. Thank you. Mr. Ritt what was the city' s inventory of affordable housing units in say 2000 or 2019 before this latest surge of building? Is 1800 a reasonable number? I think it' s I believe it' s more than that but I feel like I' ve done that due diligence and I don' t have that right up my fingertips. I remember 1800 but your memory is probably better than mine. So I mean it' s not inaccurate to say that the city has almost doubled the inventory of affordable housing in the last four or five years. If that 1800 number is accurate yeah. I also say though we' ve had often four or five years where we' re just looking at one affordable project. Right. And here we' re looking at a lot of what I think is most impressive is it' s happening all over town. Well done. Thank you. All right further questions? thank you. what do you mean? Vice mayor and council members? don' t have time for I will try to vary from my reputation though and deliver the quickest presentation tonight. strategic goals they' re pretty similar and are in the budget for reference so I' ll just land on a couple of these initiatives. First one with ten divisions there' s a handful of slides but I won' t land on all of them so due to the time constraint but did want to talk briefly about the wastewater treatment plant we' re looking to the third one down looking to finalize our sst. sst. sst. sst. history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history I think we will continue with those initiatives parks similar initiatives all in the budget. I do want to land on this one in particular the last initiative maneuver from reactive calls for service to proactive urban forest management in this budget allows us to do that as you' ll see in a future slide with addition of a third tree crew we' re very excited for this proposed budget. Mr. Gustafson I will go back to the last slide parks I noticed there' s a significant increase in spending and I believe it' s focused on bidwell park and which needs a lot of help can you just briefly tell us what that additional spending is going to go to? there' s a handful of smaller capital projects that support these initiatives but mainly a new staff person and a new maintenance worker in the park so we' re excited for that. are there any other additional dollars for tree maintenance that' s one of the things I' m concerned about? yes tree staff as well that will land on in a future slide along with the equipment to support the new staffing that' s being added. thank you. traffic safety division will continue our retro reflectivity efforts there. underground division that' s our sewer underground division that cleans our sanitary sewer system and our storm drain system we want to continue to clean at least 75% of the sanitary sewer system and we want to continue to do that. we have a high pressure nozzle that cleans 75% of the 300 miles of underground sewer pipe on an annual basis. we will continue those efforts. fleet services division about 10 years ago 10 or 15 years ago we had a heavy lift as far as regulation from the california air resources board. we had five different regulations that were under and we met all of those requirements over the last 15 years but now we have a current and a second round of heavy lift from electric power to the power station to the electrification and hydrogen as well. a lot of efforts on the fleet division to develop a plan to accommodate the electric infrastructure to meet those regulations and likely hydrogen for our medium and heavier duty trucks that' s probably coming in the future. i want to highlight this real quickly and spring off of some of my colleagues comments too with chief aldridge' s pd facility strategic plan and we' re going to partner on this and we' re looking forward to it too and his will be a very granular large chapter in this but we' re looking for a higher level two strategic plan for public safety and basically all facilities and we have a lot of age facilities that we' re trying to maintain remodeling some and when we talk about building a new police station building a new fire station looking at fire station two that is 60 years old do we try to remodel that or do we have to raise it completely and build new so we' re looking for that long term strategic plan that will help act as a guide map for those efforts and make sure we' re meeting needs decades in advance the most financially sound way possible. airport division two that fourth item down i want to continue to work with our community stakeholders to establish a well funded revenue guarantee fund i will say our goal is 1.5 million and as you know we' re currently working with our re currently sitting at 1.2 million in discussions and agreements for another 300,000 we' re very close to meeting our original goal of 1.5 million things are moving pretty quickly there and excited to continue those efforts in this fiscal year. I' m going to stop you of course my favorite topic. As everybody knows so what do we need more in our revenue guarantee fund that we don' t have as of yet? 1.5 was our original goal and that we established that several years ago and that' s a pretty robust goal and positions us well to be competitive with other municipalities that are looking to entice airlines into new markets. If we had 2 million it would really position us even better and it would be a lot more competitive. I saw our friends and neighbors up in reading are trying to bring new service to go east to salt lake or denver and their goal is a 2 million dollar revenue guarantee fund. I' m happy with 1.5 we' re meeting our original goal but the more funds we have in there the better we' re positioned and more competitive we' re moving forward. you will need some funds to build a tsa facility or at least start making efforts towards that? that' s a great point once we get into some negotiating discussions with the airline which we hope is sometime soon. There' e some immediate needs as far as the terminal improvements, housing, the tsa providing fire fighting services to the airport during those flights. There will be some other costs that will come in that we' ll need to tackle at that point. I' ll hold that off for discussion point. our outreach engagement efforts will continue to maintain our parks, greenways and open spaces as we all know that' s a bit of a challenge right now but we' re trying to get re chipping away at it one bite at a time one day at a time and we' looking to continue those improvements specifically at the alternate site too in the coming months. That' s our mission to maintain safe reliable modern infrastructure and services for the greater chico community. Multiple funding sources, total operating budget requested 31 million, total personnel costs just over 13 million. The number of full-time staffing positions that we have are 103. thank you. questions? Mr. Brennan. I' ve had a conversation with chief standridge, the city manager and a conversation with you about my concerns as well as my constituents concerns about lindow channel and the fire danger. I' m going to be requesting consideration and discussion by council to add an additional $200,000 to your budget so that we can get down into the channel and do some performance on fire reduction activity. I know the goats are coming back three times. Once this year then two more next year. I think we really need to take a good look at that possible problem if something starts. I don' t want to wait until it starts. I' d like to do something proactively. I' m going to be requesting some conversation about that. Thank you. thank you. thank you. along those lines Mr. gufson my constituents have a lot of concerns about the potholes in their district as do I. I know it' s always a challenge to keep those filled. I know during the winter it' s almost impossible. I know some of those roads are in really bad shape. Alligator cracking is hard to cover with potholes repair. Is that something where you need to be allocated some more staff? I think as you' ll see here as we go further in the next few slides we have a pretty decent staffing recommendation here with eight new permanent positions which will help all of those efforts. I' m very pleased with this budget that' s being recommended to move forward. I' m pleased with city manager sorenson' s leadership on it and council' s support. We' re sitting in a really good position going into this next fiscal year. I thought you were at the end of your slides. I' m looking. I' m like, oh, what they say is right. I' m going to be quick. Again, what' s new, it has a lot to do with staffing for us. It' s a 10.5% total increase in operating budget compared to last year and that' s staffing. A lot of materials and supplies too. You' ll see a lot of our operating budgets have a pretty fair share of materials and supplies costs that have gone up just really pretty dramatically in the last couple of years due to inflation. We' re battling that. Eight new permanent positions, a dedicated third tree crew which I' m really excited about. Two new fire engines that was mentioned by chief standards a little earlier. That' s a big purchase. We' re looking forward to those as well. Then a handful of smaller capital items that will help us achieve our initiatives and objectives. Here' s the, we actually have 12 divisions in public works operations and maintenance. We operate on a daily basis out of the bottom 10 that you could see there. We do charge time here and there to division 110 environmental services and then public works administration. This is the big stuff for us. The new staffing positions as we talk about all of our remodel efforts and supporting age facilities we manage over 400,000 square feet of facilities. That' s city hall, the municipal services center, all fire stations, the police station, the animal shelter, so on and so forth. There' s a lot of square footage that facilities is tasked with. Now that we' re embarking on a lot of remodels as those facilities age, some new buildings, new construction, we really need a project manager to manage all of those efforts. Right now our facilities manager is zigzagging back and forth, running with his head cut off on a daily basis, trying to manage a lot of projects that we currently have open right now, manage operations, and it leaves very, very little time to be strategic and manage things long term. We' re requesting a project manager for facilities. Two senior maintenance workers in our divisions, the first one being in the tree division, which will be kind of the leader of that third tree crew, and the second one being in right of way, which will help with potholes. We' re going to focus on graffiti eradication, some downtown efforts, some things where we' ve really seen things, maintenance demands increase, and we' re looking forward to adding that position to really help combat that recent increase. And then five maintenance workers. So two of them are in the tree division, so a crew for us in the tree division is one senior maintenance worker and two maintenance workers, so a crew of three. So we' re adding one full crew and one senior maintenance worker and two maintenance workers. So very excited about that. A new maintenance worker in the parks division to help with our parks efforts. And then in our landscape division, we do a lot of we have a lot of square footage that we maintain in landscape as well. We' ve had two maintenance aid hourlies over the last five or six years. We' ve seen a lot of turnover in those positions. It' s very hard to keep those positions filled. They' re kind of an entry level position, which has been great in some aspects because good staff members that perform well can maneuver into permanent positions, but it leaves that landscape division always battling with turnover and training and so on and so forth. So we' re looking to make two of those existing maintenance aid hourlies into full-time maintenance workers. And a little bit of capital projects too, peppered in there with a handful of projects going on out at the airport. We' ve had a lot of new equipment, two new fire engines. That' s a big purchase for us and that' s the color scheme I think that was referenced earlier. That' s our newest engine, engine six. And that' s the new kind of charcoal gray color over red. New parks truck for the maintenance worker to operate out of. And then when you add a new tree crew, you also have to have an equipment augment to support it. So that' s some pretty high cost equipment as far as chip trucks and chippers and so on and so forth. So it' s adding some of that new equipment needed to support that third tree crew. 411 main city hall is a roof replacement. That' s something we' ve been battling for many years now. It' s an old roof. It' s had a lot of additional items placed on top as far as communications infrastructure and things like that. I want to thank the clerk' s office for I' m sensitive to what they' ve had to go through through the recent rainy season with multiple ceiling tiles removed and trash cans and pots and pans placed here and there just to capture the water that was coming in. So really looking forward to that project and igniting it right away. The 411 main remodel that' s an ongoing project. And then all of our fire panels and all of our facilities are due for replacement too. So that' s a pretty large undertaking to get all of our fire alarm panels replaced. And then of course some items out at the wastewater treatment plant. Some wireless control units and our generators. We have a handful of generators out there and replacing all the transfer switch gear for those. Another pothole component to Merrick Coolidge. We recently took delivery of this machine. It' s a new grinder. We have a smaller grinder now and we' re upgrading to this particular one. It' s a pretty large piece of equipment for us. Our existing grinder would only grind about 2 feet and this one will do a little over 4. So we' re really looking at some significant efficiencies that we' ve gained here. Really doubling our capacity to bolster our pavement management efforts moving forward. So that' s something we' re very thrilled to get out on the right of way this summer and work. It wouldn' t be a Pueblo Works O&M presentation without at least touching on Genesis and the pilot shelter. As you know we recently gave a presentation celebrating our two year anniversary. But putting these two units into place now I know we expend a lot of funds out there. I think when we propped up the pilot shelter we did everything we could to get it online very quickly. We entered into contracts quickly to meet the settlement agreement requirements. Now that we' ve got our feet on the ground and we' re operating that facility very smoothly with our partners, our operations partner at the Jesus Center, we' re looking at every way possible to save operating dollars. We' re implementing these two sanitation units. One' s pictured on the left there. That' s a restroom and shower combo unit. There' s four of those out there. We' re expanding the laundry trailer that' s pictured on the right out there this week. Currently we have about $430,000 budgeted annually to support those two requirements of the settlement agreement providing showers and laundry service for each occupant once per week. We' re now going to be insourcing those functions with the Jesus Center staff, operating staff there. We think we' re going to save between 40% and 50% on those functions alone. It' s just a constant initiative to save operating dollars that could be used for other items that we' re going to be using. We' re going to be using those What is the project name for the funding out of the Genesis Pallet Shelter? I' was trying to find it. There' s a homeless resting site fund. There' s a homeless alternative site. It' s fund 052. It' s not under itemized requests. Fund 052. I did want to Fund 052. 688 is the operating budget. Fund 052. I did want to see if we can discuss a few really modest things out there. I like to look at small incremental cheap improvements that can carry a long way. I had a recent conversation with Amber Bass about some things that could be useful. One of them that came to my mind that' s really cost saving in the long term is the entry. Once you enter the site, it' s gravel. You have things like service vehicles to go out there, which leads to sinking of that. We won' t adopt a gravel alley if it' s a small project, like a few houses around that. The city won' t adopt that, but we have it out there with 177 units. That requires ongoing maintenance and just paving that. It could be a really modest expense that could save money in the long term. I also see that as something we can do just to symbolize a commitment to operating this in the long run in some fashion. Similar with that is we' ve had talks about the lack of shade out there in trees. I believe there' s some kind of modest attempt to bring some, like donate some potted trees or something out there. I can comment on both of those items. Yeah, would you please? Paving, we did pave the driveway last summer. That' s really due to high maintenance demands. The driveway in that area was the one section that wasn' t lime treated. That' s the entrance once you get to the parking and security. From MLK all the way to where the security check-in facility is. Pretty long stretch. We paved that area really due to maintenance demands of that aggregate based driveway. We have the dumpsters and trash facilities there are serviced daily. We have a daily process of trash trucks rolling down or into that facility. It creates a lot of wear and tear on the infrastructure there. We paved that section. We' re looking at potentially paving from that section to further that driveway to the admin building. The! The one is the one is the one is the one is the one is the history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history we have been working on trash cans we recently removed a lot of planners from downtown and trash cans we replaced the trash cans downtown we took a handful of those out to that area and working on a project to plant trees in those planners and some of the trash cans we have been able to recycle our site operators excited about it too because it' s an employment perspective from them to take care of those trees we may plant and donate some fruit trees and things like that out there that would help them as well so there' s a couple of efforts going on on both of those. I think this demonstrated psychological benefits to having greenery out there for employees and people living there and everything and I think considering putting a little bit of money to make sure we can do that well and maybe plant some trees in the community and Amber brought up when I mentioned what kind of small things could make life better for people out there and they currently just have an outdoor eating place which has a big tent which I guess handles a lot of weather and the hot and the cold requires ongoing maintenance it's another one of those things so their admin building was donated from the Jesus Center before the Jesus Center was the operator and it's just a portable like they have at a lot of schools and she said something else like that would allow them to have an indoor eating place also would have the benefit of increasing engagement among the community there which will help for people accessing case management and hopefully up the numbers of people getting into housing through there so those are the kind of things I'd like to have a little discussion about small things we can do to improve the quality of service out there. I've got them on the list. Very very close and just kind of an overview to you know since we've started we provided 600 individual assessments offering suitable shelter to those individuals those efforts will continue throughout this coming fiscal year our clean up totals that we recently presented as well so just kind of repetitive here but 612 tons in 2023 and then 2024 year to date 65 tons. And that is it so again I want to thank city manager Mark Sorensen and you council with support on this budget it's a big budget for us as far as eight positions that's a big improvement and I'm very very thankful and excited to add those positions and I'm very very grateful to the history history history thank you. s up. I was done 15 minutes ago. I was going to say you' ve got 15 minutes minus to go. I will be very quick. brendan adeboni director of public works engineering. thank you mayor vice mayor and city council members. thank you city manager and budget team for putting this together. I know there' e a tremendous amount of work that goes into it. first and foremost this is our engineering team. we' re lean and mean and we get a lot of stuff done. I want to celebrate all the hard work that a lot of people in the public don' t get to see. this truly is a great team of people and I' m so fortunate to be able to lead this group in our efforts in delivering everything. obviously they' re a quirky bunch as well. strategic goals essentially boil it all down. we plan, build and maintain our public infrastructure which essentially provides our quality of life for the chico community. we have four divisions. transportation, traffic engineering. we continue to monitor and enhance the favorite part of our downtown which is our parking meter program. that' s just about 10% of our parking meter. 50% of one person's in our departments time. and continue to oversee our traffic operations and striping projects as well as a lot of our bike facilities through this division. development engineering. we coordinate through the building planning department or divisions to provide engineering services in the reviews and approvals of any development applications. our sewer and storm drain engineering division. we oversee and enhance the � the city' s ms4 permit compliance with the state and then we accept sewer connection applications process those and oversee the long-term planning and implementation and construction of our sewer network. Two big master plans hopefully coming to fruition we had a couple of delays added some scope of work to our consultant team so we anticipate in the next few months coming forward for adoption of those master plan documents. Then capital projects is the meat and potatoes of what we do. We had a record setting year this year it follies on the fiscal year so we consider it a construction season. 2024 celebrating our historic year of construction work there $60 million in construction contracts so we hire local contractors that $60 million is just the construction contracts that we have to construction contracts that we have to implement. We have does not include staff time consultant contracts for construction inspection construction management design work all that kind of stuff. Tremendous amount of work to make that happen again that group that you saw earlier in the presentation. Funding sources I'm not going to read the mission at this point. But our funding sources are kind of all encompassing we use some general fund obviously measure h has been a significant investment in fixing our roads but we also heavily rely on a lot of a special revenue funds enterprise funds development impact fees grant funds those types of things. And so we are building a strong team up to 38 approved positions recommended positions with this budget. How is your maybe you're getting into actually I think it's the next thing never mind. Yeah challenges staffing so just I just celebrated my one year back at the time we had 13 vacancies and we since. Gotten that down to 4 positions those are manager level positions so one of the challenges is the support the deputy director Dave John co and myself. Having to fill a lot of those roles with our staff we've got a little bit of a younger team so to so trying to train them mentor and get them up to par and speed on our standards. 86 capital projects active and in the 5 year CIP 175 million dollars for context that is huge for agency of our side size and the staff of 38 people. One of the highlights. Again measure h is is a high big focus and essentially going from a couple years ago 3 million dollars per year to fix roads and do a project. with the project to close to 18 million dollars. It's not one of those things that there's a huge economy of scale it literally is almost 6 times the work so utility conflicts drainage issues. A D a issues all those upgrades that come with the project project when you. Multiply by 6 the amount of funding we're doing 6 times the work essentially so. Just a lot more challenges associated with that and recognition of staffing challenges in order to deliver this type of historic effort. We also heavily rely on consultants so we've adopted a non call consultant list of 5 design consultants and we're incrementally adding task orders for each of the years. 10 of the 10 years CIP for measure H projects assigning different consultants and in house staff to get that massive workload done. I'm. As part of measure H one thing we also still try and do is leverage that local funding source when I'm just going to take the easy road and. Pun intended I guess. And utilize that local funding source we still try and leverage that to go after state federal grant funds and maximize the amount of money we can bring into our community. And so it provides a great opportunity as well for that leveraging opportunity. And then just going to touch on some key projects we've talked about that $60 million in construction so the Bruce road widening project we just kicked off last month. That's going to be about an 18 month long project and so we anticipate completion of that project in the fall of 2025. Again the largest construction project we've ever done in our city's history 2 miles of road from highway 32 down to skyway putting in 4 lanes of concrete paving dedicated bike path bike lanes and landscape center median and lighting. So kind of all encompassing 2 mile stretch of road there. The esplanade safety and accessibility project just kicked off this month as well. And so that will be constructing that class 4 bike lane up the esplanade from memorial way up to 11th avenue as well as constructing a roundabout there in front of chico junior high at oleander and memorial way. The project also includes a traffic signal at first avenue and oleander. We anticipate completing that I appreciate that project being completed likely in early 2025. a quick question on that I hate to even preach it when we originally discussed this item at council it had bike lights at each of the intersections is that still going to be? it had lights for the bikes. lights? yes that is still the intention to have dedicated. traffic lights for the bikes? it won't necessarily be dedicated but it will be tied in with the signal system. because you have them going both directions? yes. perfect. then another significant project is our bike lane 99 phase 5 pedestrian overcrossing so we started that project last month as well. that will be about a year and a half long project. you can see the columns for the approach structure is being built right now they are starting the false work construction on the approach. the bridge structure itself is in fabrication. two pieces one in the l.a. area and one up in the state of washington. hopefully that comes to fruition this fall and that will get set in place. then we will be finishing off all the other components of the project. I have a quick question for you. yes. recently someone approached me unhappy about the expense for the bike bridge. as I understand most of that money is grant money isn' t it? is it active transportation plan money? yes. we were awarded one of the largest rural community grants through the active transportation program several years ago. what we did was leverage some transportation funds our fund 212 which is the tda funds which are focused on transit and bike and ped type of projects. then we also were able to address some of the which is to obtain approximately $5 million from c mac dollars which is congestion mitigation and air quality funds through b cag. those are federal funds. in terms of the total project costs, it' s very minimal local funds and of the local funds we did use those were restricted to bicycle and pedestrian type of funding.! thank you. absolutely. so tell them no. that was a long way to say no. moving on. 2024 road rehab project we have awarded to knife river construction. we are currently working with pg e to finalize lowering of the gas lines in rio lindo. that work is active right now. we anticipate that being done at the end of july. so knife river construction can start our project in july. so it's all of rio lindo from esplanade over to cohasset road. and then also notre dame boulevard from east 20th street down to forest avenue. your picture of rio lindo is like the best part of rio lindo. i feel like you could have picked anywhere else that looks worse. more in need of work. stock photo is what we had. that's the worst. that's the worst. the best of the worst. and for knowledge i guess the treatment what measure h affords us to do is not just skin the top of the asphalt and put new asphalt down which still tends to have cracks beneath the surface and then eventually propagates up so you don't get the longest life expectancy out of that roadway. with the measure h monies we're able to actually treat the subgrade so it's going to last 30 plus years and we're able to actually do that type of effort so either thing history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history construction of the 25 road rehab that will include Peterson memorial drive through the park as well as Bruce road north of highway 32 from highway 32 up to chico canyon road. I didn' t want to go through and do a slide for each one and get pictures and all that so we want to go through and get a little bit of a list of projects that are going on for communication through this budget. We have three bridge projects going to construction next year. Notre Dame over little chico creek that' s a completely new bridge through merriam park which will tie in merriam park as well as marsh junior high back there. Salem street and Pomona avenue are bridge replacement projects we have grant funding for through the highway bridge park. We have the upper park road treatment that' s into the park from essentially the roundabout up for the existing pavement portion. Then we have the 2024 pavement preservation that' s a slurry seal and then the 2025 pavement preservation project that will include California park and the oh my gosh I' m not sure what that's s in the budget description. Then eaton floral roundabout finally hopefully get that to construction. We' re still working through some final right of way acquisitions so we hope to finalize that this calendar year and be able to get into construction next year on that project. The P18 trunk line we anticipate on starting phase one next year. It' ll go from history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history the state budget shortfall. We will continue on design and see how that grant falls in order to try to construct that next year. Finally the commerce court connection there to that business park down there with myers being the only point of ingress and egress this will add a second ingress and egress to that business park area. thank you. thank you. I just got one quick one. Eaton floral roundabout we are working on but you can barely drive down floral between manzanita and east avenue. We are doing a roundabout where I have been to that four way stop sign and you hardly have another person there but floral itself is a mess. Which I know is all over the city. part of the funding for that project is development impact and it' s a s restricted to that intersection improvement so different from being able to use that for a maintenance type of project. we talked about some roads a thought about closing peterson memorial to traffic. we have that coming up at a future council. never mind thank you. it should change much of the design in terms of the project we have striping things with council direction we can implement that quickly. probably wouldn' t change the cost is where you were going. that as well. okay. all right. now we have to take public comment. I know we don' t have any. yes because I don' t see anybody in the audience. yes. want to comment now? all right. okay. the best way to do this I think and it' s what we talked about is any particular items we want to discuss at a later date keeping in mind that if we discuss them now it' s obviously going to take some time so we' d probably have to set an alternative date which we' ve done in the past and brought it forward to have a secondary council meeting next week so we can go through some of these items because we' re going to have the final it whatever the date is in june. the first tuesday. we need to do it prior to that because you don' t want us doing it at that meeting correct? it would be cleaner if we knew of any potential changes so that we can bring back a final document. right at the second meeting in june or that you want to bring the we have a very short agenda and if there' s any further discussion on the budget why don' t we do it in regular session? the problem would be is that if in fact we outline these and we say we want to discuss like I' d like to talk about pd positions I don' t think they' re going to bust out the calculator and make the decision is what my concern is. we can move closed session we need a break in between so we have the discussion now and move what' s unresolved and closed session to the end of the regular session. I guess my concern is that each of these items like some of the items that addison brought up as well some that council member bennett brought up staff would have to probably go and look at them and come back to us. so I' d think we' re going to do it this meeting. and somehow we didn' t see that coming? we always see that coming. you' re talking about scheduling a special meeting. usually we have two budget sessions regardless. why didn' t we schedule two budget sessions? I' m obviously annoyed. I understand that that was not my choice that' s what council decided to do which I wasn' I would have liked to get it done in a day. but it never happens. you have changes. I agree with you entirely. is everybody okay with that? it is what it is. it' s a holiday week so good luck getting everybody here. yeah. we won' t do it on monday. get everybody we can. all right. I heard some of these brought up and some of them were ones I brought up. pension policy, pd positions, measure h, firearms, revenue guarantee fund, lindo channel fire danger, pallet sheltering, paving trees and possible second portable. does anyone have anything beyond that? they want to discuss specifically at the next meeting? I don' t anticipate the next meeting because I don' we' re going to have a I think we' d probably bust through. the police chief already got back to me on the firearms or staff crystal did on the cost breakdown of the firearms so I' m good with it. we can remove firearms. okay. so. and one other alternative is we could have that discussion that you' re describing on june 4 and then we bring back the final on june 4. I think we' d better have a more wiggle room than that. that' s up to you all. I just wanted to put that out there as another option. what' s your preference? you said we could do june 4 and bring it back on the 18th and we' re still in. then just do that. unless that' s really pushing it out for you. if we had to do an additional meeting we' d have to do it in between those two and we' ll the meeting is expected to be very short. I know but I' ve been saying I think at that particular meeting since you have the list you can bring back at least some options. okay. I think we' ve got no room to move on 12 additional officers but we might have room to move on two but you' re going to have to trade off obviously there' re trade offs but there' s also one of the goals of this painful exercise is to not create a situation where if measure h goes away we' re trying to keep the pain threshold low. yeah makes sense. I think we agree with you on that. so I' d like to make a request. you want to do it on the fourth? my request is that anybody that' s asking for allocations to go to something else also have an idea where that money should come from where do they want to take it from? I think that' s reasonable. I don' t know that will stand but I think that' s a lot harder than saying I' d like to take money from the police department and give it to the tree or from the tree to the airport it' s easy to say I' d like to do this and this and then we put the owners on staff who is paid well to give us their best idea of what the budget should be. I would agree with you. so for us to override that is not generally a good idea. there is one small bucket that as barbara martin mentioned we are expecting after legal expenses roughly 2 million from the fire victims trust in the next two to four weeks. so that' s another one that we didn' t include in this budget just because our attitude is if we don' t have our hands on it then we don' t have a good budget. all right. Madam clerk would you need that as a motion or can we just say those items will come back and we will have some more discussion about it? council members could probably forward any suggestions they have if they wanted to city staff to have discussion points but I think if we handle it in the june fourth meeting or whatever what' s the first june meeting is it the fourth? okay. sounds good to me. is everybody good with that? because you guys just need direction correct? okay. all right. so with that we will adjourn until we come back for closed session in 23 minutes. any further history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. See you at 6. All right. Welcome, everybody. Good evening. Welcome to the city of california. Thank you. Thank you. It' s nice to us. We' ve been here since 1 o'clock doing budget. We' re technically reconvening our meeting. I will start with the speaker card announcement. Anybody wishing to address the council on any matter listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card. That can be found in the back of the chamber. They' re on the table back there. Turn them in to my left to your right over here to the city clerk. Speakers are taken in the order they' We' everyone to come forward. We ask that we don' t applaud in the chamber. We don' t boo in the chamber. We just sit and listen to folks so nobody feels like they can' t express their opinion. We will start with an invocation from pastor gabe rule of the north valley bath district. All right. I guess not. All right. I haven' t had that happen. All right. We' ll move on to the pledge of allegiance. Will you please stand and join me in the pledge. Salute. Pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all history thank you. we have a proclamation for city of chico travel and tourism month are we presenting that? we are. hi how are you guys? nice to meet you guys thanks for being here it's the city of chico travel and tourism month in 2016 the california legislature declared may as california tourism month to celebrate the positive economic impact of tourism in california the travel industry continues to be a critical part of chico city of chico's economy development and workforce serving as one of the largest private sector employers in california whereas a robust travel industry provides significant economic benefits for the entire state generating over 12.7 billion dollars in tax revenue in 2023 alone to support essential public services and programs that benefit all californians and whereas travel enables success for all industries including manufacturing agriculture and healthcare by driving sales growth innovation education operations moving our economy forward economy in Butte County, Florida, the city of Chico, represents 76% of the total visitor spending in Butte County, generating an estimated $4.46 million in transit occupancy tax from overnight stays in 2023. Whereas Butte County's travel industry cannot be competitive without maximizing growth and leisure, business, and domestic inbound travelers, increasing travel to and within California, dragging our economy to a more prosperous future and connecting our communities. Therefore, it would be a resolve that I, Andrew Coolidge, Mayor of the City of Chico, on behalf of the City Council, do hereby proclaim the month of May 2024 as Travel and Tourism Month in the City of Chico. I urge residents to join me in recognizing the critical role this industry plays in the city. And I will let you guys see the video. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. We're really excited about this. We represent Expo View County and Travel Chico, both non-profits in the area that are trying to promote and make sure that View County and Chico are on the map in the tourism field. It's such an amazing place to live and visit. Just to kind of mirror what Elena said, we represent Expo View County. We love representing this area as a travel and tourism destination, and we're excited to see what the future holds. So thank you, Mayor. All right. Thank you so much for all the work you guys did. Mayor, before you move on to the consent, I think we need to also report out on the closed session. Yeah. I saw that wasn't on there. Why don't we go ahead and do that? Yeah. Thank you, Mayor.

We have Eric Nielsen, followed by Susan Tichuti. Good evening. Smart Growth Advocates submitted a letter to the council. It's on May 4th. That's one of three signatories to the letter. The others being Susan Tichuti and Elizabeth Devereaux. I am here to read the letter into the public record. Dear councillors, recently, Chico voters soundly debated measures O and P by 63 and 62 percent respectively, sending a clear message that Chico residents do not want the Valley's Edge development, particularly in the proposed location. Every district voted decidedly against it. This moment creates an opportunity to revision the present. And future of our town. Chico citizens voted against Valley's Edge for very compelling reasons. Concerns about increased tariff congestion and air pollution, protection of critical habitat and need for a buffer from wildfire. The maintenance of required infrastructure for the development would only benefit a small number of city residents, though substantial and continued financial burden would rest on all citizens with our city revenues already struggling to keep pace. Curiously, and perhaps most importantly, by voting against Valley's Edge, we are going to be able to have a better future for all of our community. The Valley's Edge development will have a close relationship with the community. The Valley's Edge community have not just communicated what they don't want, but what they do want. And what they do want is smart growth. That is growth that creatively increases our local housing while at the same time protecting our local foothills, our air quality and our water basis. They envision a strong and resilient Chico. Chico will continue to grow, predicted to be around 1% per year. With the exception of one councillor, the council voted to approve the Valley's Edge development, but that was before the referendum. and an almost supermajority vote of the citizen rejecting that approval. As our city government leaders, how will you respond to the need for the type of growth that aligns with almost two-thirds of the electorate? Initially, these questions come to mind. What policies can the city implement or improve upon to promote development on the city's already identified opportunity sites as well as infill? How can the city revise the general plan to enhance smart growth? What private-public partnerships can the city pursue and help provide incentives for more affordable housing? What actions does the city plan to take to meet its climate action goals and how can smart growth help to achieve them? What plans does the city have related to housing that will help Chico be more resilient in the coming years of climate uncertainty? As representatives of those coordinating the opposition to the values of development, smart growth advocates would like to engage with you to seek a solution to the problem. We have a unique opportunity to envision the present and future of our town. Sincerely, representatives of smart growth advocates. We have had responses from Councilors Van Overbeck and Winslow, and we value the conversation. We would like to encourage all Councilors to engage with us on this critical issue. Thank you. Thank you. Susan Tuchy, thank you. Thank you, Judy. Followed by Elizabeth Devereaux. I think that the referendum provides a unique opportunity for us to create a vision, for us to have a vision. I went to the Planning Commission meeting Thursday, last Thursday, and one of the things that Brendan Beek said to me that was very important to me was that we need to have a That was really important and a way that we could think about going forward. With the property that was the Chicope Nut Company, the possibility of development there that's creative and interesting, that's mixed use, that provides infill and density in the ways that smart growth advocates have been talking about. The thing that Brendan said that really impressed me was we have an opportunity to plan. It seems like we have a lot of time. It seems like a lot of things that come to the Council come, I don't know how much the staff and the Council knows about it, how far in advance they know, but things come, they're approved or they're not approved, mostly approved. They come, they're approved. But this project, and I see the potential for this with other projects, gives Chico the time to plan. And so the Planning Commission and the Planning Department and the City Council can create a vision, have a vision, think about a vision, and work on the things that can help us move forward with that vision, rather than just convulsing from project to project. Thank you. Thank you. Elizabeth Devereaux, followed by Jacqueline Chase. Good evening. I'd like to thank you for hearing us. And we are, we are very grateful to you for your time. We are, there's a larger group of Smart Growth advocates in the audience right now, supporting the letter that has been written. And we have been meeting with Councilmen Van Overbeck and Winslow, and it's been a really gratifying conversation because, in a sense, we, we reach to the same vision, I think, of what we want Chico to become. I feel like we're at a crossroads right now. And there's a revitalization which is really necessary in downtown, as well as underutilized areas like Park Avenue and possibly Mangrove, but certainly Kmart. And the project that Susan just mentioned, the Chico Nut, is definitely an opportunity for us to explore that. And I think what we would like to see is mixed-use housing with commercial on the bottom and walkability, wide sidewalks and tree canopies, and public transit, maybe even small electric buses. I think that what we would like now is to find a project that we could engage with you on, to see if there's ways of exploring projects that, I mean, I just was in San Luis Obispo last week, and they, a lot of people compare Chico to San Luis Obispo. And they've done a beautiful thing with their downtown. And I feel like that's happened in the last 20 years when we've been watching them and watching ourselves grow. And we can use many other cities as models for what we want, but we have to have a really beautiful model to start with. So what we're asking right now is if you would be willing to engage with us to create the kind of revitalization we'd like to see. And we're not going to be doing that in downtown and nearby underutilized areas. So thank you very much. Thank you. Jacqueline Chase, followed by Marty Dunlap. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for your attention to this matter. During the referendum, we heard many Valley's Edge supporters saying that if we don't approve the Valley's Edge specific plan, that piecemeal growth will happen. And it kind of reminded me of an argument. Like, well, we need a new suburban mall, and let's just make one that's less bad than other ones. But I didn't think we ever would have needed a new suburban mall, just like the voters said that we didn't need the new development. What I think we need and want is the use of underutilized spaces in urban Chico to expand housing that is appropriate to the city's growth now and in the future. This growth path will, in fact, start to be a new development. It will strengthen the businesses that will be in proximity to the new housing. Chico could become known as a city, many like were just mentioned by our previous speaker, that values its open space and is willing to boldly find a new way to grow. I hope that the City of Chico, the City Council, the Chamber of Commerce, and many other stakeholders will join the voters and their support for smart growth. Thank you. Marty Dunlap, followed by Bill Lopes. Good evening. City leaders and city staff do need to be in the business of developing housing, particularly affordable housing. Housing and the manner in which Chico grows can't be left only to the vision of private parties, but needs to be embraced by the city with coordinated planning with the community. Chico has neglected building affordable housing for four out of the last six years, with only1%111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 of our future housing needs to be in the affordable category this is an opportunity for us to revision the present and the future of our town the citizens have spoken out and do want to see smart growth that is what protects our housing going into our local foothills our air quality and our water basins the importance of city leaders being involved with this is to encourage growth the compliments healthy air quality dependable groundwater and resiliency to wildfires Chico will continue to build but slowly and utilizing existing infrastructure in the locations already identified by the city excluding the values edge property but these include the opportunity sites infill sites and special planning areas that don't carry negative environmental consequences future housing developments ought to include mixed-use and affordable housing with access to public transportation and services the overriding goal is to preserve the precious and unique open spaces that we have left thank you thank you bill loker followed by Lauren Mike T hello thanks for the question history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history recharge and it's groundwater that all of us depend on for our drinking water. In addition, it was clear demonstration during the campfire that this area is a firebreak for Chico and helps protect the city against wildfire coming out of the foothills. So I would like to encourage you as city leaders to get together with county supervisors, explore options with the state of California for the permanent designation of this area as open space and a conservation area. There are also private actors, foundations, and others that would be willing to work in concert to provide reasonable compensation for the landowners in the area and protect this area for the benefit of the citizenry, nature, water. So I'd really like to hear or see action taken at the local regional level to make that happen. So thank you. Thank you. Lauren Mictree, followed by Ann Biker-Kaufman. Thank you, Council. My name is Lauren Mictree and I'm a lifelong Chico resident. I believe the vote in March on Measure O&P clearly shows that the majority of the city's residents are not interested in suburban sprawl. Instead, we're interested in investing our resources into developing opportunity sites that organizations like SmartHearth have highlighted. Countless studies have shown that suburbs are isolating, expensive to maintain, and destroy a large amount of natural land when building on the city limits. Mixed use, however, has been shown to be cost effective, house a greater number of people, and provide a stronger sense of community. We want to make sure that we're not just building on the city limits, but we're also We want our funds to go towards mixed-use housing, and we want our funds to protect our natural resources and the creatures that inhabit them. We need a substantial amount of affordable housing, and we need you to build it now. Thank you. Thank you. And our last speaker is Ann Biker-Kaufman. Hi. So I also voted against the Bell's Edge development. It was primarily bad. I was very sad for Chico because the revenue generated by a density that low would nowhere near cover the infrastructure that the city would have to maintain. So I also urge the city to start thinking in terms of being a strong town. And that involves, first of all, looking at how much tax revenue is generated per acre. And that involves, first of all, looking at how much tax revenue is generated per acre. And then to focus investment in areas that generate the most tax revenue per acre, which actually ends up being places that are mixed-use, that are denser, and often lower-income parts of town that have been neglected for a long time. I'm thinking the area south of campus, for example, where the roads are almost completely deteriorated. So investing in those areas that generate the most tax revenue per acre, and the most revenue helps enhance the property values of that area, which will then generate even more revenue and can make Chico stronger and stronger. So I support the letter by smart advocates, and I encourage you to really think about trying to make Chico a strong town. Thank you. Thank you. She was our last speaker. All right. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Appreciate that. We'll move on to item 4.1, hearing to review and approve the 2024-2025 annual action plan for use of federal community development block grant CDBG and home investment partnership home funds. And we have a report from housing program analysis, Mary Jo Alonzo. Welcome. Okay. Good evening, mayor, vice mayor, council members. This is the final public hearing of the 2425 HUD annual action plan for the city of Chico.

You'll see here on this side includes the final head allocations that were released last week. There was a minimal 4% increase in CDBG funding and a 6% decrease in home funding for a total of about $2.2 million aimed at addressing the goals outlined in the city's five-year consolidated plan and also aligned with the goals of the city's housing element. Again, I'm not going to read over these, but just as a review, the use of the home activities and then the proposed use of CDBG activities are listed. Based on the recommendations from the CDBG Citizens Advisory Committee, here's the slide for the public services funding. This does reflect the updated budget. So that is the final, those are the final numbers. Tonight's public hearing. The public hearing concludes the 30-day public review and comment period. All comments made regarding the plan will be included in the annual action plan that's submitted to HUD. And at conclusion of tonight's public hearing, the Community Development Director recommends holding a public hearing, considering any public comment, and then approving the annual action plan. That concludes my report. Do you have any questions? Questions? Thank you. Thank you. Yes, we have one. Three minutes. Okay. Anastasia Snyder. Good evening. I'm Anastasia Snyder. I'm the Executive Director at Catalyst. Just wanted to take an opportunity to thank you for your ongoing support and partnership. The funds that come through the CDBG public services support our emergency shelter program, which is critical. We're very grateful and life-saving for survivors of intimate partner violence who reside in Chico. So we just wanted an opportunity to thank you for that. Thank you for what you do. All right. So closing public hearing. Question? No? All right. Comments? You know, one thing just came to my mind because we were talking about affordable housing production in the budget session earlier. I know our views on housing are very different. U County Housing Authority Director Ed Mayer is retiring soon. And he mentioned to me that he has lots of great information. I think that you could invite him to give a presentation if you wanted to have that kind of information. Yeah. Any further comments? I would take a motion. Motion to approve. Second. I'll hold a second for Council Member Ann Overbeck. When you're ready. All right. Council Member Bennett. Yes. I was wondering if you could talk about the! Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. All right. Item 4.2, introduction of ordinance, amending portions of the Chief Municipal Code Chapter 15.36 regarding the administration of the sewer system processing and collection of sewer fees. A report from Public Works Director Owen Ann Pericuff. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council. I have the opportunity to speak tonight. As you mentioned, Mayor, this is an introduction of ordinance, amending 15.36 of the Municipal Code. For decades, the City contracted with Cal Water to perform monthly billing for sewer services. And the default for the delinquent payment was ultimately that Cal Water could shut the water off, which is a pretty strong process. And our delinquent accounts were collected. They were collected pretty rapidly with that process. As we all know, sewer isn't something that has a meter, nor can we shut on and off. So it' s a little bit more challenging. So in 2022, Cal Water notified the City that they were no longer performing those billing services for municipal partners within most of their service territory. So it wasn' t just City of Chico that they decided not to perform those services for. It was a handful of municipalities that they were performing those services for within their service territory. So we quickly initiated a procurement process, put an RFP out, and awarded a contract to Utility 360 to perform our sewer monthly billing services. Utility 360 began billing services July 1 of 2023. And then we considered code changes in 2024 for delinquent accounts. Something we didn' t realize at first, that we didn' t have any code sections that would address this. But we quickly found that there were a few delinquent accounts. And so we decided to amend the code to put a mechanism in place to collect on delinquent accounts. So the ordinance before you determines that the owner is responsible for sewer fees and gives the City authority to collect delinquent sewer fees by any of the following options. So it' s kind of like a menu, if you will, that we could choose the best option to move forward. So it adds a ton of value to the bill. So we have a 10% fee to cover administrative costs related to delinquent collections. So when an account goes delinquent, there' s a lot of admin time spent to track that account and to further in the collections process. We could annually place a fee on the county tax roll, which would collect the same time as property taxes. Gives us the option to issue a property lien if they go pretty far in delinquent status. Also gives us the option to connect with those properties that are in the delinquent process. We can also get the money back to the city owners and orchestrate a repayment plan or an agreement with the city to bring those delinquent accounts back up to standard. It also gives us the option to utilize any sort of collection agency to collect those fees and also if needed adds the option to pursue court or legal action. So with that, my recommendation is that city council introduce the following ordinance amending chapter 15.36 of the chico municipal code. And initiate public hearing process. the city manager. questions from the minister? who would make the determination which of the mechanisms to get redress on the late payment? the code amendment states the city manager or his designee. okay. typically the first thing we would do is lean the property. and usually that' s successful. all right. further questions? all right. seeing none we' ll open the public hearing. thank you. how many speakers? we have none. i recommend we close the public hearing. entertain a motion. second. motion from councilman moran bennett. and did you have a comment? no. and that includes an ordinance of the city council of the city of chico amending portions of chapter 15.36 regarding administration of the sewer system and processing and collection of sewer fees. councilmember bennett. yes. councilmember morgan. yes. councilmember van overbeck. carried 6-0 with one absence. all right. we' ll move on to the regular agenda of which there is no comment. reports and communications are provided for the council's information. no action can be taken on items under this section of the agenda unless the council agrees to include it on the subsequent agenda. thank you mayor. drafts ready to review. we have some questions as to some of the verbiage. want to get some eyes on it for some quick wordsmithing. my recommendation is a quick ad hoc committee. probably meet once. go over the drafts. and then present the result of that to council. probably first meeting in june. all right. i' m happy to share that. history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history history m going to be out of town but there' s no reason you can send me an email with a text. we have enough. why don' t we have the vice mayor? mr. martin. i thought you were going to chair it. gladly step aside and you can chair it. we will have a meeting the old switcheroo. or the vice mayor will. if you prefer. we will get out some dates and my hope is we do it in the next if not this week next week one shot and off we go. sounds good. thank you very much for the report item 6.2 council member request pursuant to ap and p 1010 history history history history going to be the majority vote of the council is needed in order for staff to agenda is Mr. Morgan. thank you that' s really slick andrew. I would like the council to consider agenda discussion on forming a committee of council members some staff select members of the public possibly lafco regarding growth and development of housing in the city. we have heard from a group today and others that shut down probably the best plan we will ever see. all parties need to know the best way to move forward to increase housing stock and affordability before no one wants to invest anything in housing in our city.
