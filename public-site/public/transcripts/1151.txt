 Will you please join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Clerk, would you please call the roll?  Sir, here.  Commissioner Cooper?  Here.  Commissioner Laffins?  Here.  Commissioner Poulin?  Here.  Commissioner Scarpa?  Here.  Commissioner Wolfe?  Here.  Vice Chair Scott?  Present.  Chair Wall?  Here.  Thank you.  Okay, speaker cards.  Anyone wishing to address the commission on any item listed on the agenda  must first complete.  A speaker card, which can be found at the back of the chamber.  Once completed, please turn the cards into Nicole.  Speakers are taking any order of the cards are received.  And once the first speaker begins their comments,  no additional cards will be accepted on that item.  And now, a presentation, Bruce, you want to introduce?  Yes.  Mr. Chair, the city clerk, Debbie Preston, has a brief presentation.  About our move to Granicus.  I believe it is.  Thank you, Chair Wall and commissioners.  It's an honor to be here.  You will notice that we have migrated to the Granicus platform.  In the past, you were using it just for streaming capabilities.  And now we've integrated your agendas and staff reports and everything into it.  The goal behind that is to make sure that we have consistency with all of our commissions.  And so, my deputy, Mr.  City Clerk, is going to be training all of our commissions to do this.  But you're the first one.  So, thank you for being our guinea pigs, maybe, for that.  I just want to talk to you a little bit about the different changes.  So, first of all, I think roll call used to be in the order you were seated.  And now it's going to be alphabetical.  It has to be because of the program.  And also, it's the main benefit of moving to this program.  Is to ensure that the public has access readily available to them for all agendas.  And so, now, when they click on current agendas, they will see the planning commission agenda.  In the past, we were just putting a PDF of just the agenda and no staff reports.  They would have to go to a different location to find the staff report.  So, we're trying to combine it and make it easier for our public to access this information.  In addition, when you do your roll call votes, I don't recall.  Do you do roll call before this?  Or, you know, in terms of voting?  Do you call their names when they vote?  Okay.  So, those will also be done in alphabetical order as well.  In addition, the speaker's names will now be entered into the system.  The item will come up.  And the speaker, the first speaker that Nicole calls, will come to the podium.  The time will begin.  And I would encourage you not to interrupt them.  The Brown Act requires that the public has a right to their voice.  Whatever the limit is that the city has set for them, and that is three minutes for standard speakers, I recognize in the hearing, you're going to always give applicants 15 minutes plus a rebuttal.  But in terms of the speakers, if you could hold your questions until they've finished, it's a little difficult to turn it on and off.  The speaker's names will be up on the screen.  They will see the red light or it will turn yellow once it gets close to two and a half minutes.  And they'll know.  They'll be able to see.  Just like at a council meeting.  One last thing.  One last component.  And I don't want to frighten anyone.  But it's actually a great benefit.  Once Nicole pushes the posting button for the Granicus, it will automatically drop into your electronic devices.  You will know exactly when that agenda gets posted.  We will be deploying the application called iLegislate.  It can be used on Windows or Apple platforms.  And so you'll be able to access it.  I'm not saying you cannot have a paper copy.  What I'm saying is that you'll be able to access it that way.  And then we'll deploy that for the next meeting.  So do you have any questions?  I just really appreciate this.  And I appreciate all that you do and the city does.  And we're just trying to streamline, develop efficiencies, and make it easier for you to get your information as well as for the public.  Okay?  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Debbie.  Very welcome.  Okay, Bruce.  We're going to do a selection of an alternate member of the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board.  Yes, Mr. Chair.  The primary members we have on the committee are Commissioner Wolff, Commissioner Cooper, and Commissioner Polon.  And our alternate now is Commissioner Scarpa.  We're asking for one more alternate just because holding a quorum of three is so tight.  And so we're asking for one additional alternate, if you will, please.  Anybody want to take that spot?  All right.  I'll volunteer to take it if somebody wants to nominate.  Thank you.  We got it.  Thank you.  Okay.  I'm in then.  Okay.  On the consent agenda, all matters listed under the consent agenda are considered routine and will be enacted by one motion.  There will be no separate discussion of these items.  Any questions?  Then we'll move on to the consent agenda.  Please note that the consent agenda is not in place unless requested by a member of the Planning Commission.  A member of the public may request that an item be removed provided the item does not relate to a noticed hearing which has been closed to further public comment.  Items removed from the consent agenda will be considered immediately following the approval of the consent agenda.  Are there any speakers in the call?  No.  Okay.  Okay, moving on to the approval of the minutes  of November 16th, 2023.  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion and a second.  Okay, all in favor, you're gonna have to do roll call.  Is that correct?  Okay.  Can I clarify who was the second?  Thank you.  Yes.  Commissioner Cooper?  Yes.  Commissioner Loffins?  Yes.  Commissioner Poulin?  Yes.  Commissioner Scarpa?  Yes.  Commissioner Wolf?  Yes.  Vice Chair Scott?  Yes.  Chair Wall?  Here, yes.  Thank you.  Okay, public comments.  Members of the public may address the commission  at this time on any matter  not already listed on the agenda.  With comments being limited to three minutes,  the commission cannot take any action at this meeting  on request made under this section of the agenda.  We have one speaker.  One speaker?  Tom Bond.  Hello?  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Hands up on how many people have sat at the intersection  of Glenwood and Highway 32 between the hours of 4 and 6 p.m.  or let's say 6.30 and 9 in the morning to try and get on 32,  get their children to school down the street  or head the other way to work, maybe to Portland.  It's almost impossible.  And what I want to alert you to is something  that probably you don't know about yet that's in the works.  And that is a major 300 unit apartment complex  at the exact across the street from where I'm talking about.  Think about that.  This is the entrance to Chico.  Is that what we want?  Yes.  That's 300 units.  That's 300 to 400 more automobiles leaving daily  from 300 units there alone.  I love Chico.  We've got to think before we do things sometimes.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  And that's it, Nicole?  That is it.  Okay.  Public hearing.  Do we have any expert questions?  Any expert take communication announcements  for either of the items coming up tonight?  Excuse me?  Do you have any expert take communication reports?  I drove by those sites.  Maybe .  All right.  Same here.  Just drove by.  Okay.  All right.  Use permit 23-02, architectural review 23-10, raising Keynes.  Non-ease $20 million. !  straight, APN 002450-046 and 002450-047. Madison, it's on to you.  All good. Good evening, Commissioners and Chair Wall. Oops, let's go back there.  My name is Madison Driscoll. I will be presenting the staff report  on this item. This is a request to authorize a quick service  excuse me, restaurant with a two-lane drive-thru.  The 1.15 acre site is located on the north side of East 20th Street within the Chico Marketplace  parking lot. It is between Black Bear Diner and the KFC, so right between there.  The site is designated regional commercial on the City of Chico General Plan land use diagram  and is zoned regional commercial. Currently, the site is part of the  Chico Marketplace parking lot. It is zoned regional commercial.  Currently, the site is part of the Chico Marketplace parking lot.  The site would include a almost 3,000 square foot restaurant with a two-lane drive-thru  and a parking lot with 29 spaces. The drive-thru satisfies the requirement of Chico Municipal  Code Section 19.176.07, which regulates drive-thru facilities.  The drive-thru would create a queuing area for up to 32 vehicles.  Construction of the new drive-thru facility would be a requirement of Chico Municipal Code Section 19.176.07,  which regulates drive-thru facilities. The drive-thru would result in a slight  reconfiguration of the Chico Marketplace parking lot. New construction would result in a reduction  of the existing parking lot spaces with the surrounding uses, but they would still exceed  the minimum requirement. All vehicle circulation associated with the new use would be internal  to the existing shopping center and no new access points to the public would be created.  The proposed restaurant would have a finished height of 20.5 feet.  The architectural style is contemporary in nature, utilizing a variety of materials to create visual  interest along prominent elevations. Materials would include a mixture of brick veneer and  composite wood paneling. Dark metal accents would outline the glass facades and windows  of the buildings. A large number one in a reclaimed red would provide a visual interest,  as well as two art installations along the front and side entry.  Landscaping would include a variety of new trees, including Chinese maple, Japanese maple,  eastern redbud, and crepe myrtle. The applicant proposes to remove a total of nine trees to  allow construction of the drive-thru lanes and parking area. Any tree removal must comply  with condition number seven listed on the conditions of approval. Staff has received  no public comment on the project. Staff recommends that the Planning Commission consider the project's staff report,  and the project's planning commission consider the project's staff report.  Staff recommends that the Planning Commission consider the project's staff report, direct any questions to staff, hold a public hearing regarding the project, and adopt Planning Commission Resolution 24-01, including required findings determining the project categorically exempt from further environmental review,  pursuant to CEQA Section 15332, approving Use Permit 23-02 and Architectural Review 23-10, subject to the recommended commissions.  I am available for any questions that the Commission might have.  Anybody have questions?  I just have one quick question. So you mentioned 29 parking spaces and then 32  queuing, so that's really the ability for 60 vehicles to be at that site. Is that  in line with what we typically see for this type of establishment?  So usually with, we don't usually see double drive-thru lanes. We have seen them more currently  with more successful businesses such as  Dutch Brothers. The parking minimum does meet up with our requirements there. As far as queuing, it is sometimes better with more successful change that come in.  If we look at other restaurants within town that have issues with queuing itself when it backs out into public streets, it is better in some ways to have more, but this is within regulation of our drive-thru standards.  Yeah, I've got a couple questions, if I could please.  Yes.  I guess I'm going to ask you a question. I'm a resident of a town called  Maanui in Maanui. Maanui is an urban area in Maanui. And these kinds of uses are, I'm sure just we're going to see more of them in the future. That's my sense. It's kind of a different model than what we used to have. We saw it with Dutch Brothers too. And I just want to raise the subject. It's not anything for this project in particular, but this might change the way that we look at traffic analysis.  In the past, we looked at drive-throughs and fast foods as sometimes a lot of drive-by traffic, not traffic generating, and something like this is almost a big draw.  I've talked about it with a few people, and they've definitely got a fan club.  It's a big deal.  I've got a question on the site plan.  Can we go back to the site plan?  And looking at that kind of cross-hatched area, that bioretention area, I think it's called, I saw two different notes in the plans.  One indicated that was going to be rip-rap, and one indicated it was going to be landscape.  I'm wondering what the future is for that area.  At least based off of the landscape plans, I know on them it says, at least on landscape plans,  for number one, it says,  it is a bioretention area, at least labeled on that.  So I would assume it's something similar to that where we're looking at bioswales of that nature.  But again, that's something that we usually see later on in the process, at least.  So it would be a landscaped area, wouldn't it just be rip-rap rock?  Yes.  Okay.  And then I have a question also about just the other landscape areas.  There's a lot of landscaping involved here, and I'm not really sure what it's being used for.  Maybe there's a way for the applicants,  to make sure that they're not just using it for the landscape.  They're using it for the central landscape area in their future use of the project.  And I've got a question also about the signage for the project.  Does all the signage meet the code requirements, or is that a part of our approval tonight?  Yes.  Part of the approval is also the signage.  This is standard with the sign code for the regional commercial zoning.  Okay.  So they're good on signage.  Okay.  Thank you.  Anything else?  Anybody else?  Okay.  We'll open the public hearing.  Nicole, do we have any speakers?  We have two speakers.  Two.  Hmm?  Okay.  Our first speaker is Marky Neville.  Hi.  I just put in a speaker card to answer questions.  So Dana's going to...  I'm going to do our presentation on behalf of the applicant.  Dana Siles is the applicant?  Okay.  We had a presentation up.  But I just need back real quickly.  And does this work to control the slides?  Okay.  Great.  Good evening, and thank you for having me.  My name is Dana Siles.  I'm a senior at the company called 360.  We're planners on behalf of the Raising Cane's Corporation.  Really excited to be here in Chico tonight.  Just a little bit about the company.  Raising Cane's as a company was founded in 1996 by a gentleman named Todd Graves  with a mission in college to open a chicken finger restaurant.  With no money and no investments, he worked hard to save money to be able to secure an SBA loan  to open the first restaurant located outside of LSU's Baton Rouge campus.  During construction of the first site,  Todd's Yellow Labrador Retriever Raising Cane was on site the entire time, and thus Cane won.  And now Cane 3 continues to be the namesake and the mascot for the company.  Cane's is an employee-led company where equality is paramount.  Everyone from the cashiers to the executive team were trained as fry cooks and cashiers  and go through required training each year to ensure  that the entire team understands the business from the ground up.  The company creates each location unique for the city in which it's located.  There's no formulae.  It's a one-size-fits-all approach.  Their skilled team is focused on product excellence,  ensuring that the design, construction, operation of the restaurants help to resolve  and mitigate existing problem issues where they exist and ensure  that any new operations are synergistic with neighboring uses, residents, and businesses.  Cane's is most proud of their ACI or active community involvement.  As a company, they quickly become supporters of school districts,  partnering with organizations focused on education, feeding the hungry,  pet welfare, active lifestyle, and so much more.  Our team works hand-in-hand with local organizations to identify local needs.  In Chico, prior to opening, the entire crew will volunteer at a local organization  and raise a minimum of $1,000 to present to that organization at the ribbon cutting.  Last year, Raising Cane's donated over $10 million in community partnerships nationwide,  and we look forward to being part of this community here in Chico.  What makes Raising Cane's unique above other quick-serve restaurants is their focused menu,  which allows the company to receive the highest quality food and beverage services in the city. !  with the highest ratings in the industry for food order accuracy, speed of service, food quality, and value.  Raising Cane's only serves five items, which are chicken fingers, french fries, coleslaw,  cane sauce, Texas toast, and fresh-squeezed lemonade.  Their current speed of service is 2 minutes and 28 seconds from order to delivery,  demonstrating their always-fresh motto about service to their customers.  Because drive-through operations represent roughly three-quarters of restaurant sales,  speed of service is paramount, important to the restaurant community, and the food is the most important.  Raising Cane's is the largest food delivery service in the state of Iowa,  providing up to 8,000 items to ensure that Raising Cane's does not create traffic  and or cueing impacts seen by other fast food establishments.  All items are cooked to order, and as soon as the camera sees someone pulling into the parking lot or through the drive-through,  they quickly start frying chickens because they know exactly what people are going to order.  There is no customization and multiple menu items to slow down delivery service.  Raising Cane's is proficient in managing their patron operation, with most locations providing ample indoor and outdoor dining opportunities, bicycle carts, and food carts.  parking spaces, drive-through stacking, and on-site traffic flow. During peak hours,  Canes often deploys crew members with tablets in the drive-through lanes to expedite orders  and take payments in advance so that their pickup and wait times are minimized. Sites  are developed at the highest standards, including wider drive aisles and heavy landscaping.  In this location, the restaurant is designed with a double drive-through that wraps around  the building to ensure that queuing can be managed entirely on-site. As stated by staff,  this design does result in queuing for up to 32 cars, which is significantly in excess  of the capacity provided by many of Canes' competitors in the area. This queuing capacity  is also in addition to the 29 on-site parking spaces. That also includes two electric vehicle  charging spaces and expansion capabilities for up to six cars. There's also four bicycle  parking spaces on-site. The Chico restaurant will provide 61 indoor seats and 24 outdoor  seats for on-site dining patrons.  Like all of their locations, Raising Canes here will feature numerous local groups,  sports teams, etc. that are reflective of Chico within the ultimate restaurant dining  design. Canes also employs high-quality building materials, including sustainable materials.  They use real brick in all buildings. They also feature the number one symbol in all  of their buildings that represents their one love philosophy, prominently displayed somewhere,  and that is typically constructed.  Each building has unique hand-painted murals that promptly place the name of the town  on the side of the building so that each location is uniquely branded. In this instance, the  internal elevation of the drive-thru features the one love heart with Canes' mascot highlighting  Chico, California in the art piece.  Again, on-site, things will be lushly landscaped with sustainable plants, which provide both  buffering for the store and a pleasant dining experience.  A total of 25 new trees will be planted on site as part of the project, with more than  50% of the parking lot landscaped and shaded, which will prevent heat gain.  Low-voltage lighting is also placed in planters and trees to ensure that the property is safely  lit while not causing excess light pollution onto surrounding streets or properties.  To reiterate, the project will bring significant site enhancements and an overall superior  design of the drive-thru, being able to accommodate queuing far in excess of many of its competitors.  In closing, we are very proud of the substantial design and programming efforts made in favor  of this company. We look forward to bringing this into your community and urge your approval  of our use permit in our architecture review applications.  We are here for questions should you have any more.  Maura  Maura  Maura  Maura  Maura  Maura  Maura  Maura  Maura  Maura  Maura  Maura  We don't have a board we came up from Los Angeles.  I think it's probably just a graphic issue and a printing issue, but they are exactly the same.  Which one do you mean?  So this one right here is you're saying is realistic?  I think your prints might be slightly darker.  This is more realistic.  This is their traditional palette.  Thank you.  Anybody else?  Okay.  Chico Marketplace is okay with this, I assume?  Yes.  It coordinates with all the new stuff there and everything, the colors.  Do we have any other speakers?  No.  Pardon?  No.  Okay.  We'll shut that down and open it to the public. Thank you very much.   We have no other speakers.  Pardon?  No other speakers.  No other speakers.  Okay.  We'll close the hearing.  And Commission, any comments?  Motion?  I'll make a motion.  Okay.  Everybody ready?  I proposed, I move that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution 24-01, approving Use Permit  23-02 and Architectural Resources for the  Review 23-10, Raising Gains Subject to the Recommended Conditions Contained Therein.  Second.  Okay.  We have a motion and a second.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thanks for your patience.  Commissioner Cooper?  Yes.  Commissioner Laffins?  Yes.  Commissioner Brunner?  Commissioner Poulin?  Yes.  Commissioner Scarpa?  Yes.  Commissioner Wolff?  Yes.  Vice Chair Scott?  Yes.  Chair Wall?  Yes.  Okay.  That one's done.  We'll move on to the next one, 4.2, recommending City Council adoption of a Mitigated Negative  Declaration and Mitigation Monitoring Program, approval of General Plan Amendment 22-04,  approval of Resum 22-02, and conditional approval of Subdivision 22-01, Orchard Creek  Estates, Tetrault Construction, Inc.  Presentation by Mike Scholar.  Thank you, Chair Wall.  Good evening, Planning Commissioners.  This project's located at the southeast corner of Nord Avenue and Hinshaw Avenue in northwest  Chico.  It involves three main components for your consideration tonight.  One is a General Plan Amendment and Rezone affecting 20 acres of property.  That's the GPA Rezone applications.  And then there's a subdivision of 15 acres within that site.  And to approve it all, we've prepared an initial study to mitigate a negative declaration,  which is our recommendation for how to meet the requirements of the California Environmental  Quality Act.  I'll talk about each of these in turn.  So starting zoomed way out on the whole General Plan land use diagram here, the circle here  is highlighting Special Planning Area 4 for the Bell Muir area in northwest Chico.  And you see the little square there, that's the project site.  We're going to zoom in on this.  And a closer look at what the conceptual diagram shows in the General Plan, Appendix C for  this area shows that it would mostly be planned out for low density residential, our R1 zoning  district with a smattering of small farms and maybe community gardens, and that would  be the secondary open area.  And this is the open space that you see in green on this figure.  Bottom right in the square there is where the project site is, immediately adjacent  to city limits.  The bottom half of this page out of Appendix C shows the aerial of the site, which I've  highlighted here.  And the project site's in yellow this time.  This arrow represents the, shows the distance away from the green line.  The green line's located approximately 1,000 feet to the west of the project site.  And the area that we're looking at is the area that we're looking at.  And that's the area that we're looking at.  And that's also the nearest county agricultural zoning to the site.  The property zone, the current city zoning is SPA, special planning area.  And that's because the General Plan says this whole area is supposed to be planned as one,  and then it would come before the decision makers as a master planned large area.  This special planning area is different than the others though, because the other ones  ones comprise five or six lots, one owner in most cases, or what I should say is many fewer lots  than we have out here, where we have hundreds of lots, hundreds of owners, and it would be a very  big chore to master plan the whole area. The city hasn't done that, and no developer has stepped up  to do it either. This project proposes to remove itself from the special planning area so that it  may be annexed separate from the rest of the special planning area and developed with a  subdivision, which I'll be talking about in a few minutes. Again, the arrow down in the bottom  left hand shows the nearest agricultural zoned area, and even though that arrow represents a  little bit more than a thousand feet, we've still asked for a condition of approval on this project  to include the agricultural notifications to acknowledge that agricultural operations do  happen within a thousand feet of the site because the special planning area largely has lots of  still left in it.  And we don't want to threaten people from continuing to be able to do their farming, so the  agricultural notifications disclosures are things that people would learn when they were thinking  about buying a lot here that, okay, people farm nearby, I have to live with that. The general plan  rezone looks like this. It would code two of the three properties, R1, our low density residential  zoning district, and because the existing zoning district is a residential zoning district, it would  be zoned PQ, public quasi public, which would be what we would zone it to show that we are not looking to  change anything there. It can just stay what it is. So no change really for them, except for they would  be annexed along with the parcels for the subdivision. The R1 zoning allows for densities from two units  per acre to seven units per acre.  So this is the proposed appendix C page that would show how the project site is outside of the special  planning area. It would have zoning, it is planned to be annexed, or they would hope that the city council  would annex the site, and then it would be able to be developed pursuant to the subdivision, which we're  going to talk about now. The subdivision area would be the orchards out there on these other two parcels,  not the Masonic Lodge here, but the Masonic Lodge out there. So this is the proposed appendix C page that  would be the housing for the sub-division. So we're going to zoom in on those two parcels there. There's a 10-acre  parcel with a house on the corner and a house on each corner, actually, and then another five acres adjacent to  the Masonic Lodge, which also touches East Avenue. And the subdivision would look roughly like this, with a new  access taken off of Nord, two new access points on Hinshaw and a long cul-de-sac. We're going to zoom into this  again, but we're going to also turn this on its side. So remember the shape. We're going to turn this on its  side. So we're going to turn it. There we go. So part of their request for approval of a subdivision, which the  county can or the city can do before it's been annexed, but we have a condition that says you have to annex within a  certain point in time. We put 36 months as a reasonable time we think that the annexation could occur. So this is  allowed by the MAP Act to approve a subdivision despite the fact that it's still in the county. One of the requests here  involve a long cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sacs over 500 feet require special permission. Here, the city has a  lot of !  There's a little easement that would be a walkway between the end of the cul-de-sac and the corner in case somebody on this cul-de-sac wanted to go down to the  store, the gas station store, they could leave the property that way and it would be a little more convenient for them.  Let's see. This would be a 74 lot subdivision and yield 4.8 units per acre, which is sort of in the middle of the R1 zoning district that I mentioned goes from 2 to 7 units per acre. In the city we call that low density residential.  We have another condition involving the trees. All of the trees are pretty much slated  for removal except for some of the ornamentals around the homesteads. Here are chopped out  little details of that and show you where trees would remain around some of the existing  homes which would be situated in couple of existing lots. So lot 2 would have two units  in it. Lot 1 would have an existing house in it. And down in lot 74, that existing home  and the tree in front of it would be retained there. We also prepared the  initial study like I said it gave us four mitigation measures and I found  while I was sitting there a couple mistakes on your draft resolution. The  draft conditions of approval I have noticed the numbering is off something  got wonky with the numbering it should just go 1 through 14 instead of starting  over in the middle so apologize for that. And the other problem is that the  tribe one mitigation should read differently than it does in your report.  I apologize for that but there's a cultural resources condition and that's  if you find pottery or bones or unforeseen cultural resources then that  is one reason to stop work and the other one the tribal condition should actually  say that the developer shall provide  you  reasonable access prior to grading for tribal monitors from the Machupto tribe  and cease work within 100 feet of that if they find anything. So I apologize for  that one not make it in your report I will definitely get it to the council in  their report. And then there's a hazardous materials condition which is  basically just to protect against spills during construction and nesting birds to  make sure that prior to authorizing removal of trees that the nests there  would make sure there's no nesting birds.  And prevent violating laws from that.  Staff is recommending adoption of the mitigated negative declaration with those mitigation measures and approval of the  GPA and rezone and approval of the subdivision subject to the conditions which include all the things I mentioned including the mitigation measures.  So I'll answer any questions you have.  Anybody have questions?  I'm going to go ahead and take a few questions.  I'm going to go ahead and take a few questions.  I drove through the site and my first thing is streets and access.  What is and this is about the whole plan right?  And that's the whole main plan right would be to we're adding this and four lanes and lights here.  But I'm like there's no light on Henshaw going to Esplanade.  There's no light on East Avenue going out off of Nord.  You only have the light on Cusick and now you have those apartments we approved a few months back already being built and it's already sort of the squished wedge.  Where are these cars?  Where are these cars?  Where is this access where the roads very narrow and not sidewalky and that's what I want.  Where's the city with that and how long out are they out with that type of bigger plan I guess is what I'm trying to or I'm missing maybe I'm missing some access or something.  There's currently no plan to develop a specific plan for this area.  If that was your question.  Yeah, I understand.  So no lights added or no expansion or nothing?  No.  No, the frontage improvements will be required along the project site that will widen the road out a bit on their side and build the half of the street that the city would ultimately want to see along the project frontage.  Which will also include street lights.  But if this was part of the SPA that's where you guys are going to get together and make the big plan right?  Is that what that's what the whole goal of the SPA is right?  SPA sorry.  That is the concept.  That's the concept in the general plan to plan the entire.  But this is being pulled from that and eventually could be included into that or not really because it's being pulled out of it.  It would be treated like the adjacent city that the specific plan would try to meld into.  Okay.  What we observe.  Yeah, I was there at 430 today so it was sort of an interesting, I tried to get out multiple ways and it was just I couldn't get out of there so.  Yeah.  More questions for?  Okay.  Anybody else?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a few questions.  Yeah, this project seems to have a little bit of everything, you know, mixed in with the long range stuff and then with the subdivision.  And I'll just maybe get a couple clarifying questions about the subdivision itself.  It looks like along east and north that we're going to have a back on treatment there.  And I'm just wondering what that is going to look like both as a part of the subdivision and then in the long term.  As best I can understand.  It looks like the conditions require that there be a landscape plan and a fence there.  But I'm not sure how much landscaping there would ultimately be and how that would be maintained in the long run.  Both the wall or fence and then the landscaping.  That was a concern that I had about the subdivision design.  And maybe there's an answer to that.  How is that ultimately going to be addressed?  It would be a back on condition on East Avenue and north to the first turn into the site there.  And the back, the yards would have back fences.  Six foot wooden fences is what the applicant is proposing.  And then as far as I can tell from the subdivision, it would be a normal street section where you would have a parkway strip and that would be landscaping.  And then you would have the sidewalk behind that and then the fence.  So the fence would just be right behind the sidewalk then?  I believe so, yes.  Okay.  And then about the access way at the terminus of the cul-de-sac there.  That's a pretty long access way.  It's over 100 feet long, 12 feet wide.  Are there any concerns about what might go on in that space?  Does that come up as an issue?  No, they would have the option of putting either six foot fences along there or three foot fences.  Three foot fences would provide better surveillance in there.  But there's no conditions about that.  All right.  And on the overall length of the subdivision, the basis for the deviation from the normal 500 foot limitation is what again?  The reason or the justification?  Yeah, you can, as I understand it, you can vary from the standards.  But there are certain findings that need to be made to do that.  And I'm just trying to better understand what the basis is.  I understand that.  It's necessary due to the shape of the existing property.  Yes.  And to balance with getting as many lots out of the site as possible.  The 500 foot limit on cul-de-sacs was largely a big concern before we had fire sprinklers in all the attics and homes and stuff like that.  And now the fire sprinklers requirements are much higher and greater.  And those concerns about having long cul-de-sacs are much diminished now.  We actually had the conversation among staff of why do we even have that standard anymore?  All right.  And then shifting away from the subdivision design to more, I think what might be the bigger question here, and that is the future of Belmere.  You know, should this be retained as a special planning area?  It seemed, it has seemed to me for a long time that it's pretty remote, that it's ever really going to come together as a real comprehensive plan.  And it seems that kind of chopping off the ground is the best way to do it.  And then chopping it up and reducing the area kind of reduces your overall critical mass for possibly funding improvements in the future and that kind of thing.  So I'm wondering if there's a, you know, could staff look at that as a possibility that is just eliminating this as SPA?  Does that raise other issues that, you know?  Well, that was a lot more than the applicant was asking for in this case.  Yeah.  And we do share that concern that this area is just too unwieldy with so many different owners with different motivations and interests in the future.  But we also balance that concern with those, what we see up the streets here where you see these one acre, the 10 acre, you know, the 10 acre lot's getting turned into 10 one acre McMansions out there with big homes on them.  And we are seeing it fritter away and the ability to further plan it in the future.  So this was, that outweighed that concern for us.  Thanks.  I got a quick question too.  The tower that's at the Masonic Center, there's a lot of electronics and things it seems right bordering.  Is that an impact or is there anything there that, there just seemed to be a lot of, a whole caged off area in the big tower next to houses?  It's just an existing condition that we have.  We have them all over town.  That would be a legal non-conforming if it didn't meet the requirements.  Yeah, I know.  It just seemed like it was right on the border.  Anybody else?  Yeah, I think I have, just to go off of what Commissioner Wolf said, you know, I usually say we can't plan for the ideal.  We decide the application that's in front of us.  But with a general plan reason, there's a higher burden there.  And I'm wondering just that balance that the city took in recommending that we improve this of, are there opportunities that we're missing out on by taking this out of what was a very public process, a lot of community engagement.  These maps were very public and saying, okay, now we're going to piece off a piece of it and it's not going to be part of the special planning area.  Is there any risk?  I think there's a lot of risk that's being lost in having this planned better.  A little bit.  I think I would just echo what Commissioner Wolf was saying in that if the special planning area identified a capital need and there was some dollar amount attached to that, we would say, okay, well, then all the houses have got to pay $5,000 a pop to build the extra road that's needed in the middle or something like that.  But we just don't really see a special planning area here being a priority.  And I think that's something that we're seeing master planned.  It's just there's nobody stepping up to do it.  And then to follow up on that, do we set a precedent now for the rest of the areas of is there a burden or a precedent that's put on you of the next application that comes in and wants a general plan reason?  I like to say that all projects are different.  So not necessarily.  This one has the great advantage of being immediately adjacent to the city.  So if you're not immediately adjacent to the city, you're not going to be able to do it.  But if you're adjacent to the city limits, you can't even have the discussion.  And depending on where the next property might come from, they might create like this one, for instance, wanted to annex just one piece, just the 10 acres at first.  But then it creates like an island almost.  So it pulled in the other two properties with it so that because it's not legal to create an island or substantially create an island with annexations.  So there might be some sort of chain reaction of needing to pull in additional properties depending on if who else steps up wanting to get peeled out of the SPA.  Kind of a follow up to Tony's question.  Have any other developers come to the city requesting similar projects on any of these parcels?  Conceptually.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are in an era in which we are  sites located near enough existing services to where it didn't generate too much VMT,  vehicle miles traveled.  Thank you.  If we were to annex this and approve this tonight, would there be a CMD set up to take  care of the surrounding walls and fences and any of those kind of common areas?  Typically, yes.  The parkway strip that would be behind the back fence would be rolled into a maintenance  district.  If you want to add anything, Nat, go ahead.  Yeah, any public facilities that they're proposing would be in a CMD.  Any private facilities would be burdened to the developer themselves, so they would have  to figure out how to fund that through an HOA or whatever mechanism.  And just to clarify, that would include then the fence or wall?  The fence adjacent to East Avenue and Nord?  Nord Avenue.  Probably not.  I'll just say probably not.  Because that would be on private property.  It would be private.  I believe.  We could get clarification from the applicant of their intentions, though.  Okay.  Mike, just one more question, and I can't remember.  And if you don't know, I totally understand, but the county's ad buffer, is that 3,000  feet?  Do you happen to know?  I do not know.  Okay.  One more question.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Right.  So with the R1, what is the units per acre in that subdivision, if you know offhand?  I don't know.  It looks like about four units per acre.  Those look like quarter acre lots with those cul-de-sacs.  Anybody else?  I do have one question.  So.  We've been discussing the fact of this general plan rezone.  If they didn't come under city standards, they could still build under county standards,  correct, of the one acre lot development?  Yes.  Mike, I have one more question.  When was the SPA4 master planned?  I guess.  When was the last, what was the date, the year that that one was identified as a special planning area?  With this general plan, which was 2011.  2011.  Okay.  We'll end that part.  I have one more question.  Okay.  Go right ahead.  Mike, so next to it, I noticed all the board members completely cleared it.  Is that, are you aware of that coming on board as well?  Sorry.  I am aware of that.  You are aware?  Yes.  We were made aware of that when it was happening.  Okay.  So there would be someone trying to join on and then?  Oh, they could be in the city in the winter after, cause they'd be touching the city in the winter after something's wintered.  On the other side of Henshaw where they're-  Oh, I thought you meant at the-  No, they could be cleared.  Yeah.  So the orchard next to Henshaw on the other side has been completely cleared now.  So there's just piles of trees.  So I didn't know if that was part of, cause now if we bring it on now that's touching the city now, then someone else comes in could do the same thing.  So I didn't know if that was something you're aware of or not.  That's not part of this project.  I understand that lots of Walnut Orchards are being removed though, because Walnut farmers are having tough times.  They're having a tough time.  I agree.  Oh, okay.  I have one more question, sorry.  Do we have any other SPA areas in our general plan that have this many property owners?  No, not even close.  Thank you.  Okay, thank you, Mike.  Okay, Mike.  See, we'll open to public hearing.  Nicole, are there any speakers lined up?  We have 12 speakers.  We can start with the applicant, Chuck Tetreault.  Okay, we'll have the applicant come up first.  Chuck.  Good evening, everybody.  Thank you for having me tonight.  I do want to talk what Special Administrator Wolf was bringing up with the special planning area.  Okay.  There's a law called exactions, which does not allow a private citizen and or developer to plan for somebody else's land.  So, for instance, if one of these people who I'm sure are here to talk against the project say, oh, well, I don't want this,  then if I was to plan saying, okay, well, I'm going to make your property a park, therefore your land becomes useless.  There's case law.  My attorney is probably in charge.  I'm going to put this in your packet.  My attorney sent this to the city just to make them aware of the law.  It's put to the Supreme Court multiple times, and it's something the city would have to do.  Speaking to my project specifically, I have spoken with engineering, and we have the size of piping to carry on if somebody did ever buy the rest of the hundred and something properties that are out there.  And it would be great.  I don't know if 150 people can agree on one thing, but I think we all could agree that it's hard to get three people to agree on one thing.  One thing I wanted to clarify with what Mike was bringing up with the walking path with the extended cul-de-sac is that it also doubles as a fire access.  There will be a bollard which can be removed, and a fire truck can also enter through that area.  So that was one of the things that we talked about.  So engineering for future growth.  Talking about the fence, I know if I lived across there, I wouldn't want to start at the back of the fence.  The plan for that is Greg Melton is my landscape architect on this project, and I addressed that with him.  And he suggested some flowering vines to grow up the fence in order to just not make it a blank canvas for who knows what these days.  So I think that's what I was going to say.  The Belmere SPA, I think what Mark was alluding to, at least that's what I was going to, it should not exist as an SPA.  It has too many owners.  Nobody will ever agree.  And the whole intent of the SPA is being undermined by being developed under county standards.  When we first got this property, when I say we, me and my partners,  we were going to do this property under county standards.  And I told them, I asked them a question, and this is, keep in mind, we built 210 affordable units.  We just finished 104 affordable senior units right by DeGarmo Park.  We did 98 units up Highway 32, which were affordable.  And so I asked them, I said, what does this town need?  Do we need more $1.2 million homes, or do we need more $300,000 to $400,000 homes?  So.  In my mind and in their mind, that's what made us do this decision,  because we can, by right, go in there and build $1 million homes.  I don't think Chico needs any more $1 million homes.  I think we need homes that people can afford to live in, and those are far and few between right now.  Also, I have with me my planning consultant, my engineers are here, and also my environmental consultant.  I'm sure if you have any questions of them,  they're a lot smarter than I am, but I'm also here to answer any questions that you have.  Anybody have any?  What's the estimated time frame should this all move forward?  I'm sorry, Brandy, I couldn't.  Estimated time frame to complete construction in an ideal world.  We would put the, well, so then we'd go to city council.  I don't know, Mike, do you know how long it would take to get to council?  A month to get to council.  A month to get to council.  And then.  We would start doing the engineering then.  I don't assume anything's a done deal, so I don't spend money until I have to.  So probably would start, excuse me, this summer on construction.  I just want to clarify, because, you know, one of the things, any decisions that we make,  you know, there are impacts, what that looks like.  And I would like you to touch on that buy right piece.  That you mentioned.  So.  Tony, I'm sorry.  I'm very hard of hearing.  What would you do?  So if this doesn't go forward and what you said, buy right, how many homes per acre could you build?  I would, I would go to the county and ask them to change that from one acre to half acres.  But then the, you would not get the improvements of city, city connectivity.  So right now, Henshaw, the sidewalk dead ends.  And then over by.  East Avenue, the sidewalk dead ends.  This would create connectivity, create a neighbor, a complete neighborhood.  It would give a seven foot.  I believe it's a seven foot landscape strip between that and the sidewalk.  And then we'd set the fence back probably 18 inches from the said property line.  Grow the vines, which would the water would come from the homeowners, which would be feeding the vines.  And then the other ones would be with the maintenance district, which is kind of typical.  Mr.  Tatro, what is the feasibility of increasing the zoning?  I definitely understand where you're coming from of trying to have more affordable by design projects.  I, I currently believe that this project proposals to low density for the housing needs of the community as well as for the city.  There's medium density on East Avenue.  There is a bus route route three on East Avenue as well.  I just see this project could be a little.  Bit more favorable for me to vote in favor of if it was closer to an art to what?  14, six to 14 units per acre versus our one.  I would have to say that if I tried to come here and say that I wanted 14 units per acre, that these people behind me would probably find me and kill me.  So that's why originally we did have a neighborhood meeting, which somebody I had been getting really I don't do social media.  So.  Everybody who is on social media, I was read some of the things that were said.  I do want to apologize.  I was not at the neighborhood meeting.  My son.  Qualified for a home run derby in Seattle for the all star game.  And so that's why I was not there.  And he was 12 and had to compete as a 14 year old and lost by one home run.  So I apologize that, but I don't miss my son's events.  I did leave Jake, who is very competent.  I'm not sure if you can hear me.  So that's why I called in my wife, Carrie.  Then my wife, Carrie Tatro also attended the meeting and.  Thought did a pretty good job.  I don't try to hide anything or do anything.  I do want to bring up a quick issue regarding there was four trees that were black walnut trees along Henshaw.  They were marked with an X and a number.  I called PG&E and asked, what does that mean?  They said they were marked for removal.  I have a very contentious relationship.  With PG&E.  which I'm sure a lot of people do.  And I was approached by a gentleman who said that he would buy the trees off of me.  And I said, well, whatever money you give me,  I'm going to buy lights for the Little League Parks here in town.  So for the transparency, the guy gave me $25,000 for the four trees,  which apparently I got ripped off.  But the Little League Parks will all have brand new lights as of this next season.  And I also donated $10,000 to the Heritage Tree Foundation  in order to identify trees that should be identified as heritage trees,  which black walnut trees do not fall under that category.  So I just wanted to kind of clarify that with some of the neighbors,  because I did, I was read some of the social media things that they were saying.  And yeah, I guess I'd need to have thick skin, but after a while, it kind of gets to you.  I'm also a little bit interested or concerned about the rural-urban divide.  I do know that in the Belmere specific plan area, it did include that.  It did include that secondary open space.  Is there a reason that that was not feasible in the project in front of us?  Which secondary open space are you referring to?  In the general, in this specific plan, like what the city,  what the community wanted that area to look like before the issues of the owners  and all of that.  It looked like there was secondary open space for gardens and open space for the community.  And I didn't see that in this project.  Is there a reason there couldn't be any open space?  No.  So if you look at that map, the specific map for the SPA, it shows like, it's kind of conceptual.  It's like some open space here, open space there.  And that's why when you have multiple owners on an SPA, if I didn't like somebody,  and I spent the money to lay this out, which if I didn't like that person,  I can literally say you're a park.  And their land value goes to zero.  And it's against the law.  It's not lawful.  And I have case law abroad if anybody cares to look at it.  But one thing that I have a question for is for the city is there's a proposed park on Henshaw  that they've replaced the sign three times, but the park's still not there.  So.  There is a neighborhood park planned for that area that I believe is on Henshaw and I'm sure.  And it's right by where the FFA field is where I believe they grow pumpkins and stuff as well.  But there is a park that's planned next by.  I believe it's a 20 acre parcel.  So it's good size.  Thank you.  So, yeah, but the intent, I believe that Mr.  Solly was saying also was that area specific to me.  Was what we want to be consistent with.  And so since that's what they wanted consistent with the general plan, we stayed at the low density.  And then we did lower even further to four point eight.  And I do agree.  I mean, I don't like the urban sprawl and all that good stuff either.  But I think in this area, like I said, if I tried to go to an R2 zoning, I probably wouldn't be standing here right now.  Great.  Thanks.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  If I didn't think you stopped.  OK, Nicole, do we have speakers ready?  And by the way, speakers tonight will be allowed up to three minutes.  Not required to use it all, but say what you need to say in three minutes or less.  Our next speaker is Jeff Short.  Thank you.  Good evening, commissioners.  I'm a neighbor in the area.  Live there about 12 years now.  A lot of small farming is closing up.  And I do think that better use for the land is a subdivision.  I just highly disagree with the lot size.  I think it should be a half acre minimums.  The traffic.  There's no way to get out to a light other than going all the way down to Cusick off of Henshaw.  There has been some improvements along Henshaw.  That are great, but both sides of it are deteriorating roads.  And I just don't see how cutting the center line of the road and repaving it.  It's going to deteriorate the county road right where that pavement meets the old asphalt.  We already have enough potholes on that road.  I just don't think that.  And then also the trees that were removed when we went to the original meeting at the Masonic Center.  There was a map there that showed the trees not being removed.  The coastal black walnuts.  Which was one of the largest ones in California, by the way.  And they were taken out.  And then that meeting was in July.  And then comes August, I believe.  They submitted a plan to the city to remove those trees.  But in the meeting to us, they told us that they were keeping them.  So I don't know what to believe anymore.  That's all I have. i don't know what to believe anymore um that's all i have thank you for your time thank you our next speaker is christine graff and i would just like to remind all the speakers the microphones  Thank you.  We are at maximum level.  So if they speak on that left side, then we'll be able to hear.  Sorry, Chuck.  It's really hard for all of us to hear.  So I might be.  repeating things and I apologize for that. Good evening everybody.  I think my major concerns about all this and some of it  I think has been covered but I'm not sure  covered where I could hear it that I could understand. My first  question is that I understood that the master  plan that was in place for this in 2011, I thought it was  2010, that when the area was developed  the whole area had to have a plan. You couldn't  just chip off part of it at a time and do what you wanted.  So I'm kind of, I don't understand how it's  even gotten to the point to where they're thinking about chipping some off.  That bothers me. The other thing that bothered me  was when we had the meeting  the first meeting that he couldn't attend, we specifically asked about  the trees and they said no.  They were going to save them. Then they were cut down.  I understood those trees to be on the public right-of-way  so I would think that he would have needed a permit to remove those  trees and I was wondering if he did. The other thing I would  like to know is when they were moving the trees  and when they brought in all the trucks, what allowed him to come  completely like 25 feet into my property  with his equipment without anyone asking?  Well they wanted to add pictures of pictures of pictures of pictures of pictures of  So that upset me.  The other thing that I'm concerned about is the road that's coming out on Nord Avenue from the subdivision.  Our neighbor and I have houses directly across from that, and we're wondering, you know, it's hard to tell from the picture exactly where that road's going to come out.  But certainly we wouldn't want it to come out so that it's shining into any of our houses, because if they're planning to put that many houses in there, that's a lot of traffic at nighttime with their windows or their shining lights coming right in our windows.  I just, I'm not for this, and, you know, if it does pass, I just feel like it's too high of a density for the area.  It's not.  I'm keeping up with the feel of the area.  I feel like agriculture land can be better used than for houses.  That's all I have to say.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Doris Schill.  I'd just like to say that I have the...  I have the actual functioning walnut orchard that's the closest to this property, and my concerns are that I'm still farming, and there was supposed to be like a buffer zone between orchards and developments, and I don't see that happening.  Our orchard is probably six years old, so it's still a new orchard, and our neighbors are, we planted together, so we have 17, 20 acres, whatever we have.  And, you know, this is just a lot of houses.  I'm actually not fighting this development.  It's probably going to happen.  Larry, you were our supervisor when we were doing all this.  I spent a bunch of time in your office.  It's been a long time ago, but it's...  I was very active to get the one-acre parcels, and I have to admit, one-acre parcels is a lot of land for a house to be built on.  But 74 houses or whatever it's going to be on 15 acres.  I can't...  I can't go along with that.  I'm not fighting this, but I think that's too high of a density, considering that we are still farming out there.  And I don't know what the answer is, but the roads, you know, you can't come out on...  There's going to be a lot more traffic.  There's a railroad track there.  You can't put a signal on that I'm aware of.  So just be aware that it doesn't fit our area.  That's all I can say.  It doesn't fit our area.  Could you clarify?  I'm sorry.  Could you clarify really quick?  How close is your property to this property?  I'm on the Y of Rodeo North.  Manuel's Place.  Manuel's Place.  You remember Manuel and Helen Sorays.  They both have passed away, so the kids have it now.  And they chose to take out the orchard.  For some reason, it started dying.  But they're going to still farm, we think.  I don't know if they have made that final decision.  But it still is...  I kind of wish when we were working with the city that they had just taken in the whole area.  Because what's going to happen is we're just going to nitpick constantly.  Pretty soon Manuel's going to want, or Manuel's family's going to want, to do something across the street.  I wouldn't mind it.  The Bill Muir area is not a farming area anymore.  I'm probably, like I said, I've got the newest orchard.  Most of the orchards are being torn out.  So it...  It would be nice if they would do the whole area and think about that rather than this little one,  which is supposed to be low density.  I don't consider 74 houses low density.  But look at the whole area before you start making decisions of doing this little area and that little area.  You're just going to spend more time sitting here listening to people like me.  So that's all I've got to say.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tammy Solano, then followed by...  Tim Thompson.  Hello.  Thank you for letting us speak tonight.  I'm also a neighbor.  We're here to oppose the annexing or the change from the general plan.  The general plan is supposed to preserve and protect the existing neighborhoods.  And if you go out there, you'll see that this neighborhood that they're proposing doesn't match the neighborhood.  All of the houses out there are on, I think, a third of an acre.  Up to a full acre.  And this is not in a bubble.  If you continue down Rodeo, all of the orchards, most of the orchards that have already been taken out,  there already are developments out there coming in.  So we're not talking about just 78 new houses.  We're talking about 78 new houses plus everything that's coming in down Rodeo.  That's additionally, easily 150 cars.  And if you go out there, there's no way that left turn off of East Avenue,  coming over the railroad tracks, can withstand that level of traffic.  You can hardly have four cars back up there before you hit the railroad tracks.  And that's with the current level of housing out there.  I think any new housing out there is going to increase the traffic problem.  I think we also have to factor in that the neighborhood was all orchards.  So we're not going from a neighborhood of houses to 78 new, fully dense houses.  We're going from a neighborhood that looks like an orchard.  There's a lot of house, there's orchards right across the street.  There's orchards down the road.  All of the houses are established with large trees, with room in between the houses.  And this proposal is just too dense for the area and doesn't match the neighborhood.  So we asked.  But you consider following the general plan and develop it to match.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tim Thompson, filed by JC Crew.  Good evening, Commissioner Wall and fellow commissioners.  My name is Tim Thompson.  I've been a resident in Chico for the past 30 years.  I've been a property owner in the area for about 20 years.  And I've lived in EWI subdivision for the last 15 years.  And a lot that's adjacent to the proposed development.  Under the current county plan, which is where the property that's proposed to be developed lies.  Under Article 6, subsection E, it says that new development should preserve and protect the character of the existing neighborhoods.  And ensure that the new residential neighborhood provide an appropriate transition from rural to more developed areas.  So personally, I'm not opposed to the area being developed.  I just think that the going from very low density in a 1 acre currently planned position  to density of residential 1, low LDR, where we can put up to seven units an acre doesn't necessarily go with the spirit of the current plan.  I think an LDR is an  LDR or RS 20 designation is much more fitting,  especially when you look at the EW Heights subdivision  where it's more like three to four houses per acre.  Change is going to happen.  I would just like to see the city do it with taste.  I really think when we're looking at traffic and sewage,  all those things, it doesn't sound like just listening  to the well-thought-out questions you were asking of the developer.  It's kind of scary when those things haven't really been studied  before we just make a change this big.  So I hope you consider my input.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  JC Crew.  Then after JC will be Jared Geiser.  Good evening, Commissioners.  JC Krogh.  I live down Henshaw in the Eiffel Estate subdivision,  so not as close as some of the folks that have spoken tonight,  but do share a lot of their concerns, and specifically on traffic.  I appreciate the comments from a couple of the commissioners  that you've driven by the site,  and especially Commissioner Cooper understanding the negative impacts there  at a commute hour.  But, you know, those streets were not made  and are not going to be efficient enough to add this many trips a day.  So we heard that, you know, we don't take into consideration  level of service anymore for streets and intersections.  We're considering vehicle miles traveled.  That's unfortunate because those intersections would not meet  the level of service demands that these additional trips per day are going to add.  So you look at 74 homes, okay?  Let's say you have two adults in each house.  Right?  They go to work.  They have ancillary activities.  That's probably 300 trips a day you're adding to these streets  that are essentially country lanes.  They're not even two-lane roads to some extent.  Nord's in really rough shape.  Henshaw is not made for a lot of traffic.  You're going to add, you know, we're talking about 300 trips a day.  You're probably looking at more like 600, 700 trips a day.  And God forbid that Chico Unified ever build their school site there  on Henshaw that they have left vacant and probably ask for another bond here soon  to try to do something else.  But if you added a school there, think about how many trips per day  would be added on those streets that already can't handle an additional load.  So I would just ask you to consider that.  I don't think that that is an unreasonable ask.  You know, and additionally, you look at adding more houses out there.  What's to stop other developers from wanting to tack on to this?  And, you know, the developer here is asking a lot.  You know, see it right there on the agenda item.  Asking for, you know, a negative declaration.  You're asking for general plan amendment, zoning amendment.  You're asking for annexation.  These are a lot of asks here to build 74 homes.  I'm not against housing.  I think Chico definitely needs more housing.  But the plan as it is is going to severely impact the neighborhoods,  the feel of the neighborhood, the residents who have lived there,  whether you've lived there for a year,  or 30 years, you're going to have a negative impact.  And to do that and to subdivide this into 74 lots  when the county plan is one per,  that's asking a huge amount of difference.  The last thing I want to add is it was just a touch on the Henshaw Park.  I hope that the developer has to spend some money  and do some impact fees and some development fees  that will go to CARD.  So they can finally...  you know, find some money and develop that park.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Jared Geiser, followed by Dan Heal.  Good evening, commissioners.  Good evening, staff.  I'm here tonight representing the Alta Cal Audubon Society.  And I'm speaking today because we're an organization  that is committed to the protection of native birds  and their habitats.  And so we are really concerned with how local land use decisions  affect wildlife habitat and affect climate change.  And so to be clear, when I'm not speaking today  as to whether or not we support the project or not,  just simply just providing input into how the development  could better protect the birds  and better meet the identified housing needs of our community.  So in regards to Orchard Creek Estates,  we are chiefly concerned with the potential for this project  to provide more climate-friendly housing.  And so this, ideally, by providing more housing  with a higher density,  the housing that is built on this site  could not only serve the needs of the community,  but could also serve residents with an above-moderate income,  but could also serve residents of all income levels.  So by diversifying the zoning,  you'd be diversifying who would be able to afford  to buy these homes and move in here.  And so the current zoning of the entire site  is low-density, would preclude housing  that would be affordable to a lot of the residents here in Chico.  And so I'd like to quote the City of Chico's general plan  about compact urban development.  So compact urban development is the efficient use of land  with strong,  integrated,  and integrated uses.  A compact urban form reduces the rate of farmland  and habitat conversion.  It makes efficient use of existing infrastructure  and public services,  increases the viability of transit  by adding higher densities and intensities of development.  And so on.  And the last sentence of this quote is,  a well-planned,  quality-built,  compact urban form  is the intent of the general plan.  And so this is a site that is located right next to  a corridor opportunity site,  East Avenue corridor opportunity site,  which has the potential,  and which is planned to include higher density development,  mix of commercial and residential development.  And if you recall,  City of Chico just went through a housing element update.  One of the goals and actions,  goal four, action 2.5,  in the most recent housing element update  was to actually expand these corridor opportunity sites.  And so one way to do it would be using a site  just like this one,  just down the street from the East Avenue corridor opportunity site,  and not putting as few houses,  as allowable,  you know,  not doing low density development over the whole site,  but maybe doing higher density development on the East Avenue side.  And then,  then gradually decreasing density as you move north  to allow it to be integrated into the neighborhood a little bit better,  while also providing way more housing units,  utilizing land more efficiently,  and creating the city that our general plan really calls for.  So that is proposal I would make to the planning commission.  As you think of your recommendation to the city council,  and this is critically important because climate change threatens two thirds of all North American bird species with extinction,  and poses significant threats to the safety of Chico residents  as identified in the climate vulnerability assessment.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you, Jared.  Dan Heal followed by Bill Hack.  Ladies and gentlemen,  my name is Dan Heal.  I am currently the president of the Chico Masonic Family Center Board of Directors.  And so I'd like to make a few comments,  a few questions,  and a recommendation or two.  We are located right there next to this new development that's proposed,  and a very significant number of those houses back up to the property,  to our property.  And we rent the grounds out to the public.  And by that we mean we have Sober Grad Night,  which has an outside band that they use for that,  for example,  for Chico High.  Chico Warrior Fly Fishers Dinner.  We have Shriners events that are inside and outside.  Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation meets there.  We have car shows.  We have Quinceanera celebrations there.  Boy Scouts of America.  It's a voting location designation.  And what we're concerned about is we make noise.  And it was very nice that we had the developer come and visit us last fall,  and assured us that our activities there wouldn't change.  You know, we could go on with what we do.  There wouldn't be any restrictions or anything like that.  But then we saw in the paper 74 homes on 15 acres.  That's extreme.  And like I said, a bunch of those are going to back up to this property.  So we are concerned to say the least.  What we're concerned about basically on that is that old story about the airport.  You know, you allow people to build a house in the flyway and pretty soon the airport has to move.  Well, is the Masonic Family Center going to have to move in a number of years?  Because of the activities we have there and have had there for 30, 40 years now?  So that's a question that needs to be addressed.  And we also have to worry about this cell tower.  Now we have low rates for people that we use there.  We rent our building out significantly lower at times.  Compared to most other facilities in the area.  But we get income off of that cell tower.  And who do we serve there?  Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Dish TV, Direct TV, the City Fire and Police also have a radio transmitter there as well.  So if that has to go or if there's a problem with that, and it's pretty high, it's up around 60 feet in the air,  it can be seen from that entire subdivision.  And so past that would impact the city.  And who knows what the future is going to bring for our area there?  As far as telecommunications and all is concerned.  Because these lots, a significant number of these lots back up to our property,  that means we're going to have a lot more people who could possibly complain as to what goes on there in our place.  In our property.  So we would like to suggest that we have a lot more people who could possibly complain as to what goes on there in our place.  So we would like to suggest that we have a decent, relatively high, 10 foot we'd recommend block wall on the two sides of our property  where these lots back up to us.  Is that unreasonable?  I don't know.  But we'd be allowed to stay there a lot longer if we don't have to worry about the noise we make from time to time.  And could you wrap it up please?  Could you wrap it up please?  That's it, basically speaking.  So that's where our concerns are.  And if something like that could be looked at before this is actually brought up.  So if you guys have voted on and approved, we would appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bill Hack followed by Nate Heslop.  Good evening and thank you for taking your time this Thursday evening to support the citizens of Chico.  I own a residence, my name is Bill Hack, I own a residence within a thousand feet of this development.  And I actually thought I was going to be the only one up here in support of the project, but I am definitely in support of the project.  I actually was almost certain I was going to be the only one who thought it should be a higher density than it is currently proposed.  But that's not the fact either.  I do think that the density should be higher on this project.  The needs of the citizens of Chico, they need this type of lower priced housing.  I happened to listen to a thing from the Chamber of Commerce.  There's just a little over 100 houses available on the market right now.  And that's causing the prices of housing in Chico to be almost unaffordable to young professionals and young people.  And that's unfortunate.  I know the general plan itself wants higher density, lower cost housing.  And this is an opportunity for that, contiguous with the City of Chico.  And fortunately I've been around the City of Chico and the planning process for quite some time.  I remember the discussions of Bill Muir and the concerns.  And they're coming to fruition, frankly.  You're not going to get one person to pay for the money to do a specific plan for that entire area.  So what's going to happen?  People are going to come in.  They're going to come in piecemeal, buy the properties, put in one acre lots.  And you're going to end up with, as I forget who said the term, a bunch of McMansions out there,  which is not what the large portion of the City of Chico needs.  We do need some houses in that price zone.  But we need much more in the lower price zone.  I happen to know two friends who are trying to buy houses here in the City of Chico recently.  Unless you're a cash buyer and you're coming in over asking,  you have no chance of getting a starter home in the City of Chico these days.  And that's unfortunate for a town that I've grown up in and loved.  So thank you for your time.  Thank you, Bill.  Nate Hesop followed by Ben Reed.  Ian and Christian, thank you for your time.  I think a lot of my neighbors are going to be like,  you know, we've already expressed a lot of concerns that we all have.  I live on Lorry Drive, which is one of those R1 parcels that's adjacent to the right,  as an earlier person said.  I think my neighbors and mine's main concern is not,  I totally echo a lot of Mr. Tatro's sentiment about the need for housing,  for these lower density housing.  But I think it's the volume in the small amount of space,  and particularly as it pertains to traffic.  I'm very gratified to hear that Mr. Cooper took the time to come out to our neighborhood.  And perhaps by that you see that it is already a problem.  I live on Lorry Drive, which is approximately two blocks from East Avenue down Gwynn.  And already the majority of the people who live on my street and Royal Drive,  across the way, across Gwynn from me,  already turn left and go down Henshaw to Cusick if we wanted to go left.  It's impossible to turn on East Avenue right now.  I can't imagine what it would be like to have a lot of people in the area,  or the impact of that many more cars in the neighborhood would have on that pre-existing condition.  I'd also like to say, and I've heard some other people say it,  echo the fact that we can't think about this in a vacuum,  because not only is this development happening,  but all those orchards that have been cleared,  and that a lot of us in the neighborhood have heard from the people who are in the neighborhood,  are going to be developed either with the one acre parcels or in some other way in the future.  It's been a lot of change.  It's been a lot of change.  And a lot of development that has happened over the recent years,  further down the line on Nord and on El Arredeo and on Gwynn,  and it seemed to be planned.  And then also in conjunction with the apartment complex that's going in the corner of Cusick and East Avenue,  we're looking at ostensibly as many as 500 people being added into almost one square mile.  And we really feel those of us who have young families in the neighborhood,  it's going to have a huge impact,  not only on the quality of life,  but on the traffic, the flow, the safety of the neighborhood.  It's a lot of change and a lot of time.  And so we'd like you to consider that impact, consider that plan.  It's what the plan would be for traffic turning on East Avenue right there off of Nord by the railroad track.  It would be a hell of a traffic undertaking, I would say,  whatever that's going to be planned there.  So thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ben Reed,  followed by LaDonna.  I'm nervous.  Last time I spoke in this room,  I was sitting where you guys are sitting.  I was on the architectural review board in 1989.  I made a mistake in 1989 while I was on the board.  I allowed a vehicle,  an out of town developer to come in and push a project that didn't fit the city of Chico.  But because there was so much pressure on the board to accept this new development,  I acquiesced.  I still feel bad about it.  The reason I tell you that is because I think that you guys have an important decision to make.  There are good points on both sides.  I understand the need for low income housing.  I'm a builder.  I work in multifamily, low income housing.  I know the need.  But I would just ask you guys to take a minute and reflect how important this decision is,  because it will be the creep that will,  change that whole area.  The second thing I'd ask you to consider is,  historically,  since the 70s,  early 80s,  Belle Mere has been identified by the county and the city as a unique area.  And to be treated as a unique area, complete.  Anytime we've had discussions with the city,  with the county or the city,  they say we have to solve the problems for the entire area.  If you do little pieces,  you will create bigger problems.  I think a lot of the speakers here tonight and some of your comments have,  have recognized that as potential danger.  With respect to the developer,  there has been change  in these last 40 years,  the Belle Mere area.  The Green Line has moved.  There's been discussions.  There's been a plan.  But I believe the neighborhood,  and your responsibility,  there's a,  a con,  an expectation,  a reasonable expectation,  that has been put on that development  for the last 40 years,  to be treated as a whole.  And to carve a piece out  and treat it differently  with the idea of potential creep,  I believe is a danger.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ben.  Our last speaker, LaDonna.  Hi, this is the right side.  I'm LaDonna Kanegi.  And I don't live immediately on this side of East Avenue.  I'm on the other side.  And I'm really more concerned about  taking a big picture look  at traffic in this area.  And having complete streets that are safe  and walkable and livable.  For not just cars,  that we have cars,  we have streets that address  all modes of transportation  and all abilities.  We have a new development  on the Henshaw and Cus,  or Cusack and East,  that's started now.  One of the orchards,  that's more near my house,  off West Lindo on Nord,  is being developed also.  And Gwyn Bridge is supposed to be going through  some sort of a change.  Those streets, West Lindo and Gwyn,  can't handle the amount of traffic  that'll be coming through here.  I think we need a really comprehensive  look at the traffic there.  So I had a concern with the very long cul-de-sac  in that, sure, if we build the park on Henshaw,  that's great,  but if you live in that cul-de-sac,  you're gonna have to walk all the way up  and all the way down  and all the way back to get to that.  Are there gonna be any openings  between that cul-de-sac  to connect for bicyclists  and pedestrians to get out of there?  Or is it just drive in and drive out?  So really thinking about the urban fabric  of this neighborhood  and how can we not only drive our cars there,  but walk there,  ride our bikes there,  and move around there  with other modes of transportation  in a safe manner.  And so I do think that East Avenue,  it does have public transit.  And if there's higher density nearer East Avenue,  makes more sense.  And maybe having a gradient of higher density  as you go further away,  I could see more density near East Avenue  where we've got the bus line and such.  And then really thinking about that whole area.  I understand when I went to the city  to the meeting on the west window  that there's some traffic study that's being done.  They mentioned a traffic study.  I haven't really found anything else out about it.  So I don't know if there's some sort of  a comprehensive traffic study for that side of town.  We're kind of the bastard stepchild there.  We don't have any street lights.  We don't have any landscaping in the median.  And so I would really like to have that  looked at holistically.  So thank you very much.  Can you clarify what you're saying?  What street did you just mention?  Gwynn Avenue.  You were asking about a traffic study?  Oh, just the entire area.  Just that whole, generally that end of that west, east,  and that whole area.  Because there's an enormous amount of development  that's going on around there.  And it's all going to impact what's already  kind of somewhat of a walkable environment,  but with many, many breaks in the path  that really need to be looked at.  So I'm just going to leave that to make it a complete street.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Chair, while I just want to maybe give the applicant  an opportunity to speak.  So the first thing I'd like to do is,  I did hire the wrong tree guy to remove those,  and he did not have permission to go on your property,  and I'd like to publicly apologize.  Hi, Chuck.  Sir, sir, Chuck, you're going to address your comments.  I'm sorry.  I was apologizing to the lady,  the gentleman who did take down the trees.  He did not have permission to go on her property,  and I wanted to apologize to her.  I just want to go on a couple points here.  Is the one gentleman,  he has great points about people piecemealing,  but LAFCO has very strict rules  of how they do annex into the city of Chico,  which gives higher density,  which would prohibit just somebody  in the middle of nowhere  sailing to become part of the city.  Well, you can't create islands.  You have to be, I think it's,  what, 60-something percent surrounded by the city.  So this would basically complete the neighborhood  that is already an R1 area,  create a safer way to walk around there  with the sidewalks and everything,  and it would complete that corner.  It wouldn't change anything else.  I don't see anywhere where anybody else  could say it wouldn't create an island,  and LAFCO would not go for that.  I'm sure a lot of you guys are aware of that.  So the tower,  the Masonic Center,  there's no problem with the tower.  I can speak with them about, you know,  what kind of mitigation or something for the sound,  but also we can,  it's kind of like when we do,  when we build subdivisions by the airport,  we have to do an abrogation easement with the city,  which is on their deed that says,  airplanes are going to make noise.  We could do something similar to these houses  that back up to the Masonic Center saying,  hey, their hours of operation are by law,  you know, they can make noise  and they can make noise  until 11 o'clock,  even a single family home can,  and make it where, you know,  those houses are back up there.  I don't want to, by any means,  disrupt their business.  I've actually been to their business many times.  Another thing too,  which is very interesting,  is that we're talking about being kind of consistent  with the general plan.  Well, even if that whole SPA was designed by somebody,  that area would be,  and probably would be a lot higher  than 4.8 units per acre.  Like I said, under R1,  it could go as high as seven.  After the neighborhood moving,  I did reduce it, I believe by,  I reduced it by a number of houses  in order to lower the density  at the wishes of the neighbors.  At some point,  and I don't want to build million dollar homes for people.  That's just not who I,  I don't live in a million dollar home.  I live in a subdivision.  And I'd like to build houses  that are affordable for people.  I hope I got everything.  And then the one gentleman saying  about fees for the park,  my company has paid close to $20 million  in impact fees in the last four or five years.  So I like to think that us developers  do help for parks and everything else  that needs to go with communities.  Thank you.  Thank you, Joe.  Okay, we'll bring it back to the commission.  Any comments, questions, or observations?  I think I just have a general concern  that the neighbors and the developers  and some of us mentioned  is just the Bellmere SPA.  Mr. Tatro had to apply for not just a TSTM,  a tentative subdivision track map,  but he also had to apply  for a general plan amendment and a rezone.  And so if we can't,  if we can't keep doing these developments  the way that we are,  for the fact that he did want to increase the zoning,  he has to spend a lot more time and money  and an environmental review to do.  So I don't have an answer or solution for that,  but I just wanted to bring that up.  Anybody else?  I have some questions for staff.  Not to put you on the spot,  but I didn't have these questions beforehand.  Can you give us a staff?  I mean,  about the status update on the Henshaw Park  and what, you know,  the current timing is for that to be completed and...  I cannot.  It would be a card park.  What I can say is that the houses  and the subdivision will be required  to pay the development impact fees,  which include park fees,  which go into a fund  that the city gives to CART to build parks.  And they're going to build an aquatic center  and someday in the future,  they may build a park there.  Part of what happens is, you know,  road projects,  capital improvement road projects  and park projects show up after the houses get built  and there's a demand in place.  Not before that.  Sure.  So all we know for certain  is that the land has been set aside for a park  at some point in the future  once the area is developed.  Yes, there's a park land there.  One person commented on buffer zones.  And if you don't know this offhand,  do we know what the setback distance is?  The city requires disclosures  within a thousand feet of agricultural zoned property.  This property is just over a thousand feet,  but we're adding that as a recommended condition anyway.  I changed the words.  Instead of saying zoned,  it just says used for agriculture.  Then the city requires when you're within,  when you're along the sphere of influence  adjacent to agriculture,  that we provide a hundred foot buffer,  which can be a street or open space  or something that's not somebody's yard.  So we're not up against a sphere of influence.  The sphere of influence is where the green line is  a thousand feet away.  Could you summarize for us  what road improvements either the builder  or the future residents will have to pay out for?  Yeah, before the map can be recorded  and lots being sold,  the sub provider will have to provide,  build the streets.  So these are going to be along the edges.  The existing streets Hinshaw and Nord would have  from the center line over improved  to city street standards,  curb gutter and sidewalk,  complete streets.  And then the internal streets  would also be complete streets.  And there is a pedestrian connection  from the end of the cul-de-sac out to the corner  where the bus line is.  Thank you.  Okay.  Anybody else?  Are we talking amongst each other  or are we just talking questions?  We can do both.  I'm just trying to understand.  There's 75 houses,  average of three people per house.  No park, nowhere to ride your bikes,  nowhere for these kids to play.  They can't ride on the streets  because it's bumpy and full of potholes.  We don't know when a park is coming.  What do we, is this normal for someone,  Tony, maybe you can answer that.  I don't know.  I don't know what this,  I'm trying to understand what to do.  Where are these kids going to play?  Where are these people going to go?  And then of course the traffic issues  which I've already had large concerns over.  So, and we're breaking this apart.  You know, this is a big,  this is a big project.  There's, there needs to be,  I feel like there needs to be  a little bit more something.  I'm a pro builder  and this is what's,  I'm having some conflict here.  But if we do this,  yeah, and they just start,  now we have a bunch of these with no parks,  nowhere to go,  no bike paths.  So, I'm just trying to understand  what's going on.  I don't know if anybody has any experience  or anything that can help me on this.  Well, this is what happens  when you have land  that's owned by 150 different people.  It's, it's,  it's nearly impossible  to have a master plan  on a piece of property like this.  Yeah, and I'll just add that  it's, it's not uncommon at all  to see that, you know,  the amenities kind of lag behind  on a 30-year property.  The demand, sometimes they get ahead.  It's not usually the case.  Usually it lags a little bit,  but it kind of catches up in the long run.  But it's coming together, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I think, Paul, to your point,  and I, I deeply respect Mr. Tatro  and the impact that he has had on Chico  and the thoughtfully planned subdivisions  we've approved,  we've approved,  and we've done this here.  I can't even get myself  to consider the subdivision  because I'm still stuck  on that first general plan reason.  And so I, while I appreciate the comments  on the impacts of the subdivision,  here's kind of the,  the burden that I feel like I'm carrying,  and we all carry this very differently  and weigh different options.  So, I think, you know,  we are in an era And we all carry this very differently and way different options as in feasible and maybe unlikely as the Bell Mirror special planning area is that was not this body's decision that was made. That special planning area was something that came out of months, years of community engagement, community planning, lots of hours of the planning commission, the city council, city staff, lots of reporting.  in which we are in an era That special planning area was something that came out of months, years of community engagement, community planning, lots of hours of the planning commission, the city council, city staff, lots of reporting.  the planning commission, the city council, city staff, lots of reporting. And I was one of those  sitting in the back listening to that. And really the general plan for me is akin to our U.S.  Constitution. That is my guiding document when I'm up here. So to change something in the general  plan requires a higher burden for me to say, what is there? And we've seen general plan amendments  since I've been on the planning commission, but that has typically looked like a number of property  owners coming and saying, this just doesn't work. And very little, very little disagreement with  that. This is not that case. So we have something where the guiding documents that we have say,  we want this in the special planning area, as infeasible as that may be, I'm not going to  unwind that. And my vote would not be to undo that community process. And we have, what, 12, 13  speakers, maybe 10 of them were opposed to this. It's just, it doesn't seem like it fits the way  that other general plan amendments or rezones have come to us.  In my history. That was a really long answer. Sorry.  No, that was great. That was from the small. Thank you.  I think you've raised a really good point there. We start with the general plan  and then go from there. And I am concerned as a precedent, you know,  kind of someone used the term shipping off, you know, parts of the specific plan area and the  effects of that. And I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.  You know, in terms of providing that critical mass of financing and whatnot to pull together  something in the future. Now, if that's ever going to happen, are we ever going to get a  specific plan here? I don't know. I think it'd be a real challenge to do that. So I'm kind of  stuck on one hand. I want to say, yeah, let's go ahead and proceed. But on the other hand,  we've got this specific plan and a general plan that says treat it a little differently.  That's what I'm wrestling with.  Having been very familiar with master planning, the very first thought I had was, why was  this ever a special planning area to begin with?  It's something that I would never see ever coming to fruition.  Somebody spoke about creeping.  Well, it's already happening.  The neighborhood directly adjacent to it is basically the same exact thing that's being  proposed before us tonight.  I think if we don't approve this, I think it's just a matter of time before somebody  goes to the county and slowly approves it.  It'll happen.  It'll turn into residential.  The density may be very hodgepodge, depending on how much it's going to be.  It's how the county wants to handle it.  That's what I have concerns over.  If we don't approve it, it doesn't mean the development isn't happening.  It means it's happening at a lower density.  The one thing that I could consider happening in the future is the whole area annexed in,  and then we can do our own zoning, and it's not just a specific plan.  Then people don't have to come forward and do the general plan amendment and the annexation  on top of the subdivision.  I don't know.  Okay.  I do agree with one of the comments that you had earlier about the higher density possibly  being up against West East Avenue because it is higher density along that whole corridor.  In keeping with the neighborhood, some of those lots in the subdivision I could see  being higher density.  To me, it just seems like we have such a battle of everybody wants lower price.  They are in favor of lower price housing.  They don't want the prices to keep going up and up and up.  It's a simple supply and demand issue.  I think the location being closer towards East Avenue in the outskirts of what is  considered  If you are going to start piecing this off,  this is  And  is  is  is  is  is  is  is  population for that. The most  people want homes that I would  assume are going to be in this price range.  That's what most people need  and what most people can afford.  And to your point of kids playing  and not having, you know,  they'll have a  backyard and they need a place to live.  That's what they need.  That's my two cents on that.  And though I feel for  Mrs. Scott's sentiment about the general  plan, and this is a very heavy  issue that we have before us,  we spent a lot of time  on the housing element.  Many, many, many hours.  And one of the things  that I  still can't comprehend  was when I asked if we had ever  met ARENA numbers in  any of the housing plans for Chico,  and the answer was no.  So we have the opportunity  to work towards meeting some of those numbers  and for me it would be difficult  to pass this up.  And for me, I don't want to,  because it's going to happen in 10 years,  doesn't mean we accept something  that might not be right.  So I do want to counter that a little bit.  I do apologize.  And I just lost my train of thought.  Sorry.  Let me come back to that.  So I work on housing element review.  There comes a point where there's a lack of land  and you have to figure out how to rezone that land.  I'm afraid that if we have this at low density,  what if in the seventh or eighth year,  that meets housing element cycle?  We're going to have to figure out  where the medium density,  or where all of the different ARENA,  we have the ARENA allocation,  but where are the sites for that?  I would say we just built 3,000,  we have about 3,000 low income units  that just came on board too as well.  So we're not,  I think there's been more of those  than any other thing built in Chico, if I'm correct.  So yes, back to that point,  just because something might happen  or someone else will do it,  it doesn't mean we have to do it.  There is a bigger thing here in general,  something that is going to be nasty in 10 years.  And so that's just what I'm going to share back.  And I get it, Butte County might do it,  might make million dollar homes,  might make $20,000 homes,  might make five story apartments, I don't know.  That's not my thing,  but just right now I'm feeling a little icky about it.  Well, I see this as a good project at a good time  and in a good place.  And I'll ask for your opinion.  I'll ask for a motion.  You want to make a motion?  Pardon?  I don't think I can make it.  I'll make it.  I'll move the Planning Commission  to offer resolution number 24-02,  recommending that the City Council adopt  the mitigated negative declaration and approve the,  the general plan amendment,  rezone and tentative subdivision map  for the Orchard Creek Estates project  subject to the attached conditions.  Anybody want a second?  Second.  Okay.  Nicole, you have to call the roll.  Commissioner Cooper?  No.  Commissioner Loffins?  Yes.  Commissioner Poulin?  Yes.  Commissioner Scarpa?  No.  Commissioner Wolff?  No.  Vice Chair Scott?  No.  Yes.  Chair Wall?  Yes.  It appears it failed.  The vote is prevailing.  The vote is still in session.  I'm still thinking of recommendations.  What do you mean?  Okay.  I move that the Planning Commission deny  resolution number 24-02,  recommending that the City Council not adopt  the mitigated negative declaration and approve the,  the general plan amendment and not approve,  sorry, the general plan amendment rezone  and not approve the tentative subdivision map  for the Orchard Creek Estates project  subject to the attached conditions.  Second.  I have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk.  Commissioner Cooper?  Yes.  Commissioner Loffins?  Yes.  I have a choice.  You do?  Yeah.  We'll just go.  Yes.  No.  Sorry.  Commissioner Poulin?  No.  Commissioner Scarpa?  Yes.  Commissioner Wolff?  Yes.  Vice Chair Scott?  Yes.  Chair Wall?  No.  Clarify Loffins, did you say yes or no?  Ma'am. Okay. So it doesn't matter, I guess, because for the record.  Ma'am.  Ma'am. So it doesn't matter, I guess, because for the record. And just a sec. And just a sec. Passes 5-2. Anybody else want to try?  That passed.  Pardon?  That passed.  Five two.  Okay, regular agenda, there was nothing.  There was nothing.  Reports and communications.  Brutes, there's something for us.  Yes, Mr. Chair.  Earlier, about a week ago, I sent you all an email  and I asked you to sort out amongst yourselves  who can attend the Planning Commissioner's training  in March in Long Beach.  And what I'd like to get from you today,  I've got three openings.  So far I've got Commissioner Scott that's interested,  Commissioner Cooper is interested,  but he's on the also, he's a backup.  Yeah, I'm also interested.  And then,  I think that maybe all the people  that have expressed an interest.  Commissioner Wolf, you expressed an interest too.  Yes.  All right, so I have two and I'm looking for one more  that's available to attend the Planning Commissioner's.  That's two.  Okay.  Thank you.  If I may, just to underscore the importance  that I think these kinds of training sessions offer,  it's a great opportunity to get in and talk about it.  Yeah, they'll have, they'll probably have  conflict of interest.  They'll have some of the required training  that we'll have you do.  And then you'll be able to, so to speak,  talk shop and almost commiserate with some of your, you know,  your other colleagues in the state  and exchange ideas about what they're going through,  the topics.  A lot of these same things are hitting at the same time.  Housing, housing elements, affordability,  missing middle housing, all those things.  I would be interested if no one else is interested.  You're behind Commissioner Cooper, so.  It's in person only?  Yes. Yes.  I would be interested if it was, you know,  if it was a full-time job.  Okay. Well, I'm trying to get, we need to get Nicole.  So I've got Commissioner Scott and Wolf.  Doesn't seem like I've got any others.  Then, yeah, well then it,  then it seems like Commissioner Cooper would be the next.  If you, the two of you can't go,  cause then Nicole can get working on making your  registration and travel arrangements.  And so that fits fine if that works for everybody else.  Thank you.  I will be emailing you the information  and we'll be in contact.  Yes.  You're welcome.  That concludes my report, Mr. Chair.  I don't have any other.  Thank you.  We're recommending.  Regular meeting on Thursday, February 1st, 2024.  That meeting, Mr. Chair, is recommended for cancellation.  We're still holding February 15th open though.  Okay.  Does it work? Just stop me.  Maybe the 15th.  Thank you.
