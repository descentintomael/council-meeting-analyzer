 o'clock I'm going to go ahead and call to order our city of Chico Bidwell Park and Playground Commission regular meeting August 26, 2024. Roll call please. Commissioner Alexander. Commissioner Glatz. Commissioner Shearer is absent. Commissioner Shadley. Vice Chair Nava. Here. Chair Thomas Petty. Here. Okay number two on the agenda is the consent agenda. All matters listed under the consent agenda are to be considered routine and enacted by one motion. 2.1 is approval of the minutes of the May 20, 2024 Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. And I just wanted to mention one thing about the minutes. There's kind of a and this is just surely so we have a clean record. Throughout vice chair and chair are misused throughout the whole minutes. So I don't know if we want to just maybe clean that up. And I just wanted to prove to you that I'd read the minutes. So that's the only change that I saw that otherwise. Do we need to pull this item for any other reason? You can just say as amended. What's that? You can say as amended. Oh as amended. Yes. Okay. I'll make a motion to approve as amended. We have a second? I'll second. Commissioner Alexander. Aye. Commissioner Blatchley. Aye. Commissioner Glatz. Yes. Commissioner Shadley. I wasn't here. I'll abstain. Chair Thomas-Petty. Oh, I'm sorry. Commissioner Nava. Aye. Chair Thomas-Petty. Yes. Okay. We're at item four on the agenda which is the public comments section. Do we have any public comments? No? Okay. 5 public hearings? No? Number 6. Our regular agenda. 6 point 1. Consideration of a request from the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post-1555 to properly retire American flags in Children's Playground or another suitable location. The Bidwell Park and Playground Commission will consider a request from the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post-1555 to VFW for for for location in Chic o City Lim It will are providing permits to bury synthetic flags ceremonially once per year. They are looking for a location or locations large enough to accommodate and be ADA accessible to a group of people and honor guard and presentation space. A report from Linda Herman. thank you. I think you pretty much as usual summed up what my staff report said. I had originally thought immediately about children's playground because there already is a World War I memorial there and it's got that area of bark in the trees there. Unfortunately though because that was before I knew the size of the hole, six by six by six to eight feet. So I reached out to the facilities supervisor and he confirmed what I was afraid of is that the The reason is that that is where all of our infrastructure is. All of the irrigation lines, water lines, electrical lines, et cetera. It is not going to quite work for that large of the hole for that initial year. Again, it is only that large because they have had this backlog of synthetic flags that they haven't been able to do anything with. They didn't want to burn them because of the material that they are made of. So my thought was maybe we can find another location or they can find another location if we can't help them in that regard. And then possibly we can find another location if we can't help them in that regard. And possibly maybe that area could be used in the future because the whole idea is they hopefully won't have that many flags to retire every year. And it may not even be every year. It could be every other year or just when they get to the point where they need them to bury it. So it could possibly be a place because I think there are some areas that may not have that infrastructure in that area. But other than that, that isn't going to work as what he originally thought for the first year anyway. So that is kind of where we are right now. And I think that will be the end of the presentation. I will just kind of put our heads together to see if there is a place that we could offer or if not, then he can look at other locations elsewhere. So that' s why unless you have any questions that' s all I have. But like I said, the applicant is here if you have questions of them. would you like to come to the podium and say anything about your proposed project? only if there are specific questions. I will just say that I think it' s a great opportunity to thank you. do any commissioners have questions or comments? my only thought and it may not be accessible but I think it' s called the veterans cross in upper park. I may be not saying the name correctly. it' s the easter cross is what they call it. yes. because I understand that is dedicated to veterans. I think it' s a great opportunity to be fenced in to keep dogs out. I don' t know about the ada accessibility. just a thought. I can' t think of anywhere else. thank you. can I just comment on that? digging a six by six hole in upper park would probably because of the nature of the. it would be hard to dig. that' s for sure. I initially thought upper park too. but that would take. I don' t know what. I don' t know. okay. okay. okay. okay. okay. okay. okay. okay. okay. okay. okay. okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay than burning nylon. Commissioner Flex? It seems like an admirable idea to me. And 3,500 acres, I think we could find something someplace. Even when I think of just the one-mile area, which is where the horseshoe pitch used to be, and maybe putting up just a flag. So there's some cost maybe just doing something like that. But there are areas where we could just put a flagpole up and an American flag and then start doing it there. It doesn't seem like an exorbitant cost to honor all that kind of stuff. So just an idea. The only thing I could comment on that, but I'm sure it's a big enough area we can find, is if you recall when we were looking at the traffic circulation study and what we were going to do in that portion of Lower Park, one of the ideas was to make that area a bike path to the bridge. But it would be closer to the road, so there's probably a big enough area behind that. But that was one of those. One of the suggestions from engineering is that we get them off the parking lot and into their own bike path through that area. But it will be closer to the road and not necessarily the whole area. Does anyone else have a comment, question, idea? So does that mean we're going to look at these different areas around? Yeah. And we can come back. We can look together possibly. Okay. Yeah. The idea with the ADA accessible is so we can have community involvement and we can have presentations even down to the ceremonial boxes, having local carpenters building ceremonial boxes, artists putting up patriotic artwork, decorating the boxes, have some education on the flag, what it means to different people, and what it means to our communities. So that area. I mean, it has a parking lot there, too. Yes. I have a question. Did you get this idea from another municipality, another city, or no? No. I just found myself in charge of flag retirement and took it upon myself to find another way of doing it besides that. We would be looking at retiring natural fiber cloths or natural fiber flags by burning. This would be entirely for the synthetic flags. Okay. Well, I will do a little research. Maybe it is such that other communities do something like that. We could borrow some ideas from them. In my research and looking, I have found other methods of destroying flags, but it involves more defacing. It' s where you' re stripping the flag of the stripes. Yes. Yes. I think it would be nice to have a flag that is not a flag of the stripes and then at that point it' s no longer a flag so it could theoretically be disposed of in the landfill. I really don' t like the idea of our American flags going in a landfill even if they' ve been disassembled or defaced. There' s a lot of us feel the same way. A nice ceremonial location would be quite nice. should we move to bring this back next month? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. after we all do a little research, have a solution or some ideas, and maybe we'll all scour the park and see if there's a place that jumps out or that would potentially work. Does that sound okay? I would be more than happy to come back, and thank you for your time. Do I need to make a motion? Do we need to make a motion on that? No, it's just direction. It's fine. Okay, great. Thank you. We're at 6.2 on the regular agenda, consideration of a request to conduct an erosion awareness art project in Upper Bidwell Park. The Bidwell Park and Playground Commission will consider a request from Eve Warner, a local artist and Bidwell Park volunteer, to conduct a participatory environmental art project in Upper Bidwell Park. The intent of the project is to increase the public's awareness of the extensive erosion that is occurring in the area. along the trails near Monkey Face in the park. We'll hear from Linda Herman, our park and natural resources manager. Yes, and again, you summarized it well, but I did want to introduce Eve Warner, who is the artist who's making this proposal before you, and she's got a presentation she'd like to show. Hi. Hello. I'm Eve Warner, and I'm seeking approval of this project, which is intended to raise awareness of the importance of the Bidwell Park project. This project is called for the purpose of providing a place for the use of trail erosion in Upper Bidwell Park. And it's called the Erosion Line. Thank you. Let's see. I'm going to use the equipment here. So these are my qualifications for leading this project. And I just want to say I am wanting to volunteer my skills, my expertise, and my time for this project to help this place that is really my favorite place in the whole world. Thank you. So trail erosion exists to, I would say, medium to severe extent on virtually every trail in Upper Bidwell Park. And it's really due to our unique geology, and this is the same geology that makes the upper park so wild and gorgeous. But it features, let's see if I can get my pointer. So this section of trail really is a nice way to understand the trail. And it's a very interesting way to understand what we have. So this is volcanic bedrock that was formerly covered with a thin layer of topsoil and vegetation. But in a not very long time, this has eroded away. And it's really just due to normal park use. Nothing wild is happening here. It's just the nature of our geology makes the trails very, very fragile. So what happened here is there was a small trail, a dirt trail up at the top here. And just walking on it, riding a bike on it, compacts the soil and that makes it a little channel so that rainwater flows down it. And as the rainwater flows down, it goes through that topsoil, it erodes away the topsoil layer very quickly and gets down to the bedrock. And then it moves really, really quickly because it's like basically in a gutter. And with each rainstorm, more and more of the soil is washed away until you, you end up with a large swath of denuded area. The red line on that is what I call the existing edge of erosion. And if you were to go out in a heavy rainstorm, you could actually see this in action. You would see that the rain comes, it falls on this pavement-like surface and it runs downhill until it bumps into the soil. And then it runs along this soil edge. And so each time there's a rainstorm, a little more of the soil is eroded away. And you can see how damaging this can become. Now this was never a sanctioned trail. This was just a hillside that was, this was all filled with soil, about two to three feet more soil than is there now. And there were plants growing on top. The roots helped hold the soil in place. But people would take a shortcut down here and that did the same thing. It compacted the soil, made it into a concentrated, flow of water during a rainstorm. And now we're left with literally five dump trucks full of soil has been eroded away just in the area that you can see right here. So it's a big problem. And that soil comes downhill, can end up in Chico Creek. It affects water clarity. It affects the salmon fisheries. It can exacerbate flooding. And it adds more algae, it allows more algae to grow. And then another thing to note, is once an area is denuded like that with the bedrock exposed, plants can't grow there anymore. So I'm in the park several times a week. I talk to a lot of people and people love this park. But they really don't know that these three, there are two guys, three guys here, they absolutely did not know that this is erosion and most people do not. They just think this is how it is. And that's because erosion happens incrementally. And. It's for many people who have moved to Chico in the past few years. This is how it has always looked. But those of us who've been here a long time know that this is relatively new. So this is why I'd like to start the erosion line. And so what this is, it's a community built line on the edge of eroded trails on Monkey Face in Bidwell Park. And it has two purposes, to raise awareness of trail erosion and to provide a lot of water. And it's a reference point from which to measure progression of future erosion. And it's formed by chiseling these small holes in a triangular motif along the edge of erosion on, this is erosion exposed to bedrock. This was previously covered with soil, now it's not. So it will be very subtle and it will be permanent. These, this is what the, this is the, this is the, what the motifs will look like. And you can see how I was inspired by the bedrock mortars that are in the trail, are off the Tramai Du Trail in a cave and down by the day camp area in Boulders. And these are the holes that the acorn woodpeckers make to store their acorns. And the size of the holes will be roughly the same across as one of these acorn holes. So very small, less, less than a half an inch. So there are several features that are built into the design of the erosion line that are, will help people to learn about trail erosion. In this graphic, this yellow area here represents an, an erosion exposed bedrock area. The green area is the uneroded area next to the trail. And we'll install the motifs along the edge of the erosion with the tip of the edge. And the yellow area is the triangle touching the edge. And the shape of the triangle is an arrow-like shape. And it will be pointing in the direction that the erosion has been coming. So these will all be visual cues that will have materials for people to learn about. And they can learn how to read the erosion. The more closely spaced the motifs are, the more extensive the erosion it will be pointing at is. And the more extensive the erosion, the more extensive the erosion. And this dash line represents a potential future edge of erosion should the erosion continue. In which case, if the new edge of erosion is down here, instead of touching the edge of erosion, these will be floating in the middle of the trail. And that will be another visual cue for people to see that erosion is ongoing. It's not static. It gets worse over time. And by measuring the distance, from the original dot there to the new erosion, you can calculate what the rate of erosion is. So this is a tool to help people really understand that erosion is ongoing. It's not something that's one and done. This will be a volunteer-made project. I will be the volunteer lead acting as Bidwell Park Artisan Residents. And there are, my responsibility is to make sure that the organization's organization is And my responsibilities will be to coordinate with park and city staff. I will contact organizations looking for people who would like to come out and help build this line. And I will be in charge of training and supervising all work that is done on the line. I'll be out there every step of the way. And there are just so many potential organizations who are wanting to do this. And there's a big base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base if people don't know about a problem, they're just not motivated to find a solution. They're not motivated to do anything about it. So with the erosion line, we will literally be pointing at the erosion. We will literally be able to see as the erosion moves further and further away from where the motif is, literally be able to see it happening in real time. And the citizen participation, having volunteers out here, is really critical to this because as people are out here making these little holes, they'll become invested in this project. They will tell their friends, they'll tell their family, and this will create a ripple effect of awareness throughout our community about trail erosion. And as we start the erosion line, I will continue to increase community interaction with the project. So I'll be making a pamphlet that can be available at the Horseshoe Lake parking lot on the kiosk. Volunteer-led outings could be a fun thing. I can do it. I can train other PALS volunteers to do it and just bring people out there, show them how it works, and ask them if they want to make a mark. PR with local media, I have a lot of experience with press releases and would be happy to do local and regional media contacts. Interpretive signage, this is beyond what I'm personally proposing, but this would be super great to have interpretive signs around the parking lot to describe what trail erosion is, tell people how it's made, why it's a problem. And also I'd love to have a panel about the erosion line in addition to the brochures. And then citizen science and academic field work, using the erosion line to track erosion over the years will provide hard data. And this is super important in applying for grants to be able to afford repairing the existing erosion and ongoing erosion. And of course, this can be continued on other trails because there's a whole lot of erosion out there. And that's the end of my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions you have, and I really appreciate your time and your attention. And I hope that you'll approve this project so we can get started before the end of the year. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions or comments from the commission? Commissioner Alexander? Yes. How many hundreds, thousands, do you have an idea how many of these you're going to create? It will depend on volunteer participation. I'll be supplying, we'll make the holes with little sculpting tools. They're called points and a little chisel hammer. There's really no end. If you look at the entire upper Bidwell Park, this could be an ongoing project that lasts for years. Nothing would make me happier than if it got covered up because we started abating the erosion and things started growing back. But I anticipate just in Monkey Face alone, there are a couple of official trails. I think there's three or four official trails that go up to get to Monkey Face. And there are many, many more. And there's quite a bit of potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential potential like education is the end goal we need to get to, whether it's pamphlets or whatever, because the entire time you're talking about what's the goal and the goal is information outlay, but what is the end goal? Are we trying to keep people off the paths? I'm just saying, you know, when you talked about this ancillary paths that people make, I just think that your pamphlets need to have the goal in mind, not just education. How can we help? How can the person walking on the trail help this situation and stuff like that? Absolutely, yeah. I agree. And also, now that I know who you are, we really need help with, under the 99 Bridge, painting some things. Sorry, but just getting off topic. I've been trying for years to get them to go back, you know, the 99 Freeway, all those nice paintings that used to be on the things holding the highway up, they're all getting graffitied over and stuff like that. Yeah, so it's bare holes. But thank you for doing this. I personally think it's a great idea to create awareness of things like that. Commissioner Blatchley? So, there'll be no differentiation in your holes between the authorized trails and unauthorized trails. Is there going to be any blockage by the unauthorized trails? That's, or is that some of your project? My project is just the erosion line, making this point in time mark. And then what I'm hoping is that many people will become educated about it, and there will be people, lots of people wanting to help protect the park more. Not just, I know everybody here is doing their best, but it takes a community to in order, you know. Well, no. Thank you for this exciting project. Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your presentation and for this project. I have a question for linda. I was racking my brain and I just went back and looked at former minutes. In may of 2023 we had somebody come, a consultant, and presented to us a monkey face trail design concept and recreational trails grant application. The consultant came, and I was going to apply for a grant to provide better sustainable access to monkey face and give a whole presentation. I wondered if we ever heard back about that grant application and that would maybe in conjunction with your project. This was part of the problem. Part of the problem, if I remember correctly, that they wanted to get rid of all the unauthorized trails. Did we hear back ever about that? Yes. It was not awarded. I thought I put that in the report before. I apologize if I didn't. That' s okay. I was just remembering some of these things come up and I go wait a minute. It was a very competitive recreational trails grant process. We didn' t get it. You do bring up a good point. We have those designs. I kind of like your thinking, Mr. Blatchley, is that maybe we don' t mark the non-sanctioned tours, make them not marked. That helps people to know they' re on the right trail if they see those marked. I think that would give us more ammunition to see the difference and then get rid of those road trails as much as we can. That design I could give to eve so she could see which ones are the official trails that we want and where we want those trails and that might help too. I think that was a good idea. I' m not supposed to ask questions until I allow all my other commissioners to do so. Then I do have a couple of extra questions. I have a question for you. Have you tried to chisel and use these tools in volcanic rock, the same type of material? I won' t admit any. There are different types of rock. The Tuscan flow is generally like a petrified mud. It' s hard like pavement but it' s chiselable. That' s the areas that you see on the Annie Beach Trail. People have cut steps in. That' s chiselable. The Lovejoy Basalt is not. The trails that we' re talking about are on Monkey Face and on the slopes, the side slopes of the whole canyon. That part is, there' e chunks of, there' e conglomerate masses I think is what they' re called that are not chiselable. They' re the bumps that you fall over when you' re on the paths. The matrix that it' s in is chiselable. I' m thinking and we spoke before the meeting that bringing awareness to the erosion we would probably have some people come forward and say I' ve got a solution to this or here' s what we can do. I think that' s important. We can' t go in here with this is a great idea. But we don' t know what to do about it. Maybe we do go in and that' s when the ideas come flooding in. I don' t know. Definitely I think a solution needs to be a part of the whole package here. Proposed solutions. I do really think the idea of only putting, you should only put them on the sanctioned trails. That' s great. That' s a byproduct of this. Here' s the trail you stay on. You can look for the little dots to tell you you' re on the right trail. I think that' s great. How often did you say I was trying to do two things at once here? How often is this going to be an ongoing thing? The first thing I' ll do is coordinate with the parks personnel and get direction from them about where they' d like to focus. Then I' ll contact people in all the different clubs that I can possibly think of. If there' e any more that I don' t know about, I' m happy to hear and just make the same presentation with people and arrange scheduled dates for people to come out. We can' t have gigantic crowds out there because I only have so many sculpting tools. But working with small groups of say five to ten people would be maximum. Then just start to think about what we' I think if we start making the dots it' ll take a while to do it. But if there' e five people there and each of them make one triangle, that' s five more triangles that are slowly marching up the hill. So maybe restrict it and avoid the winter months? It sounds like that' s... Well, you don' t have to avoid the winter months. I would like to do it before then. I' m anticipating not in the monkey face area but because of the! fire, there' e probably be more erosion than we' e used to. But that will not be within the scope of this particular project. But you can definitely do it. Nobody' s going to want to do it on a rainy day. But we have a lot of days that aren' t rainy and I think nobody really will want to do it in July and August. Right. Okay. Any other questions? Is that okay? Yeah. Well, yeah. I didn' t want to cut you off. I was waiting and I was wondering if my other commissioners had the same thoughts as I did. I really liked everybody. I liked your presentation. Thank you. First of all, thank you. And then I was waiting. I know my other commissioners, fellow commissioners have really good thoughts on this. I' m kind of agnostic to it. Now that I don' t like it or I do like it, what I would like to see, like everybody else, is to protect our trails and our park. I' m just wondering how it will, how do you see it helping in the future to get it, to make it better? What I just see it providing is community awareness. And honestly, I' m out there several times a week and I have only run into a handful of people who even understand that erosion is happening. And you really can' t find people to support trail alternatives like building trails or building a road. And everybody knows that there's a big potential behind getting You can't find You can find find You find find find find find find find find find find find find you were talking about. There's a trails plan. All of this information is known, but there isn't money to do it. And so I'm hoping, what I'm really hoping is to educate the people who are out there using the park, let them know what's happening. And honestly, everybody loves this park to pieces. Nobody wants to hurt this park. And if they knew what was happening, there would be a lot of people supporting expenditures and having volunteers go out and do trail building and things like that. I know that Chico Velo already does that. There are groups that are out there doing it, but they're small groups and the problem is massive. You're welcome. Any other comments, questions, ideas? Vice Chair Nava, thank you. I just want to say thank you too. I thought it was a good presentation and I'm supportive of the idea of having a park. I think it's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. Because being someone who works in the world of where grant applications come in and considering applicants, I think that would give us a leg up to have some real concrete data. And plus, I think the tie-in of sort of that it has an art motif kind of going on with it would grab interest more than, say, maybe other applicants the next go-round. So that's just something to consider as well. Thank you. Thank you. I love your inspiration to was native American and natural I love those granary trees I' amazed by them I love you tied those two things together. If we don' t have any other comments or questions do we have any public comments on this project? I would like to make a motion that we approve it on the existing project. I will second it. I think that will keep me busy for a while. Commissioner Alexander? Aye. Commissioner Blatchley? Yes. Commissioner Glatz? Yes. Commissioner Shadley? Yes. Vice chair Nava? Yes. Chair Thomas-Peddie? Yes. Thank you very much. thank you for your time I really appreciate it. we are now at 6.3 and we will receive an update on the park fire in upper bidwell park from linda hermann and richie bamlett and the update will include the park fire impacts on the upper park and remediation and rehabilitation efforts. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . where the power lines are is where the original fire started, and that's right in here, right at this edge here. And I was up there probably about 15 after 3. It started at 10 to 3, and it was already up the hill. It was going really fast. So it got out of the park pretty quickly at that point, and so if that would have been just the area that was burned, that's all we would have seen as far as damage. But unfortunately, because the next day was a red flag warning day, it came back, and when it came back, it came back with a vengeance. So, and for us, and I'll show a drone video in a minute, it's really strange. I mean, some of the fire, it came over the top and stopped, you know, where there's a trail. If you go up there, some areas are green and brown. I mean, brown now, but the green areas. And then so. Where the most of the damage was, was from Beast Trail, which is right here, to the end of the road. It got really hot there, and that's when it crossed over also. And the ecological reserve, my understanding, got worse of it than we did. My understanding, it burned all but 700 acres, and it's 8,000 acres that they have up there. So we've been meeting and trying to figure out what we can do together to work. And I think that's one of the things that we're going to have to think about. So this is, in fact, I think what I'll do is I'll just get out of here, and then I think what we'll do, I'm going to show the video first, if that's okay. I'm going to show the drone video, and I'll, yeah. So we had actually one of our mechanics does drone work, and so this is the area that you see. And this is going from Bear Hole up, I believe. And so I'll speed it up a little bit because it does take a while to get there. But this is what, but it's strange because you have things that are still green, right? And it's just, it's really different than what you see at the end of the road. And the end of the road, it gets, it was pretty bad up there. So you can see the hot spots that were there. And this, I believe, is Metal Trail, I think. But then you see this. This is the area that didn't get burned at all. So, but it goes all the way up. Now, on the south side, they did a bulldozer line down Bloody Pin, or real close to where Bloody Pin is. And that stopped the fire from going further east, west, excuse me, west. So, and you can't really see it in this video. I have other video, too. But just kind of wanted to just give you an idea. You can see where the bulldozer's lines were and where they, you know, laid hose or, you know, kept it at bay. So that's just kind of giving you an overview just quickly there. So, but, so also Chico Bello and the Resource Conservation District have been wonderful. They've been helping out. Like I said, they were there the day, that weekend out there doing assessments. So we have a registered professional forester come out. They, with our contract with the Resource Conservation District, they have those staff on. So they marked. They have all the trees with a big blue X. And that's really to kind of monitor them. And there's about 341 trees, I believe, just in this one little section. So then Richie's going to come up and talk. He did, he went out there and kind of looked at the trees to see, okay, which ones do have to come down. And then we marked them with a big white X. So I'll let Richie kind of take it over now. Where's the mouse? Right there. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Linda. Thank you, commissioners. Yeah. So here's just a quick map of the, all the trees that have been surveyed so far. It doesn't look like a lot, but there's over 700 trees on that map. So big shout out of appreciation to, I believe it was Thad Walker, Buchanee Resource Conservation District. 100%, sorry. Oh. So you can see it. They can see it there. There we go. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. So these are all the trees that have so far been surveyed as having, some severity of damage. And it ranges from a little to a lot. So what I want to do is just give you a rough idea. So, so far, on Friday, what myself and one of my tree division staff went out and we drove the whole line of Upper Park Road to the very end. And we resurveyed the trees that have been marked already. And we surveyed the ones that currently have a blue X on them. And we surveyed the ones that we really feel need to be removed sooner rather than later. So this map's just to give you a rough idea of the locations of those trees. And there's everything, as we can see, if you look at the labels, there's gray pine, blue oak, live oak, they're principally the three main species that we've seen. And not to interrupt, Richie, I just want to point out that we only, we surveyed the road. These don't include any trails work. This is just to get the road safe for the public is what we concentrated on. That's right. So if I go back, this slide covers all of the trails and, yeah. And I don't think this is completed yet possibly. So there may well be an update to this. As I mentioned earlier, currently there's over 700 trees that have been surveyed. So that number might well go up a little bit. And then shortly after the fire, we did start removal. So this is near the origin of the fire. Just around the PG&E pylons, as you can see them running diagonally across the creek. So those trees have been removed. There was 16 in total. And it was just felt that, you know, to strike a balance between trying to open the park as much as possible. And just remove the hazard that we took a decision just to remove these trees. But what we do hope, if I kind of go back to that slide, we're hoping that a lot of those trees we can monitor those trees. Because really one of the tools we have is time. So, and I'll show you in some of the next slides. I apologize. I'm kind of jumping around a little bit. Here's an example of a tree that was marked with a blue X. So that was marked by Butte County Resource Conservation District. And then we went through and assessed it as well. And we've put the white X on that tree because it really does need to come down. It's fully cooked. The bark is charred all the way around. There's nothing left of the roots. There was, you know, all the leaves are completely brown. When we did a bark. assessment, the bark was fully dead. That's the ultimate diagnostic. However, the tree to the left, if you look at the little tree, has a blue X on it. That tree has a chance. So we decided to leave that tree and we'll reassess in a month. Here's a few examples of trees that we really, there's no chance that this tree is going to survive. And as you can see, it already had structural problems. So that cavity was there before the fire. And now the fire has blown through. You can see how hot that fire was. And you know, it's cooked literally. And here's another one. So yeah, we saw several trees like this and they're within striking distance of the trail. So yeah, these trees will be getting removed. Luckily, we have an excellent contract with North Valley Arbor Management and they've been working with the city over the summer. And we're going to be working with them on tree contracts throughout the city. But we will be deploying them to do this job shortly in the coming weeks. And here's another, just another example to show you some of the assessments. So this tree had a blue X on it. But if you see down at the base, we did take some cambium assessments. So we simply cut away some of the bark with an X and just take a look at what's underneath. And this is an example. This is an example where actually the cambium was still alive and healthy. And it's easy to tell. You just look at it visually. If it's still green or white and, you know, got that moist look to it, it's still alive. And sometimes there's really no way to tell other than really, you know, do some invasive searching such as this. So eventually, once you've done a few of these, you kind of get to be able to see the tree. And you can kind of guess if a tree is cooked or not. So I'm going to say we didn't mark every tree like this, but we did take a few samples like this. Here's a good example where this tree is probably going to pull through. As you can see, there's still quite a lot of green in the upper canopy. So not all of the tree was fully engulfed by the fire. But I will say that even in those instances where all the trees have turned, all the leaves have turned brown, I think some of the oak trees still do have a chance to pull through. So as I mentioned earlier, I really do think we need to use time as one of our tools and just monitor these trees. Hopefully we get a good winter with plenty of precipitation. I think if these trees do receive the normal level of winter irrigation, that will really help them pull through. So here's an example where this is probably not, we'll probably need to remove all of these trees. And this is a mixed stand, mainly live oak. They were so cooked, you know, you don't need to be an expert to look at that. You can just tell, right, that this stand of trees is finished. The fire was so hot. It was just fully cooked. Fully engulfed. There's nothing living in that. However, one of the lucky things with live oak, they do sprout back. So in our journey through the park on Friday, we saw this in a lot of places. So this live oak, you know what, it's coming back. So from a risk point of view, we'll probably need to remove the tree. But in the future, we will look at sprout management. And it is a proven technique for restoration. So in this particular example, we'd probably look to pick two or three of the best sprouts and we'll remove the rest. And in 10 years time, there will be a live oak back there again. So I'm hopeful. It is going to be an ongoing journey with the staff. And we do appreciate the patience of the public because the majority of the park is still closed. And it's... It's something that we'll... You know, it's an evolving thing. You know, the park's natural resource manager and assistant manager, you know, Ms. Director Gustafson, Assistant Director Schuyler, you know, will be making decisions, you know, exactly how the park is open, what phases and what tree work needs to be done. Because, you know, as I'm sure you all appreciate, we have to make sure that the park is a safe place to be. You know, currently, we've made it safe up to Diversion Dam. Did I get that right? Gate. But to the gate. If we want to extend it further, there's quite a bit of tree work that needs to happen. But I'm hoping that we can, you know, get ahead of that and, you know, just keep going month by month. So with that, I'd be happy to take any questions anyone might have. Any questions? I just have a question. I have a quick one. Some of those grape vines are huge. Are you prioritizing those if they're dead for removal? I mean, the ones that can fall and, you know, actually really hurt someone. Yeah. There's some huge pines. Yeah, we've marked a lot of those. Okay. Well, the good news with grape vines is they're fire tolerant, and so that's what disperses their seed. So hopefully we'll see the grape vines soon. Just to discuss in my concern for the park is sedimentation. And I've spent the last two weeks, I've gone from Bear Hole all the way up to the headwaters of Big Chico Creek. And while Big Chico Creek itself in the riparian zone, it's, you know, it's hit or miss. But outside it's cooked just like you showed that. And all that sediment, depending on how much precipitation that we're going to get, is going to come into Big Chico Creek. And that's one of my worries. You know, does it affect Sycamore Pool? What is it going to do? And what are we going to find in this soil as far as toxins and things like that? So just a comment on that. The headwaters are still good, though. So it seems like that needs to be a consideration as far as access to the park during winter when all of this sedimentation starts to move. And that's not going to be a safe situation, in my opinion, than to have members of the public up there. I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I'm a lawyer. Okay. I have one comment and about five questions. First, thank you very much for giving it time on those blue oaks. From the Stony Fire, as you all know, most of those that were looked completely charred with all dead leaves. It seemed like about 90 percent of those came back during the Stony Fire. So. Very optimistic. And so I appreciate you not having that knee-jerk reaction. First question was, what is the total acreage in the park burned? You know, I don't know. In the park, I don't know. In fact, I wanted to talk. I know that the resource conservation district said I think 4,000 acres. No, that's going up higher. I don't know right now. I haven't been told by fire or anybody what the acreage is. So I don't know. But I'll find out. Okay. Thank you. Do we have a time when CAL FIRE is going to return the water used in Horseshoe Lake? I haven't talked to CAL FIRE. CAL FIRE is really not doing much in the park. They have a lot to do elsewhere. But I did talk to the golf course about at one time, the Horseshoe Lake fed the golf course. Well, it works both ways. So I have. And we've done it before. We've pumped water from the well from the golf course into Horseshoe Lake. And I've talked to them already and they're willing to do that with us. So. Copy. Please stay on it because they're required to return that water into Horseshoe Lake. Second, is there any opportunity that we are able to leverage this and work on some of the repair issues of the road? Yes. Okay. There will be. Actually, that's going to be done as part of the Iron Canyon Fish Passage Project because they have to get a low buoy. They have to get a low buoy trailer to get that crane up there. So, they've already had 30% designs to kind of shave off some of those dips so that they can get that up there. We can get fire engines up there too. So there are. But that's only going to go to Iron Canyon. So but it's designs and techniques we could use later on up the road if we still needed to fix some of those dips that were just not done as correctly as they should have been. So. Yeah. So that work is going to happen in 2025, the fall of 2025 when they're going to do that road work. So. Third question is do we know if we're already receiving any FMAG money that can be diverted to the park or disaster relief funds? I haven't heard anything about that. We have been working with the ecological reserve about the sediment reduction and how we're going to do that because we may be okay in the park but, you know, east of us are going to come down our way. So they are. We've been working together to try to get grants and funding to do at least that for the winter. You know, so we're looking at phases. What can we do now that we absolutely have to do as far as the sediment and erosion control? And then so they're working with the resource conservation districts and they're going to be applying for grants as well. But I'm sure that we are. We have a cost center and we're having all our track at all our costs. So we're hoping that we will get assistance in the future for sure. Okay. And then there's a point in point to point to point to point to point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point And then the last question is, I know it's preliminary discussions, but have we had any discussions about maintaining those fire break lines into the future so that we have those things permanently in place for firing operations? Yes, for sure. It's Bloody Pin was kind of where we talked about you and I when you were chief. Yes, of course so. So that one is likely going to stay. But we do have to weatherproof that as well. We need to put in some water bars and do some work on that. It's a big white. You can see it completely from the other side. It's a white swath. And that's what I believe stopped it from going west, like I said. So we talked already about doing that and keeping that fire break there. Ten Mile House Road also got hit pretty hard too, so we'll be looking at that road as well. But, yeah, definitely any of the bulldozer lines that we see that we want to keep as fire breaks, then we should keep them. Please, please do so. Thank you. Any, John? In reference to the dozer lines. Yes. They put in. Are Cal Fire right now rehabbing those, putting water bars in? Because they've got the equipment. Not yet, but we're talking to them. They happen to do that. Right. Okay. Just as a personal note, I was up there about ten minutes after the fire started because it's adjacent to my neighborhood. So I watched it go up the north side of the canyon, spread east and west. I was up there at 2 in the morning, and I saw the aircraft came in on it and then it crawled right out. It moved so fast I thought it was going to go into town. I saw it right when it started. It was amazing how fast it went. Then I was up there at 2 in the morning, I guess the day after the next morning, and the whole north side was on fire again. So just thank you, Linda and Richie. And thanks for all your work and for your future work because it's a big project. And the north side of the canyon looks very bald. Would there be any replanting? Are we just letting nature take its course? Possibly some replanting, yes. And hopefully there may be grants that may come online. And with the... I don't know if there's a possibility that there may be extra funds, a capital fund made available. We'll have to see if that's something that city council is looking at. But as I mentioned, hopefully there's some grants that come down as well. Okay. Thank you very much. I got one. Oh, okay. I guess so the big question I have, of course, is when do we start having a conversation? Do we ever open up? You know, Upper Park Road? Or is it just the road traffic again? How does that look? You know, I mean, there's been a couple fires up there over the past couple years. And we all... I mean, I was for opening it. You know, it doesn't seem to be working. You know, so how do we... When do we start that conversation? In other words, before next summer? You know, my... Because it's closed now, it seems. Do we ever open it again? Or does it just become pedestrian bicycle? And we just stick with that? Is that a council thing? Is that a... Yeah, that would be a council direction. That... Because they're the ones who directed it to open up two days per week to the end of the road. So it would be definitely a conversation that we'd have to go to the council too. Well, just to be clear, we weren't all in favor of opening that road. We weren't. And I've been on record. I even looked back at minutes, and when I had my interim appointment to this commission in 2018, I said I was against it. So you could... So you could... When you're talking to whomever, they should get on their agenda, I think, now because it's going to take some time to get the decision. Not that they're not thinking about it, but just anyways, just a thought. Any other comments? Yeah, I hear grants repeated a bunch of times, but being involved with a place that's declared a disaster, just know as long as you're, because you mentioned you're keeping track, you don't necessarily need to rely on grants. You can just do it as part of the game, and they will pay you back for the items that cost that. Yeah, I have been in contact with Dave Derby with Cal Fire, who actually helped with the Stony Fire also. But my take on that was they only fix what they damage. So a bulldozer line, yes. But I don't know about any of the others. And he says, and then we're going to bill you. No, I meant when it's declared as a disaster by the city. Yeah, and we did declare it, yes. But I mean, Cal Fire, I did have those conversations with them. Do I need to ask for public comments on this? You can, absolutely. Okay, do we have any members of the public that wanted to speak on the Park Fire update? Yeah. I know the importance of getting grant support, but I think it would be very beneficial to interact with expertise at Chico State for both monitoring, as well as, you know, I don't know, Richie, how, you know, kind of person power you have to keep monitoring trees, but that's something that students... And yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. thank you. thank you great ideas and great thoughts might be cathartic for the community to get involved with. thank you. We will move on to item 6.4 of our regular agenda review of the park and street tree budget for fiscal year 2024-2025. This will be reports from linda hermann and richie bandwagon. I will advance this a little bit. I don' t have a lot to talk about but this is what we proposed to the council this is for the operations and maintenance total but we did ask for 10.5% increase for the o&m. We asked for eight new permanent positions no we asked for more I think 10 maybe and we received eight new permanent positions. One was three of them was a senior maintenance worker and two maintenance workers for street trees to get us a dedicated third tree crew. That' s going to be a big difference for ritchie' s operations I' m sure. That' s what we used to have before the downturn and we have a projects going on. These are just in there because it was a council presentation we got two new fire engines and we did 12 new capital projects. Before you and I apologize for the audience I don' t have that up on this but you have our actual park and street well actually trees are now in what' s called the streets and roads because it' s trees along the road so we could use that funding money to I think the 307 parks is still in the general fund and the park fund 002. This is the initiatives that ritchie put into the budget that we hope to achieve this next and he can talk a little bit more about that. I' m just going to go to the parks one. We talked already about the resurface and pay section of what we' re already doing now in the park and I believe it' s striping next so that would be done in upper park. Implement the park management program for upper park. Assist engineering and designing the reconstruction of south park and peterson drives which we will be talking about that again. And then this is just one I have already going on where we' re in the process of doing the mitigation hazard mitigation grant program for lindell channel defensible space. We' re about ready to start the goats. We did the first treatment of initial thinning and elevating and then we' re going to have three grazing, goat grazings and the grant has to be spent on the same point by the end of the year. And then the transportation transportation transportation transportation transportation transportation transportation transportation transportation transportation transportation transportation transportation the maintenance worker we got an additional maintenance worker in parks and Richie got two maintenance workers in trees and then we also got a maintenance worker in landscape So that's the data positions you can see on that budget that you know We did have an increase in the overall budget in in On the park we went from two point seven million to three point three million So we did see an increase a lot of it that part of that is that staffing so but everything else was pretty much the same We do have a lot of capital projects. I think I forgot to print it out but the new capital project that we have in parks is We are doing We are going to have More money in the tree corridor program and capital project I believe and then I think there was one new one We have the big Chico Creek erosion project also that we're looking at that's being looked at by a And that's for the hooker oak Well as well as some of the other erosion sites on on lower Park Road but yeah, so now let Richie kind of talk a little bit more about what he has and and What he was able to put in his budget Thank You Linda. Yeah, not a great deal Extra dad Linda covered it. Well Well one thing I would add is that yet the street tree operating budget was increased from last year 1.9 million up to two point three million and part most of that is the addition of the extra three personnel to form a third tree crew but also the operating operating bus budget for the contract with North Valley Arbor management Was increased by believe by sixty five thousand dollars And so that helps we can get a little bit more work through that route as well And also as you'll you'll see one of the photographs in the tree division report. We got a new lift very exciting To get that crane that will enable us to reach some of the tallest trees that we have in the city Which has always been problematic? But now we'll we'll be able to manage those trees A lot more efficiently and be able to do them in-house with our new third tree crew so it's very exciting and we're very appreciative of City Council and city manager for Shepherding us through that project and getting us, you know, all of these new resources So we're excited to start putting them to work And if I could I if you look on your the budget for the parks to there that's the list of the capital expenditures I was talking about I apologize we do we did get money in the upper park lot e to do a redesign of the lot E which is a horseshoe Lake Because we really wanted to have it in one way in and one way out like a you So that's in that was new this year. We continued with the vegetation management of a hundred thousand dollars I think I put in for the next year that will probably try to increase that even more next year and Then we also have the I mentioned the corridor pruning went from a hundred three Thousand to three hundred thousand and that's the trees along the road so that that money would be used for instance in upper park along the road there if we could and And that's in he and that's in addition to his own capital projects that has the tree money as well And then I also put in hundred thousand dollars for the circular pool reconstruction That is by mainly just repairing the concrete that's wearing in the bottom of the pool. It's a maintenance project It's not the reconstruction or redesign or anything. It's just Going in and patching the floor of the pool in some other areas. So that's what that's for But then as you aware we're also having a grant to do the other project, but this is just a maintenance money for now And Justin does too Okay, sorry, I mean I was just meant to put in the queue. Okay. Um, I just had a question because When I drive around town I see broken sprinklers and the medians and the parks and like what are we doing to abate that and then Over by specifically I just use for example the Eaton median over by Hancock Park Spraying all into the you know asphalt It's not growing anything and I know that we have non-functional turf laws now in California where anything that's non-functional Does account parks, but it does count medians. It's not functional Does account trees? So I'm wondering what do we who's responsible for the sprinklers and the medians and our you know And in our right-of-ways and you know, like what's that plan? I Could probably answer that one So in a lot of areas of the city it is the medians are what's called the little Chico maintenance district And those are going to be primarily new it but in the Hancock Park area those are being Handled with the Chico maintenance district and we have a landscape contractor who does that that's Dawson's land? Scape so it really depends on the location They don't really do much with the trees But they do the irrigation that Hancock Park X actually undercard now So the irrigation around is it in the sidewalk around the median the median? Okay. Yeah Well, we do have a new contractor Dawson's doing that area. We were having problems with the previous one having that problem So I'm hoping that's all been fixed. It's gonna be fixed. Have you seen it recently? Okay, I'll talk to him But yeah So a lot of the areas are done by our landscape Contractor if it's like in the older part of town, it's gonna be under just street trees, I guess so That's where that it just depends on what what the town where? Yeah, no, I appreciate that I appreciate that one thing I could add some extra information to that I have been given direction from director Gustafson that you know medians Really? Throughout the town are a priority one one good example of Some great work we've done recently is call Park Drive You take a drive there and you'll see that medium is a hundred times better than it was You know all the functional turf is gone It looks great. It's it's you know, kind of like a mini Arboretum now, you know, it's it's gonna look really good So we hope to replicate that on a number of other meetings, especially those wide ones like that one You know that have just a lot of is a lot of turf as you' ve said is non-functional it really does have to go. I know one of the other areas we' looking at is airport boulevard that' s another median we' re hoping to turn our attention to very shortly. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. I have a specific item question. We' ve been hearing about these kiosks forever for upper park and then I see I assume that the item is parking fee infrastructure on the budget and 2021-2022 $30,000 was the total for the kiosks. $77,000 has been spent or requested? We still have nothing? Do we have the kiosks? we have the kiosks yes and what we' re waiting for is some of the road repairs you' re seeing now and paving of lot a where the kiosks are going to go that' s coming. It' s still in the queue we' do have to get some other working on how many cars come actually in. We don' t have those yet and we' re working with traffic safety on that and helping us out on that. We' re just kind of moving forward in that respect. The big thing was to make sure the road was repaired and that we had parking and that was paid at lot a. just waiting for a couple extra things. I rode my bike on the new paved road on Sunday. it' s a great opportunity to thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. Any other questions? vice chair naba? sorry. I' m not sure if I' m going to direct this to linda or richie or a combination thereof. when I last checked in on the linda channel situation and I understand there' e grant money associated with governor of linda asked for more funds to go toward the linda channel specifically and was approved that that happened. Is there a plan for more than just the goats to get that heavy equipment work going sooner rather than later? I know those homes back right up against the channel and I' ve heard that' is a acknowledged risk and I have heard from neighbors in that area that are concerned. Can we get an update on when we think that the more heavy work involved in removing vegetation will take place? that already did take place because remember this is a defensible space so we were doing from the homes out and not the other way around not from the channel in. Our specific grant this is a fema grant hazard mitigation grant did not allow us to do any work within 50 feet of the channel. So anything inside the channel was not included in this grant. So that' s going to take a different type of project and it' s also going to take a lot more permits than what we have now to do. So and that because that would that when you get into the waterways we do have a lake bed stream alteration permit but again that stipulated that you can go within 50 feet of the channel on either side. So but so that was done and we did get more money 300,000 is what I believe the council approved and so they want us to look at ways to we could get into the channel heavy equipment is not an easy thing to do in channels. So they don' t usually like that kind of equipment. I know the county used to dredge it you know years ago 50 years ago or whatever time it was but those days are gone we can' t do that anymore without getting permission and making sure that we stay on the waterways when they' re wet etc. So that's a little bit of a it's going to take some time to see if we what we can and cannot do. The good news is we are working our own maintenance routine maintenance agreement with the fish and wildlife our own altered stream bed alteration permit and one of the things that I asked to put in there and that's for all our creeks and once we have that it's really easier to get work done because it's a more of a phone call not having to get a separate permit for every location but the good thing is I wanted to see if we could use the! If that's a possibility so we put that in there it hasn't been submitted to fish and wildlife yet so it's really going to depend on what they approve or not but we tried to think of anything that we it's following the vegetation fields management plan all those techniques we talked about in the plan herbicides pruning goats anything that we might do in those greenways and creekside greenways is being asked for permission from fish and wildlife to do that work routinely as a maintenance item. I'm assuming we partnered with the state and that they understand the challenge of that in a particular that stretch that runs from like say the 11th street bridge I'll call it that or down to Holly 11th avenue down to Holly because and further because it's so steep like you mentioned and trying to get anything down there I just it just seems like we're going to constantly be in a tailspin here. Yeah that's the thing that we're trying to do is and we're trying to get everything down there. So you're saying that the work that we did on the channel was all done by hand pretty much we had all we really had was a chipper in there and even there we couldn't that's why you see some of the wood locked and scattered because it was an area that wasn't accessible for the chipper so that's the kind of work that's going to have to take to do that section we can't even really get goats in there it's too narrow and it's too I guess I get on the hills right there there Billy goats right. I was going to say I thought of goats. So yeah so but that is something we can look at and see but it's just so narrow in there it's all mostly creek beds so if we have to stay on the creek bed if we have goats in the creek bed that's going to help if we can't then it's going to be difficult to do those narrow corridors. Thank you I appreciate the comprehensive reply thank you. Commissioner Alexander did you have a question? You were ahead of me. Go ahead. Richie great job on that lift that's a great multi-use tool that's out there fantastic job. I see on here police 538,000 please tell me that's for more park rangers? It's for the park rangers I don't know about more but it's for the three park rangers that we have. So we're still at budgeted three park rangers? Yes. And could you help me on their status? We have the two sworn now and they are working seven days a week one at a time so and then I understand I don't know they were recruiting and they were doing they're going to put someone in the academy I believe for the third one. And when you say they're working are they in the park working or are they still part of the clean team? The weekend so Dylan's working Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday on Saturday and Sunday and Friday he's definitely in the park because target is an option. that on those days. It's the Monday through Thursday they're doing still aligned with target right now but I know on the weekend Dylan's in the park pretty much. Maybe you can help me out this question got brought up because I don't know if you guys hear it. The community is screaming for park rangers screaming and I'll be down at Thursday night market and I see a park ranger working security at Thursday night market and people are asking me why isn't the ranger when we're begging for rangers in the park working Thursday night market and so I'm sure there's a good reason but we just. Well there's a city park downtown I mean there's more than one city park downtown. That's okay but we have a giant park and the question that gets constantly brought up to my attention is we just did a revenue measure for 22 extra million dollars that came in and we're still at the exact same number of park rangers and people just don't understand and they hear it and they don't understand it and they're like hey there's going to be a kiosk in upper park. It's blowing their mind that they're going to have restrictions on parking when they can't even get people to put their dogs on a leash or see a park ranger ever in the park. And so there's just so you know there's a lot of frustrated people. I know believe me. We thought this budget would have more rangers in it. Yeah I get the calls and Shane gets the calls and we're just as equally frustrated. Commissioner Glatz. So I'll follow up kind of on that question. And I'm sure because it's all split up. So I saw it and you started you requested an additional 10 percent. How much more money did the parks department get from this budget? Oh that's what I was saying it went from 2.7 to 3.3. So $500,000. Yeah. Okay so there's a $23 million measure H or something like that. One thing I will say about measure H is there was that referendum that to maybe do away with measure H funds and tax local taxes. So when we did our budget that was still in the courts. That there was a possibility that they would it would reverse our tax measure if they won that referendum. So we did a conservative budget and really did not some of these positions aren't even in the budget until after January. So there'd be a lot of uncertainty. And we for that reason we didn't know how that measure was going to go. So that's part of the reason why we don't have more in there is that it doesn't mean we can't add more council canal more as the year went on. But fortunately that was struck down and we didn't have that problem. But that was the real fear that we were going to lose measure H. But we're not. Right now yeah. But when we did the budget we were. So how much was it then? We said 2.7 to 3.3 so that's 600,000 right? So 600,000 more? It's a line right there under expenditures total operating expenditures. You know I just and I harped this publicly before I mean 10% of 20 million dollars is 2 million dollars more and we got 600,000 dollars more. So I understand the thinking but there still should be more money coming to the park. So I know you guys all work for the city so I just don't wonder how we can make that decision that the money is not going to the park like they might have thought it was. And you guys got to do your job so I'll take care of that. It feels like a bait and switch. No no no no no. Well it does though it does a little bit. No I mean the council has priorities I'm not going to you know everyone has priorities you know but it just I think a lot of people voted for measure H thinking they're going to get more park rangers thinking they're going to get a clean park thinking you know all these kind of things. So I just wanted to bring that up. It's coming it's coming. Okay cool. Yeah because if it's they can increase it even now. there's more money there. Commissioner Blatchley. Yes. In reference to lendo channel I'd like to thank you for the vegetation management. I don't know if you've gone and looked at those valley oaks since you've cleared all that wild grape and that grass. But they look really good. And it's it's amazing to walk through there now. So I just want to thank you. But thanks. It's a long channel. Lots of work. Okay. One more. I just wanted to bring up what I had touched on before at a prior meeting where I said would it help if our council if we were all amenable did something in a formal paper saying we all would really recommend X number more of park rangers to have it go to council to support. I do see what you're doing. I do see that you've asked. I know you want to advocate for that just as much as we do. But if we can help in that manner I propose that we try to do something like that. I've seen other municipalities do similar things and they can be effective. Any other questions? I think we have a question from the On that note have you looked at a what I'll refer to it as a part-time park ranger that would work less than 960 hours? Because if they did that then you might have somebody who was a deputy or police officer or a state park ranger retired. It says as long as I keep under my 960. I don't know if that's been discussed or not. It was discussed. I think the police was trying to do is make it a special assignment. Some of the police officers wanted it to be a special assignment. But it was talked about at that time that there would be officers who might want to move if that became a special assignment. But I don't know if that's gone anywhere. These could be officer deputies that just retired. I know two that are looking for something to do. So if part-time came out less than 960 you may get some applicants. I think that's what we're looking for. What I had hoped again because we weren't sure of the measure H. We've talked a lot about having a non-sworn ranger as an interpretive ranger paired with a sworn ranger. We had one for a while. I forget the gentleman's name that we had. Who didn't pass didn't go through with the FTO to become a police officer. But he was in our park then until he moved to Washington State as a state ranger. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. And he didn't pass. patrol yeah I think we should try to move on but just piggybacking on off vice chair novice idea we know that you Linda Shane Ritchie communicate as much as you can what happens in these meetings hopefully council reads our minutes pays attention but I would just I think if anyone's interested when these ideas come up in front of council that we need to show up we need to show up at these meetings we need to speak we need to speak in the public comments section I think that that might be the only way for us to be in front of them and if we have something to say speak directly to them I mean I know all of us have the ear of at least one counselor but our council member but I think that it's I think some of these things we' ve been talking about for years and my time is almost up on this commission so I' m going to pay close attention to their agendas and when items that I have an opinion about an informed opinion that' s what we all develop sitting here listening month after month that we need to communicate directly to them. I will just caution on that though you can' t speak for the actual members of the committee. I will speak as an informed member of the public. just a reminder. is it all right if we move on to item 7? yes? reports and communications items provided for the commission' s information only no action can be taken on any of the items unless the commission agrees to include it on a subsequent posted agenda 7.1 parks division report linda harper will be the first to respond. thank you. thank you. this is just an informational item only and I can answer any further questions you might have. vice chair. on page 1 of 7 on your report on item 2a but the second paragraph of a it has reference to the increased amount of housekeeping that the staff has been doing in light of the sheriff' s crew having to cut their hours back to two days a week from the beginning of the year. the sheriff' s crew. it usually comes down to the availability of sergeants or captains or sergeants. or if they' re having to do other trainings or other things. so it really comes down to having the sergeant to be there during that time. and they get pulled off on other assignments a lot. okay. so maybe we can be a squeaky wheel. maybe they work their way through some of that just so they don' t take it as rote to keep on at the two day hopefully because I understand that' s a lot of labor. they like to work in the park so it' s not their choice. it' s usually higher up. okay. thanks. any other questions or comments? one. so we did this traffic study, met in the park and we' re hopeful that the sheriff' we' re going to have the lower park paved but I see here as time permits park staff is pairing up with right of way crews to do pothole and asphalt repairs in the park. we' re hoping the whole park is going to be paved. it was supposed to be this year. now it' s maybe next year. is that in the budget for next year? yes. there is money in the budget. s going to be $500,000 for lower Bible park but that' s not going to be enough. my understanding is that they want to do Peterson first and Peterson will be designed and then south park would be next because of the more complications that we have on the south side especially not knowing the traffic circulation that we' e been talking about. so that' s my understanding. maybe Skyler you could probably fill in a little bit there. just to confirm. you have Peterson, Memorial, as well as south park. and then the park drive are both slated for rehabilitation next year, 2025. okay. so that' s news to me. I thought 26 was south park. that' s the latest information we have posted. it' s on our website as well under the city of chicago. okay. all right. thank you. okay. thank you, linda, for your item 7.2, street tree division report. richie bamlett, urban forest manager. thank you, chair thomas petty. again, this is for information only. but I' d be happy to answer any questions. just a couple questions or one question. so you put a bunch of pictures in there of some people illegally topping trees. what kind of trouble do they get in? what happens with that? well, maybe I' ll hopefully provide a report on that. I' ll give you the answer of what happened. I' ve been in contact with code enforcement and director veig and director gusterson. I know this item was raised at the executive meeting. I think the executives meet monthly with the city manager. and everyone was not impressed with that photograph that you see before you. so we will be looking at that. I think it' lot of people that we feel are responsible. maybe I' ll give you an update at the next meeting. sure. yeah. I mean, that' s not only vandalism but it' s a taking. to me that could be referred to the d.a. that' s city property. yeah. any other comments, questions for richie? congrats on your third tree crew. thank you. okay. and thank you for your report, richie. if that' s it, then we' ll go to item number eight, adjournment. adjourn to the next regular meeting on september 30, 2024, 6 p.m. right here. see everybody then. thank you for being here.
