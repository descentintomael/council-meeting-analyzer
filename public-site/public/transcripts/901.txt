 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, commissioners. Thank you for being here. I haven't had the chance to meet all of you. My name is Molly Markison. I was hired back in December, and I'm excited to be here tonight to present this project to you. Tonight we're looking at a proposal to use the city's small lot subdivision standards to divide approximately 0.67 acre site into four parcels for residential development. The site is located on the southwest corner of the intersection of West Lassen Avenue. And it's located on the southwest corner of West Lassen Avenue. And Carling Place. The site is designated low-density residential on the general plan land use diagram and is zoned R1 with the airport overflight zone D overlay. Surrounding land uses include newly constructed single-family homes to the north, multifamily uses to the south, and east, and residential development of various densities to the west. The project site consists of a residential parcel that fronts West Lassen Avenue and is bounded by Carling Place. The project site is 150 feet wide and 160 feet deep and is relatively flat. The site is developed with an existing single-family home and detached garage that will be removed. Lot sizes range from 3,997 square feet to 7,486 square feet, with the average lot size being 492 square feet. The project would yield a residential density of 5.9 units per gross. 8.5 units per gross. 8.5 units per gross. Which is within the allowable range of 2.1 to 7 dwelling units per gross acre in the R1 zoning district. Public improvements would include constructing new curb, gutter, and sidewalk along the West Lassen Avenue. Improvements for Carling Place were recently installed as a result of the Carling Place subdivision. All parcels would connect to the city sewer system, which would be extended to the site. No modifications to the subdivision design criteria were requested other than to use a small subdivision.

So in conclusion, a neighborhood meeting was not conducted due to COVID-19. The proposal is consistent with the general plan and the proposal is exempt from CEQA pursuant to section 15332 in-field development and staff recommends approval. And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions the commissioner may have. And I do believe the applicant and the engineer are available via virtually. Great. Thank you, Molly, and welcome to the Planning Commission. Yeah, great to have you here presenting to us. I forgot to do announcement of expert take communications. Do we have any expert take communication regarding this? I don't know. I drove by the site. Great, thank you. I drove by the site also. And I did also. For future clarification, I don't believe that, you know, viewing a site is expert take communication. We need to disclose that. Okay, good to know. But I also appreciate you all sharing that. I should also do that. I'm sorry, Commissioner Goldstein, what did you say? Oh, driving by a site is not necessarily expert take communication. I just wanted to know if I should disclose seeing the site. Perfect. Yeah, I've also driven by it in the past. All right. So thank you so much. We are going to discuss as a commission. Do we have any questions for staff before we hear from the applicant? All right. I have a question concerning the trees, but I think it might be better to ask about an applicant and the rest of the body. Okay. Thank you. So, you know, further questions. Do we have the applicant on the line? And would they like to speak for a few minutes? Hello, my name is Greg Hansen, and I'm a contractor and owner of Sierra Cascade Group. The goal of this was to divide it and to build four homes on there. Originally intended was to build a four-room house. We're going to try to salvage the existing house, but talking with Shannon Costa previously before she left the city, just with the setbacks and where it was located and the amount of work on that house, it's pretty much condemned. So I'm talking with the engineer, Wes Gilbert. We came up with this plan to subdivide the land into these four lots. Great. Thanks. Should we? Does anybody have questions for the applicant or should we reserve those for later? If we have them. Just a process question. Like I know John had a question for the applicant. Should he ask that now? Yeah. I could ask the applicant. Greg, it's specifically about the one large redwood tree that's up front, tree number seven on the flat map. I think it's the biggest redwood tree that's on the site. And it's identified as... Southwest? On Parcel 1? Yeah, it's on Parcel 1. The very bottom corner of Parcel 1 there. Keep going up. Right? One more. Right there. Yeah, we're going to save that one. Yeah, that tree. I was interested in a couple things. One, it looks like it's a pretty healthy tree, the biggest one on the site. The arborist identified it as an excellent shape. And I was wondering why it was tagged for removal. That wasn't my doing. I'm okay leaving it. I'd prefer to keep it. It's a great tree. Oh, okay. So maybe I'll talk with Mr. Gilbert then when he comes up about the arborist report since he's the one that signed off on it. Okay. Okay. Thank you, Greg. Yeah. Thank you both. Do we have additional questions for the applicant or should we move on to... Additional speakers? All right. Do we have any public comments? Or other speakers? Good evening, Commissioner. This is Wes Gilbert, the engineer. Sorry. I can hear you. I'm sorry? We can hear you. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. So we need to ask the question again? Should we give him some time? Maybe his connection is bad? I think he's waiting for a question. Okay. I see. So do we have a question that Mr. Gilbert can answer? Or I guess I was thinking maybe you just had a... I don't have any additional comments. Sorry if I misunderstood. I have questions about... Wes, if you can hear me. This is John Howlett from Planning Commission. I had a couple questions. One, on the arborist report from Mr. Howell. The Redwoods are listed. It goes 7, 8, 8.5, and 9. And I was wondering... I was wondering what tree 8.5 was. Because I didn't see it on the plat map that we looked at on there. I'm not sure. There were some problems with the numbering. Okay. I thought that we had... Just a moment. Sure. Okay. Does that answer your question? Or do you have further... It's... My only concern is that we're not... A tree's not getting cut down that's not identified on our map. That's my only concern. And it sounds like, Wes, that Mr. Gilbert would be... I'm able to keeping that... The one largest sequoia that's there, a coastal redwood. That tree number 7. And it would be great if we could find a way to work the project around that. It's a great tree. It's large. Provides lots of shade. A real asset, in my opinion, to the project. As you heard from the applicant, we don't have a problem leaving the tree. It's just that at this stage of development, you're not quite sure what your building site's going to look like and everything. So we kind of maybe overcompensate at this point so that we don't get in trouble later on. I'm having a hard time hearing him. Yeah, it's a little hard to hear you. Okay. Okay, good. All right, great. Thank you. Thanks, Ken. All right. Any further questions for the applicant? Are there any additional speakers? Doesn't sound like it. Only other applicants. Okay. Other projects. Okay. Thank you. Great. So, I believe we can close the public hearing in, right? Great. All right, commission discussion? Do we have further discussion? I have a general question and maybe Bruce or Mike, you could answer this, but the neighborhood meeting requirement, has that been waived on all projects going forward? What does that look like? Is it actually a requirement that we have? We temporarily waived that requirement. did that and now we're asking people to see if they can engage with them through online meeting formats like that so we're instituting it again but when we first got hit with the coronavirus we kind of paused that requirement but now it's back in effect so we're encouraging people to communicate through online resources and that encouragement is that on the onus of the developer and the engineer to do that outreach yeah so they can however they can do it they can set up a meeting or a chat function or however they can do that that's what we're encouraging them to do okay thank you good question thank you further commission discussion all right do we have a motion I'll make a motion great I can find it here I moved that the planning commission adopted resolution number 20-08 approving the parcel map subject to the attached conditions and that tree number 7 is identified on the map will be made on the parcel all right all in favor any opposed are there any abstentions motion passes great moving on to item 5.2 subdivision 20-08 show one merriam park north chair goldstein so I need to recuse myself on this item I serve on the new county housing authority commission and we actually took action on the affordable housing component of this development just earlier today in fact and so I need to to step aside on this one okay commissioner goldstein I also need to recuse myself it could affect the financial action I have on this item and the interest I have in a home in merriam park good to know okay other expert pay we're serving beer out there good good any other expert pay communication if not we have a staff report thank you chair goldstein this project site is 72 acres located north of little chico creek bordered on the on its north side by humboldt road bruce road along the east side and notre dame boulevard as well as marsh junior high on the west side it's currently vacant however there is a fenced preserve the merriam park preserve biological preserve for butte county metafoam in the northwest corner as well as some pgd high voltage power lines coming through the site um um! the fencing for the preserve is pretty conspicuous so we know where that is and we'll that'll feature prominently in the future slides starting with the subdivision map it's broken into three different phases phase g is on the west side of the project it'll come off a notre dame boulevard and add two new streets a segment of avenue a and then avenue b around the east side of the first phase which is five acres and i'll speak a little bit more about that later it's for an affordable housing project and avenue d would go out to bruce road providing an important connection between notre dame boulevard and bruce road phase h is in the middle of the project site it includes two full city blocks as well as two half blocks that are abutting the preserve um! these lots down on the left hand side near near to the junior high we back up to the preserve and then the half block on the east side of the preserve would have some houses that would front onto the preserve and be alley loaded and then they would um also front on a new street inside those subdivision as well as a row of homes along humble road um! um! um! um! um! um! um! but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but that for all residential uses and then south of that again would be a smaller and a half block and a new neighborhood park and that would also that phase would also finish out avenue a so like i mentioned the existing marion park preserve comprises nearly a quarter of the site it was established years ago in 2009 or so easements re-recorded in 2015 and the preserve is actively being managed pursuant to the federal and state permits there's a lot of mention in the staff report about some old easements from a previous owner of the site in low hospital was thinking about building there back in the 90s they recorded some easements to ensure that they were staying out of the meadow foam at the north end and part of this map since now this marion park project has reached it we've heard from a lot of state legislators but we heard from a lot of state legislators but we heard from a lot of state legislators but we heard from a lot of state legislators but we heard from a lot of state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot state legislators but we heard from a lot all of the bike path in the greenway putting in places near the bridge in the greenway on this north side we see some another addition to the greenway along avenue d where to create fronting roads and have those roads be relatively straight that's why we have some additional acreage given to the greenway there and then there's some take along park b where they would still have i guess it's 2.6 acres on the map but it's it's more like four gross and it brings the total neighborhood park acreage in merriam park over six gross acres there's as with all traditional neighborhood development subdivisions there's a regulating plan and circulation plan so this is where the circulation plan portion are these red streets that you see it's it's an emergency response network the red streets are the largest streets that you'll see in merriam-park and over the years the fire department and public works have expressed some concerns over the narrower streets so we we're seeing all red streets on on this map as as also are common south of the creek and it also codes the regulating plan part codes the site for different sort of sub-designations that further specify what will go there and the nc stands for neighborhood center so i mentioned the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the state but also the the south east corner and that would also allow for a smaller mixed-use commercial center where we're expecting some mixed-use or commercial buildings on Bruce and then residential on the balance of that area that would front on the park. North Creek crossings would be that first phase of the project that's 160 units affordable housing project that is one of the catalysts for this subdivision to come before you tonight. It'll be going to the architecture review board in in June. I wanted to explain a little bit about these off-network home sites. So there's some homes that don't have a street in front of them instead they will front onto greens public greens that are added to the project and going through lot c here block c would you know have 20 or so homes that would be off-network. Streets and as well as lot d or block d I guess we could call it and then the houses that front on the preserve would also not have a street in front of them it would be the preserve and they would have a shared walkway in front of them and that walkway would set the build two lines for the homes that would go on those lots as well as down here by the park those homes would also front on the preserve and the shared parking area behind would be shared amongst the different uses. There that wasn't a new thing for Merriam Park there were off-network streets proposed on the original in in the DA reflected on the regulating plan but you do see that there are many more streets on the regulating plan a lot of blue streets those narrower streets and there would be secondary emergency response streets so we have fewer streets and more off-network homes so that led us to coming up with a new street. We're also looking at the potential for the fire truck to be able to navigate those in an emergency it also shows that park b was always planned down here along the greenway south of avenue d and this is just to flip back the comparison that we see the larger blocks lots of green fronting properties and all primary emergency response areas. We're also looking at the potential for the fire truck to be able to navigate those on the off-network streets. So to summarize some of the additional details again the neighborhood meeting was not required because of social distancing and we weren't certain how they could do that when we turn that sort of requirement over to the applicants. We have recommended conditions that would require the applicant to show us the permits that they are obtaining for the storm water retention basins along along the creek. To serve the project site that will result in a new outfall to little Chico Creek that will require those permits. You had a comment forwarded to you from the national marine fisheries service they're pointing out that you might need permits for this project because there's a new outfall there and it's a waterway that supports listed salmonids and another condition to make sure that the applicant's making progress on building the bridge the Notre Dame bridge over little Chico Creek. It's not much but it's enough to get a good faith conversation going about how that does happen in time in the next few years when it's going to be needed. I mentioned the conditions to increase alleyway width for fire access to the off-network homes and then we included a slew of mitigation measures from the Merion Park program EIR. So we are recommending that it's found that this map is found substantially consistent with the Merion Park development agreement for the reasons I've noted and that it's all in the scope of the Merion Park program EIR. And with that we are recommending that the council or the Commission adopt the resolution and approve the map adopt the circulating and regulating plan subject to all the attached conditions. Great thank you Mike. All right Commission discussion or questions for staff? Mike I just have one quick question. The question are do we not have I know on the ag land we have a 100 foot buffer I believe do we not have that with preserves? We don't it's actually in the preserve that the area around the vernal pools are given a large buffer inside the preserve so that the entire watershed that goes into the preserve is preserved in the in undevelopable area. Okay and you mentioned I don't think you could pull the map back up huh? The houses at front that there will be a walkway in front of that so they wouldn't be right up onto the preserve correct? Correct. Great questions. Do we have further questions? Yeah I have a couple questions Mike. One is dealing with the mitigation and the preserve. Are there going to be any other mitigation credits that have to be purchased based on our approving of this map at all? No no that's all included in the preserve. There was a little bit of off-site preserve that they also acquired they did all this back in 2009. 2009 I think yeah. And we have all literally the receipts for the off-site credits they had to purchase and that was more for freshwater shrimp and stuff like that. And so they've been that's you guys get a pretty good amount of credit for that. Yeah. And then I had a couple of periodic reports about it and like that they were purchased and they're still active and all that. Yeah. Yeah. The Dove Ridge is one of the preserves they purchased. Okay. And then I had a couple of questions about about there was one question was about flooding. On one of the maps, I'm going to take my glasses off. Let's see. It shows that the approximate flood FEMA flood zone. Okay. There's kind of a finger that goes into the development. It's on attachment D. Right. Sheet two of the subdivision. Yeah. Is that something that we need to be concerned with or I mean the grading of it will be such that that will be dealt with or. Yeah. They will know you don't need to worry about it. It will be part of the grading to eliminate the low spot that may have generated that. And there's high spots and low spots and the low spot will go away. And the engineer of record will have to file a LOMAR, a letter of map revision with the FEMA flood map people. Okay. That's what I figured. I'm just checking. And then my last question was about the excuse me, the letter from the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Board. They brought up a couple concerns in their letter. One was, let's see, about the wells, about inactive wells. And making sure that they were abandoned properly and sealed up properly. Let me see if I can find the verbiage that they used. While staff find the policies may provide adequate minimum water quality protection, we have potential concerns about remaining static vertical pollution conduits at depth. We request that the landowner make reasonable effort to determine well constructions at terminal depths. Okay. And propose appropriate well destruction methods for the county health officers approval. What can anybody explain that at all? Exactly what that involves? I guess I'd ask Jim Stevens to try to explain that. It's my understanding there are no wells on this site. There was an old well on the PVAG site, the other part of the preserve on the north side of where we're not even really talking about that tonight. That's just part of a preserve. That's not part of this map. It didn't say on the maps. It didn't show any wells that were marked. So that was, is Jim still with us? Yeah, he'll be on. Okay. He'll want to present for the applicant when it's time. And then the other, my final one related to water was about, it looks like potential down flow from the old burn site up off Humboldt. And after the completion of activities, burn ash, waste debris remained in several inaccessible locations. Of the proposed subdivision could be encountered by redevelopment activities. I'm just kind of interested to know what type of water monitoring, you know, would go on at the site related to that kind of pollution that we noticed there. I don't think any monitoring would be required on this site. Okay. Way back in 2006 or something like that, we've received letters of no further action for this site. It was essentially a free and clear site. The PVAG site across the street where the preserve is, is again a different story. They did. And this is all city, it's all city water, all attached to city services. And so. Well, it's California water service company water. California water service. But there, I don't think there's any plans for any well sites on this property. That was my concern. Okay. Is Jim back with us? And if there was, they would have to test and they would only serve water. Yeah. Testing. I just brought it up because the guy from the water board brought it up and I thought it was important to talk about. I appreciate that. Yeah. Do we have further commission discussion before we hear from the applicant? If not, sounds like it's a good time for Jim if he's on the line to talk to us. Sure. I'm here. Can you hear me? Yes. Great. First of all. Thank you very much for going ahead and pursuing with this. And I appreciate the effort to hear this project through these rather strange circumstances. Mike, of course, did, as he always does, did a great job in presenting the project. And so I think I'm going to leave any further questions you have to me specifically. But I want to address a couple of things. John, you had asked about a couple of the mitigation credits are taken care of. Mike mentioned that. I just wanted to clarify the fact that the preserve is operated by a nonprofit that holds the environmental easement called California Open Plants. Right. And so they monitor and they report annually. And the success has been great so far. Are you asked about existing wells? We actually did find one fairly recently as we started cleaning the property. Can you hear me? Want me to turn it up? It's okay. It's a little hard to hear you. I can hear you okay. We can hear you. You're good. But we did find one additional well. And of course, we will have to abandon it pursuant to the county standards under permit. Okay. And basically that means you fill it up and then fill the top 50 or 60 feet with concrete. Okay. And the last thing about creating any new wells, one of the provisions for allowing Cal Water to provide service is that we give up the right to put wells within the property. That eliminates that. Okay. Thank you, Jim. You're right. Sure. So after looking over the report, we agree with all of the conditions established and we agree with Mike's recommendations on working with the fire department to ensure that we have adequate and sufficient protection. And other than that, if you have any specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Great. Thank you, Jim. Do we have further applicant questions? No. Okay. All right. All right. Seeing none. Just to recommend this map, it does provide a couple of pretty significant items. One is an east-west connection north of the creek between Bruce Road and Notre Dame that will provide some relief for the traffic in and out of Marsh. Okay. And the other is a little bit of a The second, as Mike mentioned, is the provision of a pretty significant affordable project. And in fact, we have with us tonight the developer of that project. And if I could, I'd just like to turn it over to Lori Doyle for a few minutes. Sure. Hi, everybody. This is Lori Doyle. Can you hear me? Mm-hmm. Great. Thank you, Commissioner Ascendi. Thank you so much to the city staff for giving me the opportunity to be here virtually with you as well. This is my first official Planning Commission meeting virtually so bear with me if it's a little rocky. Personally, I am very excited to be here with you tonight to talk about this affordable housing development that we're referring to as North Creek Crossings at Merion Park. My company, Affordable Housing Development Corporation, has been a part of bringing almost almost 300 units of affordable housing to your community over the last 16 years. We have partnered with the Housing Authority of the County of Butte as their development consultant for 1200 Park Avenue. And we also developed, built, and still own the first affordable housing community in Merriam Park called Parkside Terrace. And about two years after that, we brought Harvest Park Apartments over on East Avenue to your community. We have a long and positive history working with the City of Chico and our local partners, including the Housing Authority of the County of Butte, who, as mentioned earlier, will be our non-profit partner in the process. Aside from our experience in Chico, our company owns and operates over 5,000 apartment units within 40 properties throughout California. So we are a very knowledgeable and experienced affordable housing developer in California and have been for about three decades. Just to give you a little concept of North Creek Crossings, if anyone's interested, the first phase will be 106 units consisting of 26 one-bedrooms, 53 two-bedrooms, and 27 three-bedroom units. It will also be a manager's unit as well as a centrally located community building for the residents. Our residents will benefit from a lot of open space, picnic areas, walking trails that will encourage socialization among the community. As Mike mentioned earlier in his staff report, the concept really is to create community among the buildings. And the design is such that the buildings will front under the street, which puts eyes on the neighborhood, providing both walkability and safety. As Jim also mentioned, this is an affordable housing project, which is near and dear to our hearts and something that we specialize in. So all the units will be below 60% of area median income. To give you some perspective, there's service sector employees, mental health workers, CNAs, pharmacy technicians, Uber drivers, farm workers, landscapers, people that are the heartbeat of the community, which is who we serve in these affordable housing communities. With that, again, I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here. I am open and available for any questions you may have. And we're looking forward. We'll be coming to the party community very soon. Again, thank you. Thank you, Lori. Do we have any questions for Lori? All right. Great. Do we have additional speakers? Ed Mayer, if you would want to speak. Is Ed Mayer on the line? Would you like to comment? Hello, this is Ed Mayer. Hi. Hello. Hello. Do you have a hot? Hello. Go ahead. Hi. Yeah. Go ahead.
