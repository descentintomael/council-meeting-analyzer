 Hi, this is Alex, and we're going to spend a few minutes, [inaudible]  spend a few minutes,  spend a few minutes,  All right.  Welcome, everybody.  So we're here at the regular Chief of City Council meeting on August 2nd.  We will call the meeting to order and we will start with an invocation from Clark Davis  Community Service Missionary Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, if you can come  down.  Welcome.  Our Father in heaven, as we bow our heads before you at this time, it's with gratitude  and humility and an expression of the many wonderful blessings that we enjoy.  Of living in a free land where we have so many blessings and we have many opportunities  to exercise our agency.  And we realize that there are many in the world who do not have these privileges and  these honors.  We are grateful for the members of this council who are willing to serve.  And we ask thee to bless them that they might have thy spirit to be with them to guide and  direct them in the decisions that they make.  We ask thee to bless them in terms of the service that they render and bless their families  and their families.  And we pray that thou bless us as a community, that we will be interested in the things that  transpire in this community and that we'll exercise our citizenship, that we might make  this a prosperous community and that we might grow together to solve the many issues that  face us.  We're grateful, Father, to live in this community.  It's a wonderful place to live.  And we give our praise and honor unto thee for this privilege.  And help us to be diligent and faithful in exercising our rights to do all those things  to make this a better place to live.  We ask thee to bless the members of this council this night as they make their decisions, that  they might be wise and that we might be supportive of the things that they do.  And we offer this prayer humbly in the name of thy son, Jesus Christ.  Amen.  All right.  Thank you very much for that.  We're actually going to take the next item, 1.4, a moment of silence in two parts.  You know, this is something that the council's done that I've been very proud of.  And I think it's very important to recognize in our community.  And the first person we lost this month was Jim Walker.  And although I didn't know Jim as much as I would have liked to, he always seemed very  pragmatic and stoic and very calm and reasonable in all his decisions.  And I know at times he reached out across the aisle and had the best interest of Chico  in his heart.  I think everybody who runs for this position and the people who are in it, they're going  to be on the city council or serve their community on some of our commissions, always has the  best interest of Chico in their hearts.  So Jim served on the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission from 2003 to 2007.  He was a council member from 2008 to 2010.  And he was vice mayor from 2010 to 2012.  So if we could just bow our heads in silence in memory of Jim Walker.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And then Tom Nichol actually was a friend.  And even though he was across the aisle on most things, he was quite a character.  And he always made his opinions known for sure.  And he was a strong character and a really good guy.  And I know I will miss him.  I miss him a lot.  And I miss both his advice and his barbs from time to time.  Tom served on the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission as well from 2017 to 2018.  He was a council member from 2006 to 2010.  And he served as vice mayor from 2008 to 2010.  So we lost two very good folks.  But if you could bow your head in silence for Tom Nichol and his memory.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  And thank you for that.  We certainly lost two of our past really good councillors.  And the loss is certainly felt in the community.  So now I'm honored to introduce the presentation of colors by Boy Scout Troop 2.  Take it away.  Audience, attention.  Color guard, attention.  Color guard, advance.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Color guard, prepare to post your colors.  Salute.  Please join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands  for which it stands, one nation, under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Post colors.  Two.  Color guard dismissed.  Audience, please.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  And you guys are welcome anytime.  All right.  Madam Clerk, can you please take the roll?  Council Member Bennett.  Here.  Council Member Brown.  Here.  Council Member Morgan.  Here.  Council Member O'Brien.  Here.  Council Member Tandon.  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Here.  Mayor Coolidge.  Present.  All right, we will start with the closed session announcement,  and we're going to turn that over to City Attorney Vincent Ewing.  Go ahead.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  The City Attorney, City Manager, City Clerk, and staff  met with me. and staff met with the council in closed session on agenda item 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and so forth. With respect to 2.3 no action was taken, direction was given. With respect to  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee. was taken, direction was given. No action was taken and no direction was given. And with respect to 2.5, no action was taken, no direction was given. Respect to 2.6, direction was given.  was given. No action was taken.  And with respect to 2.7,  no discussion occurred. That  concludes my closed session report.  All right. Thank you very much.  This time we'll do a speaker card announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the council  on any matter listed on the agenda  should first complete a speaker card,  which can be found at the back of the chamber.  And then once  completed, please turn that card  into the city clerk to my left  to your right. And speakers  will be taken in order the cards are  received. And once the speaker begins,  additional cards will not be  accepted. So if you want to speak on a particular item,  make sure you turn it in before that item is  actually announced and speakers are talking  on it.  A note, item  4.4, which is the downtown  Chico Property Business Improvement  District renewal. That hearing will be  heard first under the public hearing  section. So we're moving that  up in front of 4.1.  So staff  can recess to conference one to count the  ballots because there's a ballot procedure with  that too. So that'll save us some time.  In regards to time,  we have a very full agenda and  quite a  long meeting ahead of us. So  I'm going to limit public speakers tonight to two  minutes each unless we reach  30 and then we'll drop down to a minute.  I don't think we'll  necessarily get there. But  and then also if council members, according  to APNP 1010, could limit  their comments to two minutes as well, that'd be  appreciated. So  let's start with item 1.9,  swearing in of city  manager Mark Sorensen.  Clerk press.  You've done this a few times with him  before too. Fourth time.  Fourth time's a charm.  Could you raise your right hand and repeat after  me. I do solemnly swear  I do solemnly swear that I will  support and defend  the Constitution of the United States.  The Constitution of the United States.  And the Constitution of the State of California.  And the Constitution of the State of California.  Against all enemies. Against all enemies.  Foreign and domestic. Foreign and domestic.  And that I will bear true faith  and allegiance. And that I will bear true  faith and allegiance. To the Constitution of  the United States. To the Constitution of the United  States. And the Constitution of the State of  California. And the Constitution of the State of  California. That I take this obligation  freely. That I take this obligation freely.  Without any mental reservation.  Without any mental reservation. Our  Or purpose of evasion.  Or purpose of evasion.  And that I will well and faithfully.  And that I will well and faithfully.  Discharge the duties.  Discharge the duties.  Upon which I've entered.  Upon which I've entered.  Thank you, my dear.  All right.  Congratulations, Mr. City Manager.  Thank you.  Appreciate you joining the team.  All right.  So we will move on to the consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are to be considered routine in nature and act in one motion.  Do we have any speakers?  We have one speaker.  And that speaker is James Hutchinson.  And did you want to go with two minutes?  Two minutes.  Okay.  So James Hutchinson.  James Hutchinson.  Approval of the minutes of the last meeting that you had in July. on July 5th. Unlike many people here, I go back over the video record of what took place in this meeting. Anybody who looked at my comments will find they're gone. There are no comments there. It is written in the record though that I made comments. Very nice of you.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Thank you, Committee Committee.  Once again, I brought up the question whether O'Brien is here legally or not under the California codes.  California government code section 1099 in specific, I brought it up before.  And in that meeting, I was attacked by the mayor simply because I responded to something the city clerk said after I had finished my three minutes and was preparing to leave the podium.  The second time.  As far as voting goes, guess what, folks?  Second election in a row, I will not be able to vote for a council member.  The area I live happens to be one of the largest apartment complexes in Chico.  Okay?  It's run very well, very nicely, but we don't get to vote.  We don't get to vote on a council member.  We're going to be shoved into District 7.  No chance to participate.  Previous election, at large.  What happened when I tried to contact people in the city council about a problem?  Nobody responded.  And that was the first time I got up in front of this group.  O'Brien.  All right.  Any council disqualifications or no votes?  I'd just like to register an abstention from item 2.7.  I wasn't here for the July 5th meeting.  All right.  So noted.  Entertain a motion.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Morgan.  A second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Madam Clerk, take the roll.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already, like  cell phone usage.  No.  No, no.  I totally get it.  All right.  So, and note to turn off your phone ringer.  Members of the public may address the council at any time on, at this time on any matter  not already listed on the agenda with confidence being limited to two minutes.  And the council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section  of the agenda.  So if you have a comment which does not fall onto any of the particular items, now is the  time for those.  How many?  Any speakers?  We have seven.  All right.  Let's go with the two.  Okay.  So I'm going to call two names.  James Hutchinson is our first speaker, followed by Paula Hare.  If you're called second, please go ahead and stand in the aisle, the middle aisle.  So James Hutchinson, followed by Paula Hare.  Last time I appeared in front of this council, I brought up a certain apartment complex called  Murphy Commons.  It's a low-income place.  One of the qualifications originally.  When it was set up was that they fell into 30 to 60% of the medium income level.  Okay.  These people right now have huge complexes being built to either side of them.  First of all, we have the low-income senior citizen.  Then we have the low-income towers right next to them.  On top of that, they've recently had a case where a group of people came into the parking  lot of Marsh Junior High and tried to set off incendiary debris. at 5.30 in the morning seeing this. By the time the police get there, they're gone. It's the kind of thing that they're undergoing all the time. You also  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  They were done by police.  afternoon. Well, that was the same day as your meeting. And I brought it up at the time.  But it turned out they didn't. They delayed it for a week. So what happened?  All these preparations and things that these people did over a holiday period,  guess what? For nothing. They had to do it all  over again. One person had a major appliance go out. Couldn't reschedule  to have it replaced because they wouldn't have any electricity  at the times that were available to replace it. Okay? So they're without.  These people at Murphy Commons don't come here very often  because they don't like you. They don't like the police department. They're low-income  people. They're afraid of you. They're afraid they're going to get kicked out of their places.  I'm asking you to give them some consideration and a little bit of help. Somebody show up  there, even the fire department. Talk to them about escaping a case of a fire  because they're locked in there.  Paula Hare.  Just a second.  Followed by Amy Jernigan.  Paula Hare.  I was curious.  It seems like there's a lot of beds open at the power shelter  and at other places.  They're equal about 95 beds.  Why are you dragging your feet?  It's a scary thing.  It's scary.  It's scary.  It's scary.  It's scary.  It's scary.  It's scary.  trick or by the high school they're going out towards the VA because I go to  the VA at least twice a week to see doctors and one area used to be  gated off and locked up. That gates been ripped out and you got all the  campers in there, a big field of heavy grass next to it where you got them  building new housing and apartments. Now you got big white trucks up driving  right up on the little Chico Trink right there. All that nice dry grass you know.  I'm just wondering when the fire starts. Since they're not even supposed to be  there, not even in the middle of the night, I'm just wondering when the fire starts.  of those cancer campers or vehicles even supposed to be in there. Why they're  being allowed in there? Since it was a gated place and now the gates been tore  out by them maliciously. That's time. Yeah. That's time. Why? Amy Jernigan followed by Robin Engle.  Good afternoon everyone. Amy Jernigan. I'm here tonight representing the  Butte County Fair as a board member and reminding you that August is Butte  County Fair Month. Super excited to be here to let you know it's almost time  for corn dogs and carnivals. Opening night is, I should talk to you guys too,  opening night is Thursday August 25th starting at 530. There's a director's  reception. I left, actually I was got some help, but there's an invitation up there  for you for the directors reception and a flyer if you want to post somewhere at your business.  Also that evening at 6 p.m. is Little Miss Butte County. Also excited. I have a niece in it this  year so that's going to be fun. Friday night, mud bogs and tough trucks followed by Saturdays  are 10 o'clock junior livestock auction which is a really fun event for a lot of kids that  have worked really hard raising animals and we always love to see buyers. My favorite Saturday  evening is the destruction derby. We also have an RV destruction derby which has been super popular.  And Sunday is a fun rodeo and music festival in the arena. A lot of fun going on. Just wanted to come out, personally invite you, make sure that Chico knows that you are welcome and wanted at the Butte County Fair and we look forward to seeing you all there. Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  Robin Engle followed by Jessica Giannola.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже.  Thank you, тоже. don't have the privileges and blessings that we have. And it's not for us for any single person to decide who is more worthy or who is less worthy of services. It's not a crime to be for. It's not a deficiency of character to be  character to be for war. And in fact, we are all in this together and everyone deserves the same  equal human rights as everyone else. In the history of Chico, since we've been under District  Attorney Ramsey, over 37 people have been shot and killed by the police, or over 36, I'm not sure  on the exact number. At least half of these people did have known mental health histories with the  police department. That is something that needs to be looked into. The police manual doesn't have  mandated training for everyone in all of its 800 plus pages. That is something that needs to change.  De-escalation training that is evidence-based, based on a model that has tried and true for years,  needs to be happening within our police department. Kind of a little bit of a different note, I'm  understanding that the police, sorry, the people who are living in the pallet shelter community  are not the ones who are being trained. I'm not saying that the police are not trained. I'm not  saying that the police are not trained. I'm saying that the police are not trained. They are trained  to provide food for children, but they do not get sufficient food. They are getting food provided  by the school district, which are meals for children. And adults, we know, need at least  or approximately twice the calories, twice the nutrition and protein that kids need. That needs  to be looked into. There needs to be a systemic means for bringing people into the pallet shelter  community, as someone earlier said, and that's not happening. There are so many things that need to  happen that haven't been happening. I want to thank you, Alex Brown,  for bringing all of your values to council.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Julie Three.  Good, council.  I'd like to take this opportunity to ask again  that we consider moving to an accessibility standpoint  for people in the community with these meetings  so that they can participate by call or Zoom.  Many, many, many districts do this,  and Chico has yet to do that.  We did it through the pandemic.  I think we can improve upon that.  So we have people at home that have disabilities,  children, people who work different hours,  and they would like to participate  and have their voice heard.  Yes, they can email in,  but email is just not the same as a spoken word.  We're missing inflection.  We're missing just those nuances  with people and their participation.  And I think it's important that we hear people  who would like to participate  and we share with the community their concerns,  their wants, desires,  any of those comments on our agenda items.  So can we please consider and move forward  with offering that to our community  so that they can participate just as we are?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Julie Three, followed by Patrick Newman.  Hi, everyone.  Julie Three, here to advocate for the vaccine injured,  me being one of them.  You've heard me before.  So I just wanted to say thank you to a researcher  out in Jamaica.  I just got done with a podcast,  and I went through my whole vaccine injury  story with him.  So it was pretty exciting.  It's a little sad I had to go to Jamaica  to actually share my story,  but somebody cared.  Jamaica did.  So I shared my whole story with him.  My newest project is Butte County's Bad Batches.  So again, for those of you that are vaccinated,  you know that you got two batch numbers on your cards, right?  And mine's 042020A and 023M20A,  back in January, February, 2021,  where I worked at all the clinics  out at Merion Park first and then the fairgrounds.  So those you can look up in a database.  And I've got a program.  There's a person in Silicon Valley named Albert.  I want to give a shout out to Albert.  Welcome, EGLE88.  He did a dashboard on top of VAERS.  So you can actually go in here and pull up  and put your batch number in.  And this is actually the VAERS database.  He put a dashboard on top of it.  So you can easily see the information and numbers.  So you put it in and it gives you a relative toxicity.  So both of mine are guaranteed that I'm going  to be probably hospitalized most of them.  Again, I got the micro blood clot in the brain.  I got the brain fog, tinnitus, detached retina,  all because of neurological damage from this lot number,  both lot numbers.  Okay.  I now go in this database,  and I can pull up the med alerts for all these people.  It gives you the med alert for each individual.  You get their state.  You get their age.  You get their sex, date vaccinated, date died,  if they've died, and more information.  So when I pull up my batch number, and I pull  out 39 people with this 042L20A Moderna died.  The first one on here, she's 56 in Nevada.  And she's my age.  She got shot the day before me.  Her write-up says at 430 on January 22nd,  facility was notified of employee death.  Absolutely.  Thirty-nine people.  I go then and say, well, is there any in California?  Yeah, there's four.  Four in California.  I guarantee you these are probably in your county.  I worked at all these clinics.  One per day, one per week we gave of the same lot number.  This is disturbing.  It's disturbing that we don't get information from Danette York.  I'm calling the public death department at this point.  Why isn't Enloe, why aren't they telling us  when there's bad lots on there?  Why isn't the media asking?  That's fine.  Thank you.  I'm here if anybody wants to call media.  Our last speaker is Patrick Newman.  It's really hard to communicate anything in three minutes,  so two minutes is ridiculous and maybe that's the idea.  I don't know.  A third less democratic.  I've opposed the hiring of Mark Sorensen as city manager  and I've said why here and in the local paper,  mainly three areas.  One, I think it opens the door to low-density urban sprawl.  I think there's a long-standing connection  to the development industry.  It's not going to serve Chico well.  I see Mr. Sorensen's time on the council as being instrumental  in leading us to litigation, Warren v. Chico, and the war  on the homeless that's been expensive  for everybody including the homeless.  Thirdly, I stood here many times and recommended  that the city institute a sales tax because I think we're,  I think we're deprived of revenue that we need  to be responsible stewards of the infrastructure of this town.  In my memory, Mr. Sorensen poured cold water on that idea.  So that does lead me to the third and last issue  that I want to bring up tonight and that is this is now  on the ballot and I see letters  in the enterprise record running five  to one against this sales tax.  I think it's time to make it clear  to the citizens that we need to be responsible for the infrastructure  of Chico.  And I think you all need to stand behind this  that if we don't pass the sales tax  that the infrastructure including our roads  which are worth $500 million will continue  to decline exponentially.  And that the ultimate cost of that is far greater  than what will be collected on 1% sales tax.  So that needs to be revisited.  Maybe you need to challenge your ideological position on that  and be a little bit uncomfortable with your constituents.  That sales tax needs to pass.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Here's our last speaker.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  So we're going to move forward as discussed earlier  with item 4.4, Downtown Chico Property Business Improvement  District Renewal.  And I will turn it over to Ms. McCarthy.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds,  members of the council.  I'm Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager, here tonight  to talk through the final steps of the renewal process for the downtown,  Chico Business Improvement District, or PBID.  The PBID was originally formed in 2017 for a term beginning January 1,  2018 through December 31st of 2022.  The main purpose of the PBID was to provide expanded public safety,  maintenance and beautification, and economic services  to downtown businesses.  Per the PBID law, PBIDs are required to formally go  through the same process they went through with the formation when they're  going through the renewal process.  On June 7th of this year, the council adopted the resolution of intention to renew the PBID  within the downtown Chico area after receiving written petitions signed by the property owners  in the proposed district who would pay more than 50% of the assessments to be levied.  Per PBID law and Proposition 218, the city then mailed written notices and assessment  ballots to the owners of all of the property proposed to be assessed within the downtown  Chico area.  The proposed district's public hearing was held on June 8th.  Property owners were given more than the minimum of 45 days to cast their ballots and return  these ballots to the city clerk's office.  So tonight we ask that you open a public hearing to hear both pros and cons associated with  the downtown Chico PBID renewal.  And at the end of the public hearing, we will then go and at the city clerk's lead, we will  have the ballots be tabulated.  And at that point, you will continue on with your regular meetings.  And the clerk's office will then report back the final tabulation.  And at that point, the council will consider the final actions associated with the PBID  renewal.  And that is the final approval of the resolution of formation and the approval of the agreement  with the downtown Chico PBID to implement the management district plan, which you approved  back in June.  At this point, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about the downtown Chico PBID  or about the renewal process.  And I do know that there's also representatives from the PBID here tonight to answer questions.  All right.  Questions from council?  Thank you.  All right.  Do we have any speakers on this item?  So we do not have any speakers at this time.  Okay.  But I would ask that if anyone has a ballot that they brought and would like to have it  distributed and brought in and counted, if you could hand it off to Danny.  My staff will be going into conference room one with Jim McCarthy as well as the consultant  is there.  They will tabulate it.  It may take 30 to 45 minutes.  And so I'll stay out here so that we can continue our meeting.  Okay.  And then we'll bring it back and then council can make a vote if the votes are good.  So if you could go ahead and close the public hearing scene, Ms. Mullen.  All right.  We'll close the public hearing and move forward with the tabulation of the ballots.  Thank you.  Just give them a minute and then we'll move forward.  Okay.  Reversing back to item 4.1, Chico Cannabis Collection.  I'm sorry.  Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  So good evening, Angie Dill, the Management Analyst with the City Manager's Office,  and I'm here to discuss the cannabis appeal for Chico Cannabis Collective this evening.  So just a refresher, there are four phases to the cannabis application process,  and this appeal is on phase three, which was the City Manager's hearing.  So per the Municipal Code, the appeals on initial permits are limited to two things,  deviations from City procedures that affected the applicant adversely,  and if the scoring for the applicant was not justified.  If an appeal is upheld by the Council, the applicant would move to phase four,  which is that final selection by the City Manager.  Currently, there are only three applicants that are advancing to phase four.  The City Manager's hearing is guided by the Code,  and it's to determine the most suitable and complete applications for dispensary work,  within the City.  The phase three criteria that Interim City Manager Paul Hahn used during that City Manager's hearing  consisted of things such as the overall community benefit,  the geographic dispersal throughout the City,  site issues for each of the applicants, that kind of thing.  So Chico Cannabis Collective is here tonight on their appeal.  Their first item consists of kind of two parts,  the first being that the City Council violated the process,  and the number of allowed storefronts.  So June of last year, as you recall,  the City Council limited it from four dispensaries to three.  The Code is pretty clear that the Council has the ability to determine at any time,  by resolution, if their permits are to increase or decrease or remain the same.  They also had issue with the added benefit,  community benefits agreement requirement that was added at that same meeting.  All of the applicants were notified prior to applying,  for a dispensary within the City of this benefit.  They were not required to add anything to their application.  They simply were told that if they were selected as a finalist,  that they would be required to give 5% of gross receipts to the City.  The second item that they are appealing on,  there were 10 applicants that moved from phase two to phase three,  and only three that moved from phase three to phase four.  They claimed that because they had the high score in phase two,  that it should have resulted in a  significant improvement in their advancement to phase four.  So per the Code, an applicant who is deemed most qualified in phase two,  is not guaranteed any particular spot in the application process.  So applicants were actually notified via our website,  and prior to the City Manager's hearing,  that all 10 applicants moving forward would be on an equal playing field.  So their scores were no longer being taken into consideration,  rather the issues that I described earlier,  the site issues, the geographic location, that kind of thing.  So that's a big part of the application process.  Also, applicants moving to phase four are simply at the discretion of the City Manager, per the Code.  The third item that they are appealing on is that the City failed to hold a public hearing.  The Code that outlines the parameters for phase three of the cannabis application process  do not require a public hearing.  And the Code also gives the City Manager discretion to have the authority to adopt any procedures  to supplement that initial application process.  The fourth item was that they contended that there was no report that was publicly,  publicly, excuse me, provided to the Council prior to the decision not to allow them to move forward in the process.  There were updated guidelines that were posted both on our website,  and also emailed to all of the applicants that let them know that this was not a requirement.  The fifth item is the City Manager acted in direct opposition to procedures by not considering scores from prior phase.  And, by the Code, there is a Committee Committee Committee Committee Committee  phase four based on the city manager's hearing and the responses that are given during that time.  The sixth item is that they were prevented from providing meaningful facts to support their appeal  due to lack of transparency in the process. At the beginning of the phase three hearing,  the city manager notified all 10 applicants exactly what he would be using to select the  finalists. He was very clear and went over the criteria. It was also noted on our website that  no scoring would be used. No applicants were civilized any reports from that hearing.  The seventh and final item CCC is appealing on is the six-month delay in the city's application  process is indicative of internal problems and it's inherently flawed processes. The guidelines  are very clear stating that the city may modify or postpone or cancel  the application process. The city's application process is indicative of internal problems  that are not yet resolved. The permit application process without any liability or obligation.  In fact, all of the applicants signed some documents with this on it. They also win that  six-month pause occurred as you likely recall that was for council's reconsideration of fees  and the tax structure, which is directly tied to the application process. Any questions?  Questions for Mrs. Doe? Thank you.  All right.  So that is the staff report.  Do we have announcement of any ex parte communications?  All right.  Seeing none, we will open the public hearing for no more than 50 minutes.  The applicant has 15 minutes.  Yes.  And I would ask, okay, so if you are all going to share that 15 minutes,  then that would be great.  And if you could just say your name when you're going to speak.  I'll go ahead and just put the – let me just add this real quick.  I have to do it manually.  Thank you.  Welcome.  There we go.  Okay, so if you could start and get by your name.  Good evening, Mayor and Council.  My name is Ariana Van Alstyne.  I'm here on behalf of TWC Consulting doing business as Chico Cannabis Collective.  Okay.  And I'm here to talk about the Chico Cannabis Collective's campaign  in regards to its appeal of the decision not to move the company forward  to phase four of the cannabis dispensary application process.  First, thank you, Mayor, Council, staff, and citizens of Chico,  for the tremendous time and effort that you have put into developing a cannabis program.  It is precisely because of all the time and effort that you have put into this process  that Chico Cannabis Collective puts forth this appeal.  The city sought to create an objective system to determine the most appropriate cannabis  for the community.  And it has been designed to be a candidate for retail business in Chico.  However, the decision not to allow Chico Cannabis Collective to move forward  to phase four is fundamentally unfair.  The interim city manager's decision does not reflect objective scoring or an objective process.  This is unfair to CCC, but it is also unfair to Council and the residents of Chico  because CCC is among the most qualified applicants and because you have all put  such significant time and care and effort into creating this program.  We will continue to work with Council on this appeal to determine whether it will be  effective in achieving a fair and objective process.  Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Council grant CCC's appeal and allow  it to move forward to phase four of the application process.  To that end, I will present four points on appeal,  narrowed it a little bit from that first notice,  since we had additional information.  First, CCC has denied due process in this appeal  because it has not received all information  requested in its Public Records Act request  that was submitted in conjunction with the appeal.  Second, staff, citizens, and citizens  Second, staff, citizens,  failed to follow its process and this uniquely impacts Chico cannabis  collective third the interim city managers decision was arbitrary and  capricious and undermine the city process and for CCC's recommendation for  moving forward as I am not an owner of this business I will leave then leave  the floor to the owners Tyler Tamani Kimberly Carlisle and  Jennifer Pratt to introduce themselves to you directly turning to my first  point in connection with this appeal CCC filed the Public Records Act request  for information and documents related to the appeal process CCC is prevented from  preparing a meaningful appeal and is effectively denied due process rights  because it cannot present a meaningful appeal absent documents and information  requested in the Public Records Act request information requested directly  relates to the subject of this appeal including correspondence applications  and scoring materials with that said CCC  reserves the right to further appeal and utilize evidence that has not present  been presented been produced for the hearing today CCC's appeal should be  granted because the interim city managers decision was arbitrary and  capricious the decision not to allow a CCC to move forward to Phase 4 of the  application process must be overturned because staff deviated from published  application procedures and regulation that adversely affected CCC the interim  interim city manager deviated from the city ordinance by one, disregarding all previous  application phases, and two, failing to support the final decision with any evidence.  The interim city manager's decision not to allow CCC to move forward to phase four was  arbitrary and capricious because the process did not take into account previous scoring.  Pursuant to Chico Municipal Code 5R.42.055, the interim city manager will review the totality  of the record to confirm the tabulation of scores and decide which applicants have best  demonstrated fulfilling the requirements under the code for eligibility of a cannabis permit.  When CCC entered the interview with interim city manager, he informed the team that he  would be starting with a clean slate and all previous scoring would not be considered.  Likewise, as a result of the previous scoring, the interim city manager did not allow CCC  As identified in the staff report today, the phase three evaluation process will only be  based on presentations and responses provided by applicants during the interim city manager's  hearing.  Based on such responses provided, the interim city manager will determine the applicant  which shall proceed to phase four.  The FAQ and the interim city manager's actions are in contradiction of the ordinance and  the application procedures, and thus the decision must be overturned.  Staff's failure to consider objective scoring in the phase three evaluation process was  done by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board,  by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the  board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board,  by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the  board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board,  by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the  board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board, by the board,  member Morgan stated he wanted data demonstrating prejudice. This is precisely what CCC intends to  do. CCC's appeal is unique to other applicants because CCC had the third place ranking going  into the interview and was consistently ranked highly among other applicants for cannabis retail  business permits. In contrast, Chico Flagship, which replaced CCC in the third position,  was in 10th place prior to progressing into the interview with the interim city manager,  and Chico Flagship was never more than 10th place at any point in the scored ranking throughout the  previous phases of the application process. It scored 14th place in phase 2A. Had the previous  ranking been considered, it would have been difficult for Flagship to earn enough points  for the third spot. Failure to take into account the previous scoring was in violation  of the application process. Chico Flagship was never more than 10th place in the scored  of the city ordinance and created an unfair process, and thus the appeal should be granted.  Second, the interim city manager's decision not to allow CCC to move to phase 4 was arbitrary  and capricious because the decision is unsupported by any evidence. During the last appeal hearing  before council on July 5, 2022, the interim city manager specified that the decision was based on  conversations with applicants. He was not allowed to move to phase 4, but he was allowed to move to  phase 3. He was unsure how such conversations could be objectively compared to one another.  When determining which phase 3 applicants would be allowed to proceed to phase 4, the city manager  stated, we didn't do a ranking per se, and the interviews were not scored in a numerical way.  There was no scoring and no objective criteria to support the interim city manager's decision.  This lack of evidence is confirmed through the PRA request. No documents or information  are provided in support of the decision. The interim city manager's decision is not  based on evidence and violated the city's ordinance on procedure. The decision must be overturned,  and the decision is not based on evidence. The decision must be overturned,  to preserve the integrity and merit of the process that the city has so painstakingly set over the last  three years. To prevent further litigation, CCC has a recommendation for council to put forth a  motion to expand available commercial cannabis program retail licenses to four. Per the Chico  Municipal Code 5.42.110, the city council may determine at any time by resolution the number  of permits could be increased. City council has discretion to adopt a resolution to improve the  quality of the cannabis retail services. The resolution is to change the allowed number of  storefront cannabis retail businesses from three to four, and issuing a fourth permit to CCC would  remedy the injustice to CCC while preventing further litigation by allowing Chico flagship  to move forward as well. In sum, in the interest of fairness and ensuring that Chico has the best  retail applicants, CCC requests that city council disagree with the resolution. The resolution is  to approve the interim city manager's decision and grant the appeal. CCC put significant time,  money, and resources into the application process over the course of a year and a half,  and since the city's ordinance first took effect and should receive due consideration for its  application in phase four. Thank you for your time. We look forward to working with the city to ensure  the commercial cannabis program application program is equitable and transparent moving forward.  Good evening, council. My name is Tyler Tamani. I'm a co owner of CCC. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you guys tonight. I was born and raised here in Butte County, spend most of my life, hear, and Chico,  I graduated from Chico State in 2011 with a business degree.  My wife has taught in Chico Unified, and she has taught at the university over the last 10 years.  We have two beautiful children that we have chosen to raise here in Chico.  This is a great community, and we plan on being active families and look forward to being a part of the fairs, the FFAs, the 4Hs, Little League, and dance with my girls.  In 2018, I actually partnered up with these girls, and we own multiple cannabis businesses, one being a cannabis dispensary in Modesto.  And it's been one of my longtime goals to own a dispensary here in Chico in my hometown, and be able to bring the cannabis into the hometown.  We have secured a lease, a very good lease, in a discreet spot on 175 East 20th Street.  We've been paying that lease for over a year now.  Our location is very good to the sensitive users.  And our neighbors support our application.  Throughout this lengthy and expensive application process, we scored six.  And in our final combined score, we were number three.  This top score was due to our expert experience in conducting, opening, and operating storefronts throughout Northern California.  We are here tonight to ask you to overturn the interim city manager's unfounded decision.  Thank you for everything you guys do for Chico.  Good evening, council and staff.  Thank you so much for hearing us tonight.  My name is Kimberly Cargile.  I'm co-owner of Chico Cannabis Collective.  I have owned and operated retail storefront cannabis dispensaries throughout Northern California for the last 15 years, and serve on the board of the National Cannabis Industry Association.  At my Sacramento dispensary, I created an ownership incubator program to teach my employees how to become owners of their own and how to start their own dispensaries.  As a result...  I am part owner in dispensaries in Napa, Dixon, Davis, Modesto, Tracy, and Placerville.  This significant experience was recognized during the scoring process and during the  city's phase two interview, which we moved up then also.  We scored well in phase one, 2A, 2B, and our combined score put us in third place.  It was concerning to hear in the phase three intern city manager's interview when he stated,  quote, nothing up to this point mattered and everything was being thrown out.  If the intern city manager was going to throw out all the scores from the previous phases,  then why did we go through the whole process that took over $100,000 of our hard-earned  money in a year to complete?  Another concern that I have is the intern city manager has provided no objective grounds  on which it was decided that another applicant that consistently scored lower than 10th place  was to move up to third place.  The application procedures and guidelines were invalidated in the phase three interview  as city code states the city manager will review the totality of the record and confirm  the tabulation of scores and decide which applicants have best demonstrated fulfilling  the requirements under the code for eligibility of the cannabis business permit.  Thank you so much for hearing my questions and concerns.  Good evening, council and staff.  My name is Jennifer Pratt, and I am co-owner of Chico Cannabis.  I have worked in the cannabis industry for the last eight years.  My experience is unique to many operators because I have worked in every part of the  cannabis retail business and know how to solve problems from the executive level through  to customer service, inventory processing, and security.  As business partner of CCC, I will be residing right here in Chico, and being an active and  contributing member to the city as a business is a top priority.  Based on all documents and information available to date, no evidence supports the interim city  manager's decision.  Failure to consider scoring from previous phases is in violation of the ordinance.  We ask the city council to allow us to move on to phase four.  Thank you so much for your time and making Chico a wonderful place to work and live.  Appreciate your time.  All right.  Thank you very much.  How many speakers do we have on the line?  I believe we have six remaining.  Okay.  So we need to do three minutes just to adhere to the hearing guidelines.  So for this item, we have to do three.  So we'll do three for each of those six.  Okay.  So Tony Ruiz, followed by Andrea Gomes.  And if you can go ahead, if you hear your name called, go ahead and go into the middle  aisle.  Thank you.  I'm Tony, and I'm Tony's co-owner.  I'm here to support CCC, the team of CCC, and Tyler also.  I just want to iterate how involved that Tyler is locally.  His dad is here to support tonight also.  Tyler and I run our family farm in Butte County.  It was started in 1926 by my grandfather and then handed down to my father, and now Tyler  and I run it.  We grow organic walnuts.  Peaches, and Tyler has a warm farm on it.  We also are involved in flipping homes in Butte County, Sutter County, and Yuba County.  We've flipped 26 in the last 10 years, and we also own rentals in this area in Chico.  Thank you.  And in Gridley and down in Pumas Lake.  So you see, Tyler's value, he values his roots in Butte County.  And he's a big fan of the  community, and he stayed local.  And being involved locally is very, very important to him.  Thank you.  Andrea Gomes, followed by Mary Colgan.  Good evening, council members.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak here tonight.  My name is Andrea Gomes.  I was born and raised in Yuba City.  Graduated from Chico State and currently live with my husband and two children in Durham.  During my time tonight, my goal is to bring you the best of my life.  I want to provide you with some background of Tyler Tamani and his family, highlight his business practices, and emphasize the value of allowing Chico Cannabis Collective to have a cannabis dispensary here in Chico.  Tyler is my brother-in-law.  I have known Tyler for about 10 years.  During that time, I've had the honor of watching him become a husband to Courtney and father to their two daughters, Autumn and Evie.  Tyler is one of the hardest working people I have ever known.  He is tenacious and diligent in the field of cannabis.  He is someone who manages his business with expertise, attention to detail, and self-reliance.  During the busy season, it is a rarity to see Tyler while the sun is still out.  Farming is in his blood.  He comes from generations of farmers and continues to grow his crops proudly in the North State.  Tyler's wife Courtney is a speech pathologist here in the North State.  She received her degree and credentials from Chico State University and has served kids of all ages in the Chico area.  The owners of Chico Cannabis Collective own and operate successful cannabis dispensaries here in Northern California.  They grow their product locally and Jen and Kim represent 22% of the women who currently hold executive level roles in the cannabis industry.  Based on the most recent U.S. Census Bureau, men currently represent 70% of owned employer firms here in Chico.  The dispensary location for CCC was chosen carefully with all of the zoning requirements taking into account.  This was due to the commitment and diligence of the CCC planning team.  The location has ample parking and multiple protected vehicle entrances.  These are factors that over time will increase market sales and reduce the likelihood of crime in the area.  Regarding the proximity of CCC's location to Chico Flagship, who was one of the three chosen to move to Phase 4,  I would like to reference the clustering phenomenon,  which proves that the innovation of the CCC  and the innovation of the Chico Cannabis Collective  The CCC is an innovative activity among two firms in the same industry in the same area.  Examples we see already here in Chico are Home Depot, Lowe's, fast food restaurants, chain restaurants, and retail businesses.  Benefits include increased productivity and stimulation of new business,  both of which have positive impacts on the overall Chico economy.  In closing, I would like to thank you for your time tonight  and hope that the information I have provided allows you to reconsider  and approve CCC to move to Phase 4.  The CCC is committed to keeping business in Chico rooted in community.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mary Colgan, followed by Courtney Tamani.  Thank you all for hearing us today.  I'm just here to represent, as a friend of Tyler Tamani, I've known him for almost 20 years now.  We met while working on the Chico Cannabis Collective project.  I've been working at Tres Hombre's here in downtown Chico, which I still work and manage at today.  Over the years, Tyler and his family have been very much involved in the community.  They're always out at Thursday night markets, Taste of Chico, Slice of Chico, Friday night concerts.  You'll always see them there in their children dancing way.  They've always been a huge support in any situation of fundraising.  They're always there to back me.  No questions asked for whatever needs to go on.  They've always been very, very much a part of this community.  And I see them continuing that with this cannabis collection.  I just hope that you guys could hopefully move forward and let them move forward in the fourth phase of this.  And see that they would be a great person to move, to go on with this.  Sorry, I'm not a very good public speaker.  But they are great, great people.  And with the history of his partners, I think, you know, they're not, it's not a guessing game for them.  It's not a trial.  It's not a trial and error.  They know what they're doing.  And they know how to do it right and do it safely.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you, Courtney Timani, followed by Wade Williams.  Hello.  I'm Courtney.  I'm Tyler's wife.  And I'm here to show my support not only for him but for the women that he's working with.  They have worked extremely hard to prepare for the next generation.  And they have the chance to create the CCC.  Tyler and I are raising our two daughters here in town.  And we value strong work ethic and honesty and community involvement.  We are very rooted here and love raising our kids in this setting.  As you've heard, Tyler is a farmer and a businessman.  I'm a speech pathologist.  And I've worked in the area for about ten years.  And I pride myself on using evidence-based research when I provide therapy and support for my families.  So I'm encouraging you to look at the evidence here tonight.  The appeal for reconsideration of their application is in your hands at this point.  And I ask the city to...  I take this responsibility.  I take the responsibility of speaking to you tonight very seriously.  And I want you to know that the approval of the CCC is one that is very desirable for the following reasons.  You want a business that is safe.  The location of the CCC is convenient and discreet.  In comparison to other locations that were approved in this district,  our CCC location has the only pull-up secured garage to allow for a safe transport  of the...  of the cannabis to be delivered to its community members.  So picture a van pulling in to a secured garage,  being able to pull away,  and no one can get access to it.  I don't think any of the other applicants close to us can say that.  As a mother and an educator,  safety is a key for our community as well as for our local police officers.  You want a business that is locally owned and operational,  and operated.  That other applicants that have perked interest into this...  this venture have maybe come from out of state,  and they don't fully understand how to run a business with a Chico pride.  The women working alongside my husband are native to Northern California  and know the ins and outs of running a successful dispensary.  Our family and friends and neighbors are all here,  and we want to thank you for your consideration for this appeal.  In addition, for the approval for CCC to move on to Phase 4  and open and operate in Chico would be our dream come true.  So when you think of Cannabis Collective,  I want you to think of these things.  Safety, family, and Chico Pride.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Bob Evans.  Oh, no, he was on a different item.  You're up.  I didn't want to cut in line.  That's fine.  Okay.  Well, Council, here we are again with another applicant  appealing for their cannabis business.  I found this process really interesting to follow.  We've had so many appeals,  and that same topic just keeps coming up,  that the process was unclear  from the very beginning,  and each step left applicants confused  and seeming like they were following the steps,  but then we see this applicant today  where they said they did everything they were supposed to do,  were doing good, were at the front of the line,  and then something happened with one person's decision  on whether or not they could move forward or not.  And I find that really concerning,  as is that how we run our city?  Is this what we do to people who are coming in,  who are coming before you,  and applying to run a business here?  Are we just having one person make this decision  without any sort of backing up,  no clear understanding of the process?  I think that's dangerous to go down.  In fact, I do fear that the city could be facing  more litigation with scenarios like this,  and that's not something that we want to see  our tax dollars going to.  It seems like the applicant had a lot of family, friends  that were here in support,  but what it comes down to is just  the process and the clear legality of the process  and not showing any signs of discrimination  or whatever it might be.  I would have concerns that applicants  do have grounds there.  So I just hope that you do approve this appeal  and move forward and hopefully learn from this entire process  for the future when it comes to proposals  and people wanting to run a business here in Chico.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Bob Evans.  Evening, Council.  Let me start by saying that I am not a Tamani or a Gnomes.  I'm not related to the family, but I am a friend.  I've known this family for many years now.  My wife, Mary, has worked with Courtney in the school system  where she works with teaching families  and helping families of kids, of special needs kids.  And she has dedicated her life,  her professional life, to that cause.  Tyler is probably one of the most hardworking men I know.  He is dedicated to his life professionally.  He's also dedicated to his family, his two children,  and his wife, and he's Chico-centric.  I know him to be very proud of this community.  He has deep roots.  He's a third-generation farmer.  Anybody who knows farmers knows they're hard workers.  So that is my pitch as it relates to I know local connections  are very important to this process,  and I can't think of a better family to have in this business,  in this local, than this family.  I also just want to say one thing about the process.  I just find it puzzling.  I think it's very interesting that a company who's,  after evaluating business plans and the whole process,  in tenth place can pass up to ninth place,  the eighth place, the seventh place,  the sixth place, the fifth place,  the fourth place, and the third place,  based on one interview.  I just don't see how that works.  I don't see how you get the best results  by doing that.  And I would appreciate the council taking a look.  If nothing else, the reasons given to make that move  from tenth to third ought to be made public.  The other candidates deserve that,  and where they fell short,  or where this one candidate excelled in that one interview  should be known as public knowledge to all the candidates.  Thank you.  All right.  Would the applicant like their additional three minutes  to rebut everybody talking nice about them?  Hello again.  I likely will not take the entire three minutes.  I just wanted to make one brief point.  I don't think I can say many of the things  that the owners of the business and the public  have said better than they said themselves.  Just one quick point on the Public Records Act request.  And I know that the staff report indicated  that none of the applicants were provided with the applications  for other applicants or detailed scoring.  And draw you back to what that Public Records Act request means.  Government Code 6254 at SEC requires that processes be !  made public absent a specific need to keep them private.  So in this instance, once the scoring was complete  for each phase of those applications  and on the full scope of the application materials,  those materials should have been made public.  The vast majority of cities who go through these processes  make those public immediately.  We received certain application materials for some applicants  and not for others.  I was hoping to avoid going through those details today,  but since that was brought up  in the staff report, I just wanted to address  that specific issue.  And as some of the public comments stated,  that is precisely the issue here,  is that there is no reasoning that's been provided  why the applicant that was never scored higher than 10%  or 10th place is now the third applicant to move forward.  There's just no justification for it.  So with that, I will relinquish the floor  and let you discuss.  And thank you again for your time this evening  and again for all the time you've spent on this process  and considering all the applicants.  All right, thank you.  We will close the public hearing.  Council discussion?  Or a motion?  I'll ask a couple questions just to get a couple things  out of the way from our Mr. Bentz, if you could answer.  Mr. Bentz?  Yes.  So there are several allegations that we violated our ordinance.  Could you affirm, did we or did we not violate our ordinance  in any way?  Thank you, Vice Mayor Reynolds.  I can say that the City of Chico did not violate its ordinance,  and it's not uncommon when you have appeals or arguments  from another side for them to advance a particular position  that may not be supported either in fact or law.  That is the case here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  One of my other ones that came up is the arbitrary and capricious.  And just for the fact of everybody that was in here,  Ms. Stowe, can you remind me who,  it was not just the interim city manager that made that,  I know the police chief was in there.  I believe Brendan Vig was in there.  Can you remind everybody who all was in that meeting?  Yeah, it was myself, interim city manager Paul Hahn,  community development director Brendan Vig,  and Captain Billy Aldridge.  So the decision that was came to, it was discussed amongst everybody?  Yes.  Correct?  Each bringing a different area of expertise.  Awesome.  And we actually don't know who's, I don't know, I don't,  who's number one, two, and three.  Technically 10 could be one and two could be three and three could be two.  It's saying the number 10 went to number three.  I don't know who's one, two, and three, right?  Because at that point there's no...  Right.  The ranking, it went away.  It was a very small percentage between those top 10,  so it was only about 7% difference between all of them.  But we did not rank all 10 of them at the end.  I think that's what you're asking.  Yes.  And that was another one of my questions,  because by the time we got to this point,  I believe there was only a six or seven point difference between the number one  and the number 10, correct?  Correct.  Okay.  And I had one more.  That's all I have for right now.  I have a...  Council Member Bennett.  Mr. Ewing, City Attorney Ewing,  several of the comments that were made a few minutes ago  referred to a violation of the Public Records Act,  and so I'm curious about that.  Certainly.  Thank you, Council Member Bennett.  I'm familiar with the issue.  I've had an opportunity to communicate with opposing counsel,  or the counsel representing the appellant,  on that particular issue.  The facts are that the city responded to the Public Records Act requests  in a timely manner.  The response by the city was closed or completed on July 27th,  sometime in the morning, during normal business hours.  So the appellants had the opportunity from July 27th to date  to prepare for this appeal hearing.  In my communications with the...  City Appellants Council,  I reiterated the point that I just made to you,  and I said,  Hey, look, you've gotten the documents.  It's July 27th.  Roll up your sleeves, get to work,  and get ready for the appeal hearing on Tuesday.  That was the messaging from the city attorney's office  on behalf or for the city of Chico.  So there's been no violation of the Public Records Act request.  Now, sometimes, in all fairness to...  In all fairness to the appellant,  I think it's important to note that the public entity  And sometimes what you have when a person or an individual  makes a request for a public record,  and the public entity responds by providing that public record,  oftentimes the individual will say,  Well, this isn't what we asked for.  This is inadequate.  Or you haven't completed your request  as if they're holding the ball, if you will,  or if they have the power to determine  what records are responsive by the city.  It's the city's discretion to look for the records,  see that they're in the custody and control of the city,  maintained in the regular course of the business of the city,  not subject to any exemptions or exceptions  to the Public Records Act request,  and then to produce those records.  Now, the city is very reasonable.  If we didn't respond to something appropriately  or we provided the wrong document  and we get that information from a requester,  we'll fix it.  To our knowledge, we can...  We closed the request because we believe  that we responded to the Public Records Act request.  Now, if there's clarification that is required  or there's subsequent requests,  we'll respond to those as well,  but we have not received them to date.  Thank you.  All right, Council Member Brim.  I can completely understand  why the city wouldn't share the reasoning  behind selecting other applicants  over the ones that didn't get selected.  Is there a reason why  the city wouldn't offer input  as to why an applicant specifically  wouldn't be selected?  You know, feedback input as to the criteria  that was measured against in that final phase?  Sorry about that.  I think that's what Paul Hahn was trying to do  when he went over with each of the applicants  exactly what he was...  looking for in the beginning,  the different...  If there were site issues,  if there were deliverability issues,  that kind of thing.  So he tried to be as transparent as possible  at front explaining each of the different areas  that he would be selecting the finalists on.  Does that answer your question?  I mean, I think to the best of your ability, it does.  So on the front, and what you're saying  is the previous assistant city manager  on the front end said,  this is what we're measuring against,  but on the back end did not provide any justification  or explanation as to how the applicants were denied  or their reasoning.  There were no scoring reports.  The scoring was all done in that phase two process.  Yeah, got it. Thank you.  All right, further questions from council?  Entertain a motion.  I'll repeat my last motion.  We had only had an appeal for the same reason.  Everybody that applied that didn't make it  through the entire process  feels they're going to have justification to say,  I didn't know exactly what T is to cross  and I is to dot.  At the end of the day,  I have to trust in the city attorney  and the staff that we put together  and Captain Aldridge and everyone else.  To make the right call,  as Ms. Dill pointed out,  the percentage change was really, really small.  So while I appreciate Bob coming up here and go,  how does somebody go from number three to 10?  That sounds like it's a big change,  but not if it's a couple percentage points  based on something that's subjective or not subjective  by people like, sorry to call you out Captain,  but Captain Billy Aldridge,  who's responsible for the public safety of the city.  If, and I said this last time we had an appellant,  and I do appreciate that this group,  I think did a better job making their case.  But if we overturn one,  we got to overturn them all.  I'm not willing to do that.  This is a hard choice getting here anyway.  So I will move that we deny the appeal.  I'll second that.  I have motion and second.  Madam Clerk, you take the roll.  Council Member Bennett.  And I'm going to start with,  is it a yes, a yes, or a no, a no?  A yes, a yes, and a no.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Abstain.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Abstain.  Mayor Coolidge.  Yes.  Aye.  Okay, carries five with two abstentions.  All right.  And with that,  we have a motion and a second.  Seven,  Seven,  Seven,  Seven,  Seven,  Seven,  All right, we're going to call the meeting back to order.  Move on to item 4.2, resolutions of the application to annex unincorporated island areas.  Wow, that's a tongue twister today.  Mr. Mayor, can you repeat the item?  I'm not sure where we are.  I cannot.  Resolutions of the application.  All right, Mr. Beek, take it away.  Good evening, Mayor Kulit, Vice Mayor Reynolds and Council.  Again, I'm Brendan Beek, Community Development Director for the City of Chico.  So tonight, just a reminder that at your March 15, 2022 meeting, in an effort to consolidate the city's boundaries  and to encourage the efficient delivery of urban services,  the Council authorizes...  The Council authorizes the City Manager to enter into an island annexation agreement  between the City of Chico and Butte Local Agency Formation Commission, otherwise known as LAFCO.  The agreement obligates the City to submit annexation applications to Butte-LAFCO  for all four of those annexation areas later this month.  Tonight, Council is being asked to initiate proceedings for the annexations by adoption of four resolutions.  Consistent with the agreement, and in order to allow reasonable time for the City to prepare for their provision of services to the areas,  LAFCO has staggered the recordation of the annexations over four years.  State law requires that a resolution initiating an annexation be considered following a noticed public hearing.  Later this month, staff will submit applications to Butte-LAFCO for the four annexation areas.  LAFCO will do its own noticing, consider the annexations at a hearing, receive public comment, and take final action on the proposals.  So after tonight, there would be no further Council action.  Since the public notice went out over a month ago,  to all the property owners and the residents within the four annexation areas,  I've had approximately a dozen contacts from residents inquiring about sewer requirements,  continued use of wells, leaf burning, and other commonly asked questions associated with annexation.  To highlight a few themes, the City does not require residents to hook up to the sewer.  Cow water does not require connections to its water service.  Yes, you can continue to have horses and other animals.  The City and counties...  animal keeping standards are very similar. There are no changes in taxes required. No,  the city isn't going to immediately extend sewer lines, paved streets, and add sidewalks  to the annexed areas. Honestly, for better or worse, not much will change. I like to  think ultimately there's an overall benefit to annexation in that police response is better,  you have an opportunity to connect to the city's sewer, you get leaf pickup, you get  to vote for the city council, and you can serve on boards and commissions. The city  has proceeded with three significant island annexations over the last three years, including  North Chico, Chapman and Mulberry, and the Glenwood Avenue areas, and I'm not aware of  any major resident concerns. Tonight, council is being asked to approve resolutions initiating  proceedings to annex four areas identified in the island annexation agreement between  the city and Butte-Lapine. If you have any questions, I'm available. Questions? All right,  thank you very much.  Number of speakers? We have 13. All right. Two minutes, we'll open the public hearing.  Okay. So our first speaker is James Hutchinson, followed by Scott Long.  I'm going to limit my comments to one area, the El Monte annexation. We just heard that  not much will change.  There's a bridge being planned that connects Notre Dame across 32 straight into El Monte.  That's what will change, the traffic flow in your area. Why? Because of the 2030 plan,  the city of Chico wants to make new arterial traffic areas. Notre Dame will go clear across  town through the park up and around. That's what they're doing to you. They don't tell  you that when they do. They don't tell you that when they do. They don't tell you that  when they come into your area. They don't tell you that when they come into your area.  They don't tell you that when they come into your area. They don't tell you that when they  come into your area. They don't tell you that when they come into your area. They don't  your area. They don't tell you that when they come into your area. They don't tell you that  when they come into your area. They don't tell you that when they come into your area. They  don't tell you that when they come into your area. They don't tell you that when they come  into your area. They don't tell you that when they come into your area. They don't tell you  that when they come into your area. They don't tell you that when they come into your area.  your traffic flow through your area.  If you're in El Monte and you want to know  what the,  the Hatchico gets out of this,  you're gonna move traffic there and see the property.  Anybody who's looked at this map  that was included in exhibit one,  El Monte Annex District number one,  will see the real difference between the lots  that are there in that area,  opposed to the area around it.  This is a totally different type of environment,  you know it.  I've visited a number of times,  I'm not far from there,  I've walked through this area so many times,  we love it.  My wife and I,  it's one of the first places we ever visited  in this part of Chico.  Keep in mind,  city of Chico is using this to create a new thing  to comply with their 2030 plan.  Scott Long followed by Sandra Del Agostino.  Good evening.  I live on Dorado Cerro,  and I just saw that there was encouraging,  efficient delivery of services.  I seem to recall the city trying to annex us,  the area several years back to no avail.  It seems the majority of residents didn't want  to be folded into the city.  I don't see a lot of benefits being annexed.  Police protection, no disrespect to Chico PD,  not really.  The Chico PD is not currently respond  to most property crimes, but rather have the,  the victim fill out online reports  as they are already overworked and understaffed.  Fire protection, no change,  just switching who's gonna be what.  We still have mutual aid with Cal Fire and Chico Fire.  Water and sewer, not available to the majority of us,  and if my memory serves correct,  if it were available to our street,  the cost would be somewhere more than $16,000  per property to hook up,  and requires new, and that was 10 years ago.  Furthermore, it requires numerous properties  to hook up and requires a pumping station.  Road maintenance and repair, our roads are in better shape  than the city limits, than the city streets.  Our roads are in better blah, blah, blah.  Storm drainage, think dead horse slew,  which has jumped its bank flooding through Otto's Harrow  three times in the 20 years since I've lived there.  I have no idea how you can fix that problem at this point,  but truly believe two of the main reasons for it is that,  the main reasons for the flooding is due to the city  allowing past development upstream without adequately  addressing the lost drainage basin having been built  and paved over in the years previous.  City of Chico politics, draw your own conclusion.  Let's talk trash, ecology, and waste management.  The fact I don't have a voice or a choice is bad enough.  Currently, I have to use waste management  as the city of Chico property owner,  and in my opinion, they're terrible.  I hope we have a vote on this,  and a voice and the choice that this is gonna happen.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sandra Del Agostino, followed by John Schaller.  Gonna have to take this off.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I attended a meeting years ago, maybe about six,  in which the large community, the city, the city, the city,  came and they all voted to keep our district as it is.  They did not want to change it and make it part of Chico,  and they all still feel like that.  There's no one here except a couple of us,  but anyway, we're making our point.  I'm gonna have to put my glasses on here.  Our favorite thing about Chico is that,  my family has lived there 10 years, on El Monte,  and,  it says,  on this card, that was sent to us,  that we will become part of,  Chico, or,  next,  next station,  on 2025.  Okay, it,  it, ah,  says, also,  that,  um,  it will give,  efficient,  delivery,  of services. Well we already have that. We already have fire trucks that come and  help us. We have ambulances that come and help us and then the rest of us we work  together as a community. Okay we love living there and believe it would be  better to leave it alone with no change from Butte County to Chico. And that's  all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you. John Scholar followed by Rick  Mananarino and I apologize I'm massacring your names. I apologize. So  John Scholar. Thank you. I'm John Scholar. I have lived at 819 El Monte Avenue for 41 years.  We  have  we  built the house, raised our kids there, actually have been in business in Chico for that entire  time. But I think it was 30 years ago there was an attempt made to annex our area on El Monte  to the city. That was everybody was opposed to it at that time. I'm still opposed to it.  The there's you're going to if you take over that area you're going to have storm drain problems. As some of you may remember dead horse slew flooded. So somebody's going to have to deal with that. Near Kirk Lane, Kirkway, the one that's on the left. That's where the  water comes down there comes under El Monte and goes out into the fields. It sinks there because it is permeable. If you've put concrete back there and put houses and stuff back there, you're going to have storm drain problems. Right now it's workable if we have come back to normal rainfall.  If we have come back to normal rainfall.  Right now we're not getting that problem. But you will again if we get an only new event.  The sewer and water it's going to cost right now you'd say keep it the way it is. But what's going to happen is they infill with apartments, houses and that sort of a thing. It's going to put  a  a  a !  A  a  a  a  a  a  a  a  a  a !  Rick Minerino followed by Wade Williams.  You got it right. Thank you.  He helped me.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening. I grew up on Chico Canyon Road. Our loop, so we've been over 50 years. We own two adjacent properties. I own one and then my other two. other two.     I'm from Chico Canyon. We have over two and a half acres.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening.  in the city. We're very low density.  The only service that's highlighted there  is the police and we've relied on the sheriff all this time  and response has always been quick.  It just, the city is  in a sense an unwanted HOA, or let's put  it this way, an unnecessary one where there's more rules and restrictions.  And I understand that there's  you can still have hoved animals, for example, but how I  understand it is you have to have, the number you have on your property at the time of  annexation determines how many you'll have for  moving forward once you're annexed. So I don't want to play the game where I have to pack  our properties with animals because some years we have different  animal needs, whether it's 4-H, whether it's horses.  Recology,  we'll take recology any day over waste management.  And we have a lot of fiber on our land and  I used to fight forest fires. I diligently burn each  winter on burn days. And the cookie cutter, one size fits all.  Irregardless of what size your property is, you can't burn, doesn't work for us.  It's just not efficient. And we feed our fruit trees  and then the rest of our plants with those ashes.  Anyway, thanks for being awake. Appreciate it.  Thank you. Wade Williams, followed by Maria Stratton.  Hello there. I live on Hostick Way and it's off Centennial Avenue.  I've lived there for 26 years. It's been a great place to live. Raised my kids there.  It's been a great place. It's a private lane. It's gravel.  There are larger lots. I have animals. I've got a well.  And at the expense of being redundant,  I want to own, just for the record, I want to own and maintain my well going forward.  I want to keep my animals there.  I'm really not interested in having the city on Hostick Way at all.  And I don't see a benefit.  I could go on, but I won't. Thanks.  Thank you. Maria Stratton, followed by Carlton Lowen.  Hi. It's Marla.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for the long time.  I'm just here to represent a few of the property owners in the Five Mile area.  We have a drainage ditch that comes from the Shastan development.  It goes in front of a lot of our houses and  we don't really know who's responsible for that drainage ditch.  Is it the county? Is it the city?  If one person maintains the ditch and the person next to them doesn't, it's really a mess and it's flooded many times  since that Shastan development has gone in.  So,  our issue is through this whole annexation process,  we want it defined as to who's responsible for this ditch  because it's only getting worse over time.  Where it goes out to Manzanita Avenue, it's basically not a ditch anymore.  And we really have issues with that.  We've had swimming pools that have been filled with mud three or four times.  People have had to replace the floors of their house,  some of their rooms.  Because the water gets so high.  So, our main concern is who is going to be responsible for this drainage ditch.  It's the open storm drain ditch that goes down via Morrow and out to Manzanita.  So, that's just, I hope that you can address that when you're dealing with this.  Who is responsible for it?  Thanks.  Thank you. Carlton Lowen followed by John Hopper or Hooper.  First of all, thank you for the extra minute.  Appreciate it.  This is regarding West Sacramento annexation and  we've been residents of Bidwell Avenue for close to 40 years and  we have a very tight closed community,  very few homes come on the market with COVID.  The walk walking that the folks that are on West Sacramento,  They come through Fernleaf and they the foot traffic has increased quite a bit and we have Creek repairs  from time to time so  we you're inheriting something that has some issues and  With that  We've the history is we've had a very close  relationship with with the sheriff's and  the help from the jail system coming for  The Creek cleanup. We have a strong neighborhood watch community  the Board of Supervisors that had been with Bidwell Avenue and that district had been very close to the residents of  Bidwell Avenue, and so I when I say we and I I'm up here as one resident for the  Bidwell Avenue I see on the gray area  that  We're talking about that it represents about a third of the distance from the Rose Street Bridge down to coming out  The other way so how does that all work on coordinating when let's say for tree trimming?  maintenance  with many folks have septic some have cow water some don't so every house is there's a different situation so  We the neighborhood we're asking you that we  can  What the plan is to bring the other two-thirds of Bidwell Avenue in and if we could sit down with staff once it's approved and become  Worked together on on Bidwell Avenue. Thank you  Thank you John Hooper followed by Therese  Judy  I'm John Hooper my focus will be on  the West Sacramento annexation area  and specifically on Bidwell Avenue  Specifically the part that is from the Rose Avenue bridge  downstream and even more specifically on six houses in that section and  Concerning the water supply there the reason I'm focusing on the water is that the staff report unfortunately has a misrepresentation  Concerning water and if you looked at the table, it's exhibit to the plan for provision of services that table has three columns  service  currently, you know provided by and then  the  Proposed provider the problem it's fine for sewer because sewer less both private septic and city sewer  But for domestic water it just lists Cal water service now  That means that it doesn't list wells and when you do that someone reading the report  May think well gee  Nobody's on well, everyone's on Cal water. So water must not be an issue  The reality is most of the homes that would be involved in this  Injection for this the annexation area do have access the vast majority to Cal water  Think of Victorian Park as an example. I think just about all the houses there do  even the first seven houses from the  Bridge the Rose Avenue bridge going downstream  But the problems with the six remaining houses going to the westerly edge there is that none of our houses have that  So what do I want I want what's called fairness  Fairness because it seems only fair that the proposal  Needs to it your proposal needs to address how the city of Chico and Cal water  Will work cooperatively to help give these homeowners access to Cal water  The bottom line is will you help us on that or we have to fend for ourselves to get that access?  And if that option B's the case, then that's that's hard to support this proposal. Thank you  Thank you  So Therese Chudi followed by Kimberly Brady Cantwell  Hello  I've lived on El Monte Avenue for over 30 years  And when I got my letter in the mail like we all did I was a little bit  Surprised and want to come down and address you tonight  so although many of my neighbors are  Asking or giving you information as to?  Why not, why not, should not, do this, my question for you is, why, why, do it, what is the purpose, that's the first, question, on the application, form, that, you, will, be, required, to submit, what is the, purpose, so, what, was, explained, earlier, is, that, one, of, the, purposes, is, to, is, to, encourage, efficient, delivery, of, urban, services, well, our, neighborhood, is, not, urban, it's, not, even, sub, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't, need, urban, we, don't  services. So once again, why? What is the purpose? If the purpose could be perhaps  to address a housing crisis as mandated by the state in SB 9, let me remind you  that that does not require that an annexation take place to be in  compliance with SB 9. So again, what I'm going to suggest is that when you ask  yourselves the question why, what is the purpose, that your answer not be  fallacious and that it is very clear in your answer for who there is a benefit  in the action that you will be taking and that you consider all of our  comments tonight in that decision.  Kimberly Brady Cantwell followed by Matthew Plotkin.  Good evening, thank you. So a lot of people have already expressed an interest in not incorporating and I too am not interested in  incorporating into the City of Chico. I have a property right by Lower Park and  the Manzanita Bridge and we have an acre and a half, I'm at the very end of our  little gravel road.  So leaf pickup certainly doesn't help us. We have a well, works beautifully and the  septic system works beautifully as well. As well as the mutual aid with fire and  police has 20 years ago or more was created and so that's not an issue. So I  really don't see too many benefits to us and additionally I'm quite concerned  about the  herds of animals and I'm not sure that anybody's taking any consideration for  that. I live in a unique little spot where I actually watch the herds come  through, they rest in my pasture and feed in the area. They come down Almonte,  they cross and come down Almonte, they can't come through the park very easily  because it's so well used. And so there are very few places for these animals to  come through safely.  And that's a really big concern, if we go from, let's say, my property, which is an  acre and a half, to four homes per acre.  That is a lot of infill, and that is not a lot of area for animals to move safely. And  and hung out in my pastor.  So I just wanted to bring that up.  Also, I was under the understanding that if 50% of people in our area do not agree,  that it will not move forward.  So I'm curious about that.  Thank you.  Matthew Plotkin, followed by Claudia Rollins.  Good evening, Mayor and Council.  Thank you for listening to our comments this evening.  I live on Hostick Way, as two of my neighbors have also mentioned.  I also have seen the animals that have been spoken of, deer, foxes, bobcats, bears, and wild cats.  Most of us have animals, livestock to chickens.  And we also are very concerned about protecting these animals on our property.  Not just thinking about whether or not the animals are grandfathered.  We're also thinking about how do we maintain our animals living when we do see wild cats come through our neighborhood.  Currently, we have some options available through shotguns and the like.  We're curious to know if that changes if the annexation happens.  I don't see how...  We're curious to know how calling 911 and getting somebody from Chico PD to show up  is going to take care of any of our animals in the time that a wild cat can take out 30 chickens.  The other issues that we're wondering about is how this changes the tax rate.  Some of us do live on private lanes that we take care of.  We also have our sewer through septic, and we also have our well water.  We also have our sewer through septic, and we also have our well water.  How does that impact what we have already?  How does that impact some sort of prorating of our property taxes or not?  Thank you again for your time, and we hope that you hear our comments and take these into consideration.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Claudia Rollins.  Good evening.  I'm in the Alamon.  I'm in the Alamon County sub area as well.  And I don't have anything to add because I think my neighbors have done just a super job of bringing up our issues,  and I hope you'll really consider that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker.  All right.  Thank you, everybody.  Appreciate you coming down here and telling us your opinions tonight.  We will go ahead and close.  Public hearing and then questions, discussion, council.  Can I ask a question for Mr. V?  Can you explain what the process is and how we got here to begin with?  I know this is something that goes on regularly with LAFCO, but just for my clarification and the public's.  Sure.  So we've been working with you, LAFCO, believe it or not, for over about 20 years.  We had a very aggressive program to annex islands within the city's fabric.  Um,  in the,  um,  2000s when the recession hit,  that was kind of put on a hiatus.  Um,  we then picked up again with some of the key annexation areas,  including the Chapman and Mulberry neighborhood,  North Chico,  and,  uh,  continued to work with you,  LAFCO on kind of finalizing the islands within our fabric.  The state has given a lot of authority to the LAFCOs in order to clean up these areas.  For the reasons I've mentioned,  um,  people in essence are living within the fabric of our city.  And these islands,  and just the overall context for the state is these need to be cleaned up.  And, um,  of course there was a little leverage back and forth just so that the audience understands the city is not running around looking to take on all these obligations.  It's in essence,  uh,  a requirement of good planning and also balancing it against new annexations and new growth areas.  And so,  um,  it's something that likely would have been completed maybe four or five years ago,  if not for the campfire.  There's been a lot of other things that have kind of slowed down this process.  The staggerings intended to give us the option to be able to provide the services that are expected.  But the folks are correct.  It's not like there's going to be a lot of change.  We're not going to be extending all these new roadways and repaving them.  What I do want to add,  even though it wasn't your question is in the El Monte area,  the city has a pre zoning of a half acre.  So it's not the R1 single family subdivisions that people are used to.  Um,  and then the Chico Canyon road area,  it's acre minimums,  like north of Chico Canyon road and half acre.  And it's mimicking kind of what's out there.  Um,  and already exists.  There are some folks north of Chico Canyon road that might have three acres,  but we're not talking about classic subdivisions in the context of the cities are one single family zoning.  Um,  and just to repeat,  I think you mentioned at the beginning,  but wells and burning,  can you define that?  And the other question was defining the responsibilities.  How does that happen?  And how are the,  um,  residents assured how that's going to move forward?  Well,  one of the speakers hit it,  right?  There's not a single clean answer because every person has an individual situation.  Somebody is on a well,  somebody might have a water,  somebody might have the septic.  Um,  and then somebody may also have septic that's failing and they want to hook up to the sewer.  And so it's,  there's not a one size fits all answer to some of these questions.  Um,  what was the question before that?  Uh,  wells and burning.  So there's no requirement to hook up,  uh,  wells can continue.  There's not a requirement to hook up to Cal water.  In many cases,  neither Cal water or the city of Chico sewer is available.  Um,  so again,  I heard some speakers saying,  Hey,  it'd be nice to know that when's the sewer coming.  That's another bigger question and something that public works is working on as part of the sewer master plan.  And then burning.  No,  within city limits,  no burning is allowed,  but we do have leaf pickup for some of these larger lots.  Um,  that could might be a challenge.  Um,  uh,  and then because the state of California is so wonderful to us these days,  uh,  can you tell me how much say do we have in this?  So I've heard before when there's things that have come to us on building and things like this,  like we can get in trouble as council members if we don't pass things like this.  And do we have to choose all of them?  I don't think I heard anybody here for it except for maybe one person said,  how are you gonna make it work if you do do it?  Um,  can we leave out one of these?  Do we have that option if we can we vote on three or is it all or none?  And what are our options?  City did enter into an agreement with butte lab coat to proceed with these islands for a lot of the reasons I'd shared at that meeting in March,  which is to clean them up so that we can also then have the future option to move forward with bringing in new growth areas as well.  So it's a balance,  um,  on balance again,  I don't see the overall detriment.  Some items have come up.  If you want to ask me,  you know,  in some cases I think I tried to respond to some of them.  There's not additional taxes.  I mean,  if,  if leaf burning,  if somebody's issue,  then yeah,  that may be a problem for that individual,  but I don't see wholesale,  uh,  overall negative impacts associated with annexation.  All right.  Further discussion,  entertain motion.  So,  uh,  excuse me.  I've been monitoring the last two meetings for the past,  uh,  for a while now,  and so I'm very familiar with watching them and everything that goes on,  uh,  at the last committee.  I've been watching the last two meetings.  Um,  this is,  I know this has been going on for many,  many,  many years.  I know it goes,  you mentioned 20 years.  It's been a long time that this has been,  um,  in process.  And I know LAFCO is very adamant about getting this done.  I remember that meeting specifically.  So,  um,  it's a,  it's a change that,  uh,  some people are not going to be happy about,  but,  but I don't see the alternative.  And if there is an alternative,  could you maybe educate me on an alternative to this at this point?  No,  I,  I also don't see an alternative and LAFCO is correct.  I mean,  it is important to have an urban area,  a single fabric.  Having these markets just really doesn't function as well.  And I know people have said they're happy with the sheriff,  but I would venture to believe that Butte County also,  sees benefit to focusing their resources in areas outside of the city limits.  And these are areas in essence within the city's limits.  I have a clarification question.  Go ahead.  For council member Bennett.  Did you say you monitored the LAFCO meetings?  That's awesome.  I'm just trying to be serious.  I'm just trying to be serious.  I'm just trying to be serious.  I'm just trying to be serious.  So I do respect the opinions that we heard tonight from all those that live in these islands that are an annexed at this time.  I do respect your opinions.  I truly do.  But as a former service provider working in the city and trying to respond to different areas,  I can tell you it was difficult at times to deliver those services as efficiently as we would like.  Um,  we have made great strides in this,  this community.  And while we do think that it is important to reduce these islands,  I think that's better for these communities.  But I do again respect your opinions.  I truly do.  But I can tell you as a service providers,  service provider,  it is not the most efficient way to provide services to allow these unannexed islands to continue.  And so I'm going to support this.  All right,  we have a motion.  Was that a motion?  motion well thank you for the question yes that is a motion okay so we have a  motion we have a second a second by council member Morgan madam clerk you  take the role councilmember Bennett I just want to make one quick comment it  is in some respects uncomfortable to make my decision because I I want to  respect all of your wishes and desires but I will have to vote in favor of this  because I believe it's the right way to go so I apologize so that was an I  correct from that that would be yes okay thank you  councilmember Brown councilmember Morgan councilmember O'Brien yes councilmember  Tandon yes  yes  vice mayor Reynolds no mayor Coolidge carries 6-1 all right moving on to our  next item 4.3 housing element update and I believe we have  mr.

We have James Coles and Jessica Candela  I'm gonna have James start over with a quick start with just a quick overview of kind of housing element  introduction and then I'm gonna focus quickly as I can on the  Recommendations made by the Planning Commission with some staff input as well, and then that'll be proceeding the public here  Good evening mayor Coolidge and vice mayor Reynolds and City Council  James Coles with housing tools  We've been working with the city staff and the larger community on the housing element over the last couple years  And the housing element is a highly regulated  Documented process by the state and by state law  So we have made every effort to comply with all the state regulations  At the same time we have made every effort  To be responsive to the local needs of the community  Build on local resources and make it a relevant and effective document for the city of Chico  through our community outreach through our research and  working together with the community  I'm gonna provide a very brief overview of the purpose of the housing element and the regulatory background  Okay  So the housing element is a document a policy document that  establishes the C's priorities for housing its citizens in eight year cycles  It sets goals for the allocation of funding program coordination and zoning efforts to support the production of housing  And it is one of the mandated elements of the city's general plan  It must be consistent with the general plan by state law  Which is?  has a longer 15 to 20 year time frame. The existing or the most recent housing element  period was 2014 to 2021. And this new housing element period that you'll be considering  tonight is for the period of 2022 to 2030. Oversight for the housing element is  provided by the state through the Department of Housing and Community Development.  And the HCD approval or certification of the housing elements provides access to state funding.  Since 2014, the state has amended state housing element law through numerous bills  that have been passed since 2014. And the HCD has been passed since 2014. And the HCD has been  which place additional responsibility on local jurisdictions to adequately plan for and  facilitate the production of housing while removing as many constraints as possible.  HCD also sets the deadline for the submittal of each jurisdiction's housing element.  And Chico's is due by June 15, 2022, which is passed, but they do have 120 day grace period.  This slide shows the eight different major  topic areas that are mandated to be addressed by the housing element and  align with the chapters that are in the document as you can see there. A core  part of the housing element is the regional housing needs allocation and  this is a allocation of housing production goals by income level. The  process for establishing the RHNA or regional housing needs allocation is  through a process through demographics of state HCD assigning goals to the  various counties and then the Butte County Association of Governments  assigns goals to each of the HCDs.  within Butte County. So this next table provides an overview of the most recent  regional housing needs allocation and the units produced in each of the  required income levels. So you'll see there the 2014 to 2021 RHNA, the number  of units produced in each of the required income levels. So you'll see  there the 2014 to 2021 RHNA, the number of units produced by income level.  And then also a column which is the second from the furthest right that shows  units produced as well as those that are in construction this year of 2022 and  that includes a number of units that have been funded by the low income housing  tax credit for communities impacted by natural disasters. So in response to the  campfire, there are units there that are currently in construction.  Can I ask a quick question for clarity as I'm reading this number? It says produced and  planned in use it under construction. So is that is that housing a disease numbers reflect  housing that is currently under construction?  Either under construction currently or plan to pull building permit before the end of 2022.  Plan to pull a building permit before the end of the year?  Yeah.  Thank you.  This slide shows the regional housing need allocation for the  current planning element planning period 2022 to 2030 by the various affordability tiers.  And this table shows the adequate sites inventory. This is an exercise that's  required by state housing element law to show that the city has adequate sites  appropriately zoned to provide housing within the housing element period for the  various  affordability tiers. And so, you'll see,  hear, the number of units allocated through the by affordability,  and, then, the number of units identified through the sites, inventory,  you see, that there's a surplus, um, for each of the affordability,  this is a summary of the community engagement, this is a long, is a, two, year, process, most, of, the, community, engagement, тоже,  activities occurred in 2021. There was a low-income focus group that occurred in January of 2021,  two community meetings, two community surveys, and we've maintained a website throughout the process  to provide information on the housing element background and notes and updates on all the  various community meetings and surveys. And our outreach efforts were recognized by the  League of California Cities as a model for conducting community engagement through a  variety of mediums during the pandemic to reach a broad and diverse audience,  as featured in Western City Magazine. The public hearings are shown here. The public comment period  for the housing element draft began on May 12th and concludes.  Today, August 2nd, we had a Planning Commission hearing on June 2nd,  and then it was continued on to June 16th, in which we reviewed and considered  comments from the public as well as Planning Commission members and put together recommendations  that Brendan Veague will be going over in more detail with you tonight. And then we have the  City Council hearing tonight. Just to remind you and  those in attendance, those watching, this is the housing element website where all the information  about the housing element, the process, the community outreach efforts and results can be  found, as well as the draft of the housing element.  All right. Well, perfect. Thanks, James, again for a housing element 101 overview.  I just want to share with the Council that this is the fourth housing element cycle that I've  been involved with personally. And in all truth, I've never been through a more  complicated, complex, and uncertain process. I just want to highlight, to me, this is due  to a certain number of factors. First, there's been a significant number of new housing bills  adopted by the State related to housing elements. There's, I believe, a lack of clear guidance  from the State on the implementation of the new bills. Further, the new guidance and requirements  are coming midstream as the housing elements are being prepared. And then, in some cases,  there's some inconsistency in HCD's interpretation of housing element law. So, at this point,  there are 336 jurisdictions subject to requirements of this housing cycle,  housing element cycle, and only 36% of them have been certified by HCD as of mid-July.  And I would say this would be considered an extremely unusual situation.  There are many jurisdictions in Southern California that were required to have their elements approved in 2021  and are still going back and forth with HCD.  So, given these challenges, staff strategically coordinated a preliminary courtesy review  of our administrative draft of the housing element with HCD in early 2022.  And again, the goal was to get a temperature read from them that we were headed in the right direction.  Based on the comments and the conversations we received from HCD,  significant changes were made to the element prior to releasing it for public review draft.  In order to maximize public engagement, the public review period to this point  has been reduced to a minimum of three months.  And as James had pointed out, has stretched out over 80 days,  well beyond the HCD required 30-day public review period.  I believe we've received very many thoughtful comments and letters from numerous individuals and organizations.  Again, with excellent insights, suggestions through the public review period as well.  And in turn, your planning commission did an amazing job over the course of two separate public meetings  to review and vet the correspondence and the public comments.  They respectfully deliberated and I believe made thoughtful comments  and recommendations.  And I believe that the planning commission has done a lot of the heavy lifting for you.  So right now, I'd like to quickly go over the planning commission's recommendations,  provide some staff context, and then share our recommendation on how I believe council should proceed.  So the first planning commission recommendation was to remove three sites  from the adequate sites inventory that have been found to have certain constraints  and to add two new sites that are more appropriate based on state qualification criteria.  If you looked at the totality of the comments received, there were a number of comments  that identified potential constraints associated with the inventory.  Things like flood plains or sensitive habitat associated with the sites.  In turn, staff conducted a much more intense review and initially identified three sites to remove  and two sites to add from the low and very low inventory.  However, given the many complex HCD criteria requirements,  even making a minor change can have significant ripple effects.  In this case, it was determined that the,  the proposed changes would not be consistent with other HCD  criteria related to firmly furthering fair housing.  So, staff worked closely with the consultant to remove and add additional sites,  the inventory, to make sure we were meeting all the different criteria.  Your staff report contains a track changes, a version of, revised chapters.  So, ultimately, staff does agree with the commission,  but we also determined additional remover, and additions were needed.  The second recommendation was to direct staff, to consult, um, and update, um, the, um,佣  Appendix B of the housing element, which is an adequate site form required by ACV.  So we revised the section in the element and we have in turn updated the Appendix B to  be consistent with that.  Again, staff agrees with the Planning Commission.  Recommendation number three was to add a new action to the housing element directing the  amendment of the general plan on municipal corridor or municipal code to clarify where  the corridor opportunity overlay would allow higher residential densities.  So again, we agree with the Planning Commission.  It's important that our planning documents reflect the intent of the COS overlay.  The reason I'm going over these recommendations is we didn't manifest these and capture these  in a resolution, so I need to kind of get these out to you, give you staff's angle so  that you guys can act on these as well so they can be incorporated correctly into the  housing element.  The fourth recommendation was to add a new action to the housing element directing the  Recommendation number five was to add a new action which states as part of future municipal  code update, investigate opportunities to apply the corridor opportunity overlay to  additional areas and corridors within the city.  Staff agrees there are likely additional appropriate locations to apply the COS overlay, and we  will investigate those opportunities with the Commission and make recommendations to the  City Council as part of a future code update.  The fifth recommendation from the Planning Commission was to add a new action which states  investigate and monitor trends of short-term rentals in new housing elements.  Chico to ensure they do not substantially inhibit the availability of housing for local renters or  potential homebuyers. We do also agree that gathering data regarding the number and location  of short-term rentals and tracking them moving forward is a reasonable planning exercise and  will provide supporting information for future planning decisions. We agree with the commission.  Recommendation number six was to add a new action which states explore redeveloping city-owned  parking lots within the central city opportunity site into affordable housing or market rate  housing. City-owned downtown parking lots are already zoned for mixed use and for residential  development. Clearly, any reduction of parking supply in the downtown raises a number of planning  issues, most importantly ensuring adequate parking for downtown businesses. However, the proposed  action does not obligate the city to a specific path. It expressly uses the word explore. As you  are all aware, we are currently exploring with Chico State the potential redevelopment  of downtown parking lot five as a mixed use development, which may in fact include potential  affordable housing. Staff agrees with the commission. Recommendation number seven, add a new  action which states promote housing construction by reducing and allowing flexibility in minimum  parking requirements. Following the 2030 general plan adoption, the city-owned downtown parking lot  five was proposed in the city as part of an update, code update in 2013. In addition, the code provides  opportunities for parking reductions on a case-by-case basis, for projects located in the corridor  opportunity zones, and also for affordable housing projects as required or allowed by state law.  Staff does still agree with the commission that a fresh look at the city's parking requirements  would be a good planning exercise. Planning commission's recommendation number eight was  to add a sentence to action 4.8. The city-owned downtown parking lot five was proposed in the city as part of an update,  which states, rezone vacant sites and special planning areas to traditional neighborhood development, or TND.  The TND regulations were developed specifically for and currently apply only to one area,  Merriam Park. Nothing precludes an owner of a vacant site or special planning area  from seeking a rezone to TND. Staff does not believe that a property owner should be required  to rezone to TND. It should be a choice. Staff disagrees with the commission's recommendation.  Recommendation number nine was to modify action 5.14 to read, promote development of single room  occupancy or other small unit developments by removing or reducing parking requirements  and lowering development impact fees. Further, support the conversion of motels, hotels,  which are vacant or underutilized, and assist in identifying potential funding resources.  So as I stated previously, the city has already adopted major parking reductions,  and there are parking reductions available for affordable housing projects.  Further, the city already has an existing tiered development impact fee,  which does provide reduced fees for smaller units. In other words, work has already been done to promote smaller units.  I do believe, however, additional opportunities can be explored when parking standards are reviewed in the future,  and also as part of an impact fee update that Public Works is getting up underway.  So while staff does disagree with the commission's recommendation,  we do believe there could be an addition of a sentence to action 5.14 that reads,  inform developers of availability of parking reductions and applicability of reduced development impact fees.  We're getting close.  PC recommendation number 10, add a new policy which states, promote construction of naturally energy efficient building types,  including attached housing, infill, and smaller units.  So as I just discussed, smaller units are currently promoted by the city's tiered impact fee structure,  as well as lower parking requirements.  Further, all new construction in Chico is subject to the California Green Building Code,  which provides the nation's most strict building regulations as it relates to energy efficiency,  water efficiency and conservation, as well as material conservation and resource efficiency.  Finally, the city does already have an aggressive program to incentivize accessory dwelling units, or ADUs.  So staff disagrees with the Planning Commission recommendation because the city's existing policy framework,  codes, and regulations are already promoting energy efficiency in all building types.  Planning Commission recommendation was to add an action under the  new policy, which states, incentivize infill development, multifamily housing, and small units  through actions outlined in policy 4.2, which reads, promote a mix of dwelling types and sizes throughout the city.  The city already does support infill, multifamily housing, and small units via implementation of the actions that are already listed  under the proposed policy 4.2, which includes including implementing the corridor opportunity,  site overlay, the downtown element, as well as the traditional neighborhood development regulations.  Staff disagrees with the Planning Commission recommendation as existing actions are already achieving the policy goal.  Planning Commission recommendation number 12 was add a new action under the new policy,  which states, include supporting infill housing as a climate policy in city plans and documents.  So there are numerous actions throughout the 2030 General Plan already in support of infill development.  They've also been carried through the city's development standards.  There's also an entire policy framework in the General Plan for the City of San Diego.  The General Plan's sustainability element related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions,  which I believe was recently reinforced by Council's approval of the Climate Action Plan update last year.  So staff disagrees with the Commission's recommendation, but again,  it's because we believe the General Plan policies and adopted plans are already achieving the goal.  Number 13, when providing annual updates in addition to including a number of units that have pulled permits,  also include the number of units currently in construction and the number of units that have received  a certificate of occupancy to better provide reporting transparency.  As you are all, I believe all aware, the city submits an annual progress report to HCD utilizing a prescribed format.  Over the last four years, the reports have become increasingly more robust and detailed, requiring significant staff time.  We believe as opposed to adding a new reporting requirement, staff recommends including the Commission on the distribution of that report,  as well as the annual Department of Finance report that we provide to Council that includes new housing unit data.  And finally, TC recommendation number 14, add chapter numbers and footers to the final document.  Staff agrees.  I just want to point out that overall staff does agree with the Commission's recommendations,  except for where we believe existing policies, plans, and codes are already achieving the proposed recommendations,  or where there is a simple alternative to achieve the Commission's goal.  So finally, staff is recommending that Council hold a public hearing regarding the draft housing element,  provide direction regarding Planning Commission and staff recommendations,  for the proposed changes to the element, and three, that you adopt a resolution approving the housing element,  determining it is exempt from CEQA, and authorizing it submittal to the State.  Staff and the consultant are available for any questions.  Council.  All right, thank you.  I have some questions.  Oh, all right.  I was just leaving room.  I asked.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I have a handful.  I guess I want to preface this by asking, did staff review the letters and analyses sent to the city  and the points they outlined, particularly those sent by Butte Environmental Council  and recently, Chico Housing Improvement Program, Chip?  Yes, we have.  We've reviewed all the comments, letters, and some of them that were provided earlier,  the Planning Commission reviewed.  Okay.  Particularly the Beck report, I think, makes some sense.  I think there were several data-informed points about the housing element that I believe weren't consideration.  There's quite a few of them, but I'm curious what kind of conversation took place  and if they were considered in any changes to the housing element.  A number of it, I think the proposed recommendations from Beck were carried through as it relates to the corridor opportunity sites.  In addition to reviewing the sites, you know, adequate sites inventory,  looking at parking requirements, so there were integration of those in consultation with the Planning Commission.  Just related to some of the data points represented in the housing element,  does the availability of land for the development of affordable housing, particularly low and very low-income housing,  reflect the probability that this land will be developed for affordable housing?  Say the last sentence.  It's one sentence.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Does the availability of land for the development of affordable housing,  particularly low and very low-income housing,  reflect the probability that this land will be developed for affordable housing?  So we had a long conversation with the Planning Commission about the adequate sites inventory.  It's, you know, at some point it's an exercise that you conduct to meet the requirements of HCD.  And so, yes, it has the potential and some of the sites we've identified are already proceeding and moving forward as affordable sites.  But we also highlighted when we were sharing kind of some of the things that we were looking at,  some of the data that we share with HCD to kind of determine what's an adequate density to achieve affordable housing.  Of the 10 projects that we utilized to share what that density range might be,  I believe nine or all 10 of them weren't sites that were previously on the adequate sites inventory for the last housing element cycle.  So it's very difficult to determine where you're going to see and how affordable housing, where it will show up.  A lot of the projects that we've seen come online here in the last few weeks,  the last two years are areas that were previously entitled Oak Valley, Merriam Park.  So you're not always sure.  The Jesus Center building was torn down.  It's a redevelopment.  So it's not a clear path of where you will see affordable housing developed.  It's just a possibility.  Correct.  Why does the draft allocate nearly all sites for low income housing along high traffic arterial roads?  First of all,  that's where we have a lot of the sites that are zoned for higher density.  The corridor opportunity sites, R3, R4 is more located.  Also, those are the sites that usually score better.  They're closer to amenities and things that would more likely support affordable housing,  successful projects being moving forward and receiving funding.  Some of the letters that we received recommended that the city look at development of affordable housing closer to the downtown core.  Can you speak to that a little bit?  Nothing precludes that.  As I said, we're looking at redevelopment of the downtown parking lot, parking lot five.  One of the planning concepts in that was the integration of affordable housing.  Some of the challenges when people say just put it here or do a rezone there is it doesn't dictate the provision and the creation of affordable housing.  So I don't see a problem with and there's a lot of support in our existing planning documents.  The downtown element, there's zoning that's supportive of it.  But we also have a built environment in the downtown area.  There isn't as many vacant lots, things of that nature.  So that's one of the challenges.  And when you're putting certain parcels on your vacant adequate sites inventory, if the site's not vacant, it has a higher bar.  There's a higher challenge to show that that area would in fact redevelop with affordable housing for low and very low.  I just have two more questions.  What happens if we don't honor the area?  What are the actions that are currently laid out in this or previous housing element?  Well, we report regularly to the HCD and share that with the council.  I'm not sure if there's a punitive punishment.  I guess funding could be withheld.  HCD, we might be put on their radar like other communities that I believe are bad actors.  Coastal communities or other areas that really don't support additional housing or infill or redevelopment.  But I don't think that's what this community is about.  And my last kind of pair of questions is can you explain why the previous housing element recommendations for an inclusionary zoning policy by 2015 were removed from this iteration?  Yeah, I think I answered a version of this question before.  So at one point, staff was moving forward with an RFP or request for proposal for an inclusionary housing program.  And then we saw that we had a council that we didn't believe was supporting it.  And we're very supportive of that program.  It takes a lot of energy.  It's not just these ordinances don't come off the shelf.  There's, you know, up to $100,000, a consultant, a nexus.  A lot of work has to go into that.  So staff has capacity limitations and we want to focus on the things within the general plan.  And there are a lot of things that we need to work on and should be working on.  But we can't get to all of them.  So we instead focused on other projects and efforts.  Then at one point, it kind of came up to me.  It came up again as a possibility following the campfire as part of the ad hoc housing committee.  Ultimately, towards the end of that council that seemed maybe more supportive of that.  And again, we saw a recommendation that came out of that committee.  But shortly thereafter, there was again a change in council and a belief that to bring forward, first of all, get funding through a budget and to move forward with the program would not be a high priority.  During those conversations, which I was involved in, I was thinking about the  It was my recollection that it was in that discussion that additional information regarding inclusionary zoning would be provided when the housing element update was presented.  Are we to expect that information as part of this process?  Was it explored during the public outreach portion of the plan's development?  It was.  And there were folks that were very supportive of it.  You may remember as recently as a couple months ago, we received direction that the city council reviewed the ad hoc housing committee's recommendations.  And suggested that they were not supportive of pursuing an inclusionary housing program.  Yeah, I think that's what I'm referring to.  That discussion was supposed to be wrapped into this discussion in my recollection of the action taken.  But that's not what I'm asking.  Okay.  That's all I got.  Thank you.  All right.  Council Member Tam.  I have a quick question for you, Mr. Lee.  Not done yet.  So I see the recommendation number 13 that staff disagree.  And it says the report is provided to the planning commission.  So does that report actually talks about how many permits were pulled and how many, what the construction, the status of the construction and the certification of occupancy is provided?  Is that report provided to planning commission on an annual basis?  So historically, no.  Planning commission hasn't received the same information that the council receives.  And I think what I was hearing at the meeting was they're starved for information.  They're part of the development process.  And so, again, they were adding a recommendation that I believe was not likely necessary to be in the housing element.  Instead, we'll just best practice, give them the same information that the council receives on an annual basis.  Share with them the memo we provided, for instance, regarding the city's production of affordable housing.  Okay.  About four or five months ago.  I think that you might have requested even.  And so we want to just kind of get them involved with stuff that's already provided to council.  Right.  Just wanted to double check if we get that annually.  Oh, you do.  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you.  All right.  Any more questions for Mr. Lee?  I'll follow up on 13.  Would there be a reason why we would not include that information in the report?  I mean, in the transparency to show how many permits have been pulled and what's the scope of the commission's response to that?  What's under construction and where they're at?  That's information, for instance, I give that information at a quarterly Chico Chamber community development update on a regular basis.  I think I've shared that with previous city managers and I believe it makes its way to council.  So, yeah, we track that data and I have that information.  But to give it to HCV, who doesn't ask for it, and some of the data that I mentioned is part of the Department of Finance annual report where we're giving it to HCV.  And that's where we kind of get the final C of O's for single family, multifamily, and ADUs.  But if anybody ever wants midstream data, it's easily available on a quarterly basis.  Thank you.  Yeah, I guess what I'm hearing is we don't need to put it in this formally.  We can just do it.  That's right.  Okay.  All right.  Any more questions?  Nope.  Probably safe to leave now.  All right.  How many speakers?  We have a question.  We have four.  All right.  Two minutes.  Staying with that.  And we will open the public hearing.  Okay.  Jessica Giannola followed by Susan Tichuti.  Council, the housing crisis, housing is a big topic.  This is our opportunity to plan for our residents that are in need of housing now.  Most especially the ones that are in need of far more that we need more of.  It's the extremely low, very low and low income housing.  We need less of the above moderate development.  This cycle as a demographic has previously seen five times as much of development than  any of the low income.  That's led to the housing crisis that we're seeing today.  We are restricted.  We're restricting ourselves really in providing more opportunities by zoning.  That's within the city's control as parking requirements, mixed use allowances.  Okay.  So, the city can make those changes to zoning that would allow for more options with land  use for those more dense housing opportunities that we need for the low income.  Chico can add, let's see, when we do build, we need to avoid those flood zones and the  fire risk zones.  I'm seeing more and more data on our flood areas in Chico that we need to pay attention  to.  I know we don't have any rain coming right now, but we will at some point.  And the fire risks are extremely high.  Especially on the east side.  But the Valley's Edge proposal that will put Chico in the direct line of fire.  So, when we are developing those, we need to be very careful about where we are developing  to protect the city and homes of the people here.  I'd also suggest with this housing element here that we do allow for some short-term  use of RVs on properties as a housing option for now because we don't have the housing  yet.  That's something that we should be considering.  And I'd love to see that return of the down assistance program for homeowners.  That first time down assistance helps people become homeowners and improve their lives.  Thank you.  Thank you, Susan.  To Judy.  Thank you.  Followed by Grace Marvin.  I'm Susan Chudy.  I am a part of the Butte Environmental Council's Advocacy Committee and I'm also part of Smart  Growth Advocates.  I've attended a number of meetings.  I've attended every public meeting, I think, of the Planning Commission, the community  meetings as the housing element was being developed.  And I appreciate, first of all, I want to acknowledge that Brendan Veig and Marie Demers  have done amazing work at trying to get affordable housing done.  This housing element, and I appreciate the work of the Planning Commission and how the  staff has moved to acknowledge some of the things that have not been, that were not in  the original housing draft of the housing element.  The Butte Environmental Council analysis is very thorough and very deep and found many  inadequacies, places that were said to be available, spaces for housing that really  weren't.  And spaces that could be available for affordable housing.  This...  I think...  My biggest concern...  And I'm running out of time already...  And I have a few more things to say...  I think we have to think about...  The...  Affirmatively...  Furthering...  Fair...  Housing...  We need to think more about poverty...  We need to think more about...  Housing...  In our...  Area...  And...  The...  Environmental...  Justice...  Element...  Is...  Coming...  making sure that poor people are not isolated into poverty areas or segregated from the rest  of the community, but are part of the middle of the community. And I had so much more to say.  Thank you. Thank you. Grace Marvin, followed by Katie Toma. Yes, thank you. Good evening. I was  hoping that there would be three minutes for us, but I will go ahead and read this very quickly  then. Okay. For the very large percentage of low-income citizens of Chico, it is very important  that the city take a much stronger stance on facilitating much more affordable housing here,  affordable to low-income and middle-income citizens. To allow that to happen, zoning  should be changed throughout the city, its residential and downtown areas, and especially  near public transit stops and corridors. That is, the city needs to be able to do that.  It needs much more higher-density zoning in order to provide for the needed low- and moderate-income  households. Those zones should not be segregated from other zones, however. I, for one, would like  to see many more ADUs in the area where I live near Enloe. Why not envision mixed-cost and mixed-use  housing in lovely, safe neighborhoods? Going to city or county housing meetings has been an exercise  in futility for me. I have been a member of the City of Chico for many years, and I have been a  member of the City of Emory since the housing element has no tru-ty. The last housing element  had resulted in twice the amount of expensive homes than was planned, and only half the number  of affordable homes. I'm going to skip here. Why not require that developers first prove to the city  that they have built at least 30% of their planned homes as affordable residential units before  building any more housing? I think that is a very important point. I think that is a very important  expensive homes. Furthermore, we must address climate change even more  vigorously than is stated. Why not save money in clean air by taking a shuttle  or a bike ride to work or school? That would involve new zoning as well to  allow people to travel along tree-ride roads with safe walkways and  bicycle routes. Finally, please consider higher density, affordable homes in the  many available spots that are not currently involved. Thank you. Our last  speaker is Katie Thoma.  Good evening, I'm Katie Thoma and I'm the executive director of the Chico Builders  Association and I want to commend Brendan and his team. Chico Builders  Association has participated in all of the hearings as it's gone along and also  to thank the Planning Commission for hosting an additional public hearing  because it's been a great experience. Thank you.  Thank you, Dr. Cronin. I think it's important to note that the housing element  document is very daunting and I think for regular folks to understand it, they  chose not to participate. So that was a big disappointment. But let me start my  formal remarks by saying we need housing, we need all housing. The housing element  includes a significant number of references to housing for very low and  low-income families. So I think it's important to note that the housing element  includes a significant number of references to housing for very low and low-income  households. There are many references with regard to government programs and  subsidies for the building of very low and low-income housing. There's no mention  of programs for those who build and development for moderate and above  moderate income households. We found this very interesting and quite frankly  disingenuous because in the report, the RENA needs allocation for 2022 through  2030 shows the greatest number of units allocated are for moderate and above  moderate income households. So I think it's important to note that the housing  element document is very daunting and I think for regular folks to understand it, they  references to housing for very low and low-income households. But we found no strategies noted  to meet this allocation. Please note that the demand for housing for moderate and above  moderate households will be higher than the housing element states if it does not take  into account the expansion of Enloe Medical Center's new cancer center which expects  to hire over 100 people who will need housing. We also are hearing of another less known  business who's expanding and will provide a good number of high paying jobs. These folks  are going to need a place to live. They are all abhorred. We have to be aware that the  housing element does not address housing market conditions. So we just hope that in  the future, based on the RENA goals, that the city will consider strategies to meet  the needs of moderate and above moderate households.  Thank you.  Last speaker?  I'll say right.  Closed public hearing. Further comment from council of direction?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I don't have any further comment, but I move to approve.  Second.  A motion and a second. Take the roll. Motion by Vice Mayor Rown. Second by Council Member  Tandy.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  No.  Council Member Morgan?  I just wanted to say yes, but I just wanted to comment on Mr. Veague and the planning  commissions back and forth. I know it's hard to go against their recommendations. Did a  good job. There might have been a couple things in here I kind of argued with, but at the  end of the night, I'm going to say yes.  I think we're going to do this better than anybody, so thank you.  Council Member O'Brien?  I agree with that statement. Council Member Morgan?  And yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right. With that, we're going to take short recess.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  So, Madam Clerk, do we have the results?  Should we go ahead and move to that?  Yes.  So, we'll retake 4.4 for the rest of that item and turn it over to City Clerk, Debbie Press.  Okay.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  For allowing staff to go in and actually handle that process because we were able to complete other things.  It was successful.  The question was, shall the City Council of the City of Chico renew the downtown Chico property-based business improvement district?  And the annual assessment against the parcels identified on this assessment ballot.  We had 82.6% said yes and 17.4% said no.  So, we'll move forward.  And so, the final action would be the adoption of the resolution.  Which accepts the management district plan.  And then authorize the city manager to enter into the agreement between the city of Chico and the downtown Chico P-Bed group.  So, I'll turn it over to you for that.  All right.  Entertain motion.  Motion from Council Member Tannen and second from Council Member Morgan.  Okay.  Just a moment.  Council Member.  No.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Congratulations.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tanden.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  And this will be for a period of another five years.  All right.  All right.  We will move on to 4.5 hearing.  Hearing.  Hearing.  Ordering.  Formation.  The Maintenance Assessment District.  A49.  Wasney Estates.  Ms. Sonner.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members.  Before a final subdivision map can be approved,  the property owner must provide a means for future maintenance and replacement of certain public improvements.  Series SD LLC, the property owner for Wasney Estates subdivision,  which is at 2640 and 2660.  Series Avenue submitted a petition requesting formation of a maintenance assessment district.  The improvements include stormwater quality, street trees, irrigated and dry landscape.  And after the subject of assuming this maintenance assessment district is approved tonight and the final map is approved,  there will be 14 lots in the subdivision and the cost of the CMD for the future property owners will be $8.5 million.  The project will be $841.55 per lot per year.  And that concludes my report.  All right.  Any questions?  All right.  Thank you.  Any speakers?  We have none.  All right.  Entertain a motion.  I have a motion from Council Member Brown, a second from Council Member Morgan.  Go ahead and take the roll.  Sorry.  And that was after you opened the hearing, correct?  And closed it.  Okay.  Thank you.  Duly noted.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Moving on to the regular agenda.  Item 5.1, Council Vow Management.  All right.  The next item is the Quality of Life Measure, Quality of Life.  Mr. Young.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  This item pertains to the Quality of Life Council ballot measure on June 21st.  A draft ordinance was brought forward entitled the Quality of Life Act.  The Council decided not to take action on that particular proposed ordinance.  The reasons for that were contained in the July !  5, 2022 staff report.  Council instead directed the City Attorney to draft an ordinance for placement on the  November 8, 2022 ballot that would withstand potential legal challenges.  Council further directed the City Attorney's Office to bring forth a proposed charter amendment  to create a commission related to improvement of quality of life for Council's consideration.  It's my recommendation that the Council consider adoption of an ordinance permitting citizens  to demand the City abate public nuisances on City-owned public property as attached to  this report as attachment A. If the Council desires to submit the ordinance to the voters  of the City, the City Attorney further recommends the Council adopt a resolution calling for  the ordinance to be placed on the November 8, 2022 ballot, setting priorities for filing  a written argument and rebuttal, and directing me to prepare an impartial analysis of the  ballot.  If the Council desires to submit a charter amendment to the voters of the City, the City  Attorney further recommends that the City Council provide direction and request staff  to take all actions required to initiate the charter amendment procedure.  When we discussed this item at the last City Council meeting, I took the time to analyze  the proposed document.  That resulted in the 16 pages that you have before you.  Of course, I will not read all 16 of those pages.  I will cut to the chase and go to the recommendations and the alternative actions.  That's on page 5 of my staff report.  The alternative actions that you have before you are not to adopt the ordinance or resolution,  give direction to amend the ordinance and resolution to be returned to Council.  In this case, the Council must either call a special election prior to August 12 to place  the ordinance on the November 8, 2022 ballot.  Call for a special election or call for the measure to be placed on the next general election  ballot.  Directly adopt the ordinance, pardon the typo in paragraph 3, directly adopt the ordinance  without calling for a measure to be placed on the ballot.  This will require removing section 3 of the ordinance, provide no direction to staff to  proceed with the requirements set forth here, or give direction to develop an ordinance  for future consideration regarding the creation of a quality of life ordinance.  Life Commission. I leave, I turn this back over to the council to consider, deliberate, and provide  further direction, and of course I'm available to answer any questions right now.  Thank you. So I'll start it off since this was my item. So first I want to thank staff on all  their hard work on this and bringing it together, and after a month's consideration and reading of  16 pages, and I would like to ask my fellow council members to entertain the following.  I think we should work on the public nuisance part of the ballot measure, but just have staff  continue to work on that and put it through the regular ordinance process. I don't know if that  needs to go to internal affairs or what needs to happen on that. I'll take staff recommendation on  that, but however, I would like the ballot measure to have the quality of life on the, for a potential  commission, should it be a quality of life, I would like the ballot measure to have the quality of  be on the ballot. To be clear, and to set a few things straight because I think it got lost in  translation last time, I am not asking for a charter amendment, but a ballot measure that  recommends the creation of a quality of life commission upon the passage of the ballot measure.  I believe the commission would be a great asset to our community during this time. It would allow a  place for in-depth conversations and work that is not necessarily conducive at a council meeting.  So I've provided a copy.  I'm not saying that I'm not going to be a part of what I would be, what would be the new proposed  ballot measure and would be open to questions or conversation or I'm just trying to simplify it,  bring it down and give our voters a chance to have a commission to do some hard work.  Further comment?  Completely.  Okay.  So I'm looking at the city attorney's alternative actions. So Casey, you're not, I'm just trying to understand.  You're saying no to one, do not adopt the ordinance or resolution. Give direction to amend the ordinance.  That's what you gave us.  Correct. That's the attachment C, which is the item number five on there, the recommendation that the city does the quality of life improvement commission.  But you want that on the ballot in November?  Correct.  Okay.  In some sort of, this is just a example to give us a starter point for a conversation.  Obviously, Mr. Ewing would need to create this in the proper format and wording.  Mr. Ewing, what is the timeframe for that?  August 12th.  Yeah, our deadline is August 12th, but potentially we could have the council, if it was so inclined, could have a special meeting.  To come back to approve you writing the quality of life ordinance.  And putting it on the ballot.  To put it on the ballot.  Before August 12th.  Am I following so far?  You're following so far.  Okay.  And then we got into a charter and a commission and then you lost me.  So originally, at one point there was a mention of doing a charter amendment, which is also something that would need to go on the ballot.  And I'm not asking for this to be a charter amendment that would be permanently endowed in there.  If this passes by the voters, it's saying that the voters would like to have a charter amendment.  And then we're going to have to ask the city council to create a quality of life improvement commission.  There still is no teeth that say we have to do it.  But if the voters would like us to do it, I think it would be worth at least trying.  And this commission would be an advisory commission that would bring back recommendations to us.  They are not a board setting policy or anything like that.  It's just a place where a lot of hard work can get done.  And city council just isn't conducive to it like other commissions do and spend time doing.  Do we have any other questions?  Do we have any other questions?  Do we have any other questions?  Can I ask a question?  Sorry.  Go ahead.  So I asked this recognizing it wasn't at the previous meeting so I didn't hear the conversation around this.  Why wouldn't the request be that the council simply form this commission?  Why would you put it to the council?  Why would you put it to the voters to give the affirmation that it should be formed if you seem to think that it should be formed?  Because I would like it to be endowed for future councils.  This may not always be the council makeup.  And future councils can choose to see that and adhere to it or not.  But I would like the voters to be able to have the chance to put their voice out and say that this is something that we do.  Maybe the voters don't care about it.  Maybe it's not important to them.  And then we shouldn't probably spend money and time on it.  So you're advocating to spend $25,000?  $25,000 to form a commission that we could form by a council vote that if it passes by the voters, a future council could rescind because they don't actually have to abide by the request that the voters have the commission?  Correct.  Okay.  Thank you.  So my follow-up question to that, I understand the ballot initiative.  Asking the public if they want another commission, I don't understand.  If we don't understand what quality of life is and we need the public to tell us, first of all, we don't belong up here.  Second of all, why don't we just form an ad hoc committee and do it that way?  If it's a commission that we don't have to listen to or even abide by, it doesn't have any teeth.  Actually, this will be a shock to most of the commissions in town.  None of them have any teeth.  Zero.  So I think I understand where you're coming from.  I think it's a question of what quality of life is.  There's a plethora of people that want to have their voices heard in more than three or, in tonight's case, two minutes.  It seems there's other places to do that.  I mean, we could do an ad hoc committee on internal affairs.  We could have town hall meetings.  There's any number of ways to do that as opposed to setting up a commission.  I don't know how we'd do that.  Each one of us would pick a commissioner that would teach me what quality of life is.  So I'll be picking no one.  Okay.  I'll pick one for someone I'll have to listen to them anyway.  And then we've just added to staff time.  We've added another commission that, like the planning commission and some of the other commissions, tends to pass the buck where?  Here.  I mean, if I had my way, sorry, commissioners, I'd get rid of all of them.  Because what do they do with the hard stuff?  It comes to us anyway.  I'm sorry to contradict that, but, you know, we have heard today, the housing element,  that planning commission has done to a hearing committee.  We would have to do them here otherwise.  So commissioners definitely do stuff that basically I would say they filter the information and we just get the crux of it.  So we do not have to do that here.  We know that planning commission has done two meetings.  And that's just something I wanted to say, that yes, commissions do stuff.  And their recommendations are definitely important.  Okay.  But not binding.  So you're comparing the planning commission's housing element, which is required by state law, to the creation of a new commission that's going to tell us this is what quality of life means.  I can't make that leap.  But if you guys want to create more government, I mean, that's up to you.  Okay.  Why don't we do this?  Why don't we go to speakers and then come back to?  We have five speakers.  All right.  Two minutes.  Two minutes.  Okay.  Julie Threat followed by Robin Engle.  I don't see Julie.  So Robin Engle followed by Rob Berry.  I can't believe I kind of agree with Shawn.  I know.  I know.  This seems like a circus act.  I really don't know why we're here.  We're looking at this.  Vince Ewing red marked the whole thing all the way through.  And Vince Ewing and Sorenson were very intricately involved in writing the ordinance or set of ordinances that got us into trouble in the first place, for which we're under litigation.  The Warren versus V. Chico.  And I think that's the biggest thing.  And that seems to have been conveniently forgotten about.  Quality of life is up to everyone's discretion.  And that's mostly what I agree with Shawn with.  I mean, we all have different definitions of quality of life.  And we know that for the most part, six out of seven of you are concerned with the higher echelon of our community in terms of wealth.  We also know that you have not expressed concern for the health of your family.  We know that you have not expressed concern for people who have been shot by teens.  For example, the man who was shot almost a year ago in September of last year.  We've only heard from one of you, Alex Brown, when we requested you make a statement at all about not ‑‑ and some of you weren't on council yet, I guess.  But you make a statement about this killing of a man by teens.  So your sense of quality of life has to only do with people who live very luxurious lifestyles as do you.  And that's what I'm trying to get at.  That's offensive to us.  And so this measure is just fraught with open invites for more lawsuits.  We don't have a police advisory committee anymore.  That was done away with years ago.  If we're going to have another committee, bring that back first.  And then I'm happy to talk about a quality of life committee.  But we need housing and we need a police department advisory board or whatever you call it first.  Thank you.  Rob Berry followed by Patrick Newman.  Thank you.  Thank you, Rob.  Thank you, Rob. The first thing I want to do is appreciate the fact that you guys at least talked about it a little bit before the public got up here to speak. So at least I have some idea of where people are parked. The question was asked, why put this on the ballot if you could just create a commission anyway? The question was asked, why put this on the ballot if you could just create a commission anyway? The answer to that is because the people of Chico feel a little bit estranged from their city government. And this is an opportunity for them to give a clear expression to you about what is important to them.  them. So it's important that it go on the ballot because it would be interesting to know whether  20% thinks it's a good idea or whether 70% think it's a good idea. And I would hope that that would  have an influence on what you do as a council from that point forward. The second point I want to  make is I don't know why this is such a, even a controversial issue. The point of this commission  is not to tell you what to do or to explain to you what the definition of quality of life is.  The purpose is to use Vince Ewing's language. The purpose is to formulate proposed ordinances  and resolutions for recommended council adoption regarding improvement in the quality of life in  Chico based on these elements. And so the point is tonight's meeting is a perfect example of why  this forum is not the right forum to take up a topic like that. That topic needs to be explored.  It needs to be understood. There needs to be an opportunity.  There needs to be some heavy lifting in terms of what other cities are doing and so forth.  And that can come back to you in the terms of a more crisp recommendation about something that you can do  as a city council to make an incremental improvement in the quality of life for the citizens of Chico.  That seems to me like an unquestionably good thing. And I don't see any way to turn that into something  that is a negative or somehow, uh,  you know, adding new government. If we have too many commissions, get rid of some of the ones we have.  But this one is critically important. Thank you very much.  Patrick Newman, followed by Mike Trollander.  How long has the City of Chico been here? 150 years?  I'm sorry, I don't remember the date of the Charter.  Uh, in that 150 years, did a quality of life commission ever come up as a necessity?  I don't think so.  so and I think we should ask why and I think their answer is that issues around  quality of life have to do with things like tree crews, park maintenance, having  an infrastructure that functions that's funded well enough so that you don't  have buckling roads all over and buckling sidewalks all over town. There's  multiple things that can be done and should be done to improve quality of  life for everyone including the people that I think if you look at the code of  this are being targeted here. Quality of life is what people have worked at for  150 years and they didn't need some kind of dog-and-pony show to try to figure  out what that means and to bring something back from some kind of  pressure cooker where people are gonna cook up things and bring them here to  you because you don't have the insight to do this. The way you achieve quality  of life is you do the hard work of making the city better for everybody  including the homeless. So again, I really  what's being targeted here. Secondly, this is political posturing, Casey. This  is about you getting re-elected. This is about you becoming mayor. This is about  answering those constituents of yours who keep calling and saying, look this  council hasn't solved the homeless problem. As if you have some magic at your  disposal to do that with. And we all know goddamn well you don't but you don't  you're not honest with the public about that so they keep thinking you do.  So this whole thing is posturing on steroids and it makes no sense at any  level and I'm amazed that the hysteria has taken us to this point. That's kind  of what it looks like to me. Thank you. Thank you. Mike Trowlander is our last  speaker. Hello council, I'm Mike Trowlander. In 2013 the council canceled economic development committee.  It's done by a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a board member, a  I don't really care about a ballot initiative.  To me, that vacuum still exists.  I think there's a big vacuum about the quality of life in Chico,  about the conversation around that.  I think that when council puts together a formality for people to talk in that arena,  that real work happens.  And so what you call this, I don't really know,  but just know that a vacuum exists.  It's been existing for a long time.  And a lot of us have been sidelined.  I've been sidelined for 10 years.  Sorenson was part of that.  Hi, Mark.  He was part of that group for a long time.  And so please, maybe this isn't the everything that everybody wants,  but maybe this is a good time to do something.  And so there you go.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And further council discussion, consideration.  Second question.  This is a city attorney or city clerk question.  Do we need to put, whether or not to put a commission together on the ballot?  Can we just create a commission?  You always, the council has created commissions.  Commissions via an ordinance and it gets codified in our municipal code.  That's how the arts commission, climate action commission,  all of the other commissions that currently exist were created.  The arts commission and the climate action commission.  Yes.  Two of my favorites.  And they were created by council without putting on the ballot.  That is correct.  Okay.  Casey, no one's made a motion yet. No one's made a motion yet. I understand the idea of the quality of life and why you'd want it on the ballot. I'm going to ask respectfully that you separate the two. If you want to put the quality of life ordinance on the ballot, do it. If you want to put the commission on the ballot, knowing full well, it doesn't need to be on there. If you want to put the commission on the ballot, knowing full well, it doesn't need to be on there. If you want to create it, create it.  It's done.  It's done.  It's done.  It's done.  It's done.  It's done.  because it's not needed.  We create a commission right now.  We could create an ad hoc committee under internal affairs  and there's a hundred things we could do.  And to Mr. Newman's point, someday this council is going  to look different and that commission is going to talk  about entirely different things.  I just, I don't get it.  Council Member Bryan.  Thank you.  So this is kind of coming off the rails a little bit I think.  But I think the intent behind this is clear.  I think what we're trying to create and what I hear  and have heard the community express for many years is they  want a forum to express their concerns as to what's going  on in their neighborhoods where they live, work, and recreate.  And I've said many times if you feel threatened  in those particular areas, your quality of life,  your life suffers.  And that is every demographic in this community.  Not just the rich, but the poor as well.  And we need to consider that.  And so how do we create something  that allows our constituents an ability  to express these concerns other than having to come to council  and speaking on three minutes where really oftentimes  that is not an effective way to communicate.  How do we create those forums?  And I think this if done correctly can do just that.  And I don't think we have a lot of time left.  I don't think, you know, rushing something  to the ballot right now is probably a wise idea.  I think Councilmember Morgan is correct.  It doesn't need to go on a ballot initiative.  I get the reason why we would do that is to codify that  and really have our community speak.  But I think trying to rush that would be something probably  doing this the wrong way in my opinion.  But I do support creating a commission that allows us really  to look at health and safety.  And that's what we're talking about.  We're talking about the health and safety of this community.  And I think that's important.  I know my fellow councilmembers also agree with that.  It's just how do we create that in a way that is actually going  to be viable and productive.  And that's what I support.  So, Chief, a question.  I need to ask this question as well.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm looking at the wrong thing.  Why is this not making any sense?  Hold on.  One, two, three, four, five.  Is currently is this written to have the commission part  of the ordinance?  Mr. Ewing?  No.  No, Councilmember Morgan.  It would not.  That would be a separate action.  So the proposed ordinance or the ordinance that you have before,  you does not create a commission.  That's a separate action.  So I'm going to make a motion to approve putting the ordinance  on the ballot, but we're going to have to come back  because I think Ms. Reynolds wants changes to it first.  And then we can talk about the commission.  Could you repeat that?  Say that motion again.  Well, I'd say I move to put the ordinance  on the ballot, but I know Vice Mayor Reynolds wanted  to change it a little bit.  So I'm trying to get to where she wants that to go  because it's not quite where she wants it now unless she's not  looking at me so I can't tell.  Mr. Bennett?  Am I able to ask a question?  Absolutely.  Mr. Ewing?  Okay.  Go ahead, Councilmember.  And this is to Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Did you want this incorporated into this somewhere?  Most of it is.  Excuse me.  Go ahead.  It's okay.  Go ahead.  So this would be a lead-in?  I'm just reading this.  It would be a lead-in to this document somehow incorporated  into it so they become merged.  Is that correct?  Okay.  And the city attorney could do that but would have  to come back before the 12th to approve it?  Yep.  Correct.  That's my first motion.  I'll second it.  There you go.  Point of clarification because we have some more discussion here.  The ordinance within this is a nuisance abatement ordinance,  right?  Is that correct, Mr. City Attorney?  Yes, Councilmember Brown.  So nowhere in here as far as I can see says anything  about quality of life.  I can recognize nuisances.  Affirmative.  Yes, that's correct.  It didn't affect quality of life, but is that correct?  That's correct.  It didn't contain the language that is in the document  that I'm holding up before you.  Right.  The ordinance does not contain that language.  That's correct.  Yes.  So to say this is a quality of life ordinance we're putting  on the ballot, it's, you know, it looks like a performance piece to me.  No part of this ordinance says anything about quality of life.  This is an ordinance that says the city, as a proper government,  owner should be held responsible in the same way that other property owners are for public nuisance  issues. It's very clear what this relates to. I mean, call it what it is. As far as I'm concerned,  call it what it is. I won't support it. Okay. Any more questions?  I have a question. So how far off from, well, how far off is current code enforcement action  off of what is presented here? Oh, that's a good question. There's some pending cases now.  Um, I, I can't speak to them specifically. Um, I don't, I don't believe that  I don't believe that  Wow. How far off? Um, I don't know. Um, is the city, um, engaging in code enforcement  actions currently? Yes. Yeah. But currently they're not focused on public property. They're  not posted close to their approach. So that's probably the biggest difference. Yeah. So  that's the main crux of this. Is it what can you expand on that? What does that mean? They're  not focused on public property. They're not enforcing actions on, uh, ordinances that  we have on public property.  Right. So, um, the changes that were proposed in the staff report focus on public property,  city owned property as opposed to public property, private property. Yeah. Code enforcement  acts on private property, whereas this would act on public property. That was the crux of  the changes was more focused on public property. Right. But do we need the changes to get code  enforcement to focus on public property? Or we're just kind of encouraging ourselves to  encourage code enforcement? I think in most of these cases, code enforcement could address  them. But this brings a bigger question is, uh, what should our code look like? Those  that are related to code enforcement, both public nuisance code and the other codes under  which code enforcement operates. When you look through those, most of them were created  in the nineties, some updates since then. So they're, they're due for, they're due for  review. The code enforcement supervisor already has a list of updates and changes that she'd  like to see to help make them more efficient and effective, but that would take a little  bit of time. We don't have, we couldn't put that together, but sure now and Friday. Okay.  That leads to my next question. So could we obviously expand code enforcement to include  public property? That's what this does. Yeah. I mean, that's the answer to that question,  right? Yes. Sorry. I'm leading the.  That's okay. I'm leading the witness. Leading questions are fine. Correct. And adopting  the ordinance without putting it on the ballot is an option to achieve that end. Is that  what I'm also hearing? That is correct. That's always an option for the council. So, but  another option would be to send this to internal affairs, have them redo the code, the changes  to code. Not if you want to put it on the ballot. No, I understand that. We wouldn't  necessarily need to put it on the ballot either. If we just made changes to the code, we wouldn't  have to do that. But if we just make changes to the code, those we can do at the council  level. Correct? We can't. I'm just, I'm just trying to help the agenda item. I got you.  So I'm going to call the question. Yeah. I'll be able to call the question. Let's do it.  So it's the, um, a motion by council member Morgan, seconded by vice mayor Reynolds to,  um,  put an ordinance on the ballot as amended to reflect and the wording that we were just  given. Okay. So, um, we're going to have to see what it says. Um, and then I just need  to, so would that ordinance have to come back? That ordinance would have to come back at  a, at a special meeting. Can it be adopted?  If, if it's coming back, it'll be a brand new ordinance. Is that correct? Or is it just,  is this one being introduced with changes, but we don't know what the changes really  look like?  Uh, Claire Preston, if theoretically what we're looking at as a special meeting, um,  with the proposed ordinance for the council to adopt as amended, and I'm holding up this  document that, uh, uh, vice mayor Reynolds provided to be, and that ordinance would be,  the council would be taking action at the special meeting to place the ordinance on  the ballot. And then of course the other actions that are related to, um, placing the document  on the ballot that the city attorney, uh, recommend that the council calling for the  ordinance to be placed on the ballot November 8th, 2022 setting priorities and filing a  written argument and rebuttal and directing the city attorney to prepare an impartial  analysis for the ballot argument. That theoretically is not in the ordinance. Um, and then, um,  there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's,  there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's,  there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's,  there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's,  there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's,  there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's,  election. So she was hoping she could get it tomorrow so that they could process it and it's  not ready. So I just, that's why I brought that up just to let you know. So. So what's the deadline?  August 12th. Well, that's a deadline. August 12th is a deadline. I need to make a clarification  point because I started my motion saying we're going to bifurcate the ordinance from the  commission. So part five of this. Right. But I'll make another motion on that. Right. And just to  clarify, Debbie, the deadline for the county is different than August 12th, right? It is. She said  the supervisors needed it on August 9th. All we can do is all we can do. So the supervisors have  to approve before she moves forward, correct? Yes. We consolidate our elections with them and  they get. They have to do that by the 9th.  And we have to send the resolution to them to ask them to consolidate and add a ballot measure.  Otherwise, you're going to have a non-consolidated election. Well, it just means we've got to have it by Monday.  Yeah, I don't think they're going to hold a special meeting for us.  All right. Well, let's. Question's been called. Wait. I'm sorry. I have to ask. Mr. City Attorney,  I recognize that you have, you have, you have affirmed that this, as it's written, passes legal muster.  Yes. But as I'm reading through this and, and thinking about, okay, somebody files a complaint,  we have a settlement agreement in place. The complaint directly conflicts with the settlement  agreement in one, two, or five ways. What is the appropriate course of action and how could this  pass legal muster if those two things conflict? What the judge says. So you're referring to the  draft ordinance that you had before you? That's correct. Yeah, that passes legal muster. So we  took out the.  Language that was challenging, or, or that was, um, that exposed the city to risk. So we've cleaned it up,  and, and, um, I'm, I'm confident that the document you have before you passes legal muster.  And so to understand your question, I didn't hear the second part of that.  If a complaint is made that's in, you know, that in the normal realm of things would violate the settlement agreement for us to take action on,  if there's a conflict between the complaint and the settlement agreement, do we just not take action and that is what it is?  Okay, so when you say if the ordinance violates the settlement agreement?  That's correct.  Right, so we don't feel that it does, but certainly anybody can complain about anything, right?  And so they say, oh, this violates the settlement agreement.  Then the advice from my office would be, well, we can't do anything until we resolve the complaint.  So that's addressed in item D.  The city should be held responsible to the extent permitted by the law.  So right now the law in Chico is the settlement.  So if it is in contrast with that law, that would not be something that would be enforceable on,  and the person who made the complaint would be answered back within the 20 days or whatever it is,  why it conflicts with the law and that they cannot enforce on that at that time.  One quick question.  You just mentioned, and I hadn't thought about it, but I am now.  Is 20 days?  Is 20 days an adequate time to get back to somebody who files a or fills out the form on a complaint?  Or should it be a little bit longer to give staff time to?  That's a date we didn't, you know, it's not scientific or anything.  It's certainly, it's up to the council if, and, you know, council consulting with staff wants to arrive at a different number.  That's certainly something I encourage you to do.  We thought in drafting that that was a reasonable amount of time.  Business days.  So it's business days, so it's four weeks.  But if you want to make it for 25 days, whatever, I'm capable of that.  Okay.  Well, the question's been called, so we need to take the roll on this.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  I have some further comments, but.  Could you please repeat the motion one more time?  Yeah.  Motion was to, okay, let me go back to that.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes.  The first part of your ordinance as amended with the wording that was provided by Vice Mayor Reynolds,  it did not include the commission.  Is that correct?  Okay.  To come back at a special meeting.  So Council Member Bennett.  And it will include the additional language.  Yes.  That's what I would bring back to the special meeting is the additional language.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  No.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Okay.  So I'm going to do something that I once mistakenly scolded Council Member Brown for doing.  So, because it was a mistake.  And I take this opportunity to apologize for that.  But I'm going to say something.  I'm going to say something before I vote.  Which is, I don't mind this coming back.  I'm really hesitant about the fact that we sent code enforcement and all the issues surrounding  it to internal affairs at the start of my term.  And I haven't seen that come back with massive changes like I had hoped for.  I don't know where that is.  Necessarily haven't been tracking that.  But I think some of that could be resolved through.  Code.  I'm also concerned about the city's resources in terms of cleaning up all these issues that  get brought forward.  And whether or not we even have the resources to do that when we have, I don't know how  many street trees that need to be trimmed.  So I'm going to vote yes on this.  But when we get to the next round, just because I don't mind it coming back and I don't mind  the special meeting.  But I think we need to dig into this pretty deep before we dive off the board here.  So aye.  Okay.  Carry six one.  Okay.  So my next motion will be that the council via the internal affairs committee set up  an ad hoc committee based on quality of life improvement.  That committee we made up of the internal affairs committee and some number of citizens  of the internal affairs committee deemed worthy.  We'll leave it up to them.  If that ad hoc committee seems to be making sense and people are attending it and we're  getting good information out of it, then we can turn that into a standing commission  any time we want.  Is that a motion?  It was.  I'm going to make you repeat that.  Or somebody.  So it was to.  You got it?  Okay.  Go.  So my motion is to establish an ad hoc committee underneath the internal affairs committee  to be made up by the members of the internal affairs committee and some number of citizens  that the internal affairs committee deems necessary or worthy.  I would probably say one per, but then that's only three citizens.  So it might be two.  Or maybe the internal affairs committee says everybody on council gets to one, so then  you got seven.  That can all be worked out.  Because an ad hoc committee, I think it can have as much influence, feedback, any of those  things as commission does.  And if it turns out it's really being effective, people are going and they're having the discussions  that we can't have here in two or three minutes, then we can turn it into a commission any  time we want.  And I think that's a better way of going about it than setting up the commission and having  it maybe necessarily go the other way.  It doesn't need to go on the ballot.  Now I'm going on and on.  There's going to be one other thing I was going to say about that.  I think in, oh, no one ever shows up except the finance staff.  But in finance committee, we have long open discussions with a member of the public rights.  Now we don't cut people off at three minutes or four minutes.  It's like, okay, we go back and forth and God forbid you get Christian Pelley in there.  You can't stop him anyway.  And I haven't been on internal affairs since I was first on council, but that's how it  was.  It was a lot more give and take.  I don't think internal affairs is the right thing to do.  It's the right place for this idea because they're focused on other things.  So if they set up a specific committee to do that and it goes well, then bring it back  and I'll make the motion to create a commission for it.  But I think that we're not there yet.  So I can support that council member Morgan and the fact that vice mayor Reynolds also  agrees with that.  I think it gets our foot in the door.  And if this proves what I think it well, that the community is starving for that.  That type of interaction and those opportunities in that forum.  And we can create a commission based upon that.  I think it gives us a good start.  I will support it for that reason.  Is that a second?  I think vice mayor Reynolds seconded it.  All right.  Council member Tan.  Oh, your mic is on.  Sorry.  All right.  You have to say something.  Yeah, you have to say something.  I'll support that.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Call the question.  Council member Bennett.  Yes.  Council member Brown.  No.  Council member Morgan.  Yes.  Council member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice mayor Reynolds.  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  So are we going to set the, for the ordinance to come back, we need to set that special  meeting?  We need to set a special meeting.  Okay. We don't need a formal motion or anything, but if I could get the council while you're here, I mean, obviously Vince's office will have to write it. Mr. Young, how long does your office need versus what, well, you know what, before we Mr. Young, how long does your office need versus what, well, you know what, before we set the meeting, Clerk Cressin, why don't we have you reach out to the county to figure  Thank you. set the meeting, Clerk Cressin, why don't we have you reach out to the county to figure out what that date is, have Vince assess on his calendar how much time it will take him  his calendar how much time it will take  him to prepare this and then the two of you can reach  out to council and schedule.  Well Candy reached out to me and  said she'd like to have it tomorrow.  However I told her that that would probably not  work. Obviously not going to happen. But on their  election calendar it says August 9th  is when they need it to get to the  in order to process it to get it to  the supervisors. Okay.  So Vince do you need time to establish that  or can you tell us right now  how long it's going to take? I can tell you  I can get it to you by the  8th.  What is the 8th? That's Monday.  Monday. Yeah.  All right.  I would  also suggest  that I would think the special meeting  would not be too long.  Maybe mistaken.  Okay.  So  that's  some Monday.  Monday night. Tuesday is too late.  So it's got to be either Monday or it's got to  be Friday.  Right?  Yeah.  Well day after tomorrow is  tomorrow.  Yes.  But you need to give time.  The 8th?  He said the 8th.  By the 8th.  Yeah.  The 5th is my mom's birthday.  The meeting's on the 9th?  The 4th?  He needs to the 8th to get this done.  Well yeah but you just said half of us just said we can't make the 8th.  So.  Can't do it the 9th.  So the 9th is the actual meeting  of the supervisors at 9 o'clock  in the morning.  So if you do it on Monday  there's  Monday.  Monday.  It would be very difficult to get it done.  They couldn't add it according to the Brown Act and begin.  We have to either do it on.  So it sounds like we have to do it on the 4th.  Yeah because it would.  Which is two days.  The 4th?  The 4th.  And then.  3rd?  Tomorrow?  I'll be in there.  Then.  Just get it to us now.  I couldn't have it until 10 o'clock at night.  We need a 24 hour notice.  Yeah.  No I know.  So I could do the 5th.  This morning.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  I can do the 6th also.  I can come in for a 30 minute meeting on 6th.  At 5.  I can do the 6th.  Yeah.  Okay.  Why don't we do this?  My original plan.  We'll make this decision after the meeting as to when this next meeting will be.  Oh you can't do that?  Can't.  Can't.  We do that all the time.  Okay.  I think I'll make special.  Make special.  5th.  Special meeting only requires 24 hour notice.  Okay.  That's for you Vince.  Saturday morning has to be out.  Nothing will happen on Saturday morning.  Friday morning Vince?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  So.  We'll all figure it out.  So just to confirm it's Friday morning.  Did I hear that correct?  No.  That's what we get back.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  So we'll go from there.  Let's move on to our next item.  Vice Mayor Reynolds requests city options with some settlement agreement.  What time is it?  It is 9.58.  No.  9.  Yeah.  It is.  9.58.  9.59.  Do you want to table it?  We can.  I was just going to recommend to send it to internal affairs anyways because that's what  we're already doing over there.  So there's no sense in taking up more time here.  Are there speaker cards on the next item?  Are there speaking cards?  No.  All right.  Okay.  So no speaker cards.  It goes right along with everything else that we've just sent over there for ad hoc committee  and everything else.  So that was going to be my recommendation.  Okay.  So let's see this officially.  Item 5.2.  Vice Mayor Reynolds requests.  Do we have a motion to send it to internal affairs?  Motion to send it to internal affairs.  Second from Council Member Chapman.  No.  No.  No public comment on this item?  Madam Clerk, when you're ready, please take the roll.  Okay.  Just a second.  So that's to refer it to IAC.  So could you please repeat what just happened up here?  So.  Vice Mayor Reynolds made a request to send it to internal affairs.  5.2.  Okay.  Because it's our next one.  Okay.  Yes.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  No.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  No items posted after the agenda.  Six reports and communications.  City Manager's report.  Item 6.1.  Just to thank you, Council, for the opportunity to serve the Council and the City of Chico  once more.  Other than that, no report.  All right.  Thank you very much.  6.2.  Council Member request.  Quick one for me.  The Butte County Local Food Network recently presented the results of its Butte County  baseline food assessment to the Board of Supervisors.  They've been actively engaged in a variety of innovative local food system projects that  I think are beneficial for the public to be aware of and participate in.  So I'd like to request a 15-minute presentation from them to outline some of the issues that  they've been working on and the results similar to what they provided to the Board of Supervisors.  And I would appreciate your support keeping the public informed about the project and  its implications for the City and the County.  Second.  I will support that.  Thank you.  Ms. Brown, what was it?  What was, I'm sorry, the time.  The agency.  What was the agency?  The Butte County Local Food Network.  Food Network.  Okay.  I thought that's what you said.  Guy Fieri is coming.  Guy Fieri is coming.  Awesome.  Who was the second?  Sean.  Sean.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Alex made the motion.  Sean made the second.  Right.  Council Member Bennett.  Excuse me.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Thank you.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  And we are adjourned.  Thank you. [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
