 We will start with the pledge. Salute. And pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And before we start roll call, just a reminder to the commission to please use your microphones. If you can push, and you'll see the green light come on. But we do have our city attorney participating via Zoom, and he cannot hear us unless we use our mics. So, item 1.2, roll call. Commissioner Wall? Here. Commissioner Poland? Here. Commissioner Goldstein? Here. Commissioner Deremedy is absent. Commissioner Cooper? Here. Vice Chair Ober? Here. And Chair Scott? Present. Item 2, consent agenda. Do we have a motion to approve? I'll make a motion to approve. Thank you, Commissioner Poland. And do we have a second? I'll second. And we have a second from Vice Chair Ober to approve the consent agenda. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Any opposed? So, motion carries 6-0. 0 with 1 absence. Item 3, business from the floor. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matters not listed on the agenda. Do we have any business from the floor? Great. Thank you. Item 4, public hearings. And we have one item, item 4.1. We'll start with ex parte communications. And I will look to my left. Do we have any ex parte communications? Nope. And to my right? No. So we have no ex parte communications. So, item 4.1, BCM construction on Morrow Lane. And I will turn it over to Mike. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Scott. And good evening, Planning Commissioners. Tonight is a recommendation from the Planning Commission regarding two warehouse buildings and associated site improvements for a project on Morrow Lane. Thank you. Thank you. It involves three different applications. A general plan amendment and rezone to change the reconfiguration or to reconfigure the zoning district boundaries within the site. Site design and architecture review for the project. And then to approve those things, we prepared an initial study. An initial study mitigated negative declaration to satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act. The project site is located on the south side of Morrow Lane, just east of the freeway and and Notre Dame Boulevard. It's also bordered by Comanche Court, which is a private street along its eastern side. The zoning is ML Light Manufacturing with a ribbon of primary open space, OS1, going through the middle of it. The surrounding land uses are predominantly industrial to the north, and it's near Home Depot and a lumber yard, and then there is rural residential uses generally to the east. Taking a closer look at the site, we see that there is a vegetated corridor going through the middle, and within that there is a little stream channel. I call it the remnant riparian corridor through there because it's not quite a full functioning creek anymore, and I'll explain more about that in the next couple of slides. But this one shows how there's a vacant field to the north of the creek, and until recently that was occupied by some disaster recovery in temporary dwellings. And on the south side of the channel, there is an undeveloped contractor's yard that's been used for several years for that purpose. So why is it a remnant riparian corridor? And it's because there's not as much water going through it as once it had. There is still riparian vegetation there. There's still a depression in the landscape. And now we can kind of understand what has happened over the years. So this is an aerial of the entire vicinity with Highway 99 going through in red there, kind of flat land. The project site's inside of a little bullseye we added there. And the largest creek in the area is Butte Creek. Butte Creek comes out of a canyon, takes a hard turn left to go south through the town of Durham. Then there's Comanche Creek, which is roughly parallel. It does not make the southerly turn. No, it continues straight across the middle of our slide here. And it has quite a bit of headwaters, giving it good flows. Our little northern tributary to Comanche Creek comes out of the foothills there where you can see its origin. And then it goes through the project site area and then meets Comanche Creek. And that's how it looks on old U.S. topos going back to the 1800s. It's been like that for a long time. This would be the sort of the natural water features in the area for a long time. And it flows, like I said, out of the foothills and confluences back with Comanche Creek. And then until about the 1950s, when the Army Corps of Engineers, as part of the Water Works projects around here to limit flooding, created the Butte Creek Diversion Channel. And that transfers water from Little Chico Creek, which is north of the slide, down to Butte Creek. And in doing so, it intercepts the headwaters of our little northern tributary, here, as well as Comanche Creek itself. They did add some gate valves that allow Comanche Creek to continue its flow. So it's basically year-round aqueduct for farming purposes to the west. And, but our little tributary got its headwaters cut off and that denied the flows that it would normally experience. And that led to the channel really getting filled in. It's no longer exposed aggregate with, you know, an incised channel that you would expect with a normal, healthy stream. There's still the riparian corridor there, though. So it's kind of a combination of a former stream with still some of the values that you would expect in a creek corridor, but not all of them. The project site itself involves two warehouse buildings. One would be, so this, the orientation of this has a moral lane along the right-hand side of the slide. The larger building, building A, would be up front near moral lane. It's about 18,000 square feet in size with a little bit of parking out in front, most of the parking behind. Then the stream channel goes through the middle and building B would be in the back. That would be about 15,000 square feet. Again, with some parking in front and some behind. There is featured on the slide also some detention basins. It's very common now that all projects have to have these, features that contain storm water so that we don't get all those first flush impacts straight to the creeks. It holds some water. And then there's trash enclosures as well. There's a lot of trees also shown on this site plan so you can see it along the channel where all the existing trees are. The ones that were found to be in better health are kind of bolded so that they pop out a little bit more. And you can see that there's a good variety of trees along it. good cluster of them here in front of building B. That's where probably most of the tree removal would occur to make room for the accessway for the parking. A lot of these trees, by being grouped as they are, are crowded. They're not growing too well in that condition. Some of them have severe leaning going on. Some of them are damaged, which makes them more susceptible to diseases. Most of those types of trees would be removed. The landscape plan shows the combination of existing trees that would remain with the new trees that would be planted to shade the parking area and provide an attractive perimeter to the site. There is a condition of approval regarding the tree removal pursuant to the code. You have to pay mitigation for all the diameter that gets removed from a project. So we have that standard condition in there. The buildings are pretty substantial. They're 35 feet tall, concrete walls. That provides a lot of interior space to either infill with a couple levels of office space in addition to the warehouse space that would be in the back with maybe a tall ceiling that could allow lots of things to occur inside. Very flexible buildings regarding their use over time. These elevations really flatten them, but they do show how there's, you know, it's very attractive in the front with lots of glazing. In the back, you have utilitarian large doors that provide access back there. But in real life, they're going to have some pop-ins, pop-outs and some recesses that give it some depth and shadow lines. There's good awnings over the windows in front that announce where the entryways are. The project went to the architecture review board, last month. They unanimously recommended approval of the project design. Returning to the zoning, this shows the existing zoning boundary versus the proposed zoning boundary. And what we know about the existing zoning is that it is very imprecise because we were doing a lot of zoning boundaries when the map was created. But it's pretty accurate in terms of flagging the fact that there is a creek corridor there. It does have values that provide a lot of the benefits we expect in a creek corridor. But as I explained, due to the lack of flows, it's somewhat compromised. And what it tells us is that we need to take a close look whenever there's a project here to see what really is going on. And the new boundary would keep the same amount of primary open space acreage, but reconfigure it to basically conform to the project design, where the stream channel actually goes through there like this. We kind of missed that because I think the zoning effort followed the riparian corridor and the tree canopy. And the tree canopy just kind of led you astray a little bit in this area. So the new design provides buffers along the channel and would remain or keep the open space zoning through the center of the site. There's a crossing associated with the project design that I should have mentioned. And it would connect the north half with the south half of the project site. And enhance circulation. So we do think this is a reasonable approach to reconfigure the zoning. And it's a nice project. So we are recommending approval. For the environmental review, we turned out several mitigation measures through that process. One would require lowering the lighting across. There's one residential unit across the street on Comanche Court. So the lighting across from it would have to be lowered pursuant to that mitigation measure. And then we also wanted to make sure that the! And then we also wanted to make sure that the lighting across the street would be lowered pursuant to that mitigation measure. So that would be a major for inadvertent discovery of cultural resources during construction. To summarize, the Planning Commission is asked to adopt the resolution which would forward a recommendation to City Council to adopt the mitigated negative declaration as revised through the comments from Fish and Wildlife. As well as recommending approval of the general plan amendment and rezone. And approval of the site design subject to the conditions that include all of the mitigation measures. As well as the tree condition that I mentioned. So with that, I'll answer any questions you have. Thanks Mike. I think that was the best staff report I've ever seen. That was really good. Thank you. I just have one quick question maybe from Matt. Mike, could you go back to the slide that has the overall project and I think the bioswale, that one, yeah. So I remember I was doing a project a while back. I was doing a project a while back. And I was thinking maybe off of Manzanita that had a bioswale feature. And the city had looked into that as far as how effective and efficient it would be in doing its job. Is that something, Matt, that you would have reviewed on this project? I really haven't been involved and reviewed this. I talked to Mike about it today and it seemed like he had covered all the bases. For some reason, I can't remember what project it was. But it was a project you were talking about. Manzanita. I want to say it was near, they had some serious flooding issues. So that's why we had talked about that. Was it over on Centennial Chico Canyon Road? We had a subdivision in there that's taken a couple of forms. Yeah. Okay. When we do the engineering review of the site plans in conjunction with the building permit, we'll be reviewing the storm drain calculations. And I think what Mike had indicated that on the, I guess it's the westerly side, they're planning to have a circulation to go over it. So we'll check the storm drainage of the tributary area and the proper sizing of that pipe. Okay. And I think, too, on the earlier slide, Mike, some of that runoff, it looked like it's coming from Valley's Edge project. So we'll have to see if that's going to be a problem. Where the red arrow is, is that kind of where the bicycle path connection comes down through Potter Road? Mm-hmm. Because if a lot of that, well, the smaller dash blue line, I think that comes off of Valley's Edge. And I know when we develop that or if that gets developed, there's going to be a lot of on-site detention facilities on that. So that'll reduce, actually reduce the flow that goes down that way. Great. Thank you. Any questions to my left? I just was, on this slide right here, is that a road that's going over like a bridge? Is that a walking bridge or is it a driving bridge? Yeah, it's a clear span bridge, which means it just goes from side to side. And it's for vehicles as well as walking. You see they have a pedestrian path. Okay. So this dotted line shows us the path of travel intended to get people back out to the right of way. That's how the patio and everything, so, okay. Yeah. And the outdoor amenities I forgot to mention, but there's a lot of features to this project that the board liked. Usually when we see several bioswales like this, we're pretty satisfied that they'll be able to meet the stormwater retention requirements. It's when you see very small ones and only a couple that we get a little concerned that it's usually, though, with this, it's a matter of depth. So they have the spot for it to go. It's just how deep do you need to dig the hole to keep the water. Okay. Mr. Wong? I just have one small question. Are the bats environmentally protected? Yes, they're a sensitive species protected by the California Environmental, or California Endangered Species Act. But there's nothing in here that says they're protected. There's nothing in the mitigation comment number five in attachment J. It says they're protected. And if there's none on site, it seems like a lot of extra work to do all of this for bats that don't exist and may not even be protected. Well, they are protected. The pallid bat, if they found a pallid bat, that would be a sensitive species that's protected. Yes, they found. They haven't found any. They can occupy a site between, like, right now or next spring. We don't know when it's going to be constructed. If it's approved, it'll be approved for three years. And a species can move in during that time, so we do one check right before construction and then hope that nothing has set up in this project site. But there's no bats there now, right? I don't know that. I know they didn't find any in the biological work they did last year. Well, I guess it seems kind of odd to me. We're doing all of this for bats that aren't there, that might attach themselves to trees that are there, also trees that are outside this building as well. It's just more regulation and a cost for the applicant, it seems to me, than is necessary. They would only have to do the mitigation if bats are there, though, right? Excuse me? They only have to do the mitigation if the bats are there. If they're not there. If they're not there, they're bats found. So we have to just address that if there happen to be any bats, then there has to be a plan for handling the bats. And my understanding is that that study has not been conducted yet, right? The survey of whether they're there or not. So we don't... They were deemed unlikely in the biological resource assessment, so they weren't... They didn't really check it. It's really hard to check all the cavities of the trees in this area, too. But basically, we prepared the initial study. We sent it out for 30 days. We get comments back from Fish and Game, and they're saying, You forgot the Swainson's hawk stuff and you forgot the bat stuff. That's all we need to know to know that we need to talk to our applicant and say, Hey, can we add these things on now? Fish and Wildlife will be in a position of regulating this project. They can require permits. And to the extent the city... They don't think the city did a good enough job in our stuff that we did. They're going to require the same thing in a subsequent permitting process from the applicants. So we're best off in this situation just taking whatever Fish and Game says and putting it on the project and hoping that they take a light hand in their regulatory approach. I wonder if the same consideration isn't given to fish that aren't there in that little old stream bed. Because they might be someday. I would probably push back on a fish argument there. Because anybody can tell that there would not be a fish there. Commissioner Hubbard? Yeah, thank you. Mike, I echo Chair Scott's comments about the quality of this report. Particularly, I mean, the whole thing is fantastic, but call out specifically the detail on the tree component of this. That... You've heard commissioners ask for more detail in some projects than we've gotten. This is above and beyond. It's really helpful. I mean, I think maybe especially when we're dealing with a piece of this that is OS, then having that amount of detail is really reassuring to know that the tree's really been looked at closely. So I appreciate that. I do have a question. And I think I'm just missing something. And the applicant will probably address this too. But I'm still not quite clear what's happening grade-wise with the actual remnant of the stream bed. Is that going to be filled in and then the swales added to provide catchment? Or will the old stream beds just still be there? Which... And then, you know, the bridge at the one end. And it's almost... It reads to me as almost like a small, you know... Open space park almost in the middle of the two buildings, which sounds terrific to me. But I'm not sure I'm understanding what's happening with the grade. Well, I'll just put down a marker that whatever I say right now can be certainly amended by the project architect who is here today. However, it's my understanding that largely the stream channel as a depression will remain that way. Okay. The bioswale is up on the edge of the stream channel. It will be... A whole dug here to hold water and prove that it has enough capacity to hold the storm water from the runoff. And then there will be an ability for it to drain into the channel. Sometimes they put a gate valve there so that if there's flow in the channel, it doesn't, you know, go out. But then once there's room to, you know, allow the water to escape, it will. So it's my understanding that the bioswales are up in areas that are otherwise fairly dry. And then the clear span bridge goes from an abutment to an abutment on the edge. And doesn't add any piers or obstruction to the channel to the extent that it ever carries the flow. Right. Right. And when I looked at the site, it looked to me, you know, clearly there hasn't been much of any water there for a very long time. And I'm not... It wasn't even apparent to me, not being an expert at looking for these things, but where the water would even come from. Because both at the east and the west, it has, you know, been filled in and developed. And, you know, there's, you know... Pavement and buildings. It looked to me on top of the actual old stream bed in places. So, anyway. So thank you. I do understand that that will... That the old bed will still be there, which I do think will be an attractive project... Part of the project. It's essentially a micro park between the two parking areas and the two buildings. It looks terrific to me. So, thank you. So a little bit on to that too, Rich. With the new... Lid requirements for low impact development and what they call post standard construction plans. Typically now on apartment projects and larger developments, Lindsey's familiar with this out of Merriam Park. The owners of the property have an agreement that they sign with the city that's monitored on an annual basis that they're to maintain the facilities. And I would imagine probably the topography of that ground because we have a low... A low area that's running through that. I'm sure that the northerly portion kind of drains to the south and the southerly portion drains to the north just naturally. I think that's probably why they have those pond treatment areas in there that you're going to get surface runoff from the building into those ponds. And then it'll be treated, like Mike said, before it gets released into the natural open area. And like I said, we monitor those or will be monitoring those on an annual basis. That the owners of the property have to maintain those facilities in good working order. So... Great. Thank you. Any other questions? Commissioner Goldstein? I had a couple of questions. A couple of them have already been answered. So one thing that I was trying to understand, first of all, backtracking, great maps, great report. But I wanted to know, is this all one parcel or is it multiple parcels? It's one parcel. Three and a half acres. Interesting. I didn't know that you could have open space zoning between other zonings on one parcel. We try not to split zone parcels, but for good reason sometimes we do. Okay. And so, am I correct in summarizing this as we are moving the boundaries of the open space zone section of the parcel? While not changing the size of the open space zoning or changing the route of the channel? Correct. Okay. Great. I think I had a couple of other questions. Oh. So, do you know when the last time any water flowed through this channel or even was in the channel? Like still water? Just because I'm a planning nerd. I do come by my project site. I've been to the site from time to time. And the older application here was started in 2019. So, I've been by several times. I don't always get out there after it rains. But I've seen a couple of puddles from time to time, but never any flows. It's relegated to collecting just localized runoff. It does have two pipes from the place where the theater company is and stuff coming into the site. So, it probably collects some concentrated runoff right at the end of those pipes and probably creates a puddle there from time to time. But I've never seen any flows in the channel. Okay. And thanks for being diligent about checking on that so you can answer our questions. That's great. Is there any chance that in the future things might be rerouted with the diversion dam and that this channel could carry any water? Not that that would affect the project. I'm just curious. I don't know how that would happen. Okay. Also, I know that's not your domain as a city. I'm not a city planner. But just curious. Cool. Yeah, I think that answers my questions for now. Thank you very much. Thank you. Any other questions? No? Thank you, Mike. Thank you. So, we will now open the public hearing and we will begin with the applicant. Good evening, Commissioner. My name is Roy Cotterill. I'm with Perkins, Williams and Cotterill Architects and we're the architects on the project. And I concur. Mike did an awesome job not only presenting and putting this together in a cogent way but also processing our application in a very timely fashion and constantly keeping us informed on the details. So, you've got a great planner, Mike. He did such a good job. There's not a lot I can add other than the fact that we really, really enjoy this project. It's not too often we get an opportunity to work on an industrial project which has such a phenomenal amenity right smack dab in the middle of it. Usually we develop these things edge to edge. We're kind of scraping at the end of the day to find some little break area to put a bench. And here we have a park right in the middle of the site. So, that was very much a priority for us in the project was to keep this as a viable element for the project. And in particular, you know, save and preserve the site. And to preserve as many trees as possible. And to answer your question, Commissioner Ober, it's a combination of retaining walls and, you know, over the creek bridge. What we did not want to do is overgrade the site. Once we start grading, then we put the trees in jeopardy. Either we're going to bury them or we're going to expose the roots. So, it was a series of site plans that we went through over the course of a year that considered various options. How do we do that? Well, we're going to make it a viable site for the owner. Something that's going to have value and have development value. But at the same time preserve that open space. So, there's the drainage swales are at grade. And several of the edges to it are actually retaining walls to preserve the grade below so we can preserve the trees. So, we tried, I think successfully, it will be able to preserve the best trees on the site, the largest, the most viable trees. And so, like I said, I don't have a whole lot to add to that presentation. If you have any specifics about the design or the site, I'd be more than happy to answer any of them. Thank you. We'll start. Yeah. So, the trash, the north side trash, you put it on the creek. So, I had a question why there versus, like you can see where the one on the south side, you put it up in the corner. This one backing up to the creek. We know how sometimes people like to go through trash and it ends up now filling up that whole creek bed area. Just wondering maybe was there some reason for that. And then also the bridge, why go through that effort of the bridge? Was it a fire egress thing, truck thing? Two great questions. Thank you. Well, trash enclosures, there's no real good place to put them. Where you want to put them is where the service provider and the owner. Can get a straight shot at it, pick it up, back out, and leave. And when you start, you know, you take that as a parameter and you start trying to place it in certain places. Usually ends up the best place to put it is in front of the building or right on the street. And so, kind of working through our decision tree, on the front part of the site, that was the best place we could put it where we could go ahead and get a straight shot at it. So, that's really where it ended up there. Or it would be on the front of the site. And we thought that would be fairly objectionable. And it wasn't as ideal on the back side of the site. But they can kind of get a little bit of a crooked approach. So, it was... Were you guys building them up pretty high? Other six feet, six feet trash enclosures. And they will likely have a cover on them to protect any runoff that doesn't go in the storm green system will plummet, pipe it. And as far as the bridge goes, the idea on the bridge was once again, is if we filled it in and graded it, then we'd have to start filling in the creek that went through it. So, if we went from edge to edge, the grades and the trees on the east and the west of that bridge would be preserved. So, that was the idea there. And in terms of circulation, just so that there was continuity between the sites. There wasn't really necessarily a fire access requirement. But in general, they're going to want to have two... Points of ingress and egress, and we have those. But just so that there's some viability to connect the two sites. And secondarily, to bring the accessible path of travel from the street all the way to the back site without having to go down Comanche Court. Yeah, it's going to be a big bridge. I was out there, so I was sort of walking around. I was like, if you want us to go... It'd be pretty big. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a beautiful site. Oh, thank you, sir. Any other questions for the applicant? Great. Thank you. Well, again, thank you for your service to the community and your thoughtful consideration of our project. Thank you. Thanks again, Mike. Appreciate it. Any other public comment? I'm Gary Graves. I'm vice president of BCM Construction. So, thank you to the Planning Commission and thanks to Mike for your great presentation. And we've been... In Chico since 1994. We employ about 60 people locally. And we plan to move our offices into Building B. So, this is an important expansion for us. We need additional space. And we're a growing company here in Chico. So, we appreciate your consideration. We think we have a great project. And just want to thanks for your consideration. Thank you. Any other public comment? Okay. So, with that, I will close the public hearing and bring it back to the Commission. Any further questions for Principal Planner Mike Solley? For Matt? Or any motions? Can I ask Mike? Do you know what's going on with the west end of that property? Or is there any... Is it just... The west end? The west would be towards Notre Dame, I guess. Adjacent property. Adjacent property right there. Okay. Oh, the next property over? That's passing all over it. Nothing to my knowledge. Nothing. I just have one comment. Thank you, Mike, for a really good description and presentation. Appreciate it. Somebody's got to do it. I am. I move Planning Commission adopt resolution number 2. Number 21-09 recommending that the City Council adopt the mitigated negative declaration and approve the general plan amendment, rezone, and design review for the BCM construction on Morrow Lane project, subject to the attached conditions. Thank you. Is there a second? I'll second that. Great. So, we have a motion from Commissioner Wall and a second from Commissioner Cooper that the Planning Commission adopt resolution number 2. Number 21-09 recommending that the City Council adopt the mitigated negative declaration and approve the general plan amendment, rezone, and design review for the BCM construction on Morrow Lane project, subject to the attached conditions. Is there any further discussion? Okay. All in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? So, motion carries 6-0 with one absence. Thank you. Thank you.
