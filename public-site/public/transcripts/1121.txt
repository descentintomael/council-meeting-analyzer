 Chico, we will call this meeting to order and start with a notification from Chaplain Eileen Brownell. Did I get that okay? All right. Welcome. Thank you. We are a nation and a community of many customs, cultures, and beliefs, and Chico sits on land that was known as the Rancho Arroyo Chico. It was originally the land where the Machu Picchu and Madaya lived, hunted, and prospered. Ultimately, this tribe would work with and for General Bidwell. I was unable to find a tribal prayer, so in the spirit of inclusivity of all cultures, I offer a prayer entitled Great Spirit Prayer by Lakota Chief Yellow Lark, which expresses wisdom for today, 140 years after it was originally given. If you choose, please close your eyes with me. Oh, great. Great Spirit, whose voice I hear in the wind and whose breath gives life to all the world, hear me. I need your strength and wisdom. Let me walk in beauty and make my eyes ever hold the red and purple sunset. Make my hands respect the things you have made and my ears sharp to hear your voice. Make me wise so that I may understand the things you have taught my people, and let me learn the lessons you have hidden in every leaf and rock. Help me remain calm and strong in the face of all that comes towards me. Help me find compassion without empathy overwhelming me. I seek strength not to be greater than my brother, but to fight my greatest enemy, myself. Make me always ready to come to you. I seek strength not to be afraid of the! Let me die for what is great and what is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great is great All right. Madam Clerk, can you do the roll? Okay. Council Member Bennett? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Tandon? Here. Council Member Van Overbeck? Here. Council Member Winslow? Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here. Mayor Coolidge? Present. And now if we can move to our closed session announcement from both the April 4th meeting and April 18th meeting from Attorney Winslow. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. The City Attorney, City Manager, City Clerk, and staff met with the Council in closed session on the listed agenda items. No action was taken and direction was given. That concludes my closed session report. All right. We have a proclamation for Small Business Week. And I was going to say, who do we have meeting me down in front? All right. That's a perfect guy. It's been a long time no see. Absolutely. All right. Well, I'm glad we have our new CEO of the chamber here to accept us and make all the sense of the world. So, City Chief of Proclamation, Small Business Week April 30th, May 6th. Whereas America's progress has been driven by pioneers who think big, take risks, and work hard, and the small business community is at the very core of our nation's identity and prosperity. And whereas small business owners and Main Street businesses have energy and passion for what they do, from the storefront shops that anchor Main Street to the high-tech startups that keep America on the cutting edge, small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the cornerstone of our nation's promise. Whereas we support small businesses where jobs are created and local communities preserve their unique culture. And whereas the President of the United States has proclaimed National Small Business Week every year since 1963 to highlight the programs and services available to entrepreneurs through the U.S. Small Business Administration and other government agencies, and to celebrate and resolve the ingenuity of small businesses, entrepreneurs, and workers in the communities across the country. And whereas the City of Chico supports and joins in this national effort to help America's small businesses do what they do best, grow their businesses, create jobs, and grow their businesses to ensure that our communities remain as vibrant tomorrow as they are today. Now therefore be it resolved on behalf of the City Council that we proclaim April 30th to May 1st through the 6th, 2023 National Small Business Week and urge each individual in the community to patronize the small business shop level and support Chico businesses. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. All right. So everybody knows we've got a very busy agenda. We have a very busy closed session agenda. We're going to take two 15 minute breaks of this meeting of which 10 minutes of it will be dedicated to closed session. And we'll tell you what time we're coming back because we need to make sure that we're move this as efficiently and effectively forward as we possibly can. That being said, we need some time management, so we are going to limit all speakers at this meeting to two minutes on each topic, including business from the floor. And anyone here for Valley's Edge item, please note that the public comment will not be reopened because we took public comment at the April 4th meeting, where 25 speakers addressed the council at that time. So we continued it for deliberation, and we'll have final action later in this meeting. So moving on to the consent agenda, all matters listed on the consent agenda are to be considered routine, and therefore can be enacted by one motion. Are there any council disqualifications or no votes? All right, any speakers? None. All right, entertain a motion. Second. I have a motion from Councilmember Tandon, a second from Vice Mayor Rounds. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck? Yes. Councilmember Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right, business from the floor. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. I'm going to say not already listed on the agenda twice, so we make sure not to talk about any of that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Lisa Currier, followed by Jessica Giannola. Hello, everyone. It's been a long time since I've been up here. Thank you for that moment of silence for Cesar Sandoval. My main reason for coming tonight is that I was nowhere near long enough for a man who helped thousands of people, a man who was an ally to advocates on the street, a man who I didn't always get along with, but we had a love and respect and a kinship that allowed us to work very closely together. other, a man who showed what he stood for and that he stood for his people, that he stood to help the people. He didn't stand against the people. And any time that he had a sweep coming up, such as after the fire, he called me and my team to go before, to ask people to leave the Lowe's parking lot, to leave the Walmart parking lot. We were the first ones over there because he called us and asked us. We went at five in the morning and we went to help him out because he knew that it was harder for somebody in uniform to come than it was for me giving free advice and talking to people and that kind of thing. I also want to address the fact that we offered this city and the county 10 years ago to help with this mental health crisis, my nonprofit of crisis care advocacy and triage. And in the past two weeks, there have been seven people. People who have passed away from mental illness, addiction, or almost two was a client that I got called by a street girl who she called me on a Friday night and I went to meet her at Lindo Channel. They had walked over to Starbucks. I had met with her. There was a man fully in psychosis. No drugs on board, as I could tell. And I'm, you know, all the years I've been out here, I'm quite an expert at this. No alcohol on board, no drugs on board. And he is in jail right now. I saw his arraignment. I saw his arraignment today for stabbing someone in Depot Park. Another gentleman who's a close family friend, we took him all day to get help. He got no help, but he's sitting there for trying to run somebody over in his car. Thank you. Jessica Giannola, followed by Nancy Park. Hi, counsel. Recently, I did see an article in the paper that addressed the, uh, remote access to our meetings. And I saw that there was an issue with Zooms, possibly going down technical issues and postponing needed conversations. I don't recall if it said anything about call-ins, if that's something that we can still do. I'm hoping that the city can consider that for people who are at home that would like to participate and not able to come here. The second item is going to still be with housing. I really, really plead with each of you, no matter what, what our partisan alliance is or anything. Um, our city is so divided that we have this common need. Our common need is we need affordable housing for everyone that lives here. And why, why we need it is because we don't have enough. And when we, when we try to develop it, we've seen how long it takes the partnerships to develop the partnerships within the community, the actual development, the building and from person meeting, the housing to when they actually receive it can take years. So even now as we're developing housing, it's wonderful seeing your dance going up. It's still not enough for our community because we always need to be planning ahead for not just who's here now, but who's going to be here, who needs housing in five years, 10 years. Those are our kids. Those are our parents, our grandparents that are aging out of their current housing and still need affordable housing. So please, please just support who we have. And, um, our area who is dedicated to providing that affordable housing aspect. The need isn't going to go away. It's only going to increase. And since it benefits at all benefits us all, I'm hoping that everyone could be on board to support that. Thank you. Thank you. Nancy Park followed by Nicole Nava. Yeah, I'm speaking tonight because homelessness is not on the agenda and I feel like it's should be on the agenda of every meeting. Again and again, unhoused people are being moved from one place to another. And it's like this endless cycle of cruelty, not to mention the taxpayers expense. We all know that even if every space at the tourist shelter and the pallet shelter is filled, there will still be hundreds of people living in Chico without a roof over their heads. Now that the city is designating an area where people may camp, it's about time that the people living in those areas, were provided with basic human dignity. This includes an ample number of porta potties and plenty of dumpsters and a very frequent schedule of emptying them. While you're at it, why not have North State shelter team provide its portable showers at these sites? And how about some social workers to connect people with services, especially with compassionate programs focusing on behavioral health and addiction issues? Of course, the real answer to homelessness is housing, and that's that's a hard topic for everybody. We need to support people who are ready and willing to construct tiny homes and other housing that will work for people who are extremely low income. This will take a collaborative effort among federal, state and yes, local government. Thank you. Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Steve Deppa. Good evening, Council. Wanted to hop through a few items tonight. One of which I just want to reinforce what I brought up at the last meeting, which is a concern over ethics. I think that everyone should take the time to read over some ethics training and understand that we have clear conflict of interest. There are certain reasons why you need to step out of certain conversations and decision points. I think that's important here on Council and on commissions. Okay, moving forward. I wanted to say thank you to the Council. I got to take the most marvelous. Bike ride and I went and spent some time over by Comanche Creek and I spent some time at Windchime Park and it was so very nice to just feel like I could be in those spaces and have it be a pleasant, calm, yelling free experience where I could basically commune with nature and I could actually hear the water gurgling, which I haven't heard for a long time. So thank you for that experience. I know you're working to get all those other areas addressed and that it is not easy. I am looking forward to having the center open this summer where there will be more beds and they are humane situation and there will be services, which will be fantastic. I also want to give a plug for you guys doing things like leaning into resolutions and other items today. I got to spend time at the Capitol with James Gallagher for the fentanyl crisis and trying to get the Public Safety Committee to even hear information from parents who've lost their children, and trying to get the Public Safety Committee to even hear information from parents who've lost their children, and other things that we could do as solutions. So anything we can do as a council, board of supervisors, other people to lean in and people listening at home, you can call. You need to call the Public Safety Committee and please get them to hear this very important topic. We have hundreds of thousands of people dying across the United States and we have a gross amount here in California dying. It is not okay. So please lean into that if you can. Thank you for your time tonight. Thank you. Our last speaker is Steve Deppo. Thanks, Council, for being here. And I just wanted to compliment the City Tree Crew for, I'm not sure if it's the City Tree Crew or outside contractors, but I see quite a bit of work going on down Bruce Road and things as such that they're trimming trees in advance of issues rather than in distress. And if, I don't know what their schedule is, but California Park could certainly use a little bit of time to do that. I think it's a good idea to give a little bit of work in the area around street lights, excuse me, street lights especially, because as you go through and you see the sycamores through there, they're definitely shaded out by the sycamores that have grown within the city right away. Also, just once again to compliment the City Crews and the amount of debris they've taken out of Comanche Creek, etc. It reminds me of the old adage or rhyme that we spoke of, is, children, you know, that I can't, aunt can't move that rubber tree plant. And the tons and tons of, hundred tons of debris was it pulled out of Comanche Creek. And coming once again full circle to Officer Sandoval and the Target Team. And the reason the Target Team was so successful is they brought so many different agencies in on one scope. So if we could take these people, they could move hundreds of tons, of material into Comanche Creek. Maybe we could get these same people into some program like the work training center used to have, where they take people out in vans and they could collect debris and bring it out of the park rather than take it into the park. And maybe that aunt can move that rubber tree plant. Thank you. That's it. All right. Thank you. All right. We move on to item 4.1, Appeal of Use Permit Application 22, dash 11, Cloud Chaser. And we have a report from Kelly Murphy. So you need to state why? Yeah. I will probably put it in 500 feet of the location. There we go. All right. Give us a minute. Sure. We'll yell at you to get back in here when we're done. All right. Let's do this. Let's do this. Okay. Let's do this. Okay. Let's do this. Okay. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Okay. Let's do this. Okay. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. zoning districts. The city manager's office received a total of 29 applications for storefront retailer businesses. Ultimately, three applicants received a notice of selection from the city manager following the fourth and final review phase and were issued a commercial cannabis business permit in August of 2022. In addition to a commercial cannabis business permit, storefront retailer uses are subject to a use permit to evaluate site-specific features associated with the proposed use, including consistency with the city's zoning regulations, parking requirements, and general development standards. The project went before the Planning Commission on March 2nd for a decision on use permit 22-11. However, the Planning Commission deadlocked on motions to approve, continue, or deny the project. The applicant filed an appeal to the city council seeking a final action on their use permit request tonight. The project site is designated commercial mixed use on the city's general plan land use diagram and zoned CC community commercial. A commercial cannabis storefront retailer use may be established in the CC zoning district subject to use permit approval. The proposed storefront retailer would be located in a portion of an existing 11,000 square foot building at 1408 Park Avenue, historically the Holbrooks Furniture Site. The applicant proposes to provide 11,000 square foot building on the site on the site with additional 23 spaces provided across the street at 1405 Park Avenue. The Planning Commission staff report provides a complete project background and analysis and has been included as attachment 3 to the staff report. This is a brief slide just showing a street view perspective of the two corner parcel locations involved in the project site. The appeal primarily contends the project is consistent with the project's development standards. The project has been processed and is in compliance with the municipal code and all required use permit findings for consistency with the city's land use regulations, development standards and general plan policy is have been made. Furthermore the project is already obtained their commercial cannabis business permit from the city manager's office, which included a comprehensive review by the city manager, community development director and police Chief. Therefore, staff's recommendation to approve the project remains unchanged. That does conclude the report from staff tonight. I can take any questions now or turn it over to the applicant appellant. Questions? Mr. Wenzel. One of the issues brought up at the Planning Commission meeting was, and by residents including a neighbor and some recent correspondence with the council, is that Show Love Thrift is a neighborhood serving retail establishment and it's being proposed to be demolished to serve a parking requirement that the city is placing upon this business. We have, the city has a policy in the land use element, excuse me, there's an action under policy in land use element to incentivize higher density development, more intensive development on the land use element. The opportunity sites include Park Avenue and one of the actions under that is to maintain flexible parking standards and did staff consider that this might be a good opportunity to maintain flexible parking standards in order to not incentivize destruction of a neighborhood serving retail establishment? Excuse me, I'll just add, that action was implemented in the Municipal Code so there is flexibility that's been incorporated into the Municipal Code and provides that flexibility that can be used at the, you know, at the whim or the desire of the applicant and this is a case, what is proceeding is what the applicant is proposing. It's their desire to have this parking, which ultimately does meet our standards though. The code requires that the parking be maintained for a certain quantity of time. Is that correct? They have to have a long-term lease on the parking? In order to have off street? Yeah, the parking, the city has parking requirements, requires that the applicant have a, which, because there's both the property owner here owns the land and then there's also the business. The business being the applicant or being the cannabis dispensary is required to have a parking minimum, they're required to have that lease on that. Offsite for offsite parking? For long term, like ten to fifteen years, I think, something like that. I'm not sure, but sure, what is your point? I'm concerned that while we might not have a request for parking reduction, there is A, there is an interest in the the neighborhood and I think it's vetted by the Southwest Chico Neighborhood Plan, to not be pursuing requiring demolition of like currently active establishments to satisfy parking requirements but but the the business itself would want could want at a certain point to not continue to rent the parking spaces across the street because they might find they're not necessary we are requiring parking based on commercial square footage but a command of the Canada dispenser is not like a Walmart or convenience store there's only one thing you go in there for it also is in a relatively high density neighborhood that I think would get a good quantity of bicycle and pedestrian traffic so if they were to find that the parking is not necessary they would be stuck in a 10 to 15 year lease per city requirements which is why I recommend waiving that requirement so they have the option in the future to opt out of renting that and should it not be found necessary for them are you seeking any further comments from staff I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I think I have one question I think that's up for me thank you Vice Mayor Owens I guess maybe can I get clarification then because I didn't watch the planning commission I'm sorry is the parking there because the city is demanding that they put it there or did the applicant just choose to have parking and that's part of their plan you can get clarification from the applicant but ultimately early on in the process as applicants proceeded through the city manager's process Some of the things that we highlighted that were critical and important were provision of parking not impacting neighborhoods. So this is what they brought forward as part of their proposal. There's also staff's understanding there are multiple building code violations on the existing Show Love Thrift Store, and that demolition would have to happen regardless of this project in the future. They are relocating, though, to another location. I did see that. We have that in our packet. So thank you. I appreciate that. All right. Further questions from Council? No. All right. Seeing none, thank you. I didn't take the opportunity to do this, but I will at the beginning of this hearing. So if you have signs, you're welcome to hold them up, but at the back of the room, please, just as long as you're not blocking anyone's view. Council members, I'm going to ask you to limit not your question time, but your comment time to also two minutes to be in concurrent with the public. And then no cheering or booing because we do not want to, regardless of the item, because we do not want to. And I don't want to be puning upon anyone's right to free speech in the meeting. So if we could make sure that we see fit that all those things are done, I'd appreciate it. And then just so you know, we will move to the announcement of ex parte communications at this time in this appeal process. So any ex parte communications? I just have a quick question. The cheering and booing comments, is that for the audience or for the Council members? It's for both. Thank you. Thank you for the clarification. Just for now. Yes. It is. It's a request. So any ex parte communications? I did have a short conversation with Mr. Breckenridge. He spoke and I listened to him. Anyone else? I did speak with the principals of it and worked at the plans on it way early on, probably a year ago. That did remind me. I also did speak with Mr. Breckenridge about partner requirements before the plan commission for the item. All right. Anyone else? No? Okay great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great I am applicant for the project. I will kind of buzz through the presentation that we made at the commission meeting. Clearly, this is no longer a question about cannabis. This is a question about parking. That was the concern at the commission meeting. As has been touched, this will be a great project incorporating some adaptive reuse for the west side of Park Avenue. On the east side of Park Avenue, as it was mentioned by staff, there's an existing building with numerous code violations. We have ADA concerns. There's actually other health concerns with mold. The tenant is moving on, and they will be demolishing the building one way or the other. One point I'd like to make with regards to the site plan is that there is currently no on-street parking on Park Avenue as a component of the rework. There were some older pictures that were cited where there were some cars shown on Park Avenue. That's no longer the case. I just want to make sure that that's clear. This was a floor plan that we provided for use with commission. There weren't really any questions about that. Exterior elevations. Finally, a fairly significant beautification component of the west side building, the old Holbrooks building. Finally, the area of concern. Parking. The question is, did the applicant require this or request this or was this something that came to staff? In all honesty, it's a component of Title 19. Our job in terms of the presentation of this project is to present a project that is compliant with the land use regulations. Working through, there is an opportunity for us to request a reduction in off-street parking on Park Avenue. This is a non-site parking. There's already been some granting of that with an apartment complex that's immediately adjacent. Really, that would have hurt the prospects of this project getting its license. We proposed to provide this parking space across the way. It provides landscaping and shading in excess of the requirements of Title 19. It also provides an opportunity for additional businesses to participate in this. Honestly, the general plan does not get rid of parking requirements. We need to have parking. Parking is constrained along Park Avenue. As we want to develop Park Avenue, we need to provide opportunities for other businesses to partake in that. That's definitely a component of what we're proposing with this off-street parking. Again, I guess in summary, my comments would be that, again, this is no longer an issue with cannabis. We're here to talk about trying to have a process that's clear and transparent for pioneers of business. As we heard earlier today, we don't want to have businesses come into Chico with a set of rules that's defined clearly in our land use regulations and then a different set of policy coming through. We can't reinvent the wheel as we come before commissions or ARBs. We designed the rules that are there. We worked with staff in order to accomplish those goals. We would expect that if they're compliant with those, that we would be approved and move forward. That's our respectful request. I'm here for questions if you have any. All right. Questions? Yes. The building is 11,000 square feet. The building is 11,000 square feet. The dispensary is 6,000 square feet. Therefore, there is 5,000 square feet that would be future development, future retail use. So eventually, there will be a need for more parking to satisfy that retail use if, in fact, it is retail. It could be something else. In order to comply with the codes, there would need to be additional parking. Absolutely. 100%. And I should have brought that point up. We don't know what that additional space is going to be used for, whether it's retail, office space. All of those uses have a requirement for Title 19 to park. And without knowing what they are, our spare spaces on the side opposite the street would accommodate those future uses. Okay. So the building owner then may have some challenges in the future as he decides, he or she decides to develop the property. At this point, Council Member Bennett, we don't see any challenges because we are over-parked on the parcel. We have additional spaces available on the parcel across the way. Thank you. All right. Further? Mr. Gowdy, are you here representing Cloud Chaser, the cannabis dispensary, or the property? The Cloud Chasers. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. Now additional speakers. Two minutes is shot. How many have we got? We have nine. And I have one additional person who had asked for an ADA accommodation and they called late this afternoon. And so I offered to read their letter into the record at the end. Okay. Sounds good. So we have two additional speakers. And again, if you could both line up in the middle aisle and be ready. Thomas Hubbard followed by Sue Ellen Rawlinson. So again, if your name was called second, just line up in the aisle. Go ahead. Yes. Behind the original speaker. If you were the first speaker, we'll have you go ahead and address us. So are you Thomas Hubbard? I am. Come on down. And then who was the second? The second one was Sue Ellen Rawlinson. All right. So if you just want to be in the aisle waiting to go. We're just trying to minimize the time in between. Okay. I'm the owner of 1421 Park Avenue, which is next door to the building this proposal will demolish and replace with a parking lot. That building comes right up to the property line with zero offset. There is no way that it can be demolished safely from the inside only. Of necessity, workers will need access to my property and the demolition will create noise, dust, and debris, possibly including asbestos, that will impact residential tenants living scarcely 10 feet away. The proposed parking lot will create further problems of constant noise, lack of privacy, and invasion by loitering transients after hours. Unit 110 is occupied by an elderly couple. One of whom is a senior resident. One of whom is close to the end of his life and in need of frequent medical transport, not to mention peace and quiet. Unit 120 is occupied by a family of four with small children and dogs. Neither the developer nor the planning commission's report took into account the serious negative impacts this demolition and parking lot will have on my property and tenants. The applicant should have contacted me months ago to work out the details. But I've heard nothing from him. I've heard nothing from him until this morning and even then received only the vaguest promises. My understanding is that the applicant is not the owner of the property and does not yet even have a general contractor with whom I can discuss the demolition. A specific strategy and legal agreement for mitigating the many negative impacts of this project on the people who live there must be in place before it is approved. I request the City Council table approval of this project until that has been provided. The meeting is foe the developer, property owner and general contractor. project for the dispensary. I'm looking forward to seeing Park Avenue develop in a nice, beautiful way that would be an entryway to downtown. I don't see a parking lot as a part of that plan. When I found out about this, I visited both the Holbrook and the Show Love thrift shop and met with them and got some information out of them. Both said they had to vacate the property within 30 days. I'm concerned about having a parking lot across the street from the main business. There is a signal there, but it's hazardous. If you've been up and down that part of Park Avenue, you're moving quickly, and I don't see... At first, I was also told that there was going to be a restaurant along with a dispensary. So I thought, hmm, how are we going to have a restaurant and all these people coming out and not being able to find a parking spot? Next to the dispensary building. But they would have to manage to get across the street. So what I've seen, I've seen that lovely parking lot that was up there on the slides tonight, but it doesn't always come out that way. You have to make sure that you have that 50% shade cover within whatever it is, 35 years or something. So think about that. Parking is not the way to go. Again, we'd like to see mixed use. And throughout that area, we're going to have a couple new... This project that's going in by Jubilee Group, which is across the street from the senior housing. It's about 16th Street. So anyhow, we need to value that whole line of Park Avenue and think about how we want it to look ongoing. So please think about no parking. Thank you. Jared Geiser, followed by Rebecca Geiser. Good evening, Council. Good evening, staff. As the staff report mentioned, this is an opportunity site. In fact, it's a corridor opportunity site. And so that means that the general plan identified this as a good place for Chico to grow, for redevelopment to occur. And so destroying a commercial mixed use, destroying a building that's known as commercial mixed use for a parking lot does not seem to fall in line with the opportunity site's goals of increasing higher density housing on these opportunity sites. And mixing the uses of land, commercial and residential. And so I want to read a quick statement from Appendix B of the general plan, Park Avenue opportunity site. And so it says, Park Avenue has long been considered an opportunity for redevelopment and is emphasized prominently in the Southwest Chico neighborhood plan. Located immediately south of downtown and served by transit, this opportunity site could accommodate higher density and intensity development. The Barber neighborhood to the west and the Chapman-Mulberry neighborhood to the east contain residents who would benefit from added neighborhood oriented commercial uses. Neighborhood oriented commercial uses. I'll repeat. At Park Avenue's intersection and 16th Street, a mixed use neighborhood core is envisioned to anchor the opportunity site with neighboring serving businesses accompanied by residences, offices, and to serve as a gateway to the Barber yard special planning area. This is a big piece of land along Park Avenue from approximately 22nd Street to Little Chico Creek. This is where we need to see smart growth development. This is where we need to see housing built on top of commercial areas. This is where we can actually comply with our smart growth intentions let out in the general plan. And so I think it would be a disservice to the community of Chico to occupy such prime real estate with a large parking lot. Let's build housing there. Let's build commercial there. Let's build them both on top of each other. It's commercial mixed use. And so I ask you to remove parking requirements from this and from all other developments in the opportunity sites. Thank you. Thank you. Rebecca Geiser followed by Elizabeth Devereaux. I'll wait for my time. Okay. Okay. Elizabeth Devereaux. Followed by Tim Dodd. Good evening. I think Jared actually said a lot of the things that I feel and that we spoke about and put in the general plan in 1994. And that is that this is a prime area for smart growth. And to see a parking lot and even a one-story building in an area which could actually be a lot of the city's most important commercial area is really to help with mixed use housing and wide sidewalks, tree canopies. This is a vision we've had for a long time. But it hasn't been begun, you know, the starting point of it. And I feel like I talked to BCAG, showed them the vision that we had for it way back in 1994, which is still valid. And he said the city has to move first. They have to put in the infrastructure. Then the developers do the mixed use housing. And then we have the shuttle buses that we're thinking of small electric shuttle buses with short headways. Now, Diamond Match or Barber Yard is another incentive. It's coming. And I'm pretty sure it is anyway. And I feel like the intersection of Diamond Match and Park Avenue could be really dynamic. And it could fulfill our need for affordable housing and for a lot of energy and safety and community along Park Avenue. So I'm hoping that, you know, if you choose to agree with the cannabis facility, not the parking. The parking is a wasted use of really valuable space for mixed use housing. So but I think the first thing is getting the infrastructure in. And then you wouldn't want You wouldn't need the same kind of parking requirements if you had more walkability and if you had your small transit. That's fine. Thank you. Tim Dodd followed by Steve Depper. Good evening. My name is Tim Dodd. I'm the CEO and co-founder of Sweet Flower Chico. I'm actually here tonight in support of our competitor. So first off, Chico did a great job. Cannabis licensing is very, very hard to do. I think the city staff did a fantastic job with this entire process. Sweet Flower is very proudly locally owned and we have 100% local hiring commitment. So since we started business in December of last year, we projected about 25 local employees at open. We're now today at 53 local employees, 100% hiring commitment locally. And we probably need another 15. So we are really having a great business in Chico. So I want to thank the city. And we're very supportive of legal cannabis in the city. So I'm supportive of legal cannabis. I'm supportive of the city of Chico. We're supportive of the city of Chico. We're supportive of Cloud Chaser. Speaking from some experience, a lot of this seems to be about parking. We have a lot of other locations in the city of Los Angeles and elsewhere in Pasadena and Cobble City that are very congested cities. And we've been able to work with those cities on alternative transportation mechanisms and other parking requirements to get around having to knock down a building. I'm not coming in here from out of town, telling you guys what you should do. I'm just suggesting that there are probably ways to work around some of these parking requirements because we are, as a cannabis dispensary, a very, very short stay. People come in very quickly for about seven to 10 minutes. We have a high volume. We want to get people served, but we don't want to have people sticking around and having kind of negative wait time. So it's a traditional retail experience with heavy volume that we can accommodate with actually a very limited amount of parking and from experience in operating multiple stores. So to close again, I would urge you respectfully to grant the appeal in favor of Cloud Chaser. I do think that legal cannabis is an economic enabler for all, including the city and its local residents, and we're here to support Chico. So thank you. Thank you. Steve Depa followed by Ciceri Sherry. I was interested in the pictures by RGA and Associates. And essentially, I think both uses that are currently at these properties are nothing better than a yard sale type quality when you go by there on a regular basis. And aside from the just general code violations that they spoke of in the building, if you've checked the building file on this property, they repeatedly have been in violation of outdoor retail property, et cetera, et cetera, couches. It's, we're penalizing Chico students for having couches on their porch. And these have couches on the sidewalk, they have furniture on the sidewalk, and it, the city just recently spent millions of dollars repaving and restriping and redoing Park Avenue, which did take away significant parking up and down Park Avenue. So all the businesses involved up and down Park Avenue have been hit by the lack of parking. And a business like this that is spending significant money to create gateway vision, of what Park Avenue could be, I really think is quite amazing that they're willing to invest in this area. If you wanna see a vision of what they're talking about with multi-story housing, all you have to do is go two blocks down and stand in the shadow of the property that is being built that's four stories tall on Park Avenue right now and 12th Street. So there is multi-story property going in, yet, and the property could absorb it unless the gentleman that spoke of his tenants was willing to sell that property to expand it to build a four-story property. But it doesn't sound like that's his goal either. So thank you for your consideration. Thank you for all the work you're doing on Park Avenue. And I do support this project. Thank you. Thank you. Ciceri Sherry, followed by Adam Fadela. Hello, Council. Thank you very much. My name is Ciceri Sherry. I attended the Planning Commission meeting, I attended the Planning Commission meeting, and I was asked to speak to the for this, that this item was considered at. And at that point, I came out against it. I am a resident of the neighborhood and I really do love show love thrift. I bought furniture and clothing from there and donated to them. And I walk past them every day between my house and the bus stop. So, but I was under the impression at that point that they were being demolished unnecessarily, when that's clearly not the case. when that's clearly not the case. If there are code violations. So I'm going to have to break with my usual compatriots and encourage you to approve this. More growth does require some parking. I envision a low car future, but I also know that we're not there yet. Also as a daily transit user, I can tell you that the bus service available on Park Avenue is not yet adequate. It's we're looking at 20 to 40 minutes between buses, not 10 to 15. I would encourage you to fix that, please. My daily life would improve. But until then we are going to need parking. I think a reasonable compromise would be to make that parking lot available to all businesses in the area. So we do want more businesses to come in. All of those businesses will need parking. If Cloud Chaser finds that their parking is not necessary, maybe they can offer us a parking permit. Maybe they can offer that parking to other businesses as well. I'd like to see that sort of policy as part of a long-term parking plan for Park Avenue. This is clearly a long-term conversation that we need to have. But ultimately at the end of the day, I think this business is a general step in the right direction. And I would encourage you all to approve it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Adam Fideli. Good evening. Mayor Coolidge, members of council, thank you all very much for serving. I'm going to take a little bit of a different tack on this. I'm a long-term resident of the neighborhood. I finished my house in 1997. I've been involved with the planning process for the South Southwest Chico neighborhood plan since 2005. And in my personal opinion, speaking now professionally as a 23-year realtor here in town, demolishing that building for a parking lot is not the highest and best use of that property. Highest and best use is provide some more housing and perhaps commercial on the first floor. Just my opinion. But I would strongly encourage you all to waive parking requirements and get more creative. Perhaps re-establish the street parking in that area of Park Avenue. I think that was mentioned at Planning Commission. There's ways around this. It doesn't matter. The site already has parking on it from its grocery store days. A lot of people walk, a lot of people bike, as Mr. Winslow kind of pointed out. I think you can work around this and still prove the dispensary. Have no problem with the dispensary. You know, that's a welcome addition, I think. So those are my thoughts. If none of that is possible, I would encourage you to increase the streetlight time to give people enough time to cross Park Avenue, Park Avenue is dangerous right now. You can't get all the way across walking at a normal pace. I know this from personal experience, you have to run at the end. So if nothing else, we should do that. Thanks very much. Thank you. And then, Council, I have the one to read into the record. This is from Sylvia Polite. And I am writing this email on behalf of my husband, Kenneth Gerald Polite, who is a wartime Vietnam disabled veteran in a special mode of transportation. We are a tenant right next to the show, and we are going to be doing a lot of work on that. Thank you. I live in the Park Avenue, Chico, California. The project applicant cannot demolish the building at 1405 Park Avenue, Chico, without creating a hazard for my husband and me. There is no offset. The building is right up to the property line, and I have a yard and a garden which would be negatively impacted by the debris and activity of the demolition. It is not safe to demolish that building without moving tenants. My husband cannot be moved because he is in a medical bed at home healthcare. My husband cannot come to the meeting in person as he is disabled and medically fragile. And that was, those were her comments. All right. Thank you, everyone. All right. At this time, we will go back to the applicant with a two-minute rebuttal period, if you would like it, to address any of those items. Thank you, and we do appreciate all the comments that have come through. I think there are areas, obviously, with safety that there's no margin for error. I would say that those portions are components of the, of the construction document and permitting phase, not necessarily the use permitting phase. So as we demolish this building, we have, we do have a local contractor. Joe Holt's going to be doing the work. So that statement was in there, and Joe has assured us that those areas are not going to be done with a large wrecking ball. In fact, no areas are going to be done with a wrecking ball. So these envisions of, you know, terrible things happening aren't going to be the case. This is going to be, especially along property lines, it's going to be hand, hand removed. And taken down. So I would like to make sure that, you know, these visions of large demolition problems are not going to be the case. The other comments about this being an amazing opportunity site, I agree. Park Avenue, and I own property on Park Avenue. I think that there's a lot of opportunity on Park Avenue. If this was the last piece of property available on Park Avenue, I'd have much different opinion about how we're proceeding here. But there is a lot of vacancy and opportunity at multiple properties. The great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great parking there's other opportunities for that site but I think at this point in time providing that site for parking that we we know we're still going to be using vehicles at this location provide that for additional businesses to help other businesses grow is going to be the best first step for this region and let's let's hope and encourage that some of the other visions that we have for this area occur at other opportunity sites along the area that are still vacant thank you all right thank you very much and with that we'll close the public hearing and entertain a motion by the! what the property owner determines is best for them
