I'm going to start with a pledge of allegiance to the flag. If you could rise and join me in the salute to the flag. Salute and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll? Council Member Huber? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Ori? Here. Council Member Reynolds? Here. Council Member Stone? Here. Vice Mayor Brown? Here. Mayor Schwab? Here. Thank you. I want to remind... remind everyone that this meeting is being conducted in accordance with executive order N-2920, which allows us to meet without direct public participation. We hope that we can open our doors soon, but we want to make sure that it doesn't endanger anyone's health.

Public comment will also be accepted by email and can be sent to publiccomments at chicoc.gov during the meeting and prior to the close of the public comment on an item. The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email. Last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, last night, Mr. Huber? Thank you very much. My main objective in bringing this back was to assure that we were able to loan the money to the Butte County or the Butte Choice Energy project. That ended up being included in the budget last night, but I'm going to leave it to the city manager to provide us with thoughts on the remaining items and then possibly ask the council to take those items individually. Sure. Happy to help on that front. There's only one lingering item, and that is the BMX relocation. And so obviously I already pled my case a while back, so I'm not going to do that again. But what I will do is give you an update as to that status so at least council understands. And if there is an interest in seeing staff bring that back at a future time, then let's do that. Mr. Ottoboni, if you would be so kind to kind of give a status update on that. Yeah. Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council! Council done it essentially below cost even, so very minimal cost. Right now we have just cleared our environmental phase of the project. We're working on our final environmental permitting and mitigation costs. So the requested amount was to cover the remaining environmental mitigation fees associated with our 404 permit for some storm drainage aspects of the project, as well as the long lead gates that were associated with the project that are needed in order for the BMX. They're very specific, unique gates. I don't know how familiar you are, but they're the start gates, and so those are fabricated overseas. And so we're trying to purchase those to help expedite the delivery of the project and make that move happen. So those were the components of the project that we were requesting this funding for. So I'm available for any questions. I know part of the reason that this was so important was it was a domino in a series of things that was going to lead us to be able to use that property for either some form of homeless shelter or homeless encampment. Is that still part, you know, that situation has been so fluid with all the changes of where things are happening, where the Jesus Center Renewal Center is happening. Things with the Torah shelter, things that we're working on in terms of COVID shelter. Where are we at with that? Yeah, so all of those components are still being worked on. Obviously, the primary component of that was the Jesus Center Renewal Center. Well, now that domino has been taken out of that chain, right? So now what we have is we're evaluating a potential project with CHAT, and we're in conversations with them on looking at that. However, it would be very minor in nature, and it would be basically... sub-leasing a component of the current lease with BMX. The key partner in this is the BMX. And so in order to get them relocated then, the envisioning of what could happen there really can take place. And, you know, now that the Renewal Center has relocated to another spot, council's able and willing to envision to greater degrees if the BMX are relocated. And so that was the initiative behind it. The total cost that we were assuming would be, uh, needed would be about 600,000 in total in city investment. Um, and uh, so the initial 100,000 is what we are requesting in this immediate piece. Um, what we can do based upon what I got in feedback from the council previously, um, we kind of set this a little bit further back, but as you can tell, it's still proceeding and there are still going to be costs associated. And so what we're hopefully going to be able to do is once we get past this next benchmark of environmental, uh, if there is a supplemental necessary, um, if there is a supplemental necessary, um, if there is a supplemental necessary, we'll just bring that supplemental before council and not ask for the whole allotment at this time, realizing that this is kind of one of those pieces that the council, in their conscious effort to try to avoid spending too much capital at this time, that we can just take it piece by piece if that's council's desire. I do appreciate you desiring to come back to get even more depth to it. And I do think it's still a worthy project because, candidly, it's one of the few parcels that we own that's developable. And so if the BMX are relocated, then we can imagine a lot of wonderful things that can occur on there. So it sounds like by doing this, we open up an option for us that we don't have otherwise. Absolutely. Okay. Yeah. So in that case, I'd like to make a motion to take that one item out of what was originally the budget allocations that were before us, about five different items. And. Change my ask. Change my vote on that and ask that the council vote on that one allocation of $100,000 to the BMX relocation project. That's a motion. Did we have public comment on this? Oh, sorry. Oh, very. I'm sorry. I was jumping ahead. So there's no public comment on this particular item. because it is solely to understand if we are going to be putting this on a future agenda. Correct? No. Correct me, please. It wasn't what we put on the agenda for a cluster consideration. In order to hear the item, we have to reconsider, re-vote, and then hear the item. That's my understanding, but if I'm missing something, I'll be on. That's my understanding as well. Okay. So I have a motion. Do we have a second? I will second it. Okay. Can I have a roll call vote, please? You know why I am seconding it? I think that this project, because this parcel of land, we've invested quite a bit in it already as far as moving forward, because we saw some value in it. And so... I think this investment allows us some options. I'd like to speak to it just a little bit more. You know, over the last few months, we've seen the quandary of trying to come up with locations that we can use, and there seems to be roadblocks for everyone, and this seems like one piece of property that a lot of that vetting has... already been done. And it could serve as one of the types of locations that we might be able to jump on, rather than have to go through this six-month-year process to be able to put something together and find a piece of property that's suitable. So that's why I think it's a good investment. Okay. And this is just for the reconsideration, correct? Yes. And... Yes. Well, I think what I'm reading this is that at our May 5th meeting, we approved a request from Councilmember Huber to reconsider his vote. And... And now he's reconsidering it. And now he's reconsidering it and has made a proposal to us to fund the city manager's... recommendation of $100,000 at this point, correct? That's correct. Okay. Thank you. I just want to make sure I had it right. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? No. Councilmember Ory? No. Councilmember Reynolds? No. Councilmember Stone? Nay. Vice Mayor Brown? No. Mayor Schwab? Aye. It fails two to five. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next on the agenda is a verbal update on the pandemic response related to businesses. A report from Assistant City Manager Constantine. Yes. As Council knows, there's four buckets that the City Council is allowing staff to be able to manage over this COVID-19 situation. Continuity of essential city services, protecting vulnerable populations, management of public spaces, and finally mitigating impacts to businesses and jobs. Chris has done an amazing job at managing that bucket and I just want to thank him for that. He's going to give an update of what's going on in that sector. So take it away, Chris. Thank you. First with any endeavor as large as dealing with a pandemic and impacts across all our businesses, it's never one person that can come together and create an environment to assist. It's always a team. And in our team, we're using our Team Chico as a center point for that which includes the business community, both the Chamber of Commerce and the downtown Chico Business Association, our Alliance for Workforce Development which is our workforce development partner, Butte College and Chico State. And we're using both the training place and the sponsor's office. Business Development Center from Duke College and Three Corps which is our Financial Community Development Bank as well as a number of other business and other entities that are not part of our Team Chico partnership but have come together to assist businesses get through the pandemic. Let me start a little bit with the timeline and what we're going to do is build into two proposals we'd like to run by the council to assist some of our businesses with a focus in the downtown who is facing not just a pandemic but also facing the impact of the scheduled change of Chico State. From March 4th to 13th we saw the state, county and the U.S. declare emergencies due to the pandemic and that came forth to a stay-at-home order on the 19th by the governor and our city issued their local emergency order on March 25th. Fast forward to April 14th and where California under the state of California is now in a state of emergency. The state of California unveiled what they ended up six indicators that they were going to look to to determine when we can modify that stay-at-home order and then three days later they created a task force of business recovery to focus on what kind of measures need to be put into place for these businesses to be able to open up with modifications in the word of the governor to be able to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus because the virus just doesn't go away it continues we're just trying to get businesses back open and minimize the spread. The state authorized the reopening of stage two and what we saw the next day through as late as this week different business classifications being allowed to open starting from the office retail manufacturing sector and now looking towards more of the large scale venues with still the very close personal touch businesses massage parlors nail salons large scale events with large number of people in close proximity. Though the majority of the offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline offline! During the whole pandemic we reported to use mobility data reported via Google has to see what kind of movement we're seeing in our communities the letters are retail sector seen would be seen with people in residential areas they're homes would be seen the parts transit areas. We were very thankful that the council approved a purchase of a software subscription which was intended to assist us in doing financial projections to better know what the sales tax impact was going to be to the city. But the secondary effect of that was to allow us to look at more granular level cell phone data on mobility. So this is what you're seeing before you right now is a citywide indicator of that mobility data. It's not the Google data we were presenting to you before, but it's actually the software that we now have access to. And what you can see from the beginning of 2017, and I'm sorry for the very small print, so I'll use the pointer, a January pre-campfire trend. And then the 2018 with the campfire impact. And then we'll leave it at that. And then we'll leave it at that. And then we'll leave it at that. And then we'll leave it at that. And then we'll leave it at that. And then we'll leave it at that. And then you see 200,000. That actually is now meaningful. That change is a true percentage you can rely upon. It follows more of the median, not the outsides of the bounds of the statistical distribution. And so what we can see here, we were hovering at around 400,000 and slowly coming up to almost 500,000 here in the early part of 2020. Which would have shown a lot of movement of folks coming into and moving around in Chico. And when the stay-at-home order went into place right about here, we saw a drop to about 163,651, which is pretty significant. The data set we had was in preparation for our June 2nd meeting. So the data you see here goes to about the end of May, May 30th. And so the latest data I saw increases from now what we see is 313,000. We're increasing even more. The goal being. And when we see us getting closer to what we normally see, then we're seeing a normal level of activity on the streets. If you follow the data with your perception of how many cars were on the road and the level of activity, they correlate. And so we, at the beginning of the pandemic, spent a lot of time going, driving around, doing assessments of open businesses. How many people are there? What kind of movement are we seeing? What's the traffic looking like? And we've now seen a very steady increase in that. And it almost looks like. Things are back to normal. Almost. But we can still see that we are about 25% off from where we normally should be a little more than 25%. In terms of our team Chico partnership, there is far more that our folks were doing than what is written here. But for brevity, we listed some of the key points. We knew at the beginning of the pandemic and we saw the run on hand sanitizer. We saw a run on toilet paper. And we knew because of what we were seeing overseas in China, a run on masks. So we very quickly worked the Chamber of Commerce and us, the city, to identify a producer of hand sanitizer to reach out, to sit down, work with them and see if they were willing to do so. And that turned out to be Almendra Winery, who very quickly transitioned to producing this sanitizer in hundreds of gallons. And they've continued to produce it. And you talk to people about, where did you get that hand sanitizer? And they're like, oh, we got it over there. You go to Starbucks, I'm sorry, Barnes and Noble, and you use their pump and it's like, oh, this looks like Almendra. Where did you get this? It was Almendra. And for them, Almendra was instrumental in getting them to open as soon as they did because they couldn't find hand sanitizer before they were opening. 5th Sun was very proactive. They had already started moving to create masks when we approached them. And so they upped the production of what they were producing. So they picked up the seeds and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them up and picked them businesses to open, that there will be protection measures that are required of those businesses. For ones that were closed and for ones that were open, the virus just doesn't stop at the door because you were called essential. We knew that in order to ensure that the level of the virus stayed low, that our local businesses that were essential needed to implement protective measures. So we designed a template premised on San Diego County's public health department and went around with code enforcement to businesses and provided that template to our open businesses to say, please put these measures in place. And to our closed businesses, consider preparing to put these measures in place for the day that we open so that you're not allowed to open and now spending a week or two trying to find those materials so you can open right away. We are now utilizing code enforcement on two fronts. One, a reactive complaint front for businesses that are either not complying with the required measures. We are now using the protective measures to be able to stay open on a modified basis or those that should not be closed and educating those businesses on what's currently in place with the goal of ensuring that we keep a very high level of compliance in the protective measures. And we, throughout the entire pandemic, have been assisting businesses in making referrals to the different programs, predominantly from the Small Business Administration and directing referrals to the Small Business Development Center to get those businesses connected to the resources to make them successful. And on the next slide, you'll see what we're doing. We repeat that. This is what we did as a city, so did our partners continue doing that same effort. The city specifically waived its parking fees and allowed the designation of parking downtown in front of businesses that were doing takeout food delivery to allow folks to come park, receive their food, and be able to leave to allow some level of activity to occur in the downtown. And we waived all credit card fees for online payments so that we can push the manual transactions. So just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just but we made at least over 700 business contacts for different programs and assistance between all our different partners in fact it i don't want to say it's a thousand individual businesses but the level of contacts that i had with with a phone going directly to my cell phone seven days a week were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of businesses and it would be at least at times a hundred a day asking questions from as basic as what does the order say to this is what i need what do i need to do to what is the ppp and what is it going to do for me three core our economic development community development bank has created a small business disaster interruption loan program they received these funds years ago from the u.s economic development administration they currently have approximately 2.9 to 3 million dollars in funds for the ppp and the ppp and the ppp and the ppp and the ppp and million dollars in that loan and they make loans between 10 and 100 000 with a rate of prime plus one percent we will talk later about one of the two proposals that directly is connected to this loan program and where the city can be instrumental in expanding the businesses that could qualify for these loan programs that currently would not qualify three core also received is applying for a grant from eda to provide staff resources to assist small businesses in a comprehensive manner so then we will have three core the small business development center and the team chico being available to assist any business not just on pandemic level activity but on any activity in terms of responding to businesses critical needs we saw our workforce development partners amy velasquez and the alliance for workforce development provide direct engagement for employees that were laid off furloughed or terminated for a period of time they work with at the time we made this report 130 businesses they very quickly respond once they receive information or see that a business is being impacted and they proactively then reach out more than 510 individuals with assistance with unemployment insurance or the pandemic unemployment assistance program and i must say with the level of unemployment spiking as fast as they did it completely inundated the unemployment insurance programs that both the the state level and it was very very difficult for businesses some businesses didn't see unemployment checks for their employees for more than a month from the time they actually apply in some cases when folks applied they couldn't get into the system for three to four days just to be able to make an application so we know that the impact to our businesses and our community members that work at those businesses is not just short term it's short term long term acute and steady and it will continue until we're completely passed this our partners placed 47 adult dislocated individuals and 37 individuals in cal works and 12 disadvantaged youth in long-term career placements the city of chico is one of those locations our parks division that would be the recipients of those individuals and these would be fully paid individuals to provide a service as an enhancement on something pandemic related more sanitation and public facilities things of that nature and butte college's training place to develop 39 courses and offer almost 100 webinars to more than a thousand individuals on how to deal in an environment of telecommuting and the stress associated with a complete change in your work environment so what are our next steps we're going to continue our education effort because there needs to be a resource businesses can reach out to that are local and not a state or federal heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart What you did not hear from the president is, what is the economic multiplier effect of that money in our community? And it's more than 1.0. In certain aspects of expenses, a dollar spent by the university equals 2.25 of a multiplier. In other cases, it adds 0.5 or 50 cents for every dollar in tertiary economic impact somewhere else. And when you take that holistically, and you heard it in the council discuss this, it's a tremendous ripple effect across the community. And especially in the downtown, that when you look at mobility data, there's a tremendous amount of activity in the downtown that comes from that student base. We know that downtown is going to see an excessively increased level of impact. So what we want to offer are two proposals to the council to determine whether these make sense, whether you have ideas, or concerns, or suggestions around these programs, and to see what we can do to focus both on the downtown and citywide. One is an expanded downtown road closure, and the second one is to support three corps' ability to expand criteria of who can get loans through their emergency interruption disaster program. Mr. Constantine, before you continue with the downtown, I'm going to recuse myself, since you are going to be asking for direction, if we should go down. So let me clarify. We were going to ask for, on the first one we're asking for input. There is no council action required. There's a franchise agreement the council had approved for the downtown that allows for certain events. It also allows for three extra events. So therefore, there's no action that will be before the council as it relates to this. What we want is just input from the council at this point. So I don't believe, unless the city attorney believes otherwise, a recusal is necessary. Okay, very good. So downtown, when we look at the downtown, we've been looking at collecting data on different geographic areas in the downtown, and we've broken down the entire community into about 38, 39 different geographic areas, of which downtown is one. They're one of our leading economic generators for the small geographic area they're within. We know that their vibrancy comes from the high level of activity. A lot of places that do commercial activity very close together with a lot of access through parking, and a lot of focus in the area being between both the university and City Hall. We know that downtown creates a critical mass of activity where all types of businesses can come together, and we've created a downtown that is really a cultural experience within Chico. It was rated as one of the top 10 downtowns of middle-sized cities before, and it's a fantastic example of being perfectly located between large economic generators. And we know that they're going to face an impact that's way more enduring than the pandemic because of the university changes. So we mapped out an area of the downtown core to see what its mobility looks like. And as you can see the data pretty consistently, and you're seeing the ups and downs being holidays, summers, spikes in August, and this is what you'll see right here, the largest spike ever was in August at a time when the students were coming back into the downtown with their families and eating and shopping, but very consistently a range of about 60,000 to about 80,000, 85,000 in terms of registered hits. We dropped down to 4%. And we saw that by just driving down to downtown. The mix of businesses that are downtown had very few essential businesses that were allowed to stay open, so therefore it was a ghost town. By the end of May, we've come back up to about 30%, 34%. Of downtown activity. And since then, they're coming up closer to about 40, 45%. And I believe in the next couple of weeks, we will achieve the level of what we normally see during the summer months. So I looked at the data for previous summers, and we're coming up to just about that timeframe. Will that translate to sales transactions and economic activity? We don't know. But what we do know is we don't expect that number to skyrocket. And we're going to try to get that number up in the fall as it has here, as the numbers you see here when the students are back in the community. So our first proposal, downtown businesses, a large cadre of them end up being restaurants. Restaurants have been restricted to a floor space of 50% of their fire marshal allowed capacity. That's the max. Not every business has that ability or desire to go to the max. So our next proposal is to allow for a more broad-based street closure in the downtown to allow tables to be set out with the social distancing to expand that capacity from as much as 50% max to a much larger footprint to allow those businesses to be able to garner more economic activity. And then we're going to try to get that number And not just for the businesses that are on the street closures, but for any business in the downtown to partake. I can buy food at this location and go and sit down at a table at the closed off area and enjoy the music, which is planned to be part of those street closures. We've been working with the DCBA with the help with our public works director, Brendan Adobani. We met with the DCBA yesterday before the council meeting with a number of different business owners. It was facilitated by Melanie Bassett and the DCBA to run this concept and hear the strengths, weaknesses, any opportunities, any threats they would see about the concept. And to take that input in and to work on a very viable plan that is business driven, business focused with a goal of economic activity, but also creating an environment, an experience that residents and those outside our committee would want to have. And we want to come and partake to get that economic activity up. The events are scheduled to begin at a 6 p.m. to a 9 p.m. That takes the opening and closure to be outside the time frames that meters are operative. Partly because the generation of the meters support are pretty substantial supporting economic activity for the city and its critical services, which also serve the downtown. And we didn't want to interrupt that, and so we aligned the time frames to be like the Thursday night market, the Friday night music in the park. So pretty consistent, and there wouldn't be a concern that you're going to take up spaces in front of our businesses at a time for the event when we're still operating and are not in that area. And then the requirement to implement this only would require a street closure permit that's processed administratively, internally, because the franchise agreement that the council approved already approved this kind of activity. So what you see here now highlighted in yellow is the expansive size of the road closures. So closing Broadway from first all the way down through third, and then the side streets, partly because once you close one segment, the circulation changes, so you need to close the additional segment. There is not 100% support for completely shutting this down for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And so the DCBA is working with the business owners for the best approach. It may be that the closure is not going to be to make sure that the closures are smaller, and then expand as activity increases as the desire to have a larger footprint occurs. But we wanted to show you the more expansive piece of that closure so that you're aware of, okay, how much of an impact are you asking? In terms of mobility data, we looked at the directions of travel for folks coming into the downtown and out of the downtown. There are five ways the highest concentration of folks come in. Esplanade down, going down to the roundabout, which was a concern of the downtown businesses, is, well, how much traffic are we pushing through that roundabout, and is that really effective? The concern is diminished when you look at the other four routes in the downtown are just as high concentration, coming off of Third Street, 32, and down Second Street, coming east from Nord. Going out, it changes a little bit. And main Esplanade, so the egress becomes much easier, even though we have a significant amount of street closures. And so the goal is to increase our activity and bringing people to the downtown while still allowing for social distancing and creating the positive vibe that our community has always had in the downtown. And we'd like to know if this type of approach is acceptable to the council, if there are any other considerations you want us to bring in, to the DCBA, for them to think about, or any alternatives that you think could fit increasing activity in the downtown. Chris, I got another question. Can you go back to your map? So the yellow is showing closures? Correct. So by default, Broadway between Third and Fourth would be closed because you can't get to it, right? Correct. Okay. And the only reason I'm asking is because if we're talking about restaurants and all that stuff, you've got Raw Bar there, and you've got Burgers and Brew, which would want to be closed anyway. Correct. Okay. Thanks. Don? Matt, I wanted to see if this was the thoughts of the council, or do you want me just to finish the second proposal? Well, let's comment on that really quick. The first time I heard of this, Mr. Stone brought it up a couple weeks ago. And then I was in a meeting with Chief Madden and some of the other restauranteurs, and some other people where this came up, and due credit was given to you, Mr. Stone, by me. And no, they were ecstatic because it's like a few of them, their PPP loans are running out in the next couple weeks, and even if they're 100% full at 50% capacity, they can't make it. So they're like, how do we get back to our normal 80%, 90% capacity? If we could expand into there, we could do those things. And I heard you say there's not 100% acceptance, but I don't know exactly how the map works, but I know you're working with the people downtown that are most concerned about it. In my own opinion, if we don't do something for them, some of these places are going to close. The students are gone anyway. Summer is the perfect time to try this out. Worst case scenario, it backfires and nobody likes it, and we undo it. That's just my personal opinion. I know that DCBA was concerned about going forward with Thursday night markets, or the Friday night concerts. Would this closure be primarily for businesses, or would they be bringing in other vendors like Thursday night? One of my concerns is still allowing for social distancing. I know I'm probably the last person who is concerned about making sure that we don't have large crowds, but having that. Having additional vendors would make it more attractive, but may not reach the goal of helping exclusively downtown vendors. So there's a modification on the footprint, obviously, for the Thursday night market. The intention is to include the farmer's market component of it, but not necessarily all the food trucks and the other outside businesses into the downtown. Food trucks have remained open during the course of the pandemic, and so the downtown businesses, I mean the focus is if we do this for the downtown is for exactly what Councilmember Morgan had said, it's to increase the intensity of the downtown businesses whose traffic fell to zero in some cases, or 4% as a downtown. Okay. One of the other discussions was utilizing the University parking. I'm sure it's open to the public anyway, but are there obstructions? Are there closures that can be dealt with that would open it up more? We had some initial discussions during that meeting, and so we will be reaching out to discuss it. Part of the consideration is distance, and so we want the shortest distance possible from a business to the seating. The other considerations are there are certain businesses within the closure area that still do a large amount of delivery and takeout, and so if you shut down the streets, and DoorDash and GrubHub are coming to my business, and I'm doing a lot of that, are you cutting me off from that level of activity during that 6 to 9 o'clock time? And so in that consideration, we're also looking at pre-designated parking for those services to be close enough to the businesses just outside of the closure area to get there. The parking garage may not be in the most ideal area, but because we're looking at space, we want to approach the University and determine, are they open to utilizing that space? And so we're looking at open space that currently is not being used. Thank you. Sorry, if this is going to add, go for it, and then I'll ask my question. No, I didn't know there were more questions, so please. I did have a question. I may be walking on thin ice here, but I'm just curious, you know, because a lot of these restaurants also serve alcohol, for example. Is there any conversation about creating a zone where people can be served drinks and enjoy that aspect of the downtown as well? Absolutely. The DCBA has been in contact with ABC with their emergency exemption, and the goal is to do exactly that. There's also discussions of banding folks that are coming into the area, so you're creating a community. And so whether it's what you get it at one location or each business is providing that, if you're coming here and we're serving you, here's your band, so we know that you're within that community. And so there's a lot we could do. Yeah, I've got to follow up too. And to me, it's just a revelation of, you know, an Oktoberfest in Germany or typical summer markets in Athens, Greece, where it's just, it's just... Our streets. Our streets are much better here than they are there. But the feeling or the vibe, the environment and the energy that comes from the music, the food, the outdoors, the misters and lights that they're considering also putting out there to create a higher level audience than we currently have, I have a feeling that in a lot of our partners, that are working on this, that this may become a new model that's very successful. Mayor Foale. I have a follow up question, but go ahead. My understanding of the regulatory relief from ABC is that the alcohol being served must be in an area controlled by each restaurant. That it isn't a communal beer garden or Bourbon Street type scenario, that you wouldn't just be able to say this entire communal area is a farm, but it's a food court with alcohol. Right, you're sitting at a table. You ruin everything. I know. That's exactly what my follow up question was. Why aren't we talking about his review? Because the history of the city is such to not allow alcohol consumption within the city limits. And if we were allowing alcohol consumption within the streets, not that I'm totally opposed to that, but that would have been quite a, well, I wanted to get married in the downtown plaza. So I didn't because alcohol. It's essentially redefining the premise of that licensee to extend out into the street. Well, we can let those guys work that out. Just so there wasn't any confusion. Another quick question because I think that we're not seeing as much parking areas impacts on certain areas of the community, not just downtown. Has there been any discussion or thought put into allowing parking lots to be utilized? As an extension of certain businesses, but not necessarily city owned. But if there's a kind of swath of land that would typically be used for parking, would that be something that we might look into? And for clarity, that was part of my request originally was this should have been continued if there were opportunities throughout the city that we look at those. Obviously, downtown was a priority. But we have been looking at allowing businesses to open outside where they normally would. Wouldn't to provide food and whatnot. In terms of the parking lots, as you can see, we're very open to do whatever it takes reasonably to support our businesses. One of the considerations we have to take into effect. Let's assume this is wildly successful and we see a tremendous amount of activity coming to downtown. They have to park somewhere. They're going to park on the outskirts. And so one of the considerations is do you allow them to park on the outskirts and then allow certain folks, either they bike them in if they have specific needs or they walk into the closed off areas. We don't want to push them out too far. And so if you close, let's say the parking lot where the farmers market occurs, which is a very large number of parking spaces and say you've got to go further out into the residential community. You're not walking unless you're going to the places that are being served in that parking lot to get to crush. I'm now literally walking past the parking lot, past an expletive, across the street of Main and then I'm going all the way to the other end to Broadway to get to the restaurant. It may create an additional barrier to certain businesses that are furthest in. Yeah, I would assume it would be case by case. But we can look at that and see is there a way we could do, can we have our cake and eat it too is basically what we want. Can we do this? Eat it in a parking lot at a table. And if the event starts at 6, there is set up time required. And if employees are using those parking spots for the businesses that we do have open during the day, what is that impact of them having to run out to their car and move it at 4 o'clock? That's something we're going to have to work through or allow the DCBA to work through with the businesses because right now there's certain streets, I think the Broad in Main, the second street segment of Broadway in Main, every single business signed on to saying we're on board. And so you had one business owner that went down the street and every single one was a resounding no. And so I think those type of issues are part of the numerous ones that we have to tie up before this can go active. And the goal for DCBA, the hope, is that they can have the first night, street nights, June 18th. So I love the idea and I hope we can make something like it happen. I'm concerned that with the opening of various public facilities, and public areas around the country, they've immediately seen spikes afterwards of a resurgence of cases. And I wonder what additional precautions we might be able to put into place if we open this up to this, in exchange for that, what additional precautions can we put into place to assure that we're not seeing that same sort of spike and resurgence that we're seeing elsewhere? Anthony? That's a very good point. Those are just conversations we're also having. And whether it be offering masks to individuals who are coming in to make sure that they're covered up, we just don't know quite yet how it will land. As a community, I will say we've, we opened up faster than most. Just Barnes & Noble, which literally, we directly worked with them for a two-week period to get them open, get them what they needed. Ours was amongst the first in the United States to open. And so we're doing, a lot of businesses have been opening. Our number, our total number of case counts from the start of the pandemic, albeit 75 in the county, have been only 22 in our city. Less than a smaller city to our south in the county. And so, so far I think we're doing a good job. But this is why when you heard about the education activities, the proactive piece, what we're discussing now, what are we going to do in the downtown when we put more people in a more concentrated area, the focus has to be exposure reduction. Well, I'm impressed with, as I go to businesses, and I've been going to a lot of businesses in the last few weeks, been impressed with the plexiglass, you know, that everybody's got in front of their register. Been impressed that the employees, for the most part, are wearing masks. I just want to see that continued on so that we can do this and so that it can be successful. I think the prediction long term is some of these measures, may never go away. Hand sanitizer, sanitizing more frequently may be measures that we just become ingrained in what we do. But for what we're doing now, absolutely we need to focus on that. So it sounds, I don't hear an opposition from the council. Okay, so we'll take your input back to DCBA and make sure they're aware of that and integrate that in their plans. The second proposal is a little more complex than the first one. So let me try, I'm going to do my best to try to explain it in the most effective manner. So 3-Corps has a disaster interruption loan program. They've had this for a number of years. We recommended a lot of folks to 3-Corps for this loan program. In a lot of cases, folks looked at the criteria and did not want to apply. And so we're still sitting on $2.9 million in this revolving loan fund. In terms of how the loans are granted, they have criteria just like the PPP and other loan programs had. The PPP program had a dual set of criteria. One was just a flat credit score and the other one was a combination of factors to consider whether to give a loan or not. And so many times when you open up a new business, you don't have the credit score where it should be. You don't have the assets or the security that, you know, a bank or somebody would want to give you. So you have to have a loan that you can give you a loan for so that if you default, that can go after your assets. And there may be a number of reasons why you just would not qualify for one of the loan programs, including 3-Corps programs. 3-Corps has to be diligent in the loans that they give out. And we're not asking to be reckless about it, but it has to be, there needs to be due diligence. When 3-Corps does a loan, they have numerous partners, federal, state, and other partners, that securitize the loan against the loan law. And so one in particular at the state level will go as high as securing 95% of the loan. So if 3-Corps gives a $10,000 loan to a business in the city, they know that if that loan defaults, they're covered up to $9,500. And they only have to worry about setting aside $500 in their own loan loss reserve fund to cover the remaining amount. And that assumes the entire loan is a default, not just a portion. And so the limit, what we're looking at is, these larger scale businesses that either can sustain themselves without needing the loans and assistance are not necessarily the ones we're looking at. The businesses that already qualify and have applied and received a PPP or an EIDL loan or some other program being offered isn't necessarily what we're looking at. We're looking at businesses that fall with the criteria of these loan programs that would grant it to a reasonable level below that. That they're a reasonable good credit risk, but not necessarily so good at the low credit risk that they would apply for these programs. So we're not talking about a very risky one. We're talking about one that makes absolute sense to assist and ensure they continue, is the premise of the program. And what are we asking for as a city? 3-Corps has a willingness to expand their criteria for world-of-grant services. We're not talking about the loan. But what the expansion of the criteria will do, will reduce the percentage of security these other programs will provide against a loan. So where I normally could give business A a loan and have 95% security through a state program, business B, that is more of a credit risk, will only get 50% or 80% or 75% security through this program, thereby making 3-Corps' risk too great for them to be able to just grant a loan. And what we're asking for you to consider, and this is direction we would ask, should we proceed in this way, is to allocate $400,000 from our emergency reserve, we would retain that $400,000, it wouldn't go outside to 3-Corps, to securitize a portion of these loans that is not being covered by the other programs that 3-Corps would provide. So I'll give you an example. That business B that receives a 20% security, making it, not a business that 3-Corps would issue a loan to, but that based on our evaluation, our economic development team's evaluation of what it provides to the downtown, how real of a risk it is, why is it that they don't have assets, maybe it's a very new business, it's been here two years, hasn't been here the traditional three years, and to figure is that, does that make sense, including is the landlord willing to be a participant, in that case, the city would potentially secure that 15% or that 20% to get to the gap. So that $10,000 loan that normally would have been secured at $9,500, would be secured at $8,000 through this state program, the city would secure $2,000 of the program, tying up $2,000 to $400,000, and our security then diminishes every year that passes when loan payments are being made. And so with that, we could get a $10,000 loan out to a business, that may save a business, with the city's exposure being that $2,000. And so I have to say that we're not spending the money, but we are taking $400,000 and increasing the risk exposure that we are expending it, to fulfill a loan loss that may occur. So if we go and secure $400,000 worth of loans, and every business defaults immediately on the loans, we could be out $400,000. And so the ask to the council is, is this something that we should pursue? And if it is, we would come forward with a supplemental action to allocate that $400,000 in reserves, to a loan loss reserve, and work with 3COR to develop this program. Would we have, I'm sorry. You go ahead. Would we have a maximum loan amount that we would participate in? Since we would be designing the program, we are well within our rights to decide the full gamut of it. Including the parameters. Sorry. How long, what kind of terms are these loans? The loan program that 3COR has goes as high as 7 years. 7 years. Years ago, we had a home loan program that we had with the community, that if people qualified, didn't quite qualify for a loan, the city loaned money to them. And our default rate was very, very low on that. Very low. I think after all the years that we had it, maybe we had one homeowner that defaulted. And we still do so under our housing, certain housing program with some of the federal funds. Yes. And we're not asking, what we're not asking is, we want to make absolutely reckless loans, and we're going to be on the hook for it. That's not what we're asking for. We still, we have banking expertise, credit expertise between 3COR and the Chamber and the city. We would be evaluating any of these loans and determining the exposure, and weighing that against the benefit of saving that business in the downtown. Would it be exclusive for downtown? You've mentioned that twice. No. I mentioned downtown because of the double whammy. This would be open citywide, but there would be a primary focus on the downtown, or any business that is materially impacted by the closure or the reduction of the university because of the double impact that will have. And would the city receive the interest as well, on the loan, or not? My goal is to get some return on that that at least equals what our current late return is for cash sitting in the bank. But that's a discussion we need to have with 3COR, because their operations are funded through interest rates also. So we need to figure out how we structure that to be mutually beneficial. All right. So you're seeing this as $400,000 that we would fund and repay, and perhaps have some interest repaying that. Correct. The alternate program we were going to pitch was to take $400,000 and allow us to apply for an EDA grant to create a $2 million revolving loan fund. But the downside of that, well, the upside would be we have $2 million worth of loans we can grant to any business. The downside would be you're permanently locking $400,000. And that's, you know, right now we're doing this, if we do it, for the strict emergency, this highly high risk, low frequency event. And once we're past it, closing off the loan program, and as we're collecting back the payments, restoring the $400,000. I'd be open to this. You know, I don't see this as being a primary loan to do everything that a business needs, but more of a sort of a backup to help them out as part of a package that they're using to get their business reinvigorated. So as long as there was a reasonable limit to the size of the loan so that we had plenty of opportunities to work with a lot of businesses, and we weren't extending ourselves too much with any particular business, then I'd be open to that. Your example of a $10,000 loan I thought sounded very appropriate. Thank you. Other questions or comments? We did receive public comment on this. So before we leave this item, we should review those. How many comments did we receive in Engage Chico? We received 12. 12? And did we receive any emails? No emails. Okay. So let's just take a minute to review those. And you can read the names, please. All right. We received comments from Bryce, Jessica Gianola, Yvonne Johnson, Megan Zimmerman, Michelle Rutlinger, Michelle Burton, Michael Barr, Susan Smead, Peggy Gerowen, Nicole Nava, Jules Brown, and Julie Threat. Council has added just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just Council, I have enough time to review the comments. And after reviewing them, did you want to add any more? Casey? I just wanted to say that with small business and medium-sized businesses being the backbone of our community, I think it's super important that we bring this back. So I don't know what actual direction you need from us to continue to bring this back, but do you need direction or just kind of a verbal nod to say, yes, continue to bring something back to us later? I don't think we, if it looks like a majority of the council is supportive of it, that's all we would need at this point, and then the formal action we would bring for a vote would be at a future meeting. Perfect. Thank you. Very good. Okay. Item 5.5 is ongoing discussion of potential ballot measures. So may I ask, is that concurrence that I'm not seeing a broad-based opposition to this? Okay. Correct. Thank you. Ms. Presson, could you give us a report of where we left this item? Well, I believe that the council wanted to add a placeholder for each agenda up until when we have to transmit everything to the county in case there's additional council discussion on potential measures. So I think at this point we could just turn it over to council to see if there are any, any items that they'd like to discuss. In addition, I know that there's potential, the charter amendment that we already know, and I believe the city attorney, I want to speak for him, I believe he's working on that, and then there's the potential, the farmer's market item, so I'll just let you guys have that conversation. If no, so there's no further action needed on the two measures you mentioned? The, uh... On the charter amendment to bring our, our election, the type of election into compliance, um, and to have it meet current process, that one is just, that'll be drafted and come forward in a resolution that will bring probably, uh, I'd ask, I'd ask the city attorney, but I believe it would be, what, the first meeting in July? Yes. Okay. And then on the farmer's market, I don't know where, um, everyone is at with that one. I voted on it. Pardon me? I'm pretty sure we voted on that. Um, I, I believe it was discussed, um, I don't know if the city attorney wants any more direction on that. Um, I know we did, I believe we did receive a letter from, um, the farmer's market asking for it to not actually be placed on the ballot, so I don't know if you guys want to have that discussion. Let me, let's get an update from the city attorney and have that discussion. I'm going to step out of the room while we, discuss that because my leasehold is part. Oh. Uh, we, we voted on this. I don't understand, unless somebody wants to ask for reconsideration, why we would have any further discussion on it. I don't remember that actually being a formal motion on those because of, we don't, we don't have the resolutions in front of you yet. Um, I believe that we were getting, we were gathering information. Uh, I can double check real quick or I could ask Danny if you could check to see. Uh, if, so you're saying that we, that the council took mo- took action to direct that those, I know we talked about the charter amendment and the council concurred that that needed to be amended, but I don't recall it being a vote, but let me check. I recall it being a vote. Um. Okay. Um, to, I mean, I think the vote was to engage in whatever discussions needed to happen with the. Put it on the ballot. But I don't recall it being a vote. Put it on the ballot. Put it on the ballot. Put it on the ballot. those items, all the ballot measures that were on the list. Yeah. So in regard to the charter amendment, that would be for the district. And so we're working on that and that will be coming back on the 7th. In regard to the farmer's market, there was a letter received from the farmer's market proponent, president, I don't know, Mr. Kuhn, requesting that instead of it being put on the ballot, that the city just simply enter into an agreement extending that as a franchise for an eight-year period. After that item was previously, or recently before the council, we had the opportunity to! to pull the file on that matter and review some past history on the issue. It has an interesting history in regards to how it got to where it is presently. And it is our opinion that it would be better suited for legal reasons and potential for challenge as a ballot measure. So the California Constitution is the only one that is legally binding to be dealt with as a franchise agreement rather than a ballot measure. The California Constitution deals with, or has a provision in it that deals with issues where a private right is given to an individual or to a corporation, and it prohibits that. And so there could be an argument in that regard. I'm sorry. I mean, this is the fear for the last six years is exactly what you just said, that somebody would try to break the initiative that was accepted by this council, by a council, which took away the initiative part of it and just made it an ordinance. And we took a vote. Okay. I speak, I don't know what this letter says. I haven't received this letter. I speak to Richard on a weekly basis. You know, he sells great pork and chicken. Recommend his sausages, but that's not. So do I. So I really don't want to reopen this. And Is there anything right now to stop the action the council has already taken? If we didn't do anything, it would be put on the ballot. True? So the action taken five years ago, that's one action that was taken, and then there was direction provided about a month ago. The direction provided about a month ago was rather spontaneous. I did not have a chance to review the file prior to that time. And we did not, of course, have the letter from Mr. Kuhn at that time. My question is, if you take no further action, the ordinance adopted by the city would stand and it would go on the ballot in the record. My understanding there was not, well, there was the, yes, the ordinance was adopted. It was not, yeah, it was not codified. And the, there was a draft agreement. There was a draft agreement discussed. We cannot find a signed version of that agreement. And It's no secret I'm one of the authors of that initiative. I know exactly what attorney put that together. I'm not, it's like you're, we're talking different languages. It came as an initiative to the council. We were given all this paperwork a month ago when we voted to go ahead and put it on the ballot. You know, we're rarely spontaneous. But that's not a disqualifying emotion. So I'm ready to move on to talk about other. I have a clarifying, can I ask a clarifying question? Please. I'm just trying to understand, I don't, if we can just resign another eight years and from what I hear you saying, you think that would be better for us for protection wise as a council. Why does it, why do we need to pay money to put it on the ballot? And can't we just resign the agreement and give them another eight years? Because you want farmers market there, right? So theoretically that works. I don't know. Theoretically that, I get it. I'm sorry. I'll try to calm down because this is, it's an initiative, you know, so it does tie our hands. It, I think it validates the agreement once we take that step. And it, you certainly, good intentions may not have the votes. You have two people that probably won't be able to vote on this proposal. At least one because of proximity. And suddenly, it's the will of the voters. I guess that's the answer. It was the will of the voters. I'm not sure why you're getting so excited. I'm just trying to understand what our attorney is saying. What you were proposing was exactly the fear of the people that had been backing the farmers market for the last six years. That when it gets to this step, where we promised them we would put it on the ballot, when the voters said, that that's how they wanted to do it, that we suddenly now come up with a different. I think it's okay. I have something to say. Council Member Stone. Okay. Council Member Orr is correct. This initiative came forward because the farmers market for decades perennially was threatened with, we're going to move you to this parking lot or we want you out of downtown or we want you on a Sunday or a Monday or geez, whatever you do, just get them out of the way. And this, I've been with the farmers market for decades. I've met with them many, many times. The concern was that some of their council was going to move this on. And so it came forward as an initiative to make sure this would show up on the ballot so that no council could continue to play games at that as they had been doing with the farmers market for decades. So Council Member Orr is correct. The sensitivity about placing this on the ballot is absolutely paramount to its existence in the first place. I recognize you're relatively new to the to the, the council discussions, but again, for downtown, this was a big deal and a long standing deal and it should be placed on the ballot. That was the intention of the people that that brought that initiative forward. So we can go a couple routes. I can explain a little bit further right now. Or if you would like a full written analysis, I can bring that back as well. But it's our opinion that that ballot initiative cannot go forward. As it was written, as I understand it, it was presented with at the time when Lori Barker was retiring. And then at the time it was presented when Vince Ewing came on, it was not acted on to adopt, but rather to have a an alternate proposal to have them come on as a franchise agreement. So, if you'd like further, it's Article 2, Section 12 of the California Constitution that prevents a private corporation. I'm very familiar, and it was discussed by council at the time, the Lori Barker opinion and the argument you're making, and it is open to debate. And I may, I don't see you authorized to, to do this kind of research on a city approved initiative. Council Member Morgan. Thank you, Vice Mayor. In an attempt to reconcile these things, Mr. City Attorney, you mentioned you could give us a full analysis report written, whatever. Can you do that in enough time that we can still put this on the ballot the way Mr. Orrey believes it should be, so we can stop the back and forth? Because what I know for sure, and this is not personal to either one of you, you're not going to agree. You have, your job is to protect the city, which I appreciate. We've had two different attorneys that have had various different opinions, and every time we get a new attorney, it seems the law changes. That's not personal on you. That's not how I mean it at all. But for the protection of the city, because I appreciate what you're saying, but I also remember what Mr. Orrey is saying, and Mr. Stone is also validating. I remember what we did in the past, but I also don't want to get us in trouble. So back to my original question. Can we get that written analysis, that law, whatever, in time for this to end up on the ballot and not be perceived to be punting? Yes. I would, not that it's time to make a motion, but that's what I would move for. I would also say that the, a franchise agreement could be written in such a way that it would give some certainty for a considerable amount of time. More than eight years? Sorry? More than eight years? Yes. Yes. Let me try one more time. You're saying that you can't use an initiative as a way of gifting public property, in my own layman's language. So maybe the initiative was illegal up until the point, maybe, up until the point the city adopted it. And at that time it lost its initiative characteristics. It is now an ordinance of the city that, just like any other franchise that we have given, you know, the fact that it arose, as an initiative that was not challenged in court, is meaningless. You're correct. At the time the council took action to give a franchise there, that was appropriate. Putting it on the ballot as something that the voters would vote on as a private right given to an entity, that's where it crosses the constitutional line under Article 2, Section 12 of the California Constitution. I guess we need another attorney to look at this. The voters have all the powers that we have. If they are going to act as the council to approve a franchise, I don't see how that becomes any more, I mean, if we were, initially, if we were creating a proposal new, I could, you know, maybe you have an argument, but it is the ordinance of the city that that's how this would be handled. So, Article 12, Section, I mean, the voters have a number of powers. They do not have the power to approve a private right of action. There's no amendment to the Constitution, or no statute proposed, to the electors, by the legislature, or by initiative, that names any individual to hold in the office, names or identifies any private corporation to perform any function, or, and this is the operative part, to have any power or duty may be submitted to the electors or have any effect. And so it's that language that would possibly stand in the way of allowing this to be put to the voters. It is not, it is not inappropriate to, for the council to give that right to the farmers market to be on that site for a considerable amount of time. And whether that's a license to use it for a month, a year, eight years, an evergreen. I know you're sweet, but it's, it's beside the point. Any other questions or comments from council? Well, we seem to be at an impasse. Oh, we took a vote. Well, if we took a vote, this, well, this is going to come out wrong. If we took a vote to do something illegal, does that negate the vote? And I don't know the law as well as the city attorney do, does, and I do not know the law as well as Mr. Orry does, especially when it comes to this matter. And I know we've been through this different process, different, but kind of thing before with Chico scrap metal. We took a vote. It was an illegal vote. We did this. We did that. I don't know how we get past where we are now without getting the written legal opinion of either our city attorney or to Mr. Orry's point, if you'd be more comfortable with someone else's, I know we've done that before. I just, I don't want to watch you guys in a tennis match until 10 o'clock. I will tell you, we are prepared to, both like that opinion and to prepare a franchise agreement that would give a right for as long as the council would like to give that right. As an evergreen franchise. Now, I should say not a thousand years couldn't do that, but a significant period of time, well beyond eight years. Well, ultimately we will have to vote to put this on the ballot. Is that correct? I'm sorry. Ultimately we would have to vote to put this on the ballot. Is that not correct? No, that's not a franchise agreement could be done. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is if we take no action today, the previous action was to move forward with putting it on the ballot. Will we have to vote again to officially put that language on the ballot? So anything that's put on the ballot would require documents, documents that I would need to draft, that I would need to approve and identify as being a legitimate exercise of power, then you would need to take action to put those on the ballot. Meaning actually approve the language. The direction that was previously provided was to move forward with that. I do not see that as direction was provided to place it on the ballot, and I would simply write these things up and send them to the county clerk. Those would need to be actually approved by the council. So as it stands right now, whatever action was previously taken was direction essentially to move forward with that, to bring back those documents for you to vote on. Council Member Reynolds, did you have anything to say? Sorry. I was just going to say we have another meeting next week. Correct. Next week or two weeks, whatever it is. Then would it be appropriate to make a motion to have you bring back the opinion and a franchise agreement and let us make an, because what we're being, what I'm hearing is you say you're concerned with legality. So I would like to know that information before I vote in July to put this on the ballot. Ultimately, this may end up going on the ballot, but it sounds like we may have to do some verbiage change to make sure we're in line with what law is. So I would like to make a motion if we can, to get that information so we can talk about it at the next meeting. Motion. Motion on the floor and a second by Council Member Morgan. Any other comments by Council? Can we get a roll call vote? Yes, just a second. We can't get it to work. Is there any public comment on this? While we're waiting for that, I, sorry. My second is not even taking a position on this, either side. It's just because the city attorney has the legal question. And let's get it back and then move forward. I don't see how else we're going to do that. And just for clarification, what I, what I show in my system is that there was a formal motion for the charter amendment to be placed on there. And my report out to the council was that we are automatically bringing back the farmers market. And so after that meeting, so that, that one, the formal action has to be when you approve the actual ballot title and that information. And then that's under resolution that I send over to the county clerk's office. And so after that meeting, I was asked to forward all the farmers markets information as well. And he, and the city attorney already had the charter amendment word, wording. And so we were able to give that to them. And just, just for the, for the record, we don't have, and I don't want this to muddy the water, but the council did accept the initiative. There was a council action to do that. And there was a majority vote to do that. And what we put in the file, because we didn't ever have an actual ordinance that came back and sealed all of that into it. But we believe that the initiative outlined, all the conditions and all the things that needed to go into place for this, and with the directive that it be brought back every eight years to be voted on by the people. And so that's what we have in our file. That's what I can attest to. But I don't have an actual ordinance that was then finally formalized by the council. It references it as an ordinance. And I don't want to, I apologize for confusing it, the matter even worse. But anyway, so it was in my tickler file to bring it back for the 2020 election. And so, I guess the city attorney will prepare the analysis and then, you know, we'll do whatever we need to do. Well, we have a motion on the floor in a second. Council Member Huber. Yeah, it is confusing. And I think it's completely logical for us to get a complete accounting of what the, if ands and buts are in regards to it so that we better understand how to move forward. I'd like to support Council Member Horry, but I need to know the legality of that and how it's going to work. So it sounds like we have the time. Barely. Can we do a roll call though? Okay. What you'll have, you'll have Andrew making his point and you'll have another attorney here representing Friends of Farmers Market. That's happened years. And you're going to have two people. And I guess, potentially then, potentially is what we're doing. We're setting up potentiality. We would violate the initiative. But, I, I'm just shocked. And would the, would the council like me to resend that letter coming in from the Farmers Market? It was, it was forwarded to me. It was forwarded to the full council. So I could get that as well so that you have that. Because it sounded like Council Member Horry might not have seen that. And so I want to make sure you guys have that. That's why I would miss an email. Only with the 2,000 that you have in your inbox every day. So, you want me to call? So again, we have a motion and a second on the floor. Okay. To have the, I don't know if you want to reread the motion so that we're clear. It's for the city attorney to bring back an analysis. At our next meeting, which is on the 23rd of June. Okay. Can we call the roll on the vote? Council Member Huber. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Horry. No. Council Member Reynolds. Aye. Council Member Stone. Nay. Vice Mayor Brown. Aye. Carries 4-2 with one recusal. Okay. Let's take a quick break. We'll take a ten minute break. On 15. Okay. I already had my break. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. action on it is that of making in the charter that any voter is eligible to be a council member. I guess another way of saying it is changing the age from 21 to 18. It's a holdover from when the voter age was 21. It just wasn't changed. So I would propose that I move that we amend, ask the voters to amend the charter to allow any registered voter to be eligible to be a council member. I'll second it. Discussion on that? Sure, I'll go ahead. There was a comment in the, I don't know what you call this, that we should change the voting age to 30 so I guess we could go either direction. Well, considering the average age of our council members, that's kind of the, I'll do respect being the second baby of the group. Yeah, this is a holdover from the Vietnam War era and it's about time that we fix it, especially being from the district that has the youngest population. We're pretty close to it. This is important to my constituents. So your motion really would be to direct the city attorney to bring language back that we would approve. That's what I meant. I knew that that's what you meant. I just wanted to let the public know that we are not going to be making this decision until they have an opportunity at the next meeting to comment on that. It appears that that would be Charter Section 403, eligibility of candidates. Okay. With that noted, can we take a vote? Can we take a vote on that, please? Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 6-1. Other discussion of items that we would entertain to put on the ballot? No. I just want to briefly, you know, we have a kind of what I would call a haphazard discussion about the ranked choice voting piece. And I just felt like, and I don't know if that was continued or stalled or what happened at that moment, but I feel like it was not robust enough. It sounded like the report was about a phone call that was had with the city, with Candace Grubbs, and I just feel like something's kind of missing there. For me, I need more information about this in a more formal kind of way. Because obviously if it's changing our entire election system and date and all of that, that's a big undertaking. But if it's just the opinion of somebody that that's the case versus the formal process by which things would take place, I think I just need more clarity there. Okay. And so I didn't do, I didn't delve into the research into how that would be implemented. Because that's, that would, that process we consolidate with the county. So I'm happy to do that and bring back more of an update. It was a conversation that I had with the county elections official. So, and we could even invite her to be here to talk at that meeting if there's, because right now we do consolidate with them and. Continue doing that. I just, I want to say that possibility. I'm curious to hear from council members about it as well. I just felt like I wanted it to be more robust than it was. So if you want me to bring a report back, what all would you, would you like me to talk about the process? How it works? How many cities? I'm not sure what you would like to have. And I want to make sure it covers everything that you're looking for. I think from, from my perspective, you know, I had mentioned this, that portion of the meeting to other. Folks and they were like that, that doesn't make sense. Like it, is it only consult a non consolidating our elections? That would be the possible path forward. And, and for me, I didn't know that the answer to that question was yes. Based on the conversation we'd had at that previous meeting. And so I'm just. Right. And, and I didn't seek anything in official in writing. For it to be an official kind of opinion. Okay. I can, I can actually seek that. And, and. I can, I can actually seek that. That would be a big part of it. Because if we, let's just say, if the city was required to do standalone elections. That's a lot. That's, that's a huge cost to start up in a department that would need to be created. And equipment. Right. If there's a path forward that doesn't require that is my real question. Okay. So I will reach out to, I'll make an official request to see. To get more feedback from. The county elections official as well. And bring that back at the next meeting. I can do it for the 23rd. Thank you. Okay. My memory was that. Not that great a memory. That we also asked just to look at Alameda County or San Francisco. Any of those that are already doing it. To see if they really can't consolidate. Or if it's more of a Butte County thing. I just, it's hard to believe that. Right. Right. That there's a lot of people that are already doing it. And several municipalities that are doing rank file have to send out a second ballot. But that may, so I would like that. She gave me some examples and I'll look those up. That of cities that did end up having to, once, if they, when they went to that type of voting. They were asked to do their own. That the county, when we reach out to the county. They decide whether or not we're going to consolidate with their election. And so, and we paid them. We paid them a lot to actually do that consolidation. So I'll see what I can get and bring back. That would be great. Yeah, just some more formalized would feel better for me. Okay. I want to do our due diligence around that. So our research is showing that it's currently the cities of Berkeley, Oakland, City and County of San Francisco, and City of San Leandro. That have gone to rank choice voting. It's only available for charter cities. SB 212. In 2019 was passed. It would have allowed it for all cities in California. But that was vetoed by the governor. And so it's currently only available. Rank choice voting is only available to charter cities by admitting your charter. So we do have the ability to do it. There is this stitch of how the balloting would actually be tabulated. Who would be doing it and so forth. Got it. So one question I would have for that report is how much analysis is required. Of. The discussion of the mechanics of actually rank choice voting itself. Or is there enough understanding of that? I mean, how much detail would be needed there? And then what example do you want each of the four cities I cited as attachments of what their charter looks like? I mean, I certainly welcome examples. I think I'm particularly interested in this question of do we have to unconsolidate? I don't know if that's the term. In order to move forward with that. Asking the voters to approve that charter amendment. Because that would change my opinion of whether we did it or not. And my feeling is that the general sense is yes, we would have to do that. But I don't we don't have a formal opinion on it. And so for me, when I'm asking for. Is that the formal perspective and opinion of the county elections officials? And if it was unconsolidated, that would mean that it could not be in a November election. Is that. Yes. Your understanding as well. Okay. Yes. So that muddies it for me, but I really want a formal opinion on that. I will get that. Thank you. Before we leave this agenda item, we should review the comments that we received. How many did we receive? We received nine. And did we receive any emails? No. Okay. Let's just take 30 seconds to review those comments. Okay. And those comments were received from Yvonne Johnson, Julie Threat, Kelly Moakley, Michelle Rettlinger, Rob Berry, Carolyn Arpey, Nicole Nava, Peggy Gerlin, and Susan Schmid. Thank you. Council, I have enough time to review the comments. Did any other thoughts come to mind after reading them? So we will move to item 5.6. It's a verbal update on technology for allowing public to participate in meetings and potential council action regarding regulations. Resolution 2020 COVID-19 emergency. Mark Horne. Sure. Staff has been conducting a lot of due diligence surrounding attempting to find ways of furthering the ability for the public to communicate with council. And so I'm going to have Mr. Josh Marquis step up and give you an update on status of that. I just want to let you know that what we found very easily is the fact that we don't have audio visual expertise. We have IT expertise. So if you're talking. Anything IT, we got that handled. But this area is much different, vastly different than what most cities are working with. So with that, Josh, thank you for taking the lead on trying to figure this out. Thank you, Mark. And thank you, Madam Mayor and Council. I'm going to give you a real quick where we were, what we're currently working on, and then what we hope to accomplish. Feel free to interrupt me or ask me any questions. Like Mark said, me and my staff, audio video is kind of a different world. But we're, you know, lending our hands. And working with the clerk in the city manager's office the best we can. This room is essentially two separate systems. It's an audio video production system that's in the booth. And it's a PA system in the room, which is what we're currently hearing. Our system, which is similar to many municipal systems, wasn't really designed to accommodate an online participation. Some system design issues have made adjustments extremely challenging. As I believe you witnessed at the last meeting in May. Staff located a professional who made some temporary adjustments, which allowed us to do some limited online streaming and participation. Mainly via an audio call-in bridge. Staff continues to work with a local vendor to get a needs assessment of our current system. Staff's reached out to Chico State City. He's a media production company. And looking to see if we have any opportunities for collaboration with them. And we've also found a third vendor who's expressed an interest in helping the city, which seems really promising. Some next steps. IS, information systems, and the city manager's office are assisting the city clerk in assessing the recommendations of those AV professionals. And we'll be selecting one of those professionals to participate. And we'll be looking at how to perform the work to be done. The goal of those actions is to address the room's limitations. Improve the meeting's audio-video workflow. Hopefully making it a little bit easier for the city clerk. And also to make some changes to better accommodate remote participation. And identify methods for remote participation that allow the public better access. And allow potential remote use for staff and council members in the future. As such, we'll be looking to enter into a professional services agreement. And I hope to have a little bit more information in a couple weeks. And at the city manager or your discretion, I'm available to come back and hopefully give you more information of how we've moved forward. I do have a couple concerns about our ability to... I do have a couple concerns about our ability to... handle a very large remote participation. A lot of IT people have been dealing with the same issue across the country. And I'm part of a group that's California-based. But there's a lot of municipalities who have tried and failed. Or have tried with limited success to accommodate a large group of people participating remotely. So if you have any questions about that specifically, I'm more than willing to discuss that. Any questions? Do we have any examples of cities that have done it successfully? No. Yes. The common thread I've seen is that there are smaller cities with 5, 8, 10 participants. My biggest fear is if you had 200 participants, I don't know how the city clerk would be able to handle 200 participants in a meeting. Some municipalities have been having 3, 4, 5 people pre-screening groups of callers or audio-video people. It can be daunting. It can be doable, but it can be daunting. There's a local group that has meetings of 100 pretty consistently. I mean, if limiting it to 100 is what we have to do, that's certainly better than none. And there are options. There are even paid services that we could use that they manage all of that. In my research, some of those services are rather expensive. But...! I do plan to bring back some more of those. I'm kind of hesitating to give a recommendation of a service or how to do it until talking with an audio-video professional who can look at our system as a whole and provide a holistic approach to it. Other questions? Thank you. Appreciate the insight. Thank you. So the item on the agenda is... and potential council action regarding resolution 2020. So I believe it would be... ...unappropriate, we'll see. I would... As I read 2020, to me, what I'm struck by is how... I mean, we're waiting for somebody else to take an action. You know, and I'd like this to be more proactive, so I'd like to see if the council would ask the public health department whether or not, in their opinion, we can have a public meeting. And I would ask that question starting with the July meeting. And get direction from public health whether or not they would allow it, and under what conditions. And I would ask that question starting with the July meeting. And have that discussion proactively with public health. So there's a...is that a motion? Yes. I'd second it. I will...it was already seconded. Okay. Do you want to add something? No, because I don't think he'll go for it. Because the only thing I would change is that we tell public health that we're about to start letting the public back in. And ask them for the guidelines for doing that the safest way. I don't see that they've offered a terrible amount of leadership in anything other than supporting the needle carnival and some other things I disagree with. I can go to the bank, I can go to the grocery store, I can go to the restaurant, I can now go to a bar. Friday I can go to the movies, I can go protest about anything. But we can't do democracy. And we're not letting our people in. And... And like Moses said to Pharaoh, let my people go. I think we need to tell public health we are letting our people in. We would like your guidelines to do it. And how do we decide who gets to be in the room? That, I think that... It's a great question. I would... But I think, you know, that's what that... If you don't mind, that dialogue is... We could be holding this meeting in the Senator Theater. Where you could have the space to do social distancing if that's what it takes to bring democracy back. I don't know how many people the BCAG Amphitheater holds, but, you know, that kind of extraordinary action by this council may be what it takes. Or, you know, we could be holding this meeting in the Senate Theater. Or, you know, but to your question, I don't know what the capacity here is. 150. It says 150 on the door, which is about 50%. So if 300 people show up, we have that dilemma right there. Which of the 150 get a seat? You know, we can queue them up outside. Alex and I could choose. You know what, Mr. Ory? If there were people here, I'd almost do it anyway. I want to stand up and applaud what you just said. We could do this at the Senate, the Senator. We could do this at the LRA. We could find a place that if we want to do democracy and public health, we've got to have 12-foot distancing. And rubber walls and all this other stuff, we can do it. But there's been a lot of initiatives, some that I agree with and some that I don't, that the public is expecting to hear. They're getting put off and get put off and get put off. And it's no longer fair to the public, to the government, to the staff, when everything else is opening. And quite frankly, if someone's like, well, I don't feel safe going, what about all the, if you don't feel safe going, you shouldn't go. Just like you shouldn't go to a restaurant. We can't protect you from everything. There's a far greater chance that someone's going to die in a car accident driving to the council meeting than they are getting the COVID virus. And it's time that we let them make that choice. I'm less worried about their dying from the COVID, but they're sharing that disease with everybody else that might be here. Again, that is the underlying problem. It's not somebody's individual exposure. Yeah, I'm a little frustrated that we haven't done this already. Last time we were discussing this, I mentioned 150 people at the door and whatever it's 25% or there were two people that were going to be in the seats or 35, there is a number that we know. We have an overflow room. We've got a front walk, but just like every other business has a placement where we can keep people queued up outside. We can move to another facility. There are other cities that do this. And I was talking to my friend in Winters and she's a council member in the city of Winters. She said, we don't have any problem with this, but we have four or five people that show up at their council meetings. And I said, well. I use social distance every week. Winters, Winters. So it is whatever it has to be, whether that's Laxon or the Senator Theater. I'm all for it and we should be doing it. Mr. Murky, I appreciate the efforts and work that you've brought to the table here. And I know this is not an easy one for you. My first job out of college was as an IT director for a general contractor and the IT department was one me, which is very quickly realized. I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life. So I know how challenging this must be for you and I appreciate you and your staff's engagement here. But this is something that just needs to be done. It needs to be done quickly. I suspect that we all share the sense that as challenging as it can be to have the public here sometimes, it's much, much harder to not have the public here. It's much harder to not have the public here. It creates a tremendous amount of stress on the public and on us as well. So I'm all for doing what we have to do to try to get meetings as public as possible and make sure that that complies with some guidelines. There's precedent. We moved to the old municipal building when they were redoing all this stuff. And I understand that. I would rather see the IT staff have to figure out how to temporarily make Laxon work, which would be an awful lot of work. I would rather see the city of Laxon, which is an awesome example of a town gown partnership, by the way. It's not like they're doing anything with it now anyway. Accommodate us and the public in there than spend a bunch of money trying to figure out how to get 200 people to call in. I'd rather have them here. If we're going to spend the money, I'd rather do it that way. Before we take the... Oh, you had a point. All I was going to say is I still stay with my second on the motion, but I think it's a good point. Mr. Ory, would you be opposed to restating the motion to say that we want public health to give us direction on how we can have people here on July 7th instead of asking... Or for the July meeting instead of asking for permission to have people here? Is that verbiage? Sure. So I don't know if we need to restate it, but... So wait, I don't understand what you said. I was... I was going to give you two years a second. You made your second line, and you said okay. I said... I was going to believe the extent to which you and I are meeting on. Really? I guess my semantics, but I'm saying we're... Instead of asking permission to have people here at the first meeting in July, can we say we are having people here in the first meeting in July? What are the parameters you would like us to follow? Public health. That's all I'm saying. Oh, it helps. God, I love it. It helps. Before we take the vote, we should review the public comments. How many comments did we receive in Engage Chico? Thirteen. And did we receive any emails? No. Okay, so let's take 30 seconds to review these comments. As the clerk reads the names. Okay. Jessica Giannola, Yvonne Johnson, Julie Threat, Michelle Rettlinger, Gary Vertel, Rob Berry, Peggy Gerolin, Susan Sneed, Michelle Hale, Pamela Copping, Karen Wilhoyt, Nicole Nava, and Jules Brown. Anybody need any additional time? Okay. Any addition, comments? Let's take the roll, please. Okay. Councilmember Huber Councilmember Huber Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Councilmember Yeah, folks, you know, I brought this item forward when we were looking at a couple of hundred and over degree days as, you know, with some hopes for some urgency. Obviously, things didn't work out that way. But we are going to have hot days again. In between the time that I made this request and now, I called leadership over at the Jesus Center, with whom we've had our contract to open a cooling center during extreme heat days. And, you know, just kind of discussed, got some numbers and some data about what an average day for a cooling center looks like in terms of cost to the city. And that average cost is about $700 a day. My understanding of the barrier for the Jesus Center currently to operate a cooling center is they're churning out 600 meals a day for Project Roomkey. They've got their Sabbath House residents sheltering in place in that space. It would be very difficult to expand their operation to also accommodate folks, somewhere about 50 people a day for a cooling center. So all of that makes sense to me with regards to COVID-19 and everything going on. But we still do have a priority for making sure that people do not die or go to the hospital with heat-related illness. And so my request today is to look at one thing specifically, you know, as I've talked to more outreach workers, for some funding is running out for the outreach efforts that are currently going on as well. So fewer people are getting contact, will be getting contact with outreach workers. But the understanding is that, or the, you know, kind of effort that I think we should support is looking at supplementing their work with cases of water and sports drinks per CDC guidelines when extreme heat is present. And so I'm open to other ideas. But the main thing that I would like to... focus on is really supplementing outreach workers and or the Jesus Center who is coming in contact with folks who are unsheltered on a daily basis and helping to redirect those funds toward keeping folks safe. The other piece that I wanted us to consider is looking at alternative locations. I know that the Salvation Army is not utilizing one of their spaces. That was suggested to me as a space that we might look at contracting with to opening. A cooling center while we were in this kind of limbo space of not having a partner to open with. So with that, I'm open to any questions you have, any suggestions, and carry on. Let's do it. Do you need a motion? This is... What's the request? Questions. Because this is an initial request, right? So we don't have a public comment. No. No, this is the request on the agenda. Oh. Yes. This has already been put on the agenda, so we're at that section. Please. And you might have said it and I missed it. When you brought it up initially, we were moving funds from one place to another. So I was under the impression the money was already there. Yes. Okay. They're not asking for new money. I'm saying redirecting those funds, we would have spent $700 a day on extreme heat days towards supplying outreach workers with those materials. Thank you. Yeah. So I have a question. It seems as though since the meals and such are going through the Jesus Center and that they are already who was providing the sheltering and cooling, it seems like it would be a pretty easy transition to help supply the Gatorade and the water and have them be the hub of the source. And if they can't distribute it with the meals that they're doing three times a day, then probably whatever other outreach workers could probably come there. Sure. And that seems like it would be an easy transition. We already have somewhat of an MOU or whatever we have with them for that heating and cooling, and I could support redirecting those funds to that. Yeah. That seems like it would be easy. And just to clarify, Council Member Reynolds, thank you for bringing that up. When I did have this conversation with the leadership at the Jesus Center, they did mention that they're doing the best they can to offer that as well on those extreme heat days. For them, I think it's when days go above 95 degrees. I know that our threshold is higher than that. Okay. There is a potential for supplementing that effort. My understanding about what they do is that they're pouring those in a cup and having people have to drink them there. And so I do like the idea of having some available to take away because outreach workers might be able to reach folks who aren't accessing that service a little bit more easily. So if that's... I guess my only caveat might be as we have some sort of accounting of something, that we're not just buying $750 worth of stuff every single time. And then it's being backstocked and there's, you know... Right. Four months worth of Gatorade sitting there. I don't, you know, Gatorade's not super expensive at Costco. So if we just have some sort of a, you know, we're serving 50 people and this is costing an extra $2 a day or $3 a day or whatever. And so if we can just... But Ms. Katsona is wonderful about working those things out and I'm sure she'd be fine with doing that. Fully supportive of that. Thank you. So, yeah. Can we take public comment or... Yes. That was kind of my general direction was if we take public comment, we have to... I hear the public comment. Otherwise, I'm ready to make a motion. Let's take public comment first. It looks like the city attorney has a question. No, you should be taking public comment. Okay. Yes. Okay. Yes. And how many comments did we receive on this item? I think we received 13 on this one as well. And that would be through Engage Chico's engagement platform? And did we receive any emails? No. Okay. So we've received 13 comments. These comments we have had. We've had for several days now. So let's take 30 seconds to review them. And, of course, we'll take more if needed. And we did actually receive 15. I apologize. I can't count. Can you please read the names? Yes. Rachel McDougall, Sonia Antoine, Karen Henderson, Jessica Giannola, Yvonne Johnson, Julie Threat, Kat Mullenix, Kelly Moakley, Simi Walker, Michelle Rettlinger, Michael Barr, Megan Zimmerman, Gianni Capanera, Michelle Cooper, and Margaret. Ms. Council had enough time to review the comments. Okay. So I'll entertain a motion. I move to approve. Second. Is everyone clear on what the motion is? I have a friendly amendment. Yes. Can we agree to let the service providers hand out the waters and the Gatorades and all these things everywhere? But at the Neolab? I'm sorry, what? The needle distribution. I'm asking that we do not supply water and Gatorade at the needle distribution. What are we bringing? Well, it doesn't matter. Yeah. No, it's not. But if we're going to go out and engage people where they are because it's hot, we're going to do those things. It's outside. It's hot. They could conceivably go do it there. I'm asking that we not do that. Do we do it at the campsites, encampments? I think we can. My understanding based on Councilmember Reynolds' motion is that we're looking at utilizing the Jesus Center as a hub for outreach workers and the Jesus Center to utilize these resources for folks to pick up and give out to folks in encampments if they're not accessing that resource. That seems pretty reasonable to me. Agreed. And I would accept your friendly amendment. I think what I'm hearing is that somebody wouldn't go to the Jesus Center and pick up 10 cases and then take it to the needle distribution and pass it out at needle distribution, I think is what you're... I'm asking for that not to happen. Not to happen. So I would accept that. I think we're going to... That's two hours during the whole entire day of the whole entire week. And I think we have plenty of ways to reach people other than during that two hours. I'm not interested in excluding particular... In which case, then why don't we make sure the distribution point is in front of Councilmember Morgan's house? I mean with... Yeah. Okay. I would defer to service providers to distribute and manage that program. And my request is to provide the resources in order to allow them to do that. So I didn't make a motion or a second, but... I did and I'm not... No, thank you. Okay. So you made the motion. I did. Okay. And did you second the motion? Who's second? I thought you had a second. Councilmember Huber did. And so the friendly amendment was not accepted? Correct. Let's call the question. Mr. Orme. Thank you. Just for clarity's sake, for staff purposes, I just want to confirm is so when we have those extreme heat days is the cap $700 for those days then? Is that is that this and that's the estimate? I would say the cap is that and if you spend less to meet the need, great. Okay and then also there was a question about Salvation Army. Is that a part of this recommendation as well or this motion? My recommendation would be that we maybe explore it as an option, at least engage in the conversation but I don't know why we wouldn't just do that. I don't know why we wouldn't just do that anyway but yes. I just want to make sure you're comfortable. Please. Okay please. Thanks for asking. And are you good with that Mr. Huber? Okay so we have a motion on the table. That's been seconded. Okay. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Orme? Aye. Councilmember Reynolds? Aye. Councilmember Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. Okay. Reports and communication. These are reports provided for the Council's information. No action taken on these items unless the Council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. City Manager's report. just want just just say one thing that the Esplanade project is moving forward full-fledged. One of the things I want to ensure that Council and the public are aware of is that we do anticipate that the street grinding will start occurring come Sunday night and it's an exciting project but there are impacts and so I just want to make sure that everybody's aware that that will be occurring commencing Sunday night and it'll be moving forward after that point. So just want to make sure everybody's aware of that. We do anticipate that things will be coming to completion sometime hopefully in July and so it'll be a temporary situation but ultimately it'll be one of the most beautiful improvements we've seen from a public infrastructure perspective in quite some time. With that that's all I wanted to share. The melodic the melodic sounds of grinding asphalt and concrete sounds wonderful. Thanks. So we have 6.2 sunshining of draft PBR Chico Battalions Chiefs CBC this is for information only unless there are any questions. 6.3 is sunshining of draft MOU Chico Public Safety Association CPSA also for information. Any questions? And we have not received any comments on any of the reports and questions. Communications correct and no emails? Okay. And the monthly financial report and budget monitoring reports for information only? Okay. And is there a closed session or did we take care of everything? We are going to adjourn to finish closed session at the end of this meeting. Yes. Because there was action taken that we didn't report out but I thought it was because we were going to come back and confirm it and then report back. So that works. Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Councilmember Jen offline Exactly. It was. I was unaware of any vote. No, there was no vote. I remember I did talk to the city attorney. Well, we can talk. Okay. We voted. We did. We voted and I caught it and noted it and said that was a vote. That was not direction. And I kind of the mayor saying that there was direction given, but there was actually a vote taken. Yeah. Well, I was not in the room at the time and I was not advised of any vote. If you would like to correct the record as to that vote, please do so. We will do that at the conclusion of our at our report out of closed session. Thank you, sir. Okay. So 6.5 is for council member requests. Council members can verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority vote of the council is needed. In order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. I am requesting that council consider bringing a better understanding to our community of what policing is in our city. It's clear that there is a great divide in this community. We were fortunate enough today to receive a report from Interim Chief Madden on many aspects of the use of force policy in particular. I stand behind the Chico Police Department. And I want our community to stand behind the Chico Police Department. However, I think in order for that to happen, we need to have a conversation, a better understanding of what the policies are, how the training occurs, the implementation of those policies, and the culture that results from them. I'm approaching this as an audit of what the police practices are. I as a mayor took a pledge put out by the My Brothers Keepers organization. And I told them I was committed to this. I would commit to review the Chico Police Department's use of force policies, engage the Chico community by including a diverse range of input, experiences, and stories in our review. Report those findings to the council and the greater community and ask for feedback. And if we are appropriate, ask for reforms to take place. Community policing which we believe in is a reflection of the community and the Police Department being in alignment. I think that we can be there. The unrest that we have seen in our community cannot continue or be pushed under a rug. We need to bring it out into the open of what those misunderstandings, greater communication, clarity, change if necessary so that we can move forward from this. So my ask of the council is that you join me in this pledge and agendize this discussion that would establish a mayor's ad hoc committee to remove the police policies, including training and implementation, and report their findings and any recommendations for reforms. So it's a quick question because it's an important point. I think you accidentally said remove instead of review. Review, I'm sorry. Yes. It's not that big a deal except that it changes the nature of what you asked. Yes. Do you have... Do you have an idea of the makeup of said committee? Yes. I would propose that it be a mayor's committee. I would like to have two council members join me. I am proposing Scott Huber and Casey Reynolds to be those council members. I have not asked them, but it's putting out there. I would like to have at least three community members. One of those would be a member of... of the CC4J organization who I have been working with already who have a very good understanding of what the police policies are. In particular, Margaret Swick would be my appointee. I have a clarifying question. I'm wondering why it is that you're asking us because the mayor's committee is an ad hoc committee and the mayor can just create that committee and could have and probably should have created that committee but a week ago. A week or two ago. And you certainly didn't need us to select your own committee. You've selected the members. You're announcing those members whether you preferred to them or not. And you've selected all of the other community members. So you've taken all action and you're announcing it here as though there's a request for us to make when you could have done that all along. So I question why it is that we're here pronouncing your declarations as to the committee that you could have created two weeks ago in the first place. I'm asking... I'm asking council because the time that it would be for the police chief to be involved in this committee and officers from the police department would be an expenditure of funds and I felt that it was appropriate that the council approve expenses, appropriation of funds. So it is out of respect for the guidelines that we have for ourselves to ask council before we... before we direct staff in any way. It would involve city attorney evaluations. So that's my question. If you think that I can go right ahead... Well, I have a follow-up question because we have an organization that the chief has created, the Police Community Advisory Board, that is supposed to be engaging in this activity every single month for years. That's a group that the police department has selected and righteously so as you started out with this. You know, I'm supporting and behind the police. I'm supporting the police department and I'm wondering why the PCAB doesn't address that. It seems like an interesting time to wait a couple of weeks and say, well, I'd like the council to come together and tell us to form an ad hoc committee that you could have formed that's going to do what? Address community needs? That's already in the police department's charge. So I'm just curious. Council Member Morgan? I think I might have an answer to the question but I'm not sure because you didn't finish the list. Oh, I, the interim chief or designee and two members of police officers. Okay, so just clarifying. Chief, two police officers? Yes. So you said three community members but you only mentioned one. Yes, because I haven't, I have not, I have not named any, or I have not given that consideration. I haven't given that consideration yet. Okay. So, if you, if the mayor, in an ad hoc committee that includes other council members, which we could probably debate ad nauseum who they should be and shouldn't be, if you're appointing citizens, can it still be an ad hoc committee or does that make it no longer ad hoc, Mr. City Attorney? What makes it ad hoc is, just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just Chief. But the main legal issue is how it relates to the Brown Act. By the Mayor creating an ad hoc committee, it is not a Brown Act body. By the Council creating the committee, it does become a Brown Act body. I think it's appropriate as the Mayor was pointing out under your AP&P rules to make sure that there's consensus regarding the funds that are going to be associated with this. But the way that the ad hoc is created does have a legal effect as to how it then ultimately operates vis-a-vis the Brown Act. So, in my opinion, having heard your request, I would rather, well actually first to Randall's point, because I was on the Police Community Advisory Board meeting for our group for years. Me too. Yeah. Yeah. It was very effective. So, it might be interesting to hear, sorry Chief, the Chief's perspective on this. I don't know if the Mayor's talked to him. I haven't said that. If this is a direction that we go in and it's different than the Police Community Advisory Board, my personal opinion would be that it would be a Brown Act committee so the public can attend. And I'm sorry, I do not want to guess at your intent. But my guess at your intent is tempers are hot. Some justifiably, maybe some not. How can we make sure the people that are sending all these emails on both sides are heard? And I appreciate what you said about a review and audit of the policies, whatever it may be. Maybe they need to be changed and maybe they don't. I don't know. And maybe the Chief can shed some light on that. But I say all that to say if it's not going to be the Police Committee Advisory Board that's already there to do it, I would like to see it a Brown Act committee. I would very much want it to be an open meeting. Not these eight people or whatever in a room together. It has to be a broader conversation so that people's voices are heard. So the request is to agendize this for a future meeting? Yes. Unless the feeling is that I don't have to have the Council's permission. Well, to make it a Brown Act committee. Okay. Great area. Can we we're already talking about it. So Mr. City Attorney, can we ask to hear the thoughts from the Police Chief on this? Or is that going too far? I think you could do that. Yes. I would be interested to hear if Chief Madden thought that this would be helpful, hurtful, if this is something the Police Committee Advisory Board should be doing, if would be would be doubling up on something already. And look, he's already here. Good evening, sir. Good evening, Council. So I think it's a two-part question here. Am I right? You wanted to talk a little bit about what I think about PCAB and then also about the Mayor's proposal. Is that correct? I'd love that. Okay. So, um, first of all, I just want you to know that the Police Department has nothing to hide, and we're more than willing to engage our community. The one thing in that document that I sent you today is, means a lot to me and our officers, and that is we want our policies, our procedures, our cultures to align with the principles and values of this community. It's important to us. Most of these officers live here, work here, and they're really important to us. So I think it's a good thing that we're able to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. of the chief. I have been to meetings and I've seen all of you up there being a part of that. I'm seeing some great things come of that. I can say that as a second in command for the last three years, it seems like the last year, maybe just because of all the things that are going on, that I haven't seen a whole lot of action come out of that. And so I have not had an opportunity to even engage the current members on that to see if there's where they personally stand. But I absolutely believe in the philosophy behind that program. I've seen great things that have come out of that. And I do believe that is a great venue to even get deeper into really educating people about what police work really looks like and engage in that community. So my vision for PCAB is to really select a group that well, well represents the entire community and get outdoors and get into the neighborhoods and get those folks bringing back the information that I need to make good police decisions. And so that would be my plan. It's interesting. I don't remember what happened to it just before I transferred off. I think Mr. Coolidge came on. Prior Chief O'Brien was holding the PCAB in different places in the community. Like we did one at the Jesus Center and we did one at the Jesus Center. And so I think that's a great venue to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. is you sit in a room and you talk about issues and then those folks go out to their community and talk to them and bring those ideas back to that board and educate me personally on what's going on and then again I've been to those meetings we've been to schools Jesus Center you know so we can hear directly from those individual communities it's a diverse community and you know what's good for one neighborhood you know issues in one neighborhood may not be issues there but issues over here and so that's the core of community policing and I look forward to engaging with that. Chief you're coming in at a very interesting time of course one with the dual federal disasters as well as the murders of George Floyd and the uprisings throughout this country. I appreciate hearing you recognition that not every neighborhood is a place where you can hear the voices of people and I think that's a great argument just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just that the PCAB was less bidirectional than I would have liked. What I think we're talking about and what the PCAB has done, at least historically, are not the same things. That's not a criticism. It's just the PCAB was, as you said, educating the public and getting that education back about what's happening in each one of these sections of the neighborhood. That's not the same thing as what we're talking about. I would like some civilian accountability. I know at this stage what we're really talking about is being able to pull together the community so that we can have some healing and make sure that there's some understanding between the police department and the community that it serves. So they're kind of completely different balls of wax. I'm not sure if that was really so much a question. It's just much a concern moving forward. Excuse me. I appreciate the comments. As we move forward, however this looks, I do ask that, that it's put together in a thoughtful manner so that we actually, this actually works, that we actually come away with something that we can all work with. And so, again, with all the things going on right now, we're willing to engage. I just ask that we are thoughtful on how we put this together so that good communication, this is really a relationship that we're talking about. And in a relationship, you've got to be able to sit in a room and have those conversations. And a relationship is about compromise. And so I just ask, Mayor, as you look forward to this, is that let's set this thing up for success. Yeah. Who appoints the PAB? What's that? Who appoints the PAB? The Office of the Chief. It's a function of the Chief's Office. Yes. And that might be not, I can't criticize you. You've only been in your role for like four days. Not that you couldn't do a great job of that, but certainly there are people that would be, well, the Chief just handpicked whoever, whether it was true or not. I'm glad you mentioned that. Yeah, you're going to get criticized for that. Whereas if the Mayor chooses one, and I don't know what your thoughts are on the other two community members, if that's something we agree on, or if the people, the council members end up appointing them, whatever, it gives it a greater chance for that not to happen. Sure. May I, just to move this on, if we go ahead and approve agendizing it, it gives the option to the Mayor, Chief, can either bring it back at the next meeting as an agendized item, or she can go ahead and appoint the committee, and I don't need to be part of either one of those decisions. So, you know, if there is a motion on the floor, I'll second it. Question would be, if we already have a committee, an organization for this conversation to occur, um, do we need to have direction to give to the Police Chief that we will review policies and have a direct, so that we can continue this? I mean, we already have this committee in place. So, I'm just going to quickly say, you know, I'm going to have, I'm happy to have the conversation, um, about forming a committee. I think I would prefer that happen in the public eye. I will, it's unlikely I will support forming a committee, uh, outside of these chambers. I think there's a lot of these issues that we need to talk about in the most publicly accessible way possible. So, I'm just going to clarify that really quickly, but I'm happy to move forward and have the conversation about it. I have some thoughts. I have a request, you know, queued up for after yours that I would appreciate the Council kind of hearing and potentially having these discussions at the same time. So, that we can look at what we'd be interested in moving to committee, what we'd be interested in having conversations about in the, in the, you know, most direct view of the public. Um, so, just want to make a quick point. Uh, well, okay. So, I, I, I also have one. Scott, did I interrupt you? No, okay, sorry. Um, oh my God, I applauded. Carl, you're applauding me. This is amazing. I've got a mosquito over here, uh, doesn't get on my mind. My bubble. Uh, my thought is this. If, if we, if we approve moving forward with some, uh, idea of this committee, chief, you might have sat down too soon, but don't get up yet. If we approve and then we come back two weeks from now and we, we're talking, okay, here's how it's going to look. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, can start this committee sooner rather than waiting two weeks to put the committee together so it's another week after that and it's a month from now before it happens and people are going, the council's not doing anything. I don't really see this as an effective tool to bring about change in any reasonable amount of time that the public's expecting. So, you know, if we're going to seek agendized discussions, I'll make a motion to agendize this, that this is a council committee where the council will make the decision as to who the members are and this is a long range healing and understanding session. This committee's formation and operation is not going to be such to quell what the community is clamoring for now, nor does it really have that objective. It's repairing what the PCAB at least was not doing and what the community is asking for. We may find and uncover some things through this process that would cause us to change the PCAB or not. Again, not my, I don't have an agenda and I'm not a member of this committee, but I think if we're really looking for transparency probably the last thing in the world that we want to do is have a single person, the mayor, who wants to create a budget item, pick, handpick, cherry pick all of those members and have a wide opportunity to make those changes. So, my motion is that this becomes a council decision as to who the members are and we agendize this for future meeting. So, I have some comments. So, we've got the mayor's proposal, we've got the vice mayor's proposal. I have something that I was bringing forward tonight all on the same topic. They all have commonalities. Just wondering why we're kind of putting them all together and just making one decision on one bulk project. That would be point number one. Point number two in regards to the police chief's advisory committee, which I think is a great thing, but I think that the advisory committee should be a subject of what we're talking about, not the venue for where we're talking about it. Council Member Huber, I agree. I'm prepared to kind of accept this as a, I haven't heard your proposal, so I'm eager to hear it, but prepared to have this as kind of a package of discussion of reform, policy change, practice change within police community relations and to have it all come back at the same time so we can unpack and kind of decide how we want to move forward as a body. And I'd be eager to hear your request. Obviously, I submitted my request in writing. You all have it. The public has seen it. I don't. I don't know what you're proposing, but you said it's got a similar flavor as some of the other things that are being proposed. And so I would be prepared to have that discussion more comprehensively rather than slicing it and trying to figure out what we want to move forward and not at this point. And if it helps, I have a similar, I had a proposal in February that I'd like to bring back that's along the same lines as well. And so if it helps you, Council Member Huber, I'm happy to dovetail that. Council Member Huber, I'm happy to dovetail that. So if I might suggest, why don't we hear all of those proposals and then kind of sort it out from there rather than taking them one at a time. Can we do that, City Attorney? Yes. And Casey, you had a question. Because I'm classic for always bringing this up, I feel like we're borderlining on talking about something that all we're doing is ask to agendize and we're making decisions. We're making decisions before we get there. So we have three different requests of three different things we want to talk about. To me it seems like, or four, that we should get an up or down vote on each individual item, know what they are, have our chance to study them and understand them, and then we can come back and vote on them later and have public engagement and public involvement. We are all sitting here saying, well, we want to do this and we want to do that and we want to do this. And what's on the request is the request to agenda. So we're not going to agendize something for a discussion. So I would be more comfortable voting on whatever your proposal is, whatever your proposal is, Ms. Brown, as well as you, Mr. Huber, and I don't know what we need to do to bring back February. But I think we should just take them individually and then we can get an up or down vote on what each of them are and move forward. Wow. I understand where Council Member Reynolds is coming from. It makes it difficult for Ms. Brown's proposal if we vote on Ann's first and then we go to the second one. But the alternative is we take what sounds like four at the next meeting. We'll spend four hours trying to get somewhere with that and then it will be two weeks after that. And then, Mr. Stone, I hear what you're saying. There's, I don't know if there's anything to solve. Part of it is letting people be heard. I do like what the Mayor said about this kind of being an audit. My guess is most of your ideas, I don't have one, so most of the ideas overlap and are kind of close. Here's, I haven't seen Scott's and you've got one. I'd be willing to table it. I'd be willing to table this one for a moment, listen to Vice Mayor Brown's and vote yes or no on both of those just so we can move forward. Because that's what's on the agenda anyway. Okay. Well, it's not on the agenda. Is there a motion on the floor? There was one, but there was no second. I'll make a motion to adjourn your second. Right. So I move to accept the Mayor's request to agendize. Second. Any other questions? I would just like to... My second involves her request to agendize given that framework. Only because it's a framework. We have to start somewhere. I'm not saying yes it will look like this. We'll have a discussion on this topic. It may be that we say yes to all three items and they may come back as a combined agenda item. I don't mind them coming back combined if we end up doing that. But I would like a little bit of separation. I think there is overlap, but there's also additions. Yes. So rather than it just being kind of a pile of things, maybe we have it broken up within the items so we can touch on them each. I think... Okay. I was going to call the question, but I've done that enough to you. Go ahead. I think that's a suitable solution is have vote on them separately, but hope that they come back together. Something like that. Somewhat. Okay. All right. So there is a motion on the floor. It's been seconded. I think... Yes. And this one is to consider your request. The mayor's request. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Orring? Aye. Councilmember Reynolds? Aye. Councilmember Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. May I... Yes. So folks, I wrote a long request. This is a narrative that would be included in the discussion, if not amended between now and then, to explore quite a few different topics. You know, things that I think many of us have supported for some time, but given the urgency of this moment, I think it's prudent and appropriate for us to engage, especially as this is budget session and some of these items may require budget adjustments, to engage on these things. So my request is written. I don't know that I need to read every single piece of it, but it includes, I would say, five main things. I would love to have a kind of public report out around some of these use of force policies, around police training as it is. It applies to the audit, but I would love for that to be public. I would like for us to look at adjusting or changing our use of force policies, and I would like to see some changes to the policies, and this may overlap with the committee, and that's fine. I would like for us to create a plan, rather than just continue talking about, based on the report front that we are to receive from the police department for getting all officers trained in evidence-based 40-hour crisis intervention and deescalation techniques. And then to further to discuss, which I know is something that Council Member Stone got up at a previous meeting, the police community advisory board function, and maybe adapting that function to better meet community needs. And I guess the last piece of that is kind of in line with our diversity action plan, looking at an implicit bias kind of annual offering for all staff or a requirement of sorts. So that's what I'm asking as a package, and I hope we could unpack those a little bit more. And if you're keeping that to a general sense, then I'm comfortable, as long as we're continuing the discussion with the community review board or something like that, I'm happy to do that. I'm happy couching that in a larger discussion about PCAB and... Yeah, the specific thing I wrote was further discussion and review of police community advisory board function and adapting this function to better meet community needs and exploring community oversight. So whether that's blended or not... You covered enough of my Venn diagram, I guess, to be comfortable with that. Right. And I guess I support that, the discussion of these items. I think it's important for everyone to understand that. I think it's important for everyone to understand what the current policies, procedures, training are before we make any types of recommendations. And so, yes. Deputy Chief, Interim Chief, I genuinely appreciate the reports you sent out. I think that would be a great starting point for this kind of public accounting, just so the public is aware of everything that you shared with us. And then just for the opportunity to ask additional questions and engage a little bit more with it. So thank you for being proactive in that. I think... I move that we... Oh. ...agendize the Vice Mayor's request. Second. Mr. Huber and Ms... So I think something that I heard you say, and I'm not quite sure how you said it as you were introducing this, had something to do with adjusting the budget. And I just want to make certain that we're not talking about defunding in any way. Because if that's part of this package... I'm not interested in supporting it. If we're talking about the possibility of having to rearrange some things within the department, I can support that. But I just want to make it clear, because I don't want to go on record as supporting defunding the police department. I don't know if you read that anywhere in my request, but it wasn't my intention. I would support looking at rearranging to make sure that over the next couple of years, we're going to be able to do that. I think that's a worthy investment for the short and the long term. But no, there's no proposal in here to defund. I know that it has many definitions. Thank you for the clarification. Morgan? I actually looked up the definition of defund today, and it actually only has one definition. The one that we would normally think. Here's what concerns me. I'm really concerned about the fact that we're not going to be able to do that. I'm ready to say we can wrap all that up in the first conversation anyway with that committee if it's put together well. But here's the terms that scare me. First, recommendations to rearrange. We don't do that with other departments. We don't tell the city clerk how to run her outfit. I mean, I try, but it doesn't work. Same with Ottoboni. Certainly, we have an unbelievably qualified new police chief. We had an incredibly qualified last one. They run the department incredibly well. I realize the community needs to hear from them. So us getting down in the nitty-gritty and trying to run the police department as a city council, I think, is an absolutely horrible, horrible idea. And then also invest in the idea of community oversight. And here's why I'm opposed to that. For the exact same reason we talked about last night, that we're going to put together a committee for the tax increase. The tax increase. So that there'd be an overwatch committee to the city council because the citizens didn't trust us with their tax dollars. So we would appoint people and say, hey, you don't trust me with your tax dollars, so let me appoint Andrew over here. You can trust him to watch me with your tax dollars. If there's supposed to be community oversight of the police department, this is it. And this is where it should be. I think that the chief has been in this job for three or four days. He's already mentioned the police. I can't remember the name of it now. Board, he's going to look at that. He was honest about what's happened in the last year with the campfire and things like that. I can see why that went away. So those are my concerns. I think it's a little far, far reaching. I'm not sure how this body is an oversight of the police department. There's about two different clicks from that. The council's not in the process of doing that. There's a lot of work going on. There's a lot of work going on on the chain of command. The police chief reports to the city manager, and the city manager reports to the council. It just seems like a strange place for an oversight body in the council. But anyway, I appreciate what you said. There is a motion and a second, and we can go down into the details of the specifics when this is brought back to the committee, or council. Okay. Take a vote. Okay. Yes. And then I just wanted to remind council that there were eight comments received on the overall council request. And then I believe Danny has four additional ones. So let us take 30 seconds to review them while you read the names. Okay. Bryce Corrin, Jules Brown, Yvonne Johnson. Okay. Megan Zimmerman, Julie Threat, Karen Wilhoyt, Jody Taylor, and Michael Barr. We received the emails from Steve Simpson, Nicole Nova, Donna Sherry, and Will Wilma. Council need additional time in case these are still reading. Council has just added just one comment from Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council Council No. Please call the roll. All right. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Ory? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? No. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. It carries 5-2. Other council member requests? Yes, if I may. Thank you. Thank you. Council may remember that a year ago I asked that concerned citizens for justice be provided with 10 minutes to give us a presentation on their proposal would be on the subject of transforming the culture of local policing. The write-up that I submitted at that time from them was that concerned citizens for justice is working to build a relationship based on mutual trust and respect between local law enforcement and the residents of Chico. They promote a police culture that values the dignity of every person and reduces the use of force. Concerned citizens for justice would like to present and expand on these views for the city council's consideration. At that time, the council didn't have an appetite for this presentation. It seems very appropriate at this time. I have talked to... Thank you, Emily and Margaret. They are open to once again providing this presentation. It's interesting that some of the other proposals tonight include concerned citizens for justice as part of their plan for committees. So I'd like to provide the council with another opportunity to vote to hear their presentation so we kind of know where this... I think it's actually respected by pretty much everyone, including, from what I've heard, our police department, concerned citizens for justice. So I'm making a proposal that we agendize a discussion of having them come and provide this presentation. I second your request to agendize. Additional comments? No. So I just have a question. Instead of having them present to the committee that we're going to form, you want to come straight here? Thank you. I mean, it's a request really is to talk about it. Wow. Okay. Other questions, comments? Take it. You know what? I was going to make... I was going to bring this up as a separate item, but this... Maybe this goes... This might work to... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. hundred and something thousand odd police officers in the state who helped write the assembly and senate bills about use of force could we have them both come and present i'm open to having them on the same evening or you know if it's convenient for them having them at separate times but yeah i don't have any opposition to that at all i mean this is all great and spontaneous but uh let's i mean let's talk about it once it's agendized right what but so that's what i'm asking is that that's a that's a a request for a friendly amendment that we if we're gonna that we ask them both to come i don't know it doesn't have to be the same night we can work that all out later something second okay to have a motion on the floor to have two to discuss two presentations you council member huber council member morgan yes council member ori council member reynolds council member stone vice mayor brown mayor schwab carry seven zero any other council member requests i'd like to i'm just kidding okay i'd like to adjourn we will we will be going into closed session and then we're after closed session we'll announce that we will adjourn to a special uh city council meeting on tuesday june 23rd at we've been having our special meeting start at 5 30 so i would suggest 5 30. and we'll take just a few minutes before we get over there because i think it'll take us a few minutes to get to closed session just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just Thank you.
