I have no idea about this project, so I'm not sure to what level that...  I'm just from work relationships and stuff.  But I have nothing to do with this project or didn't know anything about it.  Okay.  Any other ex parte communication?  Great.  So we will turn it over to assistant planner Madison Driscoll.  Thank you, Chair, and members of the commission.  This is a proposal to divide a .62 acre site at 745 West 11th Avenue.  Okay.  This is a proposal to divide a .62 acre site at 745 West 11th Avenue into three parcels for residential development.

This is a proposal to divide a .62 acre site at 745 West 11th Avenue into three parcels for residential development.  the property into three parcels taking access from West 11th Avenue. Parcel 1 would be 9,138  square feet, parcel 2 would be 10,296 square feet, and parcel 3 would be 7,448 square feet.  The project would yield a residential density of four units per gross acre, which is within  the allowable range of 2.1 to 7 dwelling units per gross acre in the R1 zoning district.  Public improvements would include constructing new curb, gutter, and sidewalk along West 11th  Avenue. In conclusion, a neighborhood meeting was held on August 16th, 2021. Neighbors in  attendance of the meeting did not raise any concerns. Staff did receive a letter from a  neighbor expressing concern about the density of the project. I have attached to you in a memo.  Staff has confirmed that the proposed density falls within the range allowed by the general  plan designation. Planning staff recommends planning the project in a way that is in line  with the planning commission adopt resolution number 21-07, approving the parcel map subject  to the attached conditions. I'm happy to answer any questions.  Great. Are there any questions for Assistant Planner Madison Driscoll?  To my right? No? To my left? Thank you.  So with that, we will open the public hearing, and our first speaker will be  Mr. Gilbert. Welcome back. It's been a while.  I just want you to know that this is cutting into my alcohol, you know, my adult beverage  during public hearings. Well, we'll try to speed it up.  Anyway, Wes Gilbert with Gilbert Engineering, engineer for the project. We've looked over  the conditions, we've met with staff, and we don't have any problems with the conditions as presented.  I'm here to answer any questions that the commissioners may have.  Okay. Are there any questions for Mr. Gilbert?  Dennis? Yeah, Wes, just a question about parcel three. What kind of house layout are they looking at?  I'm sure they did some configuration there. Well, they plan on putting a house in that narrower section, which is 38 feet.  But it'll be narrow and long, which, you know, we've dealt with these 38-foot lots a lot, you know, with the small lot subdivision and so forth.  And so there won't be any problem making that fit in that particular...  Garage in front, obviously. At the garage? Well, I don't know. The garage may be in front, but anyway.  Okay. Probably in the front, yes.  Any other questions? Thank you, Mr. Gilbert. Thank you. We may ask you to come back up.  Okay.  I have a question about the trees. You can ask them. Yeah. Yeah.  Okay. Wes, before you sit down, I have one more question. Okay.  I don't know anything, and I looked it up a little bit, about Aleppo Pines, and I noticed that tree number three, which would be the one on the easterly front,  Okay. I don't know anything, and I looked it up a little bit, about Aleppo Pines, and I noticed that tree number three, which would be the one on the easterly front,  Yeah.  part of the existing house there, was to be protected and was to remain. Boy, it didn't look very good to me. A lot better than the one to the right, but...  Yeah, well, as you said, there's three trees in there. The one in the middle is a little small, one very small.  Right. Right.  The one on the west side is... it's sick.  It's dead.  Yeah. And Mr. Lamb has met with the urban forester and everything, and he has no problem with taking that thing out.  And then we're going to try to protect the one on the east side there, that group.  Right.  You just had a lot of brown, and I didn't know how they grow or how they send out new needles, but it just... it didn't look good, but I'm not an arborist.  No, it doesn't look good at all.  Yeah. So what happens if it dies in the next few months?  Well, I don't think it's going to last that long, so...  Yeah.  Can we ask for a fairly good-sized tree to be put back up if that number three dies? Is that...  Would that fall within the...  It's a...  Yes. If it's an ordinance tree, then yeah, they need to mitigate for it.  It's an ordinance tree. Yeah. Okay.  Yeah, I agree. That tree is not healthy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Is there any other public comment on this item?  No? Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  With that, we will close the public hearing and bring it to the commission.  Any questions of staff? Any further clarification needed? Or any motions?  Is there any limitations to the single-story, two-story, three-story... anything in there that I didn't pick up on?  No, there's no limitations on it. Just within the designated height of the R1 zoning district.  It was a little hard to hear you. Would you mind repeating?  Yes. So, there... The only limitation is the height of the underlying R1 zoning district.  Do you know what that height is?  I think it's something like 35 feet. I'm not sure.  I think it's three steps.  Yeah, I think it's 35. It's pretty generous in R1, yeah.  So, it's hardly ever an issue because nobody goes as high as R1's very permissive.  It's kind of a traditional R1.  Thanks.  Anything else? Anything else?  Thanks, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please  07, approving the parcel  map subject to the attached conditions.  Is there any further discussion?  I'd like to just say  one thing. It bothers  me a little bit about when  you have, you know, meets the area  conditions and we've got an average lot size  of a little under 8,000 square feet  and yet  we're creating three lots  two, well  one in particular which is quite small  and  I know it's  it fits in with some of the other housing  neighbourhood but it doesn't fit in with a lot of the other  ones as this letter proposed.  I know there's nothing we can do because  it fits into the  all the parameters but it just  bothers me a little bit that we can start  squeezing stuff in. I know we need the houses  and but  sometimes the lots get so  what's the word  interesting configurations  I would say.  Anyway, I'm just  I'm not going to vote against it but I  just wanted to make that as part of the  discussion.  I think one of the things you know Dennis  having been around maybe not as long as I have  but  when I graduated  college I worked for Rolls Innes and Rolls  and they did all the work for  Webb Homes, Drake and  all of that and  at that time obviously the city sewer  system wasn't  as big as it is now  so at that point in time  like the late 70s  for a septic lot  so you'd have adequate replacement area  they had a minimum  size of 12,000 square feet  so a lot of this area  and other areas in town were  developed on  the minimum lot size  for septic systems  so that you know that like you say  we always run into that  inconsistency in areas where  those were the smallest lots  they could develop at that time  now that we've introduced sewer  we can go a whole lot smaller  so it's always a challenge for you folks  then to kind of balance  neighborhood compatibility at all  and with the new state laws coming in  it's going to change things a lot  and the whole neighborhood  is going to change  I think it's just hard for people I guess  and I think the minimum lot size isn't it Bruce  with the new  down to like 1,200 square feet  is the minimum lot size  so just have to wait and see how all of that  pans out  that's tiny  so we have a motion  in a second to adopt resolution  number 21-07  approving the parcel map subject to the  attached conditions any further discussion  before we vote  I was curious for a clarification  on what you just said about minimum  12,000 square feet  was that for a current lot size  or are you still discussing  the historical sizes  no that's historical  back in the late 70s  the minimum lot size here in Chico  I believe for the county  was 12,000 square feet  in order to achieve  we need a certain area for the septic  and then a certain area for the replacement  of that septic fields  eventually if it failed  I'll have to call you sometime  because I'm curious to hear more about that  that's fascinating thanks  alright  so a motion in a second  to adopt resolution number  21-07  all in favor signify  by saying aye  aye  any opposed  so that motion carries  5-0 with 2 absent  and we will move on to  the regular agenda  there is none  reports and communications  Bruce  yes madam chair  I wanted to announce that  at your next meeting  we're going to be having  a public hearing  on the  Valley's Edge Environmental Impact Report  that report  and the Valley's Edge specific plan  is on the  the Valley's Edge Environmental Impact Report  and the City's web page  under current projects  and those documents can be reviewed there  and then you can be downloaded  and so if the public is watching  that's where those documents can be reviewed  but at your next meeting  excuse me  that's when people will be  the Environmental Impact Report  has been released  and our code requires  a public hearing  so that you  the Planning Commission can hear  the comments that are being made  and the comments from the public  about the Environmental Impact Report  those will be addressed  every comment will be tracked  and responded to  but for the Planning Commission  it's really kind of a listening session  at that meeting  you're not to take any action  or technically deliberate  you have to listen to what the comments are  in along those lines  we'd be happy  we provide  I think we provided the notice of availability  that has the announcement to you  and that was sent down to you  and posted in the newspaper and everything  but if you would like copies  physical copies  of either plan  please let Nicole know  or if you'd like  you know the copy  both the specific plan  and the Environmental Impact Report  are on the city's website  or if you like  we can also give you memory sticks too  so just let us know  which you prefer  and we'll make them available for you  but so that's it for today. Thank you.  So that's what we have going on at your next meeting.  And that'll be on November 18th?  November 18th?  Yes.  Okay. Great.  Do you expect a large group?  I  we'll there'll be a brief presentation  about what the project is  and then open it up  and then people will be able to comment about  and kind of get their questions out there  or put their comments on the document  or raise any issues they may have  with the Environmental Impact Report.  So I think it'll be lengthy.  Mm-hmm.  But I think it's going to be very exciting.  Yeah.  Bring your notepad.  Well, this was exciting.  Well, thank you.  So we will adjourn to November 18th.  Thank you, Commission.  Thanks.  Thank you.  .
