Same situation, you'll see everything happening simultaneously,  so you're welcome to do that. All right, welcome everybody. Thanks for being here.  Regular City Council meeting January 3rd, Chico City Council, and we'll call the meeting to order  and start with an invocation by Pastor Brian Myers. Welcome.  Good evening. And if we could close those doors in the back too,  so if everybody could just make a note because we can hear everything said in the...  Mayor, Council, City staff, Happy New Year. We're so excited about what's happening in our city,  and on behalf of Grace Community Church, we want to thank you for your service. We love the city  that we get to serve in, and thank you for your selfless service, and we are praying for you  constantly, and thank you for serving our city. Let's pray. Father God, we thank you so much for  First Lord,  for the rain. God, it is so needed. God, I just pray that our waterways would fill up. God,  and just provide, Lord, the nourishment that this earth needs. God, I thank you for this new year of  new opportunities. God, I pray that we'd be a city full of hope, knowing, Lord, that our best days  are always ahead of us. Lord, I pray for the council. God, grant them wisdom. Grant them the  capacity to know the right decisions to make. Lord, what's in the best interest for the city  to take all residents into account.  We pray for, Lord, just the property and everything, Lord, that is being determined  tonight. God, that you just give us vision. Also pray for unity in our city, that we'd have a  genuine love for one another, compassion, Lord, wanting and believing the best in each other,  and God, I do just pray for our city, that our city would be a blessing to one another,  but also, Lord, to those who live here and who visit, and God, I pray tonight just for a great  meeting. I pray for all those who are speaking and sharing, that they would share from their heart.  Lord, thank you for your love and your love for our city, and I pray for all those who are  listening tonight. Lord, I pray for your love. Thank you for your grace. We pray these things in Christ's name. Amen. Thank you.  All right. Thank you very much. If you please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.

Thank you.  Thank you.  2.2 direction was given.  On 2.3 direction was  given. On 2.4 an update  occurred. That concludes my closed  session report.  All right. Thank you very much. We'll move on to the consent  agenda. All matters listed on the consent  agenda are considered routine in nature  and enacted in one motion.  Do we have any disqualifications  or no votes by the council?  All right.  Any speakers on this item?  We do not, but I should bring it to  the attention that  Council Member Van Overbeck was  disqualified on item 2.1  at the last meeting, so I will note  that if you want me to for  this one as well. That'd be great.  I'm sure he wants that as well.  All right. Entertain a motion.  Move to approve as noted.  Thank you.  Motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from  Council Member Morgan.  Can we take the roll?  Council Member Bennett? Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Council Member Tandon? Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes.  Council Member Winslow? Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Carry 7-0. All right.  We will start with business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter  not already listed on the agenda  with comments being limited to three minutes  or as determined based upon the number of speakers.  The council cannot take any action  at this meeting on request made under  this section of the agenda. How many speakers?  We have four.  All right. Three minutes.  Okay.  All right. And I'll call two names and if the first name can go ahead and come on down to the podium,  which is Katie Posey followed by Nancy Park.  And if Nancy Park could please go ahead and go to that middle aisle.  Happy New Year, Council Members.  You may be aware of the recent budget cuts at the county level that have resulted in our very own library here in Chico,  now closed three days a week.  It's an embarrassment to me to see that the budget cuts are so much more than they should be.  It's an embarrassment to me to see that the budget cuts are so much more than they should be.  And I think it's important that we should all share that Chico, a university town built around a love of learning,  has a public library that is now closed to the public three days a week,  Mondays, Wednesdays and Sundays.  Would you open a new chapter this year by considering how you could be part of a solution  to keeping open a vital community resource that benefits all citizens?  These budget cuts should not be the end of the story.  Your constituents are served by the library in multiple ways,  and it's important that we acknowledge the detriment that a three-day-a-week library closure  brings to our community.  Yes, there are challenges the city faces in light of funding,  but at one time both the city and the county provided funding for the library.  My research showed me that the last time there was a request for discussion of bringing back funding to the library  was October 2015 by a council member who happens to be sitting on the council now.  Whether it's a funding discussion or any kind of discussion about how the city can support the library,  it's overdue.  In addition to being a safe and reliable place for all the libraries,  it's also a place for people who don't have access to internet,  need support for job searches and access to e-government services,  and even help with learning English.  For families, the library is a place where children's literacy development can be supported.  Especially significant is that the library provides access to resources for marginalized communities.  In 2007, the editorial board at the ER wrote,  It was shameful for Chico to be a community without a full-time library years ago.  Now that it's open longer, it should be preserved and protected.  Libraries are vital to the health of our communities and crucial to our reading and literary cultures,  and we must work to support it, keep it open, and ensure it provides the important resources our city needs.  As a former school librarian and lifelong library patron, I have a simple request.  Open up a discussion for strategizing how the city can support this invaluable resource.  I understand that public safety will always be the priority,  but if the city is truly serving its constituents, we must consider how to keep the library open longer.  As a continued refuge and resource for our community.  There's no disadvantage to discussing the library situation as council members since your constituents are served by it.  You have knowledge, creativity, and access to innovative ideas among the seven of you.  Many of you hopefully all ran on a platform that was solutions-oriented.  Our community needs a city council who can work together to develop out-of-the-box ideas and solutions for present challenges,  and this is a wonderful opportunity for you to continue to step into that dimension of your leadership.  Your concerns and concerns are not the only things that matter.  Your constituents would appreciate you for it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nancy Park followed by Patrick Newman.  Hi.  I would like to say a few words about this council's unwillingness to discuss issues of vital importance to our community.  Realistically, given the way the council has operated in the recent past, there will be a lot of six-to-one votes.  However, the council's unwillingness to even agendize any,  of the six issues Councilman Winslow brought up at the December 2nd meeting,  is a slap in the face to the entire community.  These issues are all important.  They include community input in streetscape projects, tenant protections,  legalizing apartments more broadly, reducing dependence on cars and new developments,  restoring neighborhood planning,  and using community development to improve the community.  These are all issues that need to be addressed.  The council has been able to design strategies to make bike paths safer.  Yet you would not even agendize one of these.  This is not the only time you have been unwilling to consider important issues.  The North State Shelter Team's 41-page plan for a managed campground for homeless people has never been agendized and discussed.  In our representative form of democracy,  we the people count on our elected representatives  to seriously and thoroughly discuss issues of concern in our communities.  The majority of this council clearly is unwilling to do this.  Why not?  What are you afraid of?  Thank you.  Patrick Newman followed by Jessica Giannola.  This is not the subject that I wanted to speak on,  but I want to say this really quick before I forget.  I was out on a four-lane boulevard again today driving,  and the traffic was blocked in the right-hand lane, down the street, cars backed up.  I pull up around a truck, city of Chico truck, two employees,  shoveling asphalt out the back of the truck with no traffic control.  I've mentioned this several times before.  It's an OSHA violation.  It's a litigation.  It's a moral issue.  I worked on highways a lot.  Traffic control is just fundamental.  It's insane that you keep doing this.  Okay, so what I'm here about is the plaza toilets.  Under Warren v. Chico,  the city is required to replace toilets when they're closed  with the same number of toilets,  with the same number of hand-washing stations,  and with drinking water.  Once again, for the fourth time in a year and a half,  a big fence was put around the plaza,  you shut down the toilets,  you knew you weren't going to reopen them.  I wish I had a clock.  Anyway.  Keep going.  Anyway, so...  Just keep going.  Your time is, it'll come back on.  Okay.  You knew you weren't going to reopen those toilets.  So at that point, to be in accord with the Warren v. Chico agreement  that you all agreed to,  you were required as a city to replace those toilets and the water.  Okay, so you didn't do it.  So I kept watching.  I contacted legal services.  I contacted the judge.  I contacted you because I came here and talked to you about it.  I contacted the Enterprise Record.  I wrote multiple letters to the Enterprise Record.  The response I got on the eve that this article came out,  we have the city public works director saying that  the toilets are in fact open.  He's saying that he's being accused of something  because I came here three days before and said that they weren't open.  Well, he wasn't being accused of anything.  The fact of the matter is they weren't open.  And since then, that one toilet was dropped outside the barricade.  That toilet's been locked.  There's no toilet paper in there.  And you're still not in compliance with Warren v. Chico  because you don't have the appropriate number of toilets,  nor do you have drinking water available.  So I've told you for five years, I don't stand and salute a flag.  I don't want to hear Christian prayers in a city where,  toilet access is denied to the poorest people.  And we do this not by accident.  We do it by design.  And you all know this.  So again, we have a situation where,  because you don't do the right thing,  you're entangled in this legal stuff,  like the Warren v. Chico suit.  And instead of learning anything from that,  that same stuff is repeated over and over and over again.  So it's not like this is an accident.  It's a game.  But it's a really cruel game  because toilets are a fundamental human right to everybody.  People in prison have access to toilets.  Everybody in the world has access to toilets.  But when it comes to Chico and the homeless and the downtown,  this game is continually played.  I don't have time to go into the whole history.  You guys know it.  I've been here a hundred times about this.  So I'm saying it again.  You're out of compliance.  You don't have the toilets over there.  And I guess it's a legal matter.  Because it doesn't seem to be a moral one.  Thank you.  Thank you, Patrick.  Our last speaker is Jessica Giannola.  And just to let the speakers know,  the timer is still going.  We are having a glitch with our system.  But the timer is still going on my computer.  Okay.  Thanks.  Hi, Council.  New faces.  I'll just start off by just backing Patrick  in the years-long request and awareness  of having public restroom access.  It's just something that every city should have,  regardless if it's going to be for people without housing  or people with housing.  It doesn't matter.  It is something that we should have as a community,  public access to the bathrooms.  Another thing that I would really, really, really like to see  is more public access to these meetings.  We have people in the community that really want to participate  and they can't because of mobility, transportation,  their age, their living situation.  And they would really like to participate.  And I would like to see that.  I would love to see more of our community be here.  And I really wish we'd see more support from,  it is you that decide that.  So that could be in forms of having a phone call in live,  live participation, not emails.  Emails are easily discarded.  I know I send them and they're not responded to.  So it would be great if we could have a Zoom option,  a phone call bare minimum, where people can call in,  they can voice their concerns,  they can celebrate with the rest of us,  they can participate.  And that's something that I really wish we'd see more effort  from you guys from doing that.  We should invite people in and not shut them out.  As always, I'll take my opportunity here for housing situations.  We have increasing numbers of people without homes.  They're not going to go away.  We have to do something as a city and as leaders  to help prevent more homelessness from occurring.  And that will have to do with policy.  It's going to be with,  what are we doing about our renting situation  or when we have people requiring three times the amount of rent  to get in, including children who are still in high school.  They have to qualify to get an apartment,  a child still in high school.  That's what we're facing.  But it takes policy change to change that.  If we don't, we continue on.  We see our situation getting worse.  It's not going to resolve.  It doesn't disappear.  It takes leadership and policy making to make those changes.  Please do that.  Your elected officials,  please do that.  We're in a lot of trouble right now.  It is up to you guys to do that.  To make those phone calls, those letters,  the reaching out to the city, the state, the county, wherever.  We are entrusting you to make those decisions and outreaches  to make the change we need to improve our city.  That's all for now.  Thank you.  Thank you.  She was our last speaker.  All right.  Thank you very much.  We'll move on to item four, public hearings.  Item 4.1, Valley's Ed specific plan adoption.  I knew I was going to do that.  All right.  And then if you do have a copy of the agenda, we have the public hearing guidelines.  So I'll just briefly go over these and then we'll have the announcement of ex parte communications.  So first is that, the announcement of the ex parte communications from council members.  Then we have the staff report.  Then we have council discussions or questions for staff.  And then we move on to the open hearing.  So the open hearing is no more than 50 minutes long.  The applicant gets 15 of those.  The public comment is 30 of those.  And then the applicant rebuttal, three minutes if it's granted.  So, and then we close the public hearing and move on to council discussion, motion if  so moved.  So with the, prior to the announcement of ex parte communications, I believe we have  council members step out of their room.  Mr. Mayor, I need to recuse myself, our home boarders, to propose new development.  All right.  We will see you after this item then.  So, and then why don't we start with ex parte communications.  Council members, please keep in mind that this does not necessarily, does not include,  for example, emails that you've gotten on this information or on this item or information  provided by staff on this item.  So we're looking for, you know, communication beyond that, beyond the normal route of communication  just from staff.  So.  And we'll start with Mr. Bennett.  I have toured the project with Mr. Broward and I have had a couple conversations with  him as well.  All right.  Vice Mayor?  I have toured the area and I have met with Mr. Broward on the project a couple times.  All right.  I'll do mine.  I have not toured the area.  I have met with Mr. Broward on one occasion where it was briefly discussed and had one  quick phone call.  Probably all of the three minutes about the project.  Council Member Taylor?  I have not toured the project site as well, but I did have a quick phone conversation  with Mr. Broward.  All right.  Council Member Wenzel?  I grew up near the project site and have always been familiar with it.  I've spoken with Mr. Broward on a number of occasions and I've also volunteered with groups  doing advocacy around the project and I have, I had comments on the draft environmental  plan that have been proposed by Mr. Broward on the back of work.  Okay.  Council Member Morgan?  I first saw the plans 11 years ago, have spent extensive time with Mr. Broward, toured  it more than once, and some time with Mr. Stevens talking about different options.  All right.  Sounds good.  We'll move on at this point towards that three-point view.  I believe we have Mr. Solvang.  Welcome.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and City Council members.  This project is one of the best projects we have ever had.  A large project has been a long time in the works, so I'm happy to be here today to present it.  I have a little outline for my presentation tonight.  I apologize for its length, but it is a large project,  so I want to make sure we go through all the details and kind of orient everybody to the project.  I'll start with the requested entitlements.  There are five applications that they are requesting approval of tonight.  One is a specific plan, that is the main plan itself, and to implement that,  there are general plan amendments, a rezone to code the property with the zoning,  and code amendments to enact a zoning overlay that would point people to the specific plan  to figure out what the rules are for the development of the site.  And there's also a development agreement, which is basically a contract between the city and the developer  to kind of explain how it's going to be built out and what is to happen along the way.  So with that brief overview of the entitlements,  we'll get into the project.  I'll go into the specific plan area and discuss what we're talking about.  It's 1,448 acres located in southeast Chico between Stilson Canyon Road and Honey Run Road.  It's east of the Steve Harrison Memorial bike path,  which is that bike path with the big sprockets on it that are very memorable,  visual when you're leaving town there on the skyway.  Access to the site is provided by East 20th Street,  which currently terminates at the project boundary,  and Skyway at the south end,  which is on this figure where there's the little curve on the bottom left-hand corner of the project site.  The soils at the site are not very good.  Everything that's not blocked off in white on this reflect soils that have very low fertility  and limited potential for various things.  It's good for various biological resources.  I wouldn't want to refute that part of it.  But it's of limited other types of use.  For instance, the county has its own agriculture,  and the agricultural capabilities are very limited because the soils are very shallow.  It's underlain by bedrock,  which is also referred to in the various documents as lahar or lava cap.  More colloquially around town, it's known as the lava cap,  which is very hard to dig and trench through because it's hardened rock.  A good visual of what it looks like out there.  On one of the mesas, this is the more relatively flat areas of the site.  There are these big flat-ish areas that undulate a little bit.  There's rock strewn about the landscape,  and you wouldn't want to try to dig a hole in this environment.  From the geotech study, they explain, they have pictures of the site  and describe it as gently sloping lava cap terrain.  Here's a typical image of the rock walls that you see out of the site.  As well as some very large oak trees that exist throughout the site,  as much so on the aerials.  Here I'm showing a figure out of the plan that shows the different slopes.  The entire site is classified by different slope types.  Basically, the take-home message on this slide is that everything in blue and purple  are steep areas of the site.  As you can see by the underlying zoning that's being proposed,  those zoning areas are mostly avoiding the steeper blue and purple,  and even most of the green areas.  Which are more of the gently sloping areas of the site.  A couple more pictures from the geotech study that show how the edges of these mesas  kind of drop off, either gently sloping down where you get some exposed rock,  or abrupt slopes down with bluffs and little escarpments and stuff.  Then eventually the low spots on the site, there's creeks.  Very little substrate in the creeks due to the lava cap parent material,  but there are some creeks on the site also largely avoided, as I'll show.  So, that's the plan that we're looking at on upcoming slides.  Back to the presentation, now we're going to get into the specific plan a little bit.  First I want to explain what a specific plan is, we don't do many of these.  It's a set of planning policies for a specific area of the community.  It's just like the general plan, but a little bit smaller.  It doesn't provide for development, or it provides for development,  but it doesn't approve development tonight.  It provides a plan that can, you know, the subdivisions and stuff would come later,  and we would compare those proposals to the plan,  to see if it's something the city would approve.  We have an example at the north end of town, it's the Northwest Chico specific plan.  It was adopted in 2006.  It's about 600 acres at the north end of town between Eaton Road and Mud Creek,  and as you can see, and this is the cover of that plan,  you see the different areas are coded for green, open space, yellow, low density residential,  medium density residential in the orange areas, and then the red areas are expected to be commercial.  And over the past 16 years, we've been working on that.  And as you can see, it's mostly built out, just like what was planned,  with mostly single family homes there and the western boundaries,  DeGarmo Park, I'm sure everybody's familiar with that community park at the north end of town.  This project, as I'll explain, would provide a community park at the south end of town.  So we start our story here with the general plan land use diagram.  It says 2017, but it was really adopted in 2011,  and it identifies five different special planning areas.  This is Special Planning Area 5, or SPA 5, the Dough Mill Honey Run Special Planning Area.  And even though it was SPA 5, it's actually the first of these five special planning areas to come forward for approval.  So we have been focusing on infill and intensification during this first decade of the general plan,  and now we're looking at considering the first special planning area  that would actually grow outside of the city limits.  On that land use diagram, we have a lot of different plans.  The first land use diagram we blow up here is a conceptual land use plan,  where the 2011 general plan gave us an idea for the mix of uses,  where they were proposed on the site.  However, it is not supposed to, the general plan explains in Appendix C  that these are not supposed to represent the relative proportions of land,  but just the mix, the variety of land uses that are expected within this planning area.  So we see LDR, that's low density residential.  That's like your RDR.  That's like your R1 stuff.  Very low density residential.  That's like Canyon Oaks, one acre, you know, half acre minimum type stuff.  MDR, medium density, medium high density, you know, R3 stuff.  SOS is secondary open space.  POS is primary open space.  And we'll have corresponding designations for the plan area shown here.  So this is actually the plan that came in to replace the placeholder conceptual plan in the general plan.  This is the proposed plan that we'll be talking about tonight.  To break it into some bite-sized pieces,  I'm going to talk about the north half and the south half.  Jumping into the north half, this is an aerial with some information put on top of it.  In white dotted, you see that's the old Dough Mill Road.  It has wagon ruts on it from olden days when there used to be wagons and stuff.  And that would be avoided by the development, as I'll show.  There's also some high voltage overhead power lines that go through the site.  They're shown in these triple line of yellow there.  And then along the northern boundary I drew, I tried to draw in the bluff.  That mesa, that area up there is above the houses below it on Stillson Canyon to the north.  So that's trying to show us where the bluff is up there.  And then if we add the open space layers to this image,  we'll see that the open space covers up most of where the trees are.  Not 100%, but a lot of where those trees, where the most concentrations of trees are,  will be covered up by the open space designations.  So that's the open space.  Secondary open space in the middle and on the right hand side.  Primary open space down low on the left where one of the creeks comes out  and kind of hits a flat area where there's those better soils that I had whited out on the earlier picture.  It does show that there's about a 300 foot buffer along the eastern boundary,  which means that we're creating a permanent eastern edge of the city in this area.  So that's what that buffer tries to do.  Along the northern side, there's about 150 foot buffer,  which means that we're making sure that the houses that are along that area  are not seen from the Stillson Canyon area and the visual impacts of the project are minimized.  So doing it in reverse, we can just turn on the planning areas for development.  The development areas are the other things, not the open space.  And those show up on the mesas, which is this big flat area here.  And they code different ways, and I'll explain the different acreages in a minute.  But what you'll see is that the development tries to be where the trees are not.  And where you see a little bit of a conflict, you'll see the lighter yellow color,  like along the Stillson Canyon northern boundary there.  And that's so that those larger lots in those areas can plant around those trees.  So you'll see the lower density being proposed where there are those tree conflicts in the planning areas.  So acreages we have for very low density residential, that's your half acre minimums and such.  You have about 18 acres of that.  Low density residential with third acre minimums, that's 131 acres.  That's in those areas I described where they're trying to avoid those conflicts between trees.  Low density residential dash SF, that's going to be your production single family home areas on the mesas where it's flat.  You can do more masquerading.  63 acres of medium density residential, that's a flexible zoning district  where you can have small houses on small lots or triplexes, fourplexes, if you wanted to do multifamily.  And then medium high density residential, nine acres of that.  It's actually sneaking up from the south side, but it's on this slide.  And that all totals about 1,420 units on the north half.  And there's a water tank site.  If this northern half were to be developed first, the water tank that would be provided would be on this side of the project.  That's why it's described as alternative site number two.  Under a different alternative, there may be the southern half of the site gets to the north half,  but if it's developed first, then we'll show you where the tank would be for that.  But this would be an elevated water tank high on the hill that would create its own pressure  and pressurize the lines and provide a little bit of security for the water system that way.  On the south half, we again see the power lines going through there.  There's actually two sets.  There's also a set that heads up the ridge.  And the bike path again is on the left.  Honey Run Road is along the southern boundary here.  Turn on the open space areas.  And you actually see in this...  We see very distinctly the Comanche Creek riparian zone going through there.  And that's all planned for open space.  That's part of the regional park that I'll explain as a component of the project.  But again, you see the open space areas trying to cover up the trees.  And then the development areas on the other spots that are more wide open.  There's about eight acres of very low density residential there, just one planning area.  200 acres of the production single family home housing.  And then 38 acres of medium density residential.  Where this whole southern half of the project site is proposed to be age restricted senior housing.  And the different product types here will allow for a variety of different types of senior housing.  And then the MDR areas is where they want to do some more of the modest cottage homes that would be relatively affordable.  And the south area of the site is about 1357 units.  And there's water tank number one.  If this site goes...  If this bottom half goes first, then the water tank would be there.  Instead of where I showed previously.  Commercial in the project is proposed mostly in the southern southwest quadrant there along the skyway.  It's about 56 acres of commercial.  And that's potential for lots of jobs.  We don't really know exactly how many.  This, again, is just a plan to code the property for zoning that will allow different types of things to be developed.  But again, it's a plan to code the property for zoning that will allow different types of things to be developed.  But using some general estimates that are common in the field, about one job per...  or two jobs per thousand square feet of commercial is a typical thing you might see there.  And then there's also potential for residential uses in the core area.  And they allow up to 35 units per acre.  So there's potential for vertical mixed use or horizontal mixed use.  And then also that's...  One of these areas is probably where the affordable housing site that is required by the development agreement,  where it would go. Some acreages for the open space areas. The regional park totals 419 acres.  That's a lot. All these acreages add up to, I think, a little over 50% of the project site.  So we have the regional open space. That's this big open space area that leaves Comanche Creek  and Honey Run Road, largely left as open space. The valley open space, another 267 acres of that  would be all these in-between areas, as well as the neighborhood parks. There's three neighborhood  parks in addition to other parks in here. There's Homestead Park and Child's Meadow Park and Pioneer  Park, and that's all part of that 267. Primary open space would be up 46 acres. That would be  the floodplain down by 20th Street and the bike path, as well as these areas up higher in the  age-restricted area where there's Butte County Metafoam in little verticals in the middle of  those areas.  And so these open space areas would provide buffers around those populations of endangered  species.  And that's following the recommendations of the biological resource reports.  The applicant's going to talk about this, so I'm going to be very brief on the village core,  but there's an image in the plan that gives you a feel of what the village core will look like,  or is intended to look like. And it would be a set of shops that would hopefully provide for  the everyday needs of the village.  So, you know, you have a lot of citizens that live there, and then that would be right adjacent to a village core park to complement that.  You know, if you're going to go buy something to eat, maybe you go out to the park to eat it, that sort of thing.  And then that leads right over to the medium high density, the R3 apartment site, and that would be between that village core area and the community park,  which is in the upper left-hand corner of this slide.  That would be adjacent to the elementary school site, which I failed to mention earlier, but there's also an elementary school in here.  That was shown in blue.  And then, like I said, the applicant will talk more about that.  There's a bunch of different things also included in the plan to complement that land use plan.  There's principles, goals, and actions that we'll use in the future to compare the subdivisions and design reviews to the plan  and see whether it's consistent with those actions to warrant approval.  The foothill development standards are largely modeled after the Mesa,  will code um foothill development standards i have two slides about the next two bullets so  talk about that but um there's also development standards of course they're also modeled  after the city's code with some special nuances like there's enhanced setbacks near still some  canyon to make sure we have enough setback from that area of the project site so they customized  it that way there's a you know imagery and descriptions of the parks and the trails  and then there's um rules and regulations about avoiding the rock walls and and the trees or or  you know compensating for the trees if they are required to be removed there's an implementation  chapter that has a whole set of financing strategies to make sure um the project's  adequately financed and then there's design guidelines that really flesh out and bring to  life the the details the types of things we talk about when we say um dark sky lighting or  earth tone colors there's examples that you can just refer to in there  um !  Firewise guidelines um were very important part of this plan it's probably the the most important  issue for the project we work very closely with the fire department throughout the um years of  the project on this and um and you know it got a lot better i think through the process  um there's it's heavy on access providing emergency access to and through the site and getting um  the emergency responders to the areas where they need to be on the site then there's the  structure hardening aspect to it meeting the building code requirements for  firewalls and other things that are required to be implemented in the site and then there's the  fire firewise construction building in these areas um then there's a vegetative fuel management plan  which has multi-prongs to it as well there's requirements for the hoa to um do vegetative  fuel management along the wui the wildland urban interface of the project and i have a slide to show  you that in a minute um so they have to provide a fire you know management along those along those  areas as an hoa then developers of specific subdivisions have to have a fire management plan  have to treat the buffer or the edge of their subdivisions.  And then there's requirements for individual homeowners  during the operations for them to plant the right types of materials,  plant materials and have their structures meeting the building code for fire code.  And there's educational aspects to it as well for the HOA moving on  to making sure that their members are aware of signing up for alerts,  the emergency response alerts and stuff like that if there is an event.  So this is what the wildland urban interface,  the WUI image figure from the plan turned out to be.  It didn't start like that.  It was different to start with.  But working out the different issues with the fire department,  we had to add a lot more edge perimeter lots.  So all the interstitial areas there with the valley open spaces  are all considered wildland interface now  instead of...  Originally, we were just kind of looking at the western boundaries  or the eastern boundaries, excuse me.  And also importantly, the final plan identifies these fire access roads  that wouldn't be available to the general public  but would be available to the fire department  to get laterally between these areas  if they discover that they're actually not where they need to be  and they need to be over there.  They'll have these abilities to get laterally across to those other areas.  Regarding the street sections,  they have these ideas to do...  And they're really good ideas to do low-impact development ditches  on the side of the road that would slow the water  and treat it as a runoff from the road.  It's a really good new method.  However, the city is not set up to deal with roadside ditches.  We have trouble with the ones we've inherited from the county.  So the solution here was to identify that the city would take care of the areas  that were custom taken care of, medians and the travel services,  between the curbs.  But they're going to have to take care of the ditches with the HOA  that are outside of the curbs.  So that will be privately maintained, as shown on this slide,  and the other street sections in the plan.  Oh, this is the slide to make sure I didn't forget to say anything important.  That vegetative fuel reduction strategy will happen annually.  It requires annual inspections by the fire department  where they'll tell the HOA what to do  and then they'll have to do it before the fire season.  So the whole process gets going.  I think I mentioned all these other things.  So moving on to the CEQA process.  We did an environmental impact report.  That's what took a lot of the time here.  Let's see, it was 2000.  We released the draft environmental impact report in November of 2022, 21, 2021.  And then we collected a...  Comments for 45 days and prepared responses to those comments  and released the final environmental impact report in October of this year.  Responding to all those comments received.  And just as an aside because I don't want to forget.  After the final impact report that responded to those comments,  we continued to receive comments up to the planning commission.  We forwarded those to the planning commission.  And that's in the packet that we included in your packet from the planning commission.  After that, we continued to produce the planning commission.  received comments which we forwarded to you via email over the recent weeks so I  just want to make sure that everybody realizes that their comments did get  forwarded whether we responded to everybody who sent them in or not they  were forwarded on to the City Council. We looked at a variety of different areas  they became chapters of the plan and everything was mitigated to less than  significant or deemed less than significant except for two areas that  could not be reduced as such and that that's that was in regard to aesthetics  and greenhouse gas emissions. So aesthetics involves the visual changes to  the environment and you know the City of Chico has had a long-standing policy of  protecting the view shed of the foothill backdrop to the urban form and you know  we've had people doing earth tone colors just so that you wouldn't look that much  different than the earth than the backdrop  and we have a lot of work going on with that.  and now we're building up off of the valley floor into that area and the visual simulations we did  visual simulations in the EIR they don't really show a lot of impressive impacts regarding  the visual changes but the thing is when you're on those roads you'll see it you will just totally  see it it'll be very apparent to people that the city of Chico isn't just that city down on the  valley floor it also extends up into the foothills now so and that's a permanent change so we just  called it what it is a significant change that cannot be mitigated because if we build the project  you're going to have this change greenhouse gas emissions a little more complicated because  for the EIR we do some modeling and there are some issues that I've articulated in the staff  report with that modeling and then we're we have to compare that to our climate action plan  and the two documents are not prepared in the  same way so we're going to have to compare that to our climate action plan  our climate action plan speaks a lot about hey if you do these things you can end up at this place  that puts you on the right track and we can't take for granted that will that the city will  accomplish all those things so we can't take credit for them and we didn't if those things  do occur they will accrue to the benefit of the you know the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions  for the project but we cannot take credit for them in the environmental impact report  so we didn't and those impacts remain significant and unavoidable  and that's the secret process I'll answer any questions any more questions you have about any of this stuff I'm just trying to get through it in a reasonable amount of time  I'm sorry this recommendation is going to even be a three-parter because I need to talk a little bit about the development agreement those are also rare it's it would be a 20-year term of an agreement between the city and the developer that it for them mostly it provides predictability vested rights to proceed with development of the project as described in the plan  the state is not going to change its mind full the road out or try to do the rules later that will undermine the projects ability to move forward it would also extend the Entitlements like a subdivision that gets approved out to the  the term of that development agreement which is a tremendous benefit to the developer they would be required to pay all existing fees even  even if they change, but we couldn't,  the city couldn't institute new fees or exactions.  And, you know, again, kind of move the goalpost on the project.  And that's to provide a predictability.  There's a bunch of requirements that the city gets from,  from those on the developer, which is there.  They have to dedicate a community park.  They have to improve neighborhood parks.  Those three neighborhood parks I mentioned at reasonable parts along the way  of the development of the project at unit 500,  at unit 1,000, at unit 1,500,  which is well in advance of the ultimate build out of the project.  So people get parks when they move in.  And also to improve the trails along with the roads,  because the road systems over here, the trail systems over here,  we want to make sure they both go up the same, it's the same rates.  Also requirements to construct roundabouts and signals that are either  inside the project or immediately adjacent as recommended by the traffic  study.  We don't do level of service in the EIR anymore.  So the development agreements,  the only place where we can get those requirements.  Oh, and then they have to implement the EIRs mitigation.  That's going to be just up and down.  And there's a requirement for an affordable housing site to be provided in  the project.  Now it'd be four acres or multiple sites that would give at least 90 units  of affordable housing.  And that's just a benefit to the city that we've negotiated.  And then for the city part,  we have to expeditiously process and review building current plans and  improvement plans.  And I think we do a pretty,  pretty good job of that anyway.  So I don't think that's a big hit for us.  It would also give them a six month grace period on building code update  cycles so that they don't have to redo their master plans right away.  They get a little grace period there.  So that brings us into the project merits.  Our recommendation is based on the merits of the project.  In this case,  we see a project that implements a general plan as I described it  implement special planning area five.  And it does so in a way that the general plan tells it to.  And I have a lot more details on that.  There's a whole general plan.  Consistency analysis that was attached to the planning commission staff  report that I think is,  there's a lot of the work for this project on showing those consistencies.  It provides land for future housing.  Housing is needed.  We all know that it will provide an actively managed wildland interface.  And that goes back to that vegetative fuel management that will happen  every year.  You know,  we expect they'll probably use some goats like we have in,  in lower park and that sort of thing can really change the complexion of  wildland.  So the joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint  joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint  joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint  joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint  joint joint joint joint joint joint  joint joint joint  joint  joint  the commercial areas will create jobs and tax revenue. And it was also a tremendous opportunity  for us to do comprehensive planning in the city. You know, usually we're just responding to project  by projects as they pop up. And this was a great opportunity to look holistically at a site  without, you know, a bunch of predetermined designs. So our staff recommendation is in line  with the planning commission's recommendation. The planning commission met on December 1st  last year and recommended what we're about to read on the slide, which is that the city council  adopt resolutions and ordinances that would certify the environmental impact report, adopt  findings of fact and statement of overriding considerations, amend the general plan and the  zoning map and Title 19, and then adopt the Valleyside specific plan and also to approve  the development agreement. And that's our recommendation. I'll try to answer any questions you have.  All right. Question.  Mr. Winslow. Mr. Sully. Hold on a second. Mr. Bennett. All right. Yeah. Council Member Bennett. Go ahead.  What happens? I'm just curious. It's a 20-year development agreement. What happens in 20 years  in one day? Does it just cease to exist or? No, we would probably extend it if we still  needed it at that point. Okay. Okay. Thank you. All right.  Council Member Winslow. It says that the build-out for this project should be 2030 to 2045. Is that correct?  The EIR looked at an ambitious build-out schedule that I think would be  ultimate build-out by like 2045. What's maybe a more realistic look at how long build-out would take?  I think 20 to 40 years is a more realistic expectation because there's going to be a  recession at some point and everything's going to go on ice.  Is there a reason the development agreement only goes 20 years?  I think it was what was proposed. I think that's your answer. Okay.  Within the development agreement, what happens if rezones are proposed? For example, I want to get  into this that the state housing community development department rejected the city's  housing element for insufficiency on some grounds. And this is probably going to be something that we  face in the future.  We have difficulty finding sites for affordable housing. This project does not propose a very large  proportion of affordable housing. If we need to make rezones in the future, would that be a  violation of the development agreement on the city's part? It could be. It would be something  we would have to negotiate. What does the negotiation look like on that? It would be the city approaching  the applicant to say, hey, we would like to talk about an amendment to the development agreement,  just as they can come to us and say, hey, we need to amend the development agreement.  And then they would come to them and say the same thing. What if they reject it? Is it a negotiation or is it something the city has authority to do ultimately?  I guess I would say we would necessarily only look at this project site to accommodate any future needs to accommodate housing element requirements.  So I'm not sure I understood what...  I think what Mike's saying is this isn't the only site where we would look to address and meet our RENA numbers.  Right. Yeah, but if the city determined that...  because they have some of these mesas that may have been unbuilt in their zone for low density residential that we need more  high density housing in order to satisfy state requirements or own community goals,  could the city do that without  having to offer some other concessions?  I think we could. We would have to kind of...  just like we tell the developers, you gotta pay for it all and we can do it.  But you have to pay for us to do all the work and get you to the hearing.  We would have to tell the developer the same thing.  Look, we have a need. We'll pay for everything. We'll make sure that...  we'll have to maybe update the EIR or something or do the work to verify that it's within the scope.  And then go back to them and say, hey, we really need to up zone some stuff.  But I'm also not sure that we'd be looking to look for higher density, higher up in these more sensitive areas,  both of you shared some of the issues that have been raised already.  Mm-hmm.  This might be a good question for Mr. B.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So, the city has no compliance with the element and the specific plan is supposed to be consistent with our general plan.  Can we adopt a specific plan without a housing element?  Well, I'll first say we are working closely with HCD on seeking compliance on the housing element.  We've submitted a draft, had initial conversations, made initial revisions,  have had subsequent conversations with HCD staff, and we'll be making additional revisions.  We feel like we're in the home stretch.  But to answer your bottom line question, I think we're in the right place.  My immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate  other way. It's usually the other way. So in this case, I don't see how HCD would have  concerns with us proceeding with projects that are approving housing.  Right. This isn't a housing project being proposed per se. We're proposing a zoning  layout that would provide maximums for how much housing can be built.  I would agree with you.  I want to ask, because I think this is, I think the concerns that HCD brings up with  the housing element are valid, and I think this is some of the biggest concerns I have  with the project, is that this does not provide a fair share of low-income housing for the  city, just like the city of Chico is expected to provide a fair share of housing for the  state. Is that a concern that the city's had, that there's not enough medium-high density  housing proposed for this development in order to help us meet our needs for housing besides  low-density residential?  Your question, again, is whether or not staff believes.  Does this project provide? So again, right now, we have not included the Valley's Edge project as part of this  eight-year horizon on the housing element to help us meet our housing needs. So it's not even contemplated  to meet the next eight years.  So in the letter from HCD projecting the housing element, they mentioned that the city's, by the city's own  analysis, our sites for affordable housing currently for the next eight years will not affirmatively  further fair housing, which is a mandate on all public agencies.  So they said that we, in the city's draft housing element, we said that that would be postponed  until we would address that in future housing elements. And they said in that letter that we should not be  looking at future housing elements to address issues. We should be addressing them in this housing element.  What I'm seeing and I'm concerned about here is that this is the future of our housing development.  This is, I believe there's more space proposed for residential development, and within this plan,  than the four other special planning areas combined.  So how do we expect to be meeting our state housing targets when there's so little housing proposed here to help with that?  There's so little land that's proposed to assist with that goal.  First, start with the comments we've received regarding our firmly furthering fair housing.  They've asked us for more information and more analysis, which we're providing.  So that's one item. Now as it relates to this project and this site,  the state digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive  about what we're proposing at this location.  I will say that I could anticipate,  for instance, Oak Valley,  Northwest Chico-specific plan,  Merriam Park,  all major master-planned areas  from the early 2000s.  Several of them had no intention  of specifically providing affordable housing.  We have three affordable housing projects  going in Oak Valley right now,  Northwest Chico,  there was one in the last 10 years,  and there's another one proceeding right now.  So the point is we're providing a land program,  which I think is what you're getting at,  that could provide for affordable housing in the future.  Some of the areas that are specifically commercial  can develop as residential.  So there is potential,  even in areas that aren't zoned purely residential.  So those commercial zones are,  it'll,  there,  there is residential development allowed  up to 35 units per acre.  This whole development in the general plan  has a maximum unit count, right?  It's like 2,777.  That's how much has been proposed  for this whole zoning schema that we're given.  If there were to be residential development  in some of the commercial zones,  would they then have to compensate  by not developing other areas?  I'll take a shot at this.  So that's an interesting question  because you had these master-planned areas  and we try to use the EIR,  the Environmental Impact Report,  to identify,  the impacts associated with build-out of the areas.  A lot of things change over 10, 20, 30, 40 years.  What we do know is that commercial development  is often more impactful,  has greater impacts than residential development.  So I would think at a time  where we would come to a situation  where somebody is proposing to only do residential  in an area that was zoned commercial previously  or that was analyzed for that commercial,  we would have to look at the Environmental Impact Report,  see where we are,  see the status of development at that point.  I believe that we could conclude  that that would be something we would do in the future,  that the impacts were captured  under the purview of the entire Environmental Impact Report.  The key things usually are the trip generation,  the greenhouse gases,  the things along those lines.  So commercial, as I suggested,  has greater impacts than residential.  So I don't think that there's necessarily a hard number,  but we'd look at that 10, 20, 30 years from now.  So, yeah.  So it's not really a hard, fast number,  only for the planning purposes now,  which we're counting zero residential units  in the commercial zones.  And we are saying this has the maximum number of units planned.  Yeah, and there may be a need  to tear off that environmental document,  dig a little deeper, do an initial study.  There may be a whole lot of new current status  10, 20, 30 years from now.  There may be new rules and regulations.  I think that's sort of my concern,  where within the merits of the project,  I don't see...  The allowance for high-density housing,  or 35 units an acre within commercial zones,  to be too beneficial,  because one is clearly the plan  is to develop solely commercial uses there.  And then two,  seems like there will be more work necessary  in order to make that happen  to where I see it as perhaps unlikely  that developers will go forward with that,  preferring to build instead low-density residential,  where you have a quick turnaround,  low investment, high return on the land  that we're offering them to...  to build out.  Thanks for keeping up with me so far.  All right.  Mr. Winslow, if you don't mind,  just to have some other council members break in here.  Oh, sure.  We can go back to you if you have another question.  Thank you.  Do we have any further questions from any council members?  All right.  Well, then we'll turn it back to you.  Okay. That was a good recess.  But let's...  Yeah. I mean, in terms of doing this, we don't...  Obviously, within reason.  So...  All right.  We'll let you...  Right.  It's a very large project.  It is.  There are a lot of documents associated with it.  Absolutely.  We're asked to make several overlapping decisions.  Yeah. No, go ahead.  And there's, I think, large questions about consistency  with the general plan, and that's...  Right. What I hope to get into.  So it does say in the description of this project  that it should provide a broad range of housing types  and densities.  I'm wondering, is there a standard that the city used  to assess this to be consistent with that?  This is a broad range of housing.  So, you're saying that there's a broad range of types, densities?  No.  There's not actually necessarily a broad range of housing types proposed.  There's a variety of zonings that could support different types of housing types.  Our go-to is this.  This shows the different types of land use,  the variety of land uses we expect to see,  different levels of residential,  different levels of open space,  a little bit of public and commercial down by the skyway,  and then that's what we have on this plan, too.  The same variety of land uses, although different proportions.  Right. So the general plan proposed, I believe,  twice as much land for medium-high density residential housing  while proposing 680 fewer units overall.  That's correct, right?  It showed as a conceptual plan with the caveat that...  Conceptual drawings are showing the variety of land uses,  but not the relative proportions or locations.  Mm-hmm.  I'd be happy to read right from the general plan.  It says...  I left it over there.  Conceptual land use plan that...  Can you go back to the conceptual land use plan?  It says the conceptual land use plan includes a collage of shapes  with land use designations that were selected  to reflect the desired uses on the site,  take into consideration existing conditions,  and accommodate projected housing and jobs needs.  The conceptual land plans do not represent precise proportions  or locations of future land uses.  So they're a starting place.  Right, right.  So there's also a policy in the general plan that says  we should allow flexibility in the planning of the special planning areas  to meet our changing housing and jobs needs.  And between the general plan and the Valley of the Pacific plan coming out,  we experienced the Camp Fire, North Complic fires.  I think the Dixie Fire may have been burning while the plan was released.  And these destroyed...  These destroyed primarily low-cost housing in the foothills  that have been like your naturally affordable housing  that is very well irreplaceable.  So it dramatically increased the need we have for lower-income housing.  My concern is that the way that the Valley of the Pacific plan  changed from the general plan conceptual land use mix  was to increase the quantity of low-density residential housing  while decreasing the quantity of medium-high density,  what would be more affordable housing,  what would qualify for subsidies for affordable housing.  So we have a policy that says we should allow flexibility  to meet our changing housing and jobs needs,  but it looks like we saw the opposite happen.  And I'm wondering at what point staff may have intervened  if you would have proposed, say, just an eight-plex.  There's one small project to qualify to meet that range of housing needs.  At that point, it's no longer a broad range.  It's simply a range.  Was there a point where that would have happened,  or did the city ever negotiate with the applicant?  For a greater mix of medium-high density housing,  given that our housing needs very clearly demonstrate  that's the sort of housing that we need?  I don't think there's a spot where that necessarily would have happened.  It's hard to speculate on that.  But we see that they're asking for their flexibility  in implementing to allow more units than anticipated by the general plan  so they can accommodate age-restricted housing.  So we see an increase in the number of units,  but it's okay.  It's okay because the age-restricted units  have less vehicle miles traveled associated with them,  and the impacts kind of balance out.  So that's the means by which the applicant is seeking the flexibility  under that general plan policy.  And at this point, we're not looking at eight-plexes.  We're looking at zoning, which might accommodate an eight-plex,  or it might not.  That's the flexibility.  Yeah, I mean, just an example of a minute share.  I just have a follow-up question.  Is there, like, an equation that we can determine  the difference between broad range and range?  No.  It could have said range, I suppose,  is what we can conclude at the end of it all.  I'm ready to move on somewhat from that.  Looking at the medium density,  within the values-based specific plan,  I think this is one of the neatest things,  is the missing middle housing that's proposed.  There's one in particular cottage court concept,  which could be somewhat higher density.  It's kind of a nuance of the proposed zoning  for this specific plan in particular.  However, medium density residential developments  that are going on in the city,  I've noticed there's one on Morseman and Eaton.  There's others in the Sycamore Creek area  where they developed, they're allowed up to 14 units an acre.  This could be a mixture of townhouses,  all the neat things that are drawn out in the specific plan.  But we're getting single-family houses packed,  relatively tightly together at six units per acre,  the bare minimum that the city allows.  Are there examples of creative forms of housing  coming out of medium density residential right now,  or is this just what is proposed in this plan,  but not what we're seeing in practice?  There are.  There are some examples.  I know there's an apartment project.  I don't know how innovative it is,  but we saw more apartments on an R2 site  and an apartment site on Lassen a couple years ago as one.  There's various examples,  but I think your point's well taken.  Most of the R2 developments are going to be the single-family homes,  small single-family homes on small lots,  which are still relatively affordable  to single-family homes constructed in the R1 district.  Is there anything in the plan or the development agreement  that says that they could not build 100%  of these medium-density residential areas  with single-family houses at six units per acre?  Nope.  Thank you.  I guess I always need to leave a little bit of room  for the applicant to one-up me  and show that he knows more about the project than me,  so maybe hold tight for maybe a final answer to hear from him,  but I think the answer's no.  Thank you.  I have one quick question for you.  In the staff recommendation,  please amend the general plan.  So I know we are not amending our general plan,  so could you specify,  why are we saying it, amend general plan?  Oh, we would amend the general plan, yes.  It would, so this...  Because I know that we have heard  it's in compliance with our general plan.  Right, right, right.  Just please clarify that.  Okay.  Are we amending certain portions  because of this specific project?  Yes.  So we can get rid of that confusion.  So there's one action in the general plan  that says plan Valley's Edge,  and pay attention to the access and the fire stuff,  and it tells you what to do for planning the site.  And then there's appendix C,  where you see this image that's on the screen now.  And the general plan amendment would do two things.  It would replace this image in appendix C  with one that looks just like that,  and it would change that policy to one,  instead of asking for a plan to be developed,  it would say the Valley's Edge specific plan  has been developed, go see the plan.  So it would go from perspective to retrospective  on the planning effort.  Okay.  Further.  Further.  In the Valley's Edge specific plan,  they described this concept of a 20-minute walkable neighborhood  because there are some commercial zonings proposed  within what I suppose would be a 20-minute walk  of any of these areas that that should,  could potentially satisfy people's needs.  And you mentioned that the commercial,  the village core would hopefully provide the basic needs  for the people who live there.  Do we have any specific plans that would support that?  Do we have any reasonable estimation  of what sort of commercial we can expect at these sites?  Has there been a market study to determine what sort of,  like is a grocery store feasible given the proposed residential units  at full build out, at half build out?  No market studies prepared by the city.  It's tricky because commercial always shows up later.  You have to have to see the houses there to know that they have the investment  will be warranted to put,  to put a store there.  So it always comes in later.  We never know how they come out.  And, you know, the Northwest Chilis Visit Plan is an example of,  you know, there's still some vacant commercial sites there.  There's some projects that got started and went away  and we're hoping one comes back.  And so it comes in later and I just can't really speculate  on what exact types of,  it'll be a market driven build out there.  I recall hearing that Whole Foods did a study  on the Park Avenue area to look at if there's a feasibility  for Whole Foods to open there.  They determined that there was not.  Marion Park currently has a,  is looking for somebody to take over a store within there.  And even with much higher residential densities,  they're not able to find somebody's suit very easily to do this.  Does the build commercial is,  or drive through,  like coffee shops allowed or drive through anything allowed with the use permit?  Does it require the conditional use permit?  I don't know the answer to that.  I don't know the answer off the top of my head.  I think they're prohibited.  I think we should ask the applicant about that.  It's a general concern that we have these great ideas  for some developments.  Like we have, I think if a neighborhood commercial site is over two acres,  we have to have some kind of vertical mixed use within it.  And so we end up having developers build 1.9 acre neighborhood commercial sites  with like a drive through coffee shop.  And it goes from this idea of this walkable area  to being auto centric because that's what's easier to produce.  It requires lower investment, whatever.  There's some preference in the industry for it.  You know, this plan probably looks the best it ever will,  like on paper, as things progress.  Like can we expect for some of the promises  that this will be a 20 minute walkable neighborhood to be met?  And could we do any kind of research to determine that it is viable  and we don't have to,  we shouldn't propose some changes in it,  like higher density housing next to the village commercial.  They have a large low density residential area  that butts up to the village core.  Has that been considered that in order to satisfy the actual goals  that are written to this specific plan that we're looking to adopt  as public policy that we should be asking for changes in the project design?  I know the applicant has looked at some of that stuff  to figure out what was viable and has looked at many different iterations  that many of which I've never even seen on this plan.  It's,  so close to the edge of town that it will be really hard  to have a major grocer see that there's a good market opportunity there.  So smaller shops is what we would expect in the village core.  That's the trick with having a 20 minute neighborhood.  If you can't get the things within that distance,  you have to find a different way to get to the stores,  which goes into my next question.  We have a general plan policy that says that we should,  in circulation 5.3,  ensure that new development supports public,  public transit.  I know that there are bus pullouts planned in the physical infrastructure.  Has there been any consultation with BCAG as to whether bus service  would be feasible here without public subsidies?  Not in extensive coordination,  but they have identified that the bus stops would be best placed down in the core  near the elementary school for sure,  and then in the core area.  And we have their design guidance on how to place those.  But whether or not any bus will actually run that route,  we don't know that.  We have historically required subdivisions all over town to provide these in case a bus route were to show up someday.  And we have them all over the place just in case.  But we don't program that,  and it's out of our hands to do so.  But if you have a driver,  like a community park and a school site and a village core,  you know,  there's again no promise,  but that is the genesis of how you get bus routes.  When you have that build out.  Yeah, to build on that,  we also had a similar thing in Merion Park.  Merion Park wants a bus route going through it really bad,  but they weren't assured to get one until that courthouse showed up.  Then they'd definitely get one.  Right.  Can I?  I believe,  and Fern,  then maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,  having sat on BCAG before,  I believe every single lot in the city of Chico is within,  what,  a half mile above a bus route?  Is that not true?  I think that's accurate.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  So I don't see why they would abandon a particular area of town.  It just wouldn't make any sense.  The more like.  Every single lot in the city is within a half mile of a bus stop.  And according to some of the state guidelines,  when you're subdividing property now through California's new rules,  because they allow you to subdivide it,  you don't have to provide additional parking spaces.  And in fact,  you are within that half mile bus route too.  So a lot of people are benefiting from that as well as,  you know,  property owners are benefiting from that.  But so are,  you know,  the splitting current lots,  because now you can split any current lot and add two units to each side if you so see fit.  So maybe a slightly different variant on your answer would be the most likely form of public transit  we should expect in the future is a shuttle for the age restricted housing that would mostly live at their clubhouse,  but would be on demand for them to get trips going to downtown farmers market,  marketplace,  or any other place wherever they want.  I'll agree they want to go.  They have to walk all the way down the hill to the bus stop that's down.  They don't have to walk there.  There's going to be EV lanes.  I should have mentioned on that slide where we saw the street sections.  There's electric vehicle lanes.  So people will have options and encouragement to have electric vehicles that will help them get up and down the hill.  Golf carts.  Yeah,  like golf carts.  Golf carts that are street legal down to the collector road,  but no further.  The family portion doesn't even have lanes for those.  No, it's just for the age restricted component and it would mostly surround this clubhouse,  which is this little triangle of the village core down here.  So, but they'd be legal throughout the entire development, correct?  Only if they have the extra wide lane.  Oh, okay.  So not all streets will have the extra EV lanes.  Sometimes hear concerns about bike lanes that go unused.  And I feel like these might be like those,  except a little bit wider for neighborhood electric vehicles.  Well, we did have an opportunity to go down to Lincoln and tour some existing sites.  And we definitely saw people using their EVs to get around.  Yeah, I would just say a family member who lives there.  I'm trying to follow your logic.  Did you not just argue for the senior living folks to have some EV free access and then turn around and say,  you don't think people are going to use these things?  I think it might be unrealistic to expect people to use those as,  if we're looking at offsetting vehicle miles traveled,  people will actually opt to own a golf cart and take the bus over owning a car.  I think that's very unrealistic given the layout of this project and given what we know about other similar projects.  What do we know about other similar projects?  Well, we know that in the city of Chico, we don't have a single bus route that is not subsidized.  We don't have a single high-quality transit route that would actually qualify for parking reductions or elimination of parking within a half mile.  The only transit priority area defined by the state with a major transit stop in the city, I believe, is the transit center.  Because there are so many routes that intersect there.  None of our routes are functioning.  And this is the area of town with Marion Park.  There's a lot of high-density housing on Forest Avenue and Dome Hill that was designed well with higher density housing and nice walkable streets.  People like to be outside.  And this is where I see the opportunity where we could establish a major transit stop, high-quality transit.  We could have financially solvent bus routes.  And I see that this project is not being designed to fulfill that role.  And because this is proposed as the very end of development forever in Chico, we're looking at a gold line on the east side.  This would be the last opportunity we have to install a major transit stop and to reverse the pattern of automobile dependence that the city of Chico is in and has been in  as long as we've been building development.  So the immediate immediate immediate immediate They'll always be like allowed to drive a car. They'll always be like allowed to drive a car. But it seems like they're proposing here that these seniors are going to drive significantly less than people. They actually say half as much as other households in the draft environmental impact report. But we're relying on that saying that people are going to drive golf carts to a bus that will come, it's a shuttle perhaps, maybe once every once in a while. We're talking about these services, commercial services and bus service.  and bus service isn't gonna come  until some of the build-outs been reached,  at which point people have already been established  in their habits of driving cars,  needing to drive a car to get places.  So I appreciate your questions,  but I don't know where you're headed.  I've got a proposal that does a lot of good things,  including meet the general plan for the most part,  provides housing, provides low-income housing,  lets other housing become low-income housing,  and I'm hearing a lot of criticism and questions,  not a lot of solutions, and I guess I'm struggling with why.  Is it I don't like the project,  or you want to create a utopia that you have in your head  that the builders that have been doing this  their entire lives can't seem to do?  Guys, come on.  It's an honest question,  because he's taking more time than I am.  It's an honest question,  because he's taking more time than I am.  I've never heard anybody take,  which is fine, it's your right.  It's a big project.  Big project you've ever looked at.  It is an easy killer.  It is an easy killer.  Citywide, the largest project we've ever looked at.  If I may, Council Member Winslow,  if you go down to the Lincoln Project,  which has some similarity to this,  they have an EV parking space in grocery stores  or in their core that are utilized all the time.  I mean, I have a family member who lives down there.  I go down there almost every week to visit them or weekend,  and they have an extensive use of electronic vehicles all the time.  I mean, it isn't limited.  They go to the store on them.  They drive them.  They range from the golf carts to the, you know,  I can't recall the name of the other one that looks kind of bubble-looking,  you know, that looks like a golf cart.  But, you know, they're everywhere,  and, you know, they use them for their golf courses too.  But they're, I dare say, they're almost more numerous than the cars.  What you were saying, Sally,  is that these golf carts will not be street legal on Skyway and Northeast 20th,  meaning you cannot get to Marion Park,  where they also drive around golf carts right now, by the way.  But you can't get from here to there legally.  That's right.  So we shouldn't be relying on a new mode of transportation  if we don't have a citywide plan for it.  We do have some attempts at a citywide plan for transit,  and for bicycles.  What I see is that this project is not fitting into that.  So when we say that it should ensure new development supports public transit,  this is the biggest new development.  We have the opportunity to plan.  And if we're not planning for high-quality transit,  then we're not going to get high-quality transit anywhere else in the city  at any point.  And so what I would like to, I mean, what I will come to,  what I think is a good idea is that the land use plan  should be redesigned in consultation with BCAG  to provide a major...  to provide high-quality transit.  So we can get from this idea of people driving around golf carts  to a potential shuttle,  which seems a little utopian in my view,  to a very realistic scenario where we have a major transit stop  because we have planned it with the planners  and said that if you have this amount of residential density,  we can anticipate that.  BCAG does have standards.  They do say in some plans about 15 units an acre is what you need.  This overall, just the built residential land,  is 4.6 units per acre.  So we're very far from that standard overall.  Just the village core, we can maybe approach that.  But it's not with this land use plan that we're being given,  which is why I think we need to talk.  If we want to ensure this development supports public transit  in a meaningful way, we need to have a condition of approval.  BCAG has their major transportation transit hub here in the downtown.  We have density all around the city.  The driver behind the use of the transit system  isn't necessarily in the city of Chico, to my opinion, density.  It's about free parking.  Thank you.  We have free parking, and people, therefore,  can very easily utilize their vehicle.  I've lived in urban centers.  It is the lack of free parking that is usually the driver.  So we are not going to get,  we may get the density in the Merriam Park area.  That might be a location for another hub.  This is a transition into the foothills.  We're looking to feather the density,  respect the terrain, and the foothill view sheds  and all those other things.  It's not the dense edge of our community.  So again, I can't imagine,  I don't believe BCAG is looking for an additional transit center.  They have their transit center,  and everything loops out of this area in the downtown.  I really appreciate that input,  and that there are certain things that we need  in order to make public transit work.  What I see is that we have not had the conversation  with our transit provider to see that public transit  could work in this development,  and that's what I think would be a good idea to resolve it,  would be to have a consultation with BCAG,  so they can see that, you know, that's a good idea.  And then, as you say, for themselves,  you need to make sure there's not enough free parking  in the village core, or you need to make sure  that there's more housing nearby so that people can walk  to the transit stop without needing to own a golf cart.  We do know that BCAG looks for approximately 15 units per acre  to have a viable corridor for a bus route,  and I think you could ask the applicant to explain  the different choices made around possibly doing that  or doing what's being proposed here.  Sorry, I'd love to hear from you.  Yeah.  So I thought, are you good?  I have one more small set of questions on the third topic.  You have this in front of you, I believe.  You could email it.  Oh, I have it in my email, yes.  Okay, thanks.  All right.  A few more.  Go ahead.  When you brought up a slide, Mr. Sully,  it showed the street with the pavement.  You said that would be publicly maintained  within these roadside ditches, I think, as you described them,  that those would be privately maintained.  Is there a map?  I mean, is this true of all the streets within the development?  Because I was understanding it was a homeowner association  with limited access like California Park  where you're not allowed to walk around in the streets  unless you have an ID.  Is that no longer the case,  or did I never understand that correctly?  I'm sorry.  I didn't realize which question you were asking there.  I don't know that the public portions of the streets  are going to be free,  you know,  freely traveled by the public,  especially the areas where the city is maintaining them.  So it's my understanding the streets are going to be  freely available for the public to use,  but the open space areas less so  because the HOA is in charge of maintaining them,  and they're going to have to look after their own needs of doing that,  which currently the idea the applicant is sharing is that  they would have some sort of like annual fee or something  to have a membership.  Just enough of a speed bump that it is a privilege  that can be taken away if you abuse it.  But the idea is that the public will be able to use  the open space areas,  the regional open space here in the site.  However, it's not without some privilege being attached to it.  So you're describing that what we expect out of it.  This isn't something that's written into the development agreement  that people do have to have access to certain areas  or not?  No.  No, it doesn't.  We didn't think it needed to be written because the public park  would be dedicated to CARD,  or the community park will be a CARD operated park.  Of course, it will be public.  The elementary school will be a public school.  Of course, it will be public.  And the public areas of the streets.  But no, in saying to the applicant,  the city is not going to take care of your open space,  we didn't also follow that with,  but you have to let the whole public use it.  We did not do that.  So something like Stillson Canyon,  there's a trail around there currently.  They could make that off limits to the public.  They could.  After we approve this project.  They could.  I do want to be open about one of my concerns here.  We have a policy and a general plan that says that it's a ban  on new gated communities.  I assume it was put in after people were upset about Canyon Oaks.  We are going to have a new general plan by the time that  build out is reached.  And if that policy is not renewed,  then there's nothing in here that would also  prevent a gated community from being built in any place within the project.  I don't think we would allow a gated community if there's publicly  maintained roads behind it.  We wouldn't let a gate off an area there's public access and public  service requirements beyond the gate.  Okay.  Very close to being done.  Is there any kind of analysis over whether this project,  again with the land use plan that's being given,  will be capable of affording through property taxes,  sales taxes,  the long-term maintenance of it?  I know this question was asked to the Planning Commission.  I believe the answer came to impact fees.  They're going to have to pay impact fees to set up the infrastructure.  That has some impact that I believe it was said would improve the rest of the city.  Those impact fees are one-time.  However,  and when we look at the long-term impact fees,  we need to have an ongoing source of revenue.  If there's one thing we can be sure of,  it's that the impact fees that we got may have covered infrastructure at one point,  but we do not currently have a city that's being paid for by property taxes and sales taxes.  This is why we just increased our sales tax and we are dramatically underfunded on all fronts.  Is there been any kind of study to look at,  like can this development afford the long-term maintenance?  No specific study.  It is following the pattern of previous development,  except the rules and regulations improve over time.  Meaning the city will take care of the paved streets,  the public parts of the sewer system,  the public parts of the storm drain system,  but the private parts of those systems before they enter the public parts  have more and more rules all the time.  So people have to put in a whole bunch of storm water separation stuff  and things that require maintenance all the time  before they can discharge into the city's portion of the sewer.  So the burden on the city has been reduced over time with newer development.  And the big hole in the bucket on that is the older development  that didn't have those sorts of rules to maintain the discharges into the city's infrastructure.  So you think that new low density subdivisions are paying enough to sustain their long-term maintenance?  Enough is a tricky part.  I have a point.  We are completely off topic.  Yeah.  And I would say that having actually agendized and promoted the one cent sales tax,  it's to fix the roads, but it's not to overcome that specifically.  It's to overcome poor priorities for the long number of time  that put us in a hole that the only way to dig out of was one cent sales tax.  And that's the reason why I put it forward.  So at this point, if you're comfortable.  That was the last question.  I just want to say as far as is germane to the topic,  there was a comment on the draft environmental impact report number 46 in the final EIR  that asked that the project analyze its ability to sustain its full cost  and maintain its infrastructure and municipal services in the long run.  The response was that CEQA does not require the cost or economic viability of the project to be evaluated.  So now that we're discussing the merits of the project,  not just the CEQA process,  I would like to ask if we've looked at the cost or economic viability of the project.  And what I understand is the answer is no, but you're optimistic maybe.  It's not largely different than other developments that have been approved in town.  And there are maintenance districts that are set up and there's HOA requirements.  So there are mechanisms for the ongoing maintenance of infrastructure.  All right.  Thank you.  So with that, we're going to take a short break.  And then we'll come back for the public hearing and hear from the applicant in 15 minutes.  Order, please.  All right.  All right.  Someone sees Council Member Winslow, if they could grab him.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  alert maybe if you could just give them a heads up at a two minute out all right if there are  any questions does that get do i get time added yeah it's additional can i start  hi um my name is bill broward i've been a resident of the chico community  since the late 70s when i moved here we would wear  jean cutoffs that were horribly short wear sandals we'd listen to james taylor and crosby  stills nash and young if my kids saw me in one of those photos back then they would be horrified  and i have changed a great deal um when our when i moved here again our community was about 28 000  people um we now have over 100 000 it's changed for me it's changed for the rest of the community  it's changed for every all of you and it's changed for everyone in this room and in this community  people before us anticipated and accommodated our lives and we need to do the same for our children  over that uh in my time here 44 years if we didn't have a document that guided our growth  and development we would indeed have sprawled we do have those documents butte county general plan  and the city of chico  general plan general plans are not easy in chico the contract was 10 000 hours for the consultant  1.5 million dollars not including staff time hundreds of meetings um i attended myself i know  there are several of you that were on the general plan task force the county's general plan says  look we know we're going to grow as a county we need to direct that growth to the city  the city's general plan says this is where we need to do it in a good way  our city council back in 2011 and our general plan is very very progressive  the general plan is important i want to read the introduction page one the chico  2030 general plan is a statement of community priorities to guide public decision making  it provides a comprehensive long-range and internally consistent policy framework  for the growth and development of the community and the community-led development of the community-led  and preservation of chico the plan's guiding policies principles and goals guide day-to-day  decisions made by councils boards commissions on the physical development of our city  land use changes budget decisions and development proposals will be considered against the backdrop  of the general plan it's really important it informs public deliberations it informs home  buyers that the lot behind your house is actually designated for a shopping center  the state digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive  and it informs public agencies on where to spend your resources, how to plan.  It is our constitution for development.  The general plan and the authors of the general plan,  again a very progressive council back in 2011,  created a written description.  This is the community's vision,  the community's expectation for what landowners and planners are supposed to do.  On this 1,446 acres,  it's described here on Appendix C,  it's the community's expectation.  The expectation is planning will result in a recreationally oriented mixed-use community  with a broad range of housing types and densities.  The written description goes on to identify 18 additional objectives,  like worthy access,  and the !  The plan is designed to be a !  Class Class Class  Class Class In 2023, Enterprise Record called it a great chance for future growth in a smart way that will keep our city Chico to its core.  Class  Class  Class  Class  Class  that kept our team engaged into what we as locals felt was really, really important.  Everything we did aligns with these five goals and principles.  The land matters.  Well, first of all, implement the Chico General Plan.  Second, the land matters. Listen to it.  That means plan open space first.  Allow nature to define what is and isn't suitable for development.  Number three, dirt's good.  Plays transformative.  Create Chico's most extensive network of bicycle and walking trails.  Make it easy to get out into the park and the forest.  Let's play again.  Item four, promote healthy and sustainable community.  We do this by making it easier for people to live healthy lives,  including age-in-place homes for seniors and multi-generational fire-resistive homes,  inclusive parks, community gardens,  and other third places.  that is a place that brings kids and seniors and families together  and really that intergenerational mix, which is so important today, more important than ever.  And complement hometown Chico.  That means respect the Green Line.  That means contribute to Chico's economic vitality, environmental stewardship, and social vibrance.  Division, a community in a park.  This is overall Chico.  We've got our natural open space.  If the state digestive system still didn't produce enough digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive  creeks closed off to people's backyards.  We would have eyes on them, open space.  We would use them for transportation, for bike trails,  much stronger resource corridors for critters.  And what we decided very early on,  the most important thing we did before we thought about anything else was  plan open space first.  And that's the emblem that we ended up with is about 730 acres of open space,  including some land for public uses.  This is how we preserve our seasonal creeks, our oak woodlands,  our heritage elements like pioneer era rock walls,  the old Dome Hill wagon road, steep terrain,  all the things that we kind of, we want to get out into.  But we,  we cherish, we want to preserve.  We had to do,  we had to plan open space first just to understand what the site was like.  And it's big.  So when it's large,  you can be very,  very gracious about what gets developed and what gets preserved.  There's a lot of parks and open space.  I want to put that into perspective,  city of Chico and card.  If you take all of lower park,  improved areas,  middle bidwell park is the golf course.  All of our community parks,  neighborhood parks,  specialty parks,  linear parks,  city of Chico and card collectively have 648 acres of parks and preserves for  this town.  The parks,  Valley's edge has 732 acres of parks and preserves.  Two of those categories,  419 acres for a regional park and 36 acres for a community park totaling 62  acres.  62% of the open space framework is designed for public use.  This is a typical character of the open space.  This is so important to be able to conserve and plan development.  Master planning is how this gets preserved.  This is typical development character.  It's relatively gentle and slope.  It's surrounded by oak woodlands that are preserved and protected.  Um,  and it,  that these are the areas that remain.  So the question is,  this is suitable for some kind of development.  What type of development depends on the size and the shape,  um,  the,  the proximity to the village core and other basic planning elements that we  consider along with density to inform a land plan from not only a dense  perspective,  city didn't ask us to provide a dense,  uh,  development along the Steve Harrison Memorial bike trail.  They gave us a directive and that means you have to look at the land and where  it is.  Before you just start putting high rise apartments there.  The final master plan,  the staff addressed this earlier.  I want to identify a couple of things.  One of the things I'm very proud of personally is the creation of the bid wall.  Uh,  butte Creek preserve that's over at a mile and a half of butte Creek Canyon from the entrance up to the diversion dam.  No housing.  Uh,  the other element that really stands apart is the trail system,  the off road trail system.  This is the backbone that distinguishes Valley's edge from other areas of the community is getting into the parks,  getting onto the bike,  getting outdoor,  being,  having,  uh,  being able to recreate outdoor with families and friends that becomes part of the daily routine.  Can I get time?  Check my,  it wants my face and it's not,  uh,  let me say you have four and a half minutes.  Um,  so again,  uh,  focus points,  uh,  along Steve Harrison Memorial bike trailers over 20 miles of trails,  major trails,  class one trails,  and again,  an irrevocable offer to gift the city of Chico of 419 acre regional park,  419 acres that hasn't happened since the bid wells and it'll never happen again in this community.  The front door.  Uh,  we talk a little bit earlier about kind of that vibrant village core the community park elementary school.  We spent a decade planning with agencies a card and to come up with the first joint use elementary school community park with all of the uses that make those make that area connected by trailways right adjacent to immediate to multifamily right adjacent to a village core.  So it's a vibrant downtown effect.  if you will, on a very small scale.  I'll burn through this, this kind of imagery.  This isn't a Safeway location.  It's a neighborhood village, a neighborhood-style grocer.  It's not a Walgreens.  It's the largest community garden in Chico.  This is a variety of housing types.  I've heard it's luxury housing, folks from the Bay Area, et cetera.  There's 11% of the land uses here are for estate lots.  That's custom homes.  34% is starter homes and workforce housing.  Another 49%, roughly half, is for single-family traditional neighborhoods.  That's 80% of Chico's market, is single-family detached neighborhoods.  So if you're going to build the market, which any supply and demand would suggest you do,  this mix is a little bit weighted towards starter homes and workforce housing.  For some of the reasons that Councilmember Winslow mentioned,  we have a greater opportunity to become more and more affordable,  and we can do that through design in many instances.  It does mean smaller lots.  It means attached housing.  But there's still opportunities for rental and home ownership at that step-down pricing level.  Voluntary subsidized housing.  We talked a little bit about that.  There's no requirement for that, but we did it because it was the right thing to do.  Again, 100 acres tied to workforce housing.  That's enough for 1,000 units.  20-minute neighborhood.  This is really important.  It came up earlier.  I'd like to spend more time on this, but effectively, Valley's Edge accomplishes each of these objectives  within a 20-minute walk or ride.  It's Chico's largest.  Special planning area, community gardens, network of walking biking trails,  voluntary oak woodland reserve.  It's Chico's first and only all-electric community.  Intergenerational community.  It's 100% neighborhood electric friendly, and that is the way people will be getting around.  Firewise, these are local agency acknowledgments.  How much time?  We have one minute.  All right.  Chief Standridge.  Chief Madden.  Chief  Kevin Bultema.  Ann Willman with CARD.  We've worked with all these agencies.  They've given us acknowledgment that how we've approached it is the right way, and I believe  they'll support the planning process.  I want to close with the general plan.  Our sphere of influence, our green line, our parks and preserves, our resource-constrained  areas, and our five special planning areas.  What Valley's Edge does is create a gold line on the east side of Chico.  That's a tight urban core.  That's a very compact core.  And what's best about Valley's Edge, I think, if it could locate in any of the areas around  Chico, it is located right next to Chico's largest business and employment center.  So we talk about commuting.  I mean, there's no place else we could put a large master plan community than right next  to southeast Chico.  I'm probably good, so I'll address any questions.  All right.  We're done with this time, yes?  Yes.  Okay.  Just wanted to make sure.  Unless you had questions for him.  Okay.  Do we have some questions?  Go ahead, Mr. Moore.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  Mr. Brower, could you expand on the 20-minute neighborhood idea, and is it possible to bring  that slide back up?  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  So there's lots of definitions of smart growth, right?  It's not some obscure principle.  Thank you.  It talks about...so this is the ability to meet most of your average daily needs within  a 20-minute...I call it a 20-minute walk, but they also add cycling in here.  On the right here, you're talking about parks, playgrounds, community gardens, sports and  rec facilities.  The next quadrant here, you're talking about affordable housing options, aging in place  together, housing diversity.  Walkability, safe cycling networks, local public transportation, jobs, employment opportunities,  local shopping, local health facilities.  We don't know that there will be a health facility, but in the senior community, health  and wellness is a big part of that.  So we do expect that medical...that there will be a lot of medical support and medical  facilities eventually developing in that area.  And then local schools and lifelong learning institutes.  So all of that...  these we hit or we promote it won't again it won't be a safe way center it's going to be some  village scale grocer that can take care of your daily needs i in my head i think of something and  you know where you've got daily meats and cheeses and just you stop there on your way home or you'd  ride your bike there and you grab a lunch at the community center and it's all part of a small  village core so that's the 20-minute neighborhood and it's one of the it's one of the benchmarks  of a of smart growth and a sustainable design we can't assume smart growth is infill development  you know how many sites there are on the market right now for infill development for single family  none zero you can't rely on a single strategy which is the founders of our general plan identify  so redevelopment  and special planning areas i hate to cut you off but you're past answering my question which is  going to get me in trouble with mr winslow appropriately could i ask you another question  sir yes how long have you been in planning of this development you and your colleagues  um uh well 2023 so we started in 2017 okay that's been uh i could get credit for the next year so  it's 14 15 years  but in your head when did you start this because i saw plans for this before that  no i said 2007 i'm sorry yeah i was gonna say yeah no i i had brown hair so 2007 you had what  i had brown hair i didn't have children and my wife and i just got married  so uh and then just my last question i'll turn it over to my colleagues uh how have you found  the city staff to work with as far as keeping this applicable to the general plan and all the  generalities that you needed to hit um i found the city staff to work with as far as keeping this  very thorough and very tough um there and in most all instances at the end of the day i think they  made the plan better it wasn't always what i wanted to do but in my heart of hearts i i knew that it  was the right thing to do thank you those are my questions thank you mr mayor all right mr winslow  mr bravo how have you changed the plan  in response to criticism either from the public or city staff um well the first plan well  evolution of the plan has been going on uh for over a dozen years i've had over 600 people on  site many of the amenities and many of the components out there were inspired by the  conversations with chico with friends environmentalists recreationalists fire professionals  housing professionals and i think that's a very important part of the plan and i think that's a very  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous generous  Let's keep that in open space.  The most recent was after reading the draft EIR,  and the environmentally superior alternative said do two things.  Eliminate, I think it just said eliminate equestrian ridge,  and we eliminated all of the development in Butte Creek Canyon  that would have been visible from parts of the floor.  So we over-delivered on that,  exceeded the expectation from the environmentally superior alternative.  The other thing we did was increase some of the density  from lower density up to medium density  to accommodate more affordability in some of those valley areas  right next, within a short walking distance from the village core.  Multifamily in the village core, the subsidized housing,  that was kind of a joint.  We wanted to do something.  Staff wanted us to do something.  We will continue to work with Butte County Housing Authority in that  and look for other opportunities.  Literally, it's a decade-long history of refinements and tweaks and changes  in response to either city staff pulling at those issues  or members of the public, including a great many of the opposition.  So between the draft environmental...  I think you said the draft environmental impact report being released,  and now the changes you alluded to,  there's some areas of very low-density housing that were removed.  There's one, I believe, one area, the nine-acre section,  it's PA-22 on this one map that I have that nobody else can see,  but there is a section that was up-zoned from low-density to medium-density in the proposal.  Yes.  Did you find that that complicated the financial viability  or the economic viability of this development to you?  I did not.  I didn't analyze the economic viability  of a decision like that on a site of this scale.  What we're really looking for, we're starting with,  is character, quality, respect for the natural resources.  That was a push to attract more of that workforce housing  in a really beautiful setting.  These aren't the worst sites.  Those MDR sites are in beautiful areas.  It'll be surrounded by oak woodlands.  I mean, we saved the best  for some of the...  We saved the best for some of the workforce housing.  And that's the attached product.  You want to do that.  You can do townhomes, condominiums, courtyard products.  Cottages, I think, are the best opportunity we can get for those real, affordable, smaller units.  I mean, you're talking homes that are less than 750 feet.  So that's how you're going to...  If you were to be asked by staff or by anybody to take some of these other areas  that are near the western edge of the project,  and take them from low density residential to medium density residential,  at a certain point, would you see that that compromises the viability of the project?  It would compromise...  I don't know if it would compromise the economic viability of the project,  but I can tell you it would compromise viewshed.  And we don't like to put higher density things further away from the village core.  For medium density, you think it would compromise the viewshed?  Well, medium density, I thought you were shooting for higher densities.  I am.  I would, but I was now asking about medium density just because I'm seeing what happened  in the changes made since the DEIR and trying to see where it would go.  I'm a real ground person.  I mean, every site in there, every property line, I know it in the field.  I know what oak trees are protected and which ones are isolated out in the middle.  I'd have to look and see what you're referring to.  Tell you whether or not it would be within the character of the plan area,  in order to make it more medium density.  But we've got 100 acres of medium density product,  which is enough for 1,000 dwelling units that the community doesn't have now.  And maybe it won't get for 20 or 30 years, but at least the land will be there,  plus the land in the community in the commercial area, which, as we've said earlier,  that's where we can find more opportunities for subsidized development  if the city has an interest in doing that.  So if I were to ask you, what was the rationale for taking, you know,  in the conceptual land use plan, the general plan,  taking the amount of land allocated for medium-high density,  lower-cost housing, and cutting it in half?  Can you tell me if you said few shed impacts?  No, we didn't cut it in half.  We actually expanded it significantly by having multifamily and allowable land use  in all 50 acres of the village core.  We don't know exactly where that might go,  and we don't know exactly what kind of commercial will be developed there.  This isn't a footprint for  subdivisions.  This is, again, when we take the general plan and we make a microcosm of it,  we're still not down to the point where we're identifying where buildings are going to go.  Right.  I hope you can understand why allowing residential use in a commercial zone is different from  allowing higher density residential use in a residential zone,  and just saying HCD does not count the same commercial zones because you don't have the  expectation that housing will be built there.  But we do have the expectation that housing will be built where,  where we have the zonings.  So I guess I'm struggling with this concept of the view shed is the concern for not having  more higher density housing.  And if we can agree that some of these things, like in the 20-minute neighborhood,  housing diversity, walkability, local shopping centers, employment opportunities,  all these are benefited by having more density near the village core.  You're saying that the concern that was the view shed impacts,  that's why we can't have more medium high density in other parts of the development than  the nine acres that is proposed.  Well, in some areas I would say yes.  I mean, our idea is we don't like to have rooftops over oak trees.  We've got beautiful, majestic oak trees.  So in some areas, the idea of a transit over all of the other project objectives,  we're not going to reach.  We're not going to be able to do 15, 18, 18 units per acre.  If we did right along that core, everything west of the power lines, that's 2,800 units.  There'd be no project left.  There'd be no planning area.  There'd be no housing stock.  5,000 units.  There'd be no housing for single-family detached housing.  So it's a mix of things that are meant to anticipate and respond to the market,  but also respect the site and the land under it.  So where I really struggle with that is we're being asked to adopt a statement  of overriding considerations, saying that the significant unavoidable aesthetic impacts  are worth the benefit because of the housing that we need that you're describing.  But you're saying that we can't use this land to satisfy our housing needs because  of a potential aesthetic impact.  Oh, I, I, this land,  this land is being, is satisfying your housing needs.  This land is providing a master plan within an open space framework for 30, 40 years.  How can you argue it's not satisfying?  The optimistic proposal for this development's build out is two planning periods for housing  element, eight years.  Right now, our current one, eight years, this would provide one-tenth of the low-income  and very low-income housing that we need.  It's, it's not tiered towards our housing needs.  It's tiered towards what you're describing as 80% of the Chico's market desiring, you're  saying, larger single-family houses.  I wanted to ask, where do you get the last?  Wait, I keep questions up.  Mr. Rowdy, where does that?  Gentlemen, if we can keep questions as questions and answers as answers, that will be the best  way to go.  Thank you, Mayor.  The 80% of Chico's market wanting a single-family house, where does that factor, where does  that come from?  That's been kind of traditional, I think.  I don't know, maybe there's someone from the realtors that can speak more to it.  I know that there was 11, 12, 13.  We have about 1,200 single-family homes, and including townhomes and condominiums sold,  and by far, the majority of those are going to be single-family homes.  We just don't have the townhomes stock.  So that figures independent of the vacancy rate on multi-family units that are newly  constructed?  Yeah, I don't, I, I do know that, that subsidized housing was just put on land that was, it  existed because it was shovel-ready.  And that's what Valley's Edge does, is provide shovel-ready land whenever the market needs it.  Thank you.  I have three questions, but they're easy ones, I think.  655 acres.  The Northwest SBA, when it built out, was about 600 acres into about 16 years, we're told earlier this evening.  Am I hearing this as a 20- to 30-year build-out, approximately?  20, I think, is super aggressive.  We go through economic cycles.  We're heading into one now.  It all depends on what other areas are available and shovel-ready.  Perfect.  This isn't going to be built overnight.  We're planning for my children to buy a home someday, or maybe grandchildren.  It provides land for generations of families and generations of builders and architects.  Okay.  And then there was another slide that said,  this is an...  It's an all-electric community.  Can you expand on that?  Yeah.  Because it went by us.  Again, no requirement for us to do this, but just in the interest of sustainability,  we do believe that California and the world is going to all electric, no more natural gas.  We made that commitment well in advance of any requirement to do so.  Perfect.  And then my last comment was there was a question earlier on BCAC.  My understanding is you guys met with BCAC.  I actually serve on that committee.  So I know that it is in our requirement to ensure that we are taking bus routes to everywhere,  which is highly subsidized by the state all across the state of California,  and absolutely nobody is sustaining their own bus system.  But you have met with BCAC and there will be buses be going at that, correct?  I did, and they advised us to have transit stops,  and they can't commit on the bus service we're talking about.  Again, a planning document, a policy document.  Perfect.  Okay.  And to correct earlier, Valley's Edge is 100% electric vehicle friendly.  All of the roads are electric vehicle friendly.  Skyway is not.  So there's no access off that.  Great.  Thank you so much.  Neighborhood electric vehicles is what you're referring to?  You say all electric?  So those lanes will exist in the family section of the project.  I think we were getting the other.  Neighborhood electric vehicles on the main collector, they have their own lane.  Yeah.  And the families in northern half of the project, they also have those.  The whole project.  Neighborhood electric vehicle doesn't need a separate lane.  It can drive in an automobile lane when you're under 35 miles an hour.  And I think that's going to be, I think you're going to see a lot of that here.  I also think you're going to see a lot of it in the family, in the other section.  And you'll see a lot of electric bikes because we've got off-road trail systems.  All right.  That goes everywhere.  Council Member Bennett, did you have a question?  I just have.  A comment.  It's not a question and it's not a requirement.  It's just a thought.  We hear so much about the affordable housing issue.  And I think we're going to hear more about it this evening from folks.  So I'm just going to make a friendly suggestion to perhaps you can give thought to additional affordable housing someplace, somewhere, somehow.  Otherwise, thank you for the presentation.  Enjoyed it.  All right.  We'll move.  Any more questions?  All right.  We'll move on to the public comment.  How many speakers?  We have 59.  I was hoping you'd say 30.  All right.  So public comment in a hearing is limited to 30 minutes.  But with my colleagues' understanding, I'd like to give at least everybody one minute if everybody's willing to do that.  Yes.  I'm seeing not a heads.  So let's do one minute at a time.  Okay.  And if...  If we could have, again, the quieter and faster we move if we have folks lined up and move through this.  You know, we have said this in the past.  I know it was at past council meetings that I've said to...  Been at two when there was a large crowd.  If, in fact, we have someone who's already said everything you're going to say, you know, come up and say, hey, I just, you know, believe everything that was brought forward before.  And I don't necessarily need to continue making the comment because...  Although we appreciate it.  If everybody's comments, I know we've gotten a lot of emails.  There is a lot of information out there for us to digest.  So anyway.  Okay.  And then as I call the first two names, please go ahead and line up in the quarter.  That will take a little less time.  Caitlin Dalby followed by Keith D'Aglio.  Don't start it yet.  I've been waiting very patiently.  I don't know if you saw me dancing out there.  Excuse me.  Okay.  We're ready.  Are we doing...  Did I hear one minute?  One minute.  It will go...  Okay.  So because the system isn't set up for one minute, I'm going to have to enter it.  So as soon as you start speaking, I will turn it on and it will reflect one minute.  Thanks.  Thanks for clarifying that.  All right.  Sorry.  I heard the one minute and I started having to figure out where I'm cutting my one pager out.  Good evening, council members.  I'm Caitlin Dalby.  The executive...  Director for Butte Environmental Council and the Chico Unified School Board President.  I want to start by just letting everybody know that it's important to state for the record that Butte Environmental Council is not anti-development.  We are pro-smart growth.  So we do see a need for development and we do see a need for planning in a smart way for our community to grow in a way that is for future generations.  For example, not too long...  I'm going to go back.  Butte Environmental Council endorsed the Merion Park development plan in its original form.  With its mixed-use buildings, walkable space, and communal essence, it was the type of development that the organization agreed made good progress toward a smartly developed future.  Unfortunately, that project was not implemented quite as well as originally designed, and yet that design is still better than the design of this Valley's Edge specific plan.  Really, one minute?  Oh, my gosh.  Thank you.  Okay.  Before I walk away, I'm going to say that Bill and I did speak on this.  Keith D'Aglio followed.  And we had good conversations about it.  And I wish that he would have heeded those suggestions that we made for him.  Okay.  So that's difficult for me to call the other names.  So please...  Yeah.  He interferes with us calling the next person and their ability to speak.  So if we cannot over-speak people...  Before you start, let me call the next speaker.  Elizabeth Devereaux, if you could come to the center aisle, please.  Thank you.  So, Keith, go ahead.  And I will start it.  Good evening.  I'm Keith D'Aglio.  I'm here on behalf of Ms. Ginger Drake, who's attending the meeting to represent her interests  regarding the impacts to her from the project.  To begin, Mrs. Drake is not taking position on the project and is not here to discuss  the merits of the project.  She's only concerned about the impact to her and her properties.  Mrs. Drake is the owner of 525 acres of underbilt land that's within the southeast Chico-Village  She's the owner of the land that's within the southeast Chico-Village area.  She's the owner of the land that's within the southeast Chico-Village area. Mrs. Drake is the owner of five hundred twenty five acres of under built land with this within the southeast Chico sewer assessment district. The perfect purpose of the district is to construct a sanctuary sewer infrastructure to serve the parcels within the district. As a owner of this land, she has paid in the bonds to fund the installation, the sewer system serving the district.  digestive As a owner of this land, she has paid in the bonds to fund the installation, the sewer system serving the district.  digestive  digestive  digestive  digestive  digestive  digestive  digestive  digestive  she is requesting that parcels not within the district are not allowed to connect and she is  concerned with that's that yes thank you elizabeth devereaux followed by jacqueline chase  this is the race i want to say that uh this precious land is huge and it's the size of  bridley and now home to mountain lions bears wild cats and to many birds and endangered species  could be approved as a mega development for a relative few or preserved for the use of all of  chico as bidwell park is it could be called upper park south or maybe broward park  it is not what is usually understood as infill as city staff calls it infill would be downtown  in the general plan opportunity sites underutilized areas with walkable wide sidewalks tree canopies  small electric buses and mixed use housing housing promoting community safety and affordable housing  for many people who can't afford to live in valley's edge our smart growth vision doesn't  need new expensive infrastructure  have 23 000 car trips a day and horrendous traffic or promote existential climate change  thank you jacqueline chase followed by tyler schrock  hello i just um i'm going to make a couple of comments about uh fire which is a concern of mine  first of all i've been hearing uh i heard tonight and i've seen in the plans  a kind of weird reference to the wii the wildland wildland urban interface  as in the wildland urban interface and i think it's a good idea to make a comment on that as well  i think it's a good idea to make a comment on that as well  if this project only touches um on its edges to the wildland urban interface but in actuality the  entire project will be in the wildland urban interface because it's not about an edge so much  as a distance to um certain vegetation so i just feel like that needs to be brought up um i feel  like we're getting a lot of sunny assurances but i would like more analysis especially when it comes  to fire and i feel like this out of the box it's going to be out of the box and i think it's going  to be out of date because the um state of california is asking for uh actual risk analysis and i didn't  see any in any of the plans i just saw a laundry list of of the um firewise that's not enough  thank you tyler schrock followed by gene thatcher  how's it going my name is tyler schrock i own north from adventure sports right down the street  um i've been working with bill for 12 years  building trails maintaining trails i've seen this project since it was 14 pages long  um i've been out there probably more than bill has it's amazing um i don't know about all of you in  here but i don't want to live on the third floor of a marion park apartment it's not my thing um i  would like to live someplace like valley's edge um if you go out there right now and you look to  the south you see beat creek canyon you see houses on skyway you look north you see highway 32  development you see cal park  canyon oaks this land will be developed at some point why don't we develop it in bill's vision  with trails with with open space i don't want to live in your vision of chico i want to live in  bill's vision of chico so gene thatcher followed by jake morley  happy new year's tell me when you're starting go ahead  oh it's red  okay so um i have several concerns it sounds like a beautiful project and i uh but still  uh there are some really serious concerns i have first is uh i'm wondering about our  infrastructure our traffic is already horrendous and uh also uh the uh roads outlets where they  come out at 20th street and skyway are already the the traffic is is unbelievable and that  area uh the other thing is that uh about sewer how much is that going to cost us to uh because  the sewer our sewer system is already going to be overtaxed with paradise being added to uh the  sewer system plus sewer system is not in very good shape so that's a big concern uh also uh  i have i'm wondering how many of the people that work on this project are going to be local  contractors and local workers i think that's a big concern i think that's a big concern i think that's a big concern  that's a big concern i think that that's really important  thank you thank you  jake morley followed by david welch  hi good evening uh thanks to mike sauley and staff for carrying the project the project is thoroughly  planned out with a forethought integrity if you approach bill in the last 14 years he did  everything he could to make sure that your concerns were addressed through through uh  implementing them in the project the project should be championed  uh as a way to involve a community plan and incorporate natural resources open space and  housing and commercial land the question for the council tonight isn't if this project  shouldn't be a growth area the question for the council tonight is if this scope of that  bill's vision should be improved and the answer is yes thank you  thank you jake david welch followed by bill monroe  hello chico clearly does have a need for more housing but it has a need for housing to meet  the needs of the people that are already here and to meet the needs of the growth that will occur  naturally an  an  think we have a need for the kind of housing that is designed to artificially accelerate growth by  being marketed to people from outside the area. And there are, in fact, a lot of potential  opportunities for development within the existing urban boundaries. There's a lot of completely  long-term vacant commercial property that could be rezoned for housing. There's the barber yard.  There's the continuing build out of Merion Park. There's a lot more opportunity to build  housing in this community without yet extending up into this kind of area. So I think that needs  to be delayed farther into the future. Thank you. Bill Monroe, followed by Brandon Slater.  Hi, Bill Monroe, 234 West 4th Avenue. I do a lot of political stuff,  and I know that there are tons of Airbnbs in our neighborhood. Where have all the housing  gone? Gone to Airbnb, everyone. And will this Valley's Edge thing allow non-owner-occupied  Airbnbs? Or is some hedge fund manager going to come in and buy up all the medium-density housing  to rent as Airbnbs by the week or day? And I think that's something that should be clarified  and maybe worked into their HOA.  Thank you. Thank you, Brandon Slater, followed by Brad Johnson.  I'm Brandon Slater, and a few years ago, I had this idea that I was going to solve the  housing crisis here in the state. Anyways, I built a house. My first idea was that these  crazy developers were making too much money, so I built a house and lost, didn't do so well on it.  And I found out that it does actually cost a lot more to build. And anyways, now I'm building,  I got finished in my first 300, six 300-square-foot houses, and I want to build more, but there is  no land in Chico to build. I cannot find anything. I'm currently buying houses that  are on large lots and splitting them to be able to build these 300-square-foot houses.  We need housing diversity. I mean, this is,  I think we need all types of houses. I want to quote Senator Scott Weiner,  Democrat. He says, we need more housing of all types, meaning market-rate housing.  Thank you. Brad Johnson, followed by Annabel Grimm.  First off, I'd like to thank that gentleman right there for his knowledge of this project  and your insightful questions. Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I knew I was going to come here and talk about the technical details of this project,  and I found out I don't know crap, so I'm not going to be able to talk about that very  much, but I'll express my concern here, which is the great American philosopher Mike Tyson  said, he said, every boxer has a plan until the first time they get hit in the face. My  concern here, based on what I saw, I've been in California for 60-plus years, what I saw  in Sacramento, where I grew up and the developers got a hold of me, and I said, I'm going to  walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk  the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk  the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk  the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk  the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk  the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk  the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk the walk  parks, community centers, and neighborhood parks. In 2022, CARD provided 118 sports leagues for  nearly 8,000 adults and youth, served 1,100 children per month in the after-school program,  and offered nearly 450 classes to 3,200 community members. We do not envy the difficult decision  before the city today regarding growth and development of our amazing community. We do,  however, appreciate your consideration of any projects presented to the council that  intentionally and responsibly aim to increase recreational parks and facilities and opportunities  to help CARD meet its mission of providing recreational opportunities to the community  in a coordinated and cost-effective manner. Thank you. Thank you. Steve Depa, followed by Nancy Park.  Good evening. Thank you for all your time and patience.  I'm Steve Depa. I'm two-time past president of North Valley Property Owners Association of the  local apartments and two-time past president of the Sierra North Valley Association of Realtors,  so I've been involved in real estate for a little while, 40 years. From my knowledge of the other  special planning areas, and I've studied them, they're owned by multiple different parties and  people and things as such.  I've been involved in a number of different projects, but I've never been involved in a  project that will never be able to coalesce around a plan like Bill Rawert's. I don't think you'll ever see a project in Chico this well-thought-out, this well-planned, that offers everything that it does and meets the needs of the general plan and provides housing that will allow people to move up and to move up housing, workforce housing, and replace that lower-cost housing. This will be the best project you'll see in our lifetimes, in my opinion. Thank you so much.  Thank you, Nancy Park.  Followed by Carl Hinker.  Proponents of this development are touting it by saying Chico needs this housing and by painting those of us who oppose it as anti-growth. But do we need a development of 1,400 acres? Take a drive around town, especially to the north and east, and you will see a robust building industry. Buildings are sprouting up all over. Merriam Park is being built out and major housing developments have already been approved off Hicks Lane and west of Bruce Road.  The real questions here include, will these homes be affordable for working class people?  How many people currently living and working in Chico can afford this housing?  How many residents of this development will be people from outside the area?  We don't need Valley's Edge with its negative impacts on water supplies, fire safety, oak woodland habitat, and our infrastructure.  Thank you, Carl Hinker, followed by Austin Barron.  I want to commend Bill for his foresight in developing this plan.  There's a lot of talk about affordable housing, and affordable housing is almost impossible to build in today's environment.  With the cost of land, the time it takes to do a development, and the cost of building.  You can see that in Paradise.  We lost a lot of affordable housing in Paradise, and we just cannot build it back in Paradise, even with the low cost of the land.  And because of the cost of construction, inability to get labor and materials, and the time it takes to build houses.  So that's a whole different discussion that we need to have.  This is the best, as Steve Depp has said, one of the best plans we're going to see in our lifetime.  And it's not going to be built in my lifetime.  It's going to take a long time before this plan is completely developed.  Thank you.  Thank you, Austin Barron, followed by Kim Hawley.  Good evening, Council.  My name is Austin Barron.  I'm an Architecture Review Board member for the city, as well as a board member for the Sierra North Valley Realtors Association.  I want to start off with, I think it's pretty laughable to attempt to solve all of the city's problems with one special planning area.  The facts are, this is the definition of smart growth.  This is the definition of better neighborhood.  This does finalize Chico's compact urban form.  It does follow the general plan.  It creates needed housing and helps create generational wealth for its citizens instead of living in apartment complexes.  It creates tens of thousands of jobs, helps preserve with public access to parks and greenways.  It appears to be a walkable and bike-friendly community.  That, as I said, encompasses the spirit of Chico and accomplishes our housing needs.  Thank you.  I think everyone who's here, everyone who's coming before me said it perfectly.  I don't want to live in Addison's Chico.  I want to live in Bill's Chico.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Kim Hawley, followed by Mary Kay Benson.  Good evening.  I live immediately next door to the Valley's Edge site.  I've spent years hiking the entire area.  I am absolutely convinced that this is a correct place and correct use of the land is Bill's vision for Valley's Edge.  And I urge the council to please say yes.  I know there's some folks that don't want Chico to grow.  They want it to stay small like it used to.  Well, that's not going to happen.  Whether we build Valley's Edge or not, Chico is going to grow.  The only question before us is how we plan for that growth.  We can be smart about it and manage it through well-designed, well-planned and environmentally friendly developments.  Or we can put our heads in the sand and end up...  with a random, haphazard, one cul-de-sac at a time approach to our town.  If we fail to plan, we plan to fail.  Please vote yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mary Kay Benson, followed by Rob Berry.  Happy New Year, City Council.  I just want to pay homage to the Mechoopda tribe.  This is their unceded occupied territory.  Probably the first real estate deal was bid well going down to Mexico and getting land deed.  Didn't turn out well for that group of people who still live here.  But I have studied with Allie Meadors Knight.  She is the traditional ecological master recognized by the tribe.  She does talk about the...  If you remove 20% of the oak trees, which bring the water level up,  is why we have...  wetlands there and all of the nature that you're trying to market but you  take those out and it will turn into a desertification if you want to listen to  the land I say we listen to the Machu Picchu tribe this is privatized open  space it is a beautiful vision it does not meet the general plan now because  the housing element is part of the general plan. Rob Berry followed by Derek  Sanderson. I just have a simple comment you know it's not fair to make the rules  and then criticize someone for following them and this plan is I don't think you  have a legal basis for denying the plan but on the other hand I think we ought  to count our blessings because there are a lot lesser plans that would accomplish  a lot less that would still be legally permissible on this land so I urge you  to approve it thank you. Thank you Derek Sanderson followed by Nancy  Prasler.  Good evening Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council. Valley's Edge is a good step in the right  direction for Chico it's been said this is going to be built over the next 20-30  years it's not going to be built overnight and there's still time I've  sat in this chamber so many times when developers and building plans have come  forward and they've asked for modifications to plans that are already  in place so there's space to be able to change things  if we have a plan that is going to be changed we have to have a plan that is going to have a  we absolutely have to as a city but it does fall in line with the city of  Chico's mission and that is to protect and enhance our community's quality of  life for present and future generations the City Council and city staff are  committed to ensuring that Chico is a safe place to raise a family an ideal  location for businesses and a premier place to live in Valley's Edge does this  thank you thank you Nancy Prisler followed by Christine  Mueller I'm Nancy Prisler I'm co-president of the Mount Lassen chapter  of the California Native Plant Society CPS and a letter was sent from a program  manager of CPS regarding comments on the Valley Edge specific plan EF EIR just a  couple of comments  for the Valley Edge specific plan EF EIR just a couple of comments for the Valley Edge specific plan EF EIR just a couple of comments for  from her the project will compromise Chico's invaluable natural resources  including special status species oak woodlands and hydrological features like  vernal pools the project site contains valuable and increasingly scarce native  habitat including multiple bands of blue oak foothill pine woodland grassland  areas of the site include native wildflowers with occurrences of the  federal and state endangered butte county metaphone with associated wetlands  including vernal pools and swales that often contain rare plants the  area of the site is a  the EF EIR fails to adequately respond to many comments regarding rare plants raised during the draft EIR comment period and in light of these deficiencies the city should not verify the VESP EF EIR thank you.

The loss of this valuable resource will not help address  Chico's pressing housing needs, which are for moderate to very low income housing. It is very  unlikely that most people in Chico can afford these homes with HOA fees and the rest of the  density. Jim Stevens followed by Laura Flacard. I apologize if I'm not getting your names exactly  right. I know I'm getting Jim's right. So there you go. Greetings. I think the issue before you  here tonight is a policy interpretation issue. It's not a project issue. The policy is the  general plan, and the interpretation is the implementation of that plan, and I think that's  your job tonight. This plan is by far  a  a  a !  consistent plan with the general plan that I have seen in my 35 years of practice, and it most  closely represents the community preference for what they want to see for delivery of  development in Chico. I was on that task force, and I remember the brain damage for the three  and a half years that we brought it to the public. This specific plan is just what the  city is looking for, and to deny it now would reject that community effort, and I think  and it would risk i think more stridently putting additional pressure on other areas that haven't  been as thoroughly or deeply analyzed i think this is much better than any of the proposed alternatives  mr stevens you've come before this body and talked about making adjustments to the green  line and different things to protect agriculture and add potential more housing if not this then  that's that's it that's a good question i'll be brief i i think the risk by not  i'm sorry folks if a council member does ask a question to a member of the public they are  allowed to answer the question thank you i think that the risk in in denying it this at this point  because has been mentioned we're growing we're going to continue to grow and the thing in  talking about all the different types of housing affordable multi- 항 digestive digestive  multifamily estate lots.  What's the bottom line is that we need housing.  We need housing here.  We are the employment center of our whole region.  And if we don't have housing opportunities,  then the people that work in Chico are going to commute in from Oroville,  from Gridley, from Biggs, from Red Bluff, from Corning.  We see that now.  And what happens then is that our greenhouse gas loads jump tremendously.  We have folks driving on our roads without being local,  so they haven't paid impact fees to help maintain them.  And I think another threat is that those folks will take Chico paychecks  and spend them in other communities.  I think we need to have an adequate housing supply here.  Thank you, Mr. Stokes.  Thank you.  So Laura Flacard, I think, and followed by Carol Serrano.  Hi, good evening.  I address the City Council this evening in support of Valley's Edge.  My husband has been in the trades for 20 years,  and I have been in the home industry for the last 15 years.  Collectively, we have taken part in the development of hundreds of homes  inside of the Chico City limits,  and we are passionate about being part of the legacy that is being left  for the future generations to come.  We want our grandchildren to live in Bill's Chico, not in Winslow's Chico.  We appreciate the thought and care that has gone into this plan.  It would feel tragic if Chico could no longer provide significant opportunity for income,  or potentially limit our future generations from being able to obtain sustainable work  within the trade services, allowing for our future generations to remain.  My children are coming up in the industry, and I would love to see my grandchildren  and my children be able to remain Chicoans, as I have and my husband's family have  now for the last three generations.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Carol Serrano, followed by Jerry Olio.  All right.  And as a note, if we can...  I would like to avoid classifying council members in particular ways and their visions of Chico,  and they can do that.  I'm not speaking to you, ma'am.  Generally speaking to everybody.  Sorry.  I just happened to be at the podium.  I'm not hearing you well.  I'm tired.  Anyhow...  No, go ahead.  I just feel like somebody's been drinking the Kool-Aid,  and you guys are doing this as a matter of formality,  and it's a sham that, for the most part, it's obvious in your affect  that you've already...  Go ahead.  ...gone along with this.  And I haven't heard anybody mention watershed, which is the primary concern.  I've lived in Butte County for over 46 years,  42 of which were in Paradise until I had to come to Chico,  which I'm here now.  And I am concerned about what I see.  In Paradise, you could see the reservoirs.  Here, you cannot see the aquifer, and it is being depleted.  And I think there needs to be more attention,  and this area...  where we are talking about VE,  which always, in my mind, from history,  meant victory in Europe,  not VE, which is hubris, in my estimation,  about this whole thing when it was brought up.  Thank you, Jerry Olia, followed by Susan Tachuti.  I'm going to try that.  Thank you.  The main purpose of the City Council today,  and the City staff,  is to make sure that we preserve Chico and its way of life.  This valley edge does nothing for either.  I am a proud member of the early group of people  yelling, no way, San Jose.  San Jose was in this position themselves,  ...  way back when,  when they said, oh, we have to grow, we have to grow,  and then here we are.  We have San Jose, we have Chico here.  People that have lived here for 30 years, 20 years,  they wouldn't trade.  Then, for now, because of what's happened,  look at the knifings, the shootings that we have in Chico today.  Look at the traffic congestion.  No, vote no on this development.  Thank you, Susan Tachuti, followed by Nishihara.  Thank you, Nancy McCune.  Times are changing.  It's not 1950.  We need to think seriously about climate change,  about depletion of our water,  about the loss of natural resources and endangered species.  We need to conserve our land, water, and air,  all currently in decline.  We must plan differently.  We don't need this special planning area,  which is what we have developed now.  And we don't need it, we shouldn't be anticipating  what's going to happen in 40 years.  We need, in fact, to take care of the people who live here first.  I am not anti-growth.  I think we can do beautiful things within the city,  and priorities should be given to the people who live here.  Valley's Edge isn't careful planning.  It's extravagant planning.  And this HOA community is not for most of us.  It's for the privileged few.  Thank you.  Nancy McCune, followed by Sarah Salisbury.  There are so many reasons to vote against Valley's Edge.  The most important of these is water.  The applicant waxes poetic about the number of parks and trees  that will be planted.  Where is the water for all that landscaping coming from?  The lower Tuskegee Aquifer is already in deficit,  and one winter's storms will not balance out  several consecutive years of drought.  Add 2,800 homes to the equation,  and you have a disaster in the making.  We've already heard about all the green gas gas emissions  that can't be mitigated,  but the real tragedy of 29,000 car trips daily  on the 40 miles of asphalt planned in the project  will be the effect on the spring-run Chinook salmon in Butte Creek,  as tire particulate is particularly deadly to salmonoid species.  Fish and Game, the Friends of Butte Creek, and other agencies  have worked for many years to support and increase the salmon,  which are an essential part of the food chain and ecology in Butte Creek.  People with integrity make decisions that stand the test of time.  Take the long view and vote against this project.  Be people with integrity.  Thank you.  Sarah Salisbury, followed by Eric Nilsen.  Let's remember that the General Plan is not a mandate,  and since 2011, when it was implemented,  we've had a couple of catastrophic events here.  Of course, we all know about the Camp Fire,  and I think we all know about the drought, okay?  And despite the beautiful rain we're having right now,  we are in a drought condition.  We all probably experience water restrictions at our homes as I speak,  and the Vina Subbasin, which holds the Tuscan Aquifer,  is in an overdraft condition at this time.  That means more water goes out than comes in.  Where does the water come in from?  Where is the recharge area?  It's in the foothills.  You pave that over.  I know it's not all paved.  I get that part.  But you pave a lot of it over, lots of concrete.  That's a thirsty substance right there.  And then you have however many people, 5,500, 6,000 more people who are living there.  What does that do to the water?  Water is life.  Thank you.  Eric Nilsen, followed by Jared Geiser.  Good evening.  Legal Services of Northern California submitted a letter to the City of Chico  and City Council members regarding the Valley Touch specific plan.  In the letter they said Valley's Edge, quote,  does not sufficiently plan for affordable housing  or meet the City of Chico's obligation to affirmatively further fair housing, unquote.  Of the 2,777 units planned for development, quote,  only four acres or 0.6% of the total acreage be developed as affordable housing, unquote.  The letter further amplifies the vulnerability of the City to litigation.  Quote, failure to adopt a housing element that substantially complies with State housing element law  means the City could be subject to litigation  finding the housing element out of compliance with  and suspending the authority of Chico to make a variety of planning decisions.  We have recently witnessed hundreds of thousands of dollars in litigation costs to our City  when the City Council failed to recognize noncompliance pertaining to solutions for our homeless citizens.  There are a plethora of reasons and sufficient data to suggest we not move forward with this development.  Please, govern responsibly.  Thank you.  Jared Geiser, followed by Maggie Scarpa.  Good evening, Council.  I'm here.  I work for Elk to Cow Audubon.  Our mission is to protect birds, enhance birds, get people aware about birds.  And Valley's Edge is horrible for birds, as you might imagine,  when you destroy 650 acres of their habitat and fragment the rest of it.  So several species that have faced serious declines in the past 50 years  are facing habitat loss from this proposed development.  These birds have been observed on the site,  and their habitat types are disappearing across the State of California,  largely from land use changes such as suburban sprawl.  And so habitat loss is one major issue with this development.  But the other one is climate change.  Believe it or not, we are faced with a crisis of climate change.  It threatens our civilization, it threatens our stability,  and it threatens two-thirds of North American bird species.  And the City knows about this.  You can't, you know, it's an inconvenient truth that we all know is the truth.  The City of Chico has a climate vulnerability assessment that identifies the threats to residents.  I'll briefly list them off in my five seconds.  Extreme heat.  Increased wildfire risk.  Changes in precipitation patterns.  Reduced snowpack and reduced streamflow in summer months.  I can't imagine Chico without creeks in the summer.  Thank you.  Maggie Scarpa followed by Noah Zappai.  Hi. Thank you for the opportunity to speak.  I'm a City of Chico resident.  I'm a State Housing Policy Analyst,  and I'm a Butte Environmental Council Board Member.  I'll try to keep it brief, but this development,  I urge you to really think about this development.  This is the...  This is the size and approximate population of Gridley,  and so this would be popping Gridley onto the south end of Chico.  A couple notes that have been discussed.  There's no need for this type of housing.  Through 2022, based on the Housing Element Update draft,  219% of the above-moderate housing was developed,  when only 42% of the extremely low-income housing.  We need more affordable infill development housing,  and we don't...  This type of development isn't something that Chico needs.  Realtors and real estate agents will talk to you tonight  that we need this type of housing,  but the Chico data shows that we need more affordable  and moderate-income housing, not this luxury housing.  Thank you.  Noah Zappai, and I'm...  Zappi.  Zappi? Okay.  And followed by Anthony Nicosia.  I'm going to try that.  Hello. My name is Noah Zappi,  and I'm a resident here in Chico.  I'm 22 years old and have lived in and around Chico my whole life.  Today I'm speaking in favor of Valley's Edge.  As a young entrepreneur, I view Valley's Edge as a long-term plan  that would provide a world of endless possibilities over its build-out.  It will create opportunities for over 9,000 jobs.  Not only will this project create jobs,  but it will increase the City of Chico's revenue  by hundreds of millions of dollars.  That means that the City will be able to continue funding essential programs  and be able to give back to this amazing community.  Along with improving revenue for the City,  I would like to list off some impressive facts about this project.  Zero percent impact on endangered species,  1,372 single-family starter homes,  nine acres of multi-family apartments,  730 acres of parks with 25 miles of trails.  Now that I've gotten the facts out of the way,  I would like to say something quick about Bill.  I bring nothing to the table,  and Bill has always been there to help me.  I think that speaks volumes.  I think that speaks volumes about his dedication to the future generations of Chico.  Thank you.  Anthony Nicosia, followed by Beth Sisk.  So is Anthony here?  No.  Okay, so let's move on to Beth Sisk,  followed by Steven Kaczmowski.  We've been experiencing drought for many years.  We've been on water shortages and water restrictions this year.  The aquifers in overdraft.  The idea of thinking about all the water that's going to be sucked out of the Tuscan aquifer  and how that's going to affect us,  what disrespect for the limitations of our water resources is disturbing to me.  I have a place up in Butte Creek Canyon.  If all that water is sucked out for this development,  am I going to still have a well?  It's like, does anybody consider the implications for people that already live here?  And the destruction of the wildlife.  Beautifully designed development.  I see that people have made a lot of effort,  but it will no longer be a wild area.  There will no longer be wildlife in the same way.  The trees that don't have adequate water,  if that aquifer is depleted,  they will be gone.  Okay, Steven Kaczmowski, followed by Jonathan Richman.  Thank you for letting us speak on this really important issue for all of Chico.  Context is everything.  And I think one of the things that has really gotten a lot of people in an uproar about this project  is that within the frame,  the design,  it's beautiful.  You've designed a beautiful, self-contained town.  The problem is the town doesn't relate to the rest of Chico.  There's no analysis on what it does to Skyway,  what it does to 20th Street,  how it relates to the development that is already planned immediately to the west.  And so I think further analysis and the city is going to have a lot of homework  to actually develop those roadways.  For multimodal access.  Walking should be the priority from this community  all the way down to the grocery stores down on Bruce Forest.  Simple suggestion, since it's going to be built,  please consider the orientation of the park and the school.  They are a problem.  Thank you.  Jonathan Richman, followed by Charles Husam.  Thanks to everyone for this great meeting.  My concerns have been,  have been amply addressed.  I see sincerity on all sides.  I see the rest of my time.  Thank you.  Charles Husam, followed by Nick Brighton.  So is Charles here?  And I don't know if there's anyone still in the overflow room.  Nick Bratton, followed by Brent Sellerbauer.  Nick Bratton.  Okay.  So Brent Sellerbauer.  And I apologize if I messed up your name.  It's a tough one.  Tough German name.  Hi.  Brent Sellerbauer here.  So I'm a local real estate agent.  I just want to talk about the kind of missing middle class home.  In November, I listed a house.  It's a three bedroom, two bath, two car garage.  It's kind of standard house.  End of a cul-de-sac.  And, you know, interest rates are high.  So we listed it.  Let's list it kind of low.  Make it affordable for people.  As we did that, we proceeded to give a lot of money to the community.  We got about 100 tours.  We got 14 offers.  Everyone started bidding against each other.  The house went $81,000 over the asking price.  We were shocked.  The seller didn't need that necessarily.  They were happy to get it.  But if I had 14 different houses, it would stay at the 359 affordable price.  But because there's not enough of these homes, the affordability skyrockets.  In addition to that, I talked with a lady today who looked at the house, she said, you know,  she's not going to be able to afford it.  So she closed on papers today, signed for a house in Oroville.  She lives in Chico.  She works in Chico.  All her friends are in Chico.  She's commuting, her and her husband both, about two hours of drive time every day into  Chico.  So if we don't build in Chico, people are going to move to Oroville and surrounding  areas.  Thank you.  Alan Harthorn followed by Karen Laszlo.  So is Alan here?  Okay.  We'll move on to Karen Laszlo.  Followed by Suzanne Racina Hutton.  Alan is here.  Oh, Alan is?  Okay.  Sorry, I didn't get any warning there.  Okay.  Hold on one second.  Let me just do that.  I apologize for your name not showing.  But go ahead.  My name is Alan Harthorn, as you all know.  Executive Director of Friends of Butte Creek.  And I just want to say that I hope the citizens of Chico don't envision a house that's going  to be a mess.  I hope that the residents of Chico and the residents of Butte Creek don't envision our  foothills like Lincoln and Rockland and Roseville.  Or San Jose.  I say no way Lincoln.  No way.  But my main point here is that all of this project drains directly into the Butte Creek,  the diversion channel from Little Chico Creek over directly into Butte Creek.  All of the toxic runoff from the roads, from the lawns, fertilizers, pesticides, all into  the Butte Creek.  And finally, there are a couple lakes in this project that have been kind of glossed over.  I don't think those lakes are going to be filled with cow water.  They're going to be pumping groundwater to fill those lakes.  And although the realtors are all here to support this, I have not seen one farmer get  up here and say this is a good idea.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Suzanne Racine-Hudden, followed by Chuck Nadu.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I forgot Karen was here.  I apologize.  That's what happens.  Let me clear the speaker.  Go ahead, Karen.  Former Chico City Councilor Dan Winton told me that new developments never pay for themselves.  Valley's edge infrastructure costs will be huge due to the slopey, rocky terrain and  the high cost of building materials that will continue to rise, even if the developer, Bill  Brower, ends up paying for the initial infrastructure costs via development impact fees.  All subsequent long-term costs will be borne by those Valley's edge buyers who can afford  such costs and by the Chico taxpayers who will subsidize Valley's edge for years to  come.  Meanwhile, down here in the flatlands of Chico, we'll have to make do with our crumbling infrastructure  with no hope of mitigation.  Valley's edge and local infrastructure will be a major challenge.  We're not going to be able to do it without the support of our local real estate salespeople  telling us that it's just what Chico needs to help cure our housing crisis.  Of course it isn't.  That's time.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Suzanne Bersina Hutton, followed by Chuck Nadu.  Good evening.  I live in Stillson Canyon and have experience with the landscape in which Valley's edge  is proposed.  You may not be aware.  But Stillson Canyon is a very large area.  The campfire burned into Stillson Canyon and our dear neighbor lost his home.  His lot is contiguous with Valley's edge's boundary.  Our neighbor directly across the street's well has run dry.  For Thanksgiving, she had to run a hose from next door.  Now she has a water tank that needs filling regularly.  In recent years, many neighbors have had to drill deeper wells.  We have rich wildlife including deer, bobcat, ringtails, bats, many species of birds, and  bears.  In the canyon, we actually modified our garbage pickup time to dissuade the bears.  And to get anywhere in Chico, we in the canyon drive.  There's no bus or easy bike path.  The impacts are real.  Valley's edge's massive development will harm habitats.  It's planned for an active fire area.  Water is precious and air quality will be harmed.  That's time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Chuck Nadu, followed by Betty Noble.  Good evening, Council.  I'm Betty Noble.  I'm a resident of the Chico General Plan.  I've been a resident for 20 years and I have read both the specific plan, the Chico General  Plan, taken tours of the site, and also been at the listening sessions.  And I have to say that I'm definitely in support of the project after going through all of the  research on my own time.  I think that we have to be very grateful that we have someone like a Bill Broward and his  team looking at a project like this.  This isn't a KB Homes that's coming to just flatten the landscape and put up as many homes  as it makes sense for the shareholders.  This is someone who spent the last decade plus taking a look at what is the best use  for the land in the aspect of how it can help Chico's growth.  If your big interest is multifamily housing and seeing more of that, that's a discussion  that you need to have and bring forth it with your own financial wherewithal.  I mean, this is a great project.  JODI digestive digestive  digestive  digestive  digestive Is Jessica gone? Oh, Jessica. Is Jessica gone? Oh, Jessica.  digestive  digestive  digestive  digestive  digestive  digestive  because that's what I fear when we come to fire and all these other things I've already said before.  But what it's really going to come down to, we have scientific and environmental impacts that  are going to hit our city and the people of our city, our community. Those are hard to understand.  Financial seems to be easier to understand. And I see a lot of people supporting this that I think  are going to benefit financially from it. And so there's a lot of support for that. But when it  comes down to our responsibility as a city, we need to build the housing for the people who are  here. A quarter of our population is waiting. Right now, those people are waiting. This housing  won't be built until my grandkids are looking for housing and they won't be able to buy these homes.  I'm sorry. They can go to Chico State, get their degree, but they're still not going to be able to  afford these homes. We should be concentrating on affordable housing, high development of affordable  housing for the people who need it now, the people who will be needing it in the future. And this  project does not do it aside from all the other environmental impacts that will hit it. Thank you.  Okay. So, Jean Christofferson, followed by Sherry Scott.  Jean Christofferson. Okay. Sherry Scott.  Hi. I'll in one minute.  So,  wildlife, trees, views, the water supply, agriculture, the small town culture, those are  some of the most important things that brought me to Chico 27 years ago. And it seems that they're  all in peril due to drought and development. I am easily charmed by all these great ideas,  the words, the pictures. And I'm very, very grateful to be here today. And I'm very, very  grateful to be here today. And I'm very, very grateful to be here today. And I'm very, very grateful to  all the promises of this development. But I know that that's a lot to do with the highly paid  marketing firms and all. And this plan is massive and it scares me. And it scares me for what's to  become of all the things that brought me to Chico and for our town. Thanks. Sarah Salisbury,  followed by Patrick.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  on many topics for many years.  It may seem tedious, but it's really fundamentally important,  whether you like it or not.  So if you start with the guy in the plaza,  he's brain injured, soaked with the rain, he needs a tarp.  He doesn't have any toilets because the city's engineered them out of existence.  And as a crow flies, you go all the way up to the top of Canyon Oaks.  And I've been to Canyon Oaks many times.  I've been in some of the houses.  Think about that contrast,  and think about the gap between rich and poor in America and what's happened.  And think about the fact that we're facing environmental catastrophe.  And then think about this, this plan,  which is beautiful for whoever can live inside that bubble,  but it doesn't address any of the stuff outside that bubble.  So it's just obsolete thinking.  Thank you.  Emily Alma, followed by Valerie Rediman.  Thank you.  Drinking the Kool-Aid is still reverberating in my ears,  as well as the boxer who gets hit in the face for the first time.  I feel like there are so many questions that have not been asked.  It sounds like a beautiful vision when Bill Brower talks about it,  but there are so many holes that,  oh yes,  I'd rather live,  up where I have a beautiful view of the valley  than in a third-story apartment.  Well, some people can't afford that.  And the danger of all of these wonderful middle-income houses  being bought up by an outside realtor,  by people coming in from out of town and out of state,  the wealthy people who don't live in Chico,  this isn't going to solve Chico's house,  it's going to solve the housing needs.  Valerie Rediman, followed by Roxanne Barish.  Good evening.  I've had the distinct privilege of working on Valley's Edge  and the capacity of communications for the past few years,  and I am one of its biggest fans.  I've lived in Chico for over 22 years.  It's where I've proudly raised my family,  started businesses,  where I've committed to community service,  including years serving on both Chico's sustainability and the community's community service.  I've been a member of the Valley's Edge Sustainability Task Force,  as well as the Chico's Parks and Playground Commission.  And my experience tells me that Valley's Edge is good for Chico.  Preservation, conservation, and multi-generation.  It's a powerful combination that doesn't come around very often,  and it's something that us Chicoans deserve to have.  I ask that you follow the facts.  To quote a friend,  facts don't have to be nice, they have to be true.  And the fact is, Valley's Edge is good for Chico.  It provides much needed housing at a place for people,  for kids to play,  their parents to own a home,  whatever that might look like,  and their grandparents to retire close to family.  So please vote yes to approve Valley's Edge.  Thank you.  Thank you. Roxanne Barish, followed by Faye Romero.  Good evening. My name is Roxanne Barish.  I've lived in this area for over 40 years.  I grew up in Paradise and Chico.  I'm a public school teacher for over 25 years.  So I feel like I have a more growing interest in this area.  I have a global view of some of the surrounding areas  and also being a homeowner and a taxpayer and a landlord.  And my hope is that this conversation between two thought outsides  will come together in some kind of compromise.  My concern is for the congestion created by the Valley's Edge.  Having experienced the campfire and having an 83-year-old parent  who did not evacuate due to the congestion,  I'm concerned for the people who are living there.  I'm concerned for the people in Butte Creek Canyon  and for the development that increases on the ridge  where we do have space.  Being a teacher in Orland,  I've watched the depletion of the water supply  and people's housing prices going down.  At the same time, I'm seeing growth in the school systems  because people are moving that way.  I'm concerned about the environment here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Faye Romero, followed by Ginger Vogel.  Hi, good evening.  I'm a resident of Butte Creek Canyon, born in Paradise,  raised in Butte Creek Canyon.  We were all evacuated during the campfire.  And I will tell you, it was ugly in every scene.  And I had a mother who was in her 70s who couldn't get out.  I had gone to school with my son who couldn't, to drop him off,  I couldn't get back in.  The congestion on the skyway was terrible.  It was deplorable.  The entire Bruce Road was completely cut off  to every single resident coming out of the canyon in Paradise.  If you add that many more cars with that much more traffic  and no evacuation, any other source of evacuation  than the road that we already had, it's not going to work.  People died in that way.  The other thing is water.  As you said, Mr. Bill, that there was a gentle slope,  asphalt is oil, the oil is gently going to slope  and contaminate Butte Creek.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ginger Vogel, followed by Kimberly Michael Green.  I'd like to see the project put on hold as long as it can possibly be done.  I think the community can stand up for that  if they were to try to preserve it.  We have in 20 minutes, 25 minutes, you can be up the hill,  you have a full town that has been burnt to the ground.  The housing can go there.  It can be developed there.  You have a whole area in our county that can solve the problem of housing.  This money can be spent for the sewer system coming to Chico.  The fire, I live in Butte Creek Canyon.  The fire hurt the wildlife so bad.  We don't even have blackberries.  They're taking down trees.  The trees are falling.  The trees that are dead have all the acorns,  hundreds of acorns for the birds to eat.  And now you're going to take the little that is left,  what is preserved, which has flowers and things that are on Butte County's endangered list.  Thank you.  You're taking the seed.  You're taking it all away.  Thank you.  Rosalie Michael Green followed by Vikki.  Rosalie Michael Green Good evening.  My name is Kimberly.  I live in Chico.  I graduated from CSU.  I facilitate Climate Cafe at a local community center.  And it's for people that are dealing with climate distress.  Climate change isn't coming.  Climate change is already here.  We've been seeing that with drought, wildfire,  fire, water shortages. The acreage that is proposed in Valley's Edge has already burned  three times in the last 10 years. There's no reason to believe that it won't burn again.  Putting seniors there, you are building a crematorium. It's disgusting, like honestly.  To not be able to mitigate the greenhouse gases should be enough in and of itself to deny this  project. It's not smart to build this here. And open space is just habitat fragmentation.  We can call it what it is. Thank you. Thank you, Vicki, followed by Lindsay Steinberg.  This is my first time here. So far, we've been doing a lot better than my husband's school board  meetings in the past. Anyway, one of the things that I want to  bring up is lightly touched on when they were talking about the plans. Oh, and here's the  elementary school site. What a lot of people don't understand is that you have to get a certain number  of kids before a school is going to be built. We're not going to build it just for 20 kids.  So are you going to tell people who buy houses, oh, by the way, you'll be driving them to the  school, which I'm sure doesn't help the green.  But the and the school district has enough trouble now because they advertise for school buses,  drivers. I think we need to have a little more thought about how soon we can get in schools.  How many kids is going to take to do that? Also, just a quick thing. Could you please address  all the people's concerns about their wealth? Thank you. So Lindsay Steinberg,  followed by Robert Moline.  I think we're nearing the end. I was just doing the time on my watch, so I'll keep it really brief.  I support Valley's Edge, and here's why. I have deep roots in Chico. My dad is born and raised here.  He was one of the first graduating class at PV. My husband is born and raised here, and I landed  here going to Chico State. I started my business here. I started a family here. I got married here.  I've had a pleasure to work on Valley's Edge, and when I got onto the project, our marching orders were clear.  I've been here for a long time. I've been here for a long time. I've been here for a long time. I've been here for a long time.  So here's the facts. It checks all the boxes. The plan lays out the feeling of that's so Chico,  open space, preserving trees and rock walls, while providing intentional smart housing growth.  With all those elements included, I see it as a place where different political backgrounds,  environmental groups, personal needs, and community members can coexist.  It combines what we love about Chico, a place where we can live, work, and play.  Adopting Valley's Edge is saying yes to a stable,  and economically viable future. Valley's Edge is good for Chico.  Thank you. Our last speaker is Robert Moline.  My name is Robert Moline. I am one of the owners of a parcel adjacent to and east of Valley Edge,  which we use for cattle grazing and hunting. With the potential of 5,000 to 10,000 people moving into this area,  we are committed to providing a safe and affordable home for all.  Our concern is trespass onto our property and the disturbance of cattle grazing.  Our property is accessed through Valley's Edge using Dome Mill Road and off Honey Run Road.  Access my family has used for four generations.  These accesses are also used by PG&E to service a 500 kV and by CAL FIRE as well.  Any change in our access is yet to be finalized. Thank you.  Thank you. Sir, last speaker.  All right. We've had a request for a short break.  So, yes. Yeah, just so we're going to take a, let's take a five, five, ten minute recess.  Five minutes?  All right. If we can call it back to order, please.  All right.  All right. Side note that I'm going to make, if we can not have references to drinking the Kool-Aid,  as that refers to the Jonestown Massacre, which I'm not really crazy about, may not be inappropriate,  or may not be appropriate. And my apologies, because I probably should have allowed Mr. Broward to have his own.  But I'm going to ask you to please rebuttal three minutes before moving on so we can close the public hearing.  So we will do your three minute rebuttal and go forward from there.  I don't think anybody wants me to say anything.  So I won't. Thank you for your time. Thank you everybody for your comments.  I agree with the gentleman. There's a lot of sincerity in this room.  And the microphone's in the podium.  Well, that's it.  All right. Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  All right. So with that, we will close the public hearing and move to council discussion, motion, and or vote.  And Mr. Morgan, I believe you have a...  Yeah, just a couple comments that I now can't read.  We have a pretty well thought out, beautiful, quote unquote, plan community.  I got a quote here.  Plans are useless. Planning is indispensable.  That was Dwight Eisenhower, five-star general of the Army and U.S. President.  We can't plan for every storefront, bike lane, golf cart, bus stop, and grocery store.  We can do planning, compromise, and careful consideration.  That's been done here between the applicant, the staff, many groups, and members of the community.  We can argue ad nauseum about the hue of a particular building or where things are going to go.  But I don't think we're going to see in any amount of time, seeing as this started in 2007,  with people that do this for a living, is a better plan.  It's not going to happen overnight.  Whether it's perfect or not, we're never going to know.  I think it's as good as it can possibly get.  I think it's easy for anybody to put holes and criticize just about anything because it's so complicated.  But it does fit the general plan and does create a plan for Chico that I agree with, somewhere I would like to live.  So, Master Chief, I have a quick question.  Yes, sir.  There's four resolutions on this and three ordinances.  Can I make one motion approving the resolutions and read the ordinances?  I think in this particular case it would be better if you read all of them, all of the resolutions,  because they all do different things.  I apologize.  I mean, I can sum it up.  There's a resolution certifying the adequacy of the environmental impact report.  Then there's...  I'll do it.  Thank you.  That's what I thought.  I shouldn't ask questions.  So I will start with a motion for the Council to consider.  Number one, the resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico certifying the adequacy of the environmental impact report for the Valley's Edge Specific Plan.  Number two, resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico adopting findings regarding environmental effects.  Two, adopting a statement of overriding considerations.  And three, adopting a mitigation, monitoring, and reporting program for the Valley's Edge Specific Plan.  Resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico approving general plans.  항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항  approving the development agreement between the City of Chico and Chico Land Investments, LLC.  That is my motion.  I will second that, but I have a couple of comments that I'd like to make as well, if that's okay.  So, to respect the people that came before me, before I was up here,  three and a half years, 10,000 hours, and a million dollars is what sticks in my head,  is what we came up with to come up with a general plan to tell us where to move forward  and how we, as a council, sitting up here right now, can make wise decisions for the future of Chico.  Three and a half years, 10,000 hours, and a million dollars.  I'm not going to override that.  Somebody's been working on this project since 2007.  It's been very well thought out.  There's been many adorations coming.  And for the comment of...  It seems like...  It seems like this is just a fait accompli.  You guys all know what you're going to do.  You know what the fait accompli is?  SB35, State of California says, we cannot deny a project.  It's got affordable housing, it falls within the plan, and it does what we're supposed to do for our city.  And this isn't an either or.  We're not making a choice right now.  Do Valley's Edge, or do infill, or do upbuild, or do whatever.  We can do both.  Tonight, we are talking about Valley's Edge.  Anybody else is welcome to bring forward whatever affordable housing.  You want to bring forward whatever multi-unit housing, whatever lot splits you want to do.  We approved all that last meeting, which I wasn't super excited about.  But the State of California said we had to do that too.  So I'm all of the above.  I'm a yes on this, and I'm a yes on bring me anything else that you want to build.  All right.  Further comment from council?  Mr. Brennan?  That was good.  That was good.  I didn't even type that up.  No idea or concept is perfect.  It just doesn't happen that way.  And for all of you that don't believe that Valley Edge should be built, I do respect your desire.  I respect your opinion.  But as has been said so well, we are to follow a general plan.  That is our job.  We are to follow the rules, the laws that have been put in place.  By the State of California.  And this project does, in fact, follow the general plan, follows the rules.  And it should be approved because it's the right thing to do.  And for you that don't believe that, I just hope you understand that we must make a good decision for the benefit of the majority of citizens in Chico.  So that is my decision.  Thank you.  Anyone else?  Go ahead.  You know, I completely agree that we need more housing.  We do have a shortage of it, for sure.  And like Vice Mayor said, this is not the only plan.  We can definitely bring in more and more projects as developers find land to build them on.  And this project will take care of housing needs of Chico for the next many years.  Okay.  And it will also take care of the different kinds of housing needs for our working middle class taxpaying citizens with families who might prefer a yard and would not like to live in an apartment.  And as one of the emails that I received from the conference, and I'm sure we all received from Mr. Don Cross, and I quote what he stated in his email.  I remember in the 90s when we were in the middle of the country, we were in the middle of the country.  And people thought that the California Park subdivision would ruin our city's small town feel.  And now it is one of the most desired neighborhoods in Chico.  I'm coming.  Things change.  And I believe this is a well thought out plan for Chico.  We need it.  So I'm going to support it.  Ms. Windham.  Normally projects come to us with some set of expectations.  We have a zoning and etc.  And it's a plan that says this is what you can build.  This is what's allowed within here.  And this is not like a normal plan.  This is why we have to develop a whole specific plan.  It's like a general plan, only smaller, is what Mr. Solle said.  But this plan was not written through a process driven by public input.  It's proposed by a private developer.  And the land comes with a visionary.  And his vision is a lot of low density tract homes.  There's no other 1400-acre site in the city for housing.  When we look at projects for affordable housing, we're not talking about a project that's going to be built on a land.  We're talking about a project that's going to be built on a land.  And what the city has cited in the past is we lack available land for it.  We don't zone enough land to provide for these projects.  So we're not getting these projects.  We are getting something here.  This is where we do have an opportunity with a very large amount of land that is between two arterial roads  where you can connect a road and you can put a bunch of housing along there.  I think it's, what we're looking at is a missed opportunity just by itself.  That we have this one unique place where we can think on the scale that Mr. Broward is thinking.  And what he has come to and what we're forced to come to as a result is that this is just a bunch of land for the rich.  And we can continue to look to and fro in Chico and in other areas for housing for the working class people that make up this city.  And we're deciding that this is not for them.  Seniors need affordable housing.  Families need affordable housing.  It is no requirement for people to live in apartments to allow apartments on greater than 1% of the land that's being offered.  We talk about all these lofty concepts like 20 minute neighborhood and walkability and alternative mobility.  And this is greenwashing.  If you don't have the planning to account for these goals, then all this is is what we find on paper.  The best this plan will ever look, the best this project will ever look is what it is on paper.  Mr. Broward perhaps would have it differently if he were building the housing, but he is not.  These are going to be sold off into developers who are going to do the same thing that developers  always do.  They're going to find the cheapest way to produce housing the fastest of a certain style that they think is marketable.  It says in the general plan that these special planning areas should be planned to meet our housing and jobs needs.  And that is not what's happening here.  It's based on some study that says 80% of the demand is for large single family houses.  Well, we have research.  We have data.  We have state housing targets that say that we need housing for other people.  Consistently in a general plan, you can find that where we should have greater demand.  They still offer the full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full full  and I recognize that there's a lot of support  for taking the offer that's given to us,  but I would like to propose a substitute motion  that we request the applicant to consult with BCAG  on a plan to provide a major transit stop  within the development  and re-examine the project after that.  All right, we have a substitute motion.  Do we have a second?  Substitute motion fails for lack of a second.  All right.  Call the question, Mr. Mayor.  All right, Madam Clerk, take the roll.  Okay, let me get back there.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes, thank you, Mr. Brower.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck is disqualified.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Who carries five, one with one recusal.  All right, moving on to item five of the regular agenda,  5.1, consideration of an introduction of ordinance  and adoption of an urgency ordinance amending Title 12  of the City of Chico Municipal Code  to specify that violation of Chapter 1218  is punishable as a misdemeanor infraction.  And if you're leaving, if you could please leave quiet,  because we are continuing the council meeting.  And I should make a note here,  if the council wishes to implement the urgency ordinance  that would become effective immediately,  we'll ask the city clerk to read the ordinance  into the record.  And we have a report by City Attorney Vincent Yui.  Thank you.  Wait, if I could just interrupt,  I think we're trying to get Mr. Van Overbeck back.  Oh, yeah, thank you.  We'll have Tom rejoin us.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And this item would require a four-fifths vote  or super majority, so at least six ayes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Van Overbeck.  Van Overbeck.  Van Overbeck.  There he is.  Van Overbeck.  Nope.  There he is, yep.  Yep, all right.  All right.  Sorry, Tom, I was starting without you.  All right, so item 5.1,  report by City Attorney Vincent Yui.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  Regarding this item,  the city's current park rules and regulations  is codified in the Municipal Code Chapter 12.18.  Do not specify,  whether a violation shall be a misdemeanor or infraction.  The original intent of enacting Chapter 12.18  was to be able to enforce the similar anti-camping provisions  within the City of Chico Municipal Code Title 12R  as misdemeanors.  To enable misdemeanor enforcement of Chapter 12.18,  staff recommends that the City Council introduce an ordinance  amending Chapter 12.18 to include a section  that specifies that a violation of that chapter  shall be a misdemeanor or infraction.  I further recommend that the adoption of,  I recommend the adoption of an urgency ordinance  to make the amendments effective immediately  for the preservation of public peace, health, and safety.  The recommendations are as follows,  that the City Council review and adopt by fourth, fifth vote,  a supermajority, the attached urgency ordinance  entitled an urgency ordinance of the City of Chico  amending Title 12 of the City of Chico Municipal Code  to specify that violations of Chapter 12.18  shall be a misdemeanor or infraction.  Recommendation two, that the City Council,  the City of Chico, and the City of Chico,  the City of Chico Municipal Code  introduce and waive first reading  of the attached ordinance entitled  an ordinance of the City of Chico  amending Title 12 of the City of Chico Municipal Code  to specify that violations of Chapter 12.18  shall be a misdemeanor or infraction.  That includes my report.  That concludes my report.  All right, thank you.  Speaker?  We have three.  All right.  First speaker is Rob Berry,  followed by Jessica Giannola.  And if you go ahead and come down to the center aisle,  Jessica.  And three minutes.  I apologize in advance for speaking on this subject.  I know we're all tired,  but first thing I want to say is I totally support  the intent of this ordinance.  You know, all good,  but I would be remiss if I didn't point out  what I consider to be two rather serious errors.  The first is that I continue to disagree  with the interpretation that is being promulgated here  on Martin v. Boise.  The first is that I continue to disagree with the interpretation that is being promulgated here on Martin v. Boise.  In fact, your explanation of the interpretation of Martin  contradicts what you'd later say  about the requirement for shelter.  So let me say it this way very simply.  You are correct to say that Martin  prohibits the universal ban of sleeping outdoors  if there is not an indoor alternative.  But to say it another way,  if you do not ban sleeping outdoors  everywhere and at all times,  then the immediate immediate immediate immediate immediate  issue of shelter does not arise and and martin does not apply to the regulation so the cities  you're correct to say the cities can regulate sleeping outdoors in terms of time and place  if you are going to ban sleeping outdoors under all conditions in all places at all time then you  must provide alternative shelter that's what martin holds and so we've sort of pursued a  misinterpretation of that and it's gotten us into some problems but i want to raise  my remaining time here what i consider to be a bigger problem which is that there's a provision  in this which also says the pre-ordinances it says the following this section is not applicable  to unsheltered individuals when no available shelter is available in my legal opinion that  is a violation of the equal protection clause you cannot create a protected class  based on their condition or status and create a special privilege to violate an otherwise  legitimate ordinance or law or regulation and that's what you do when you exempt people  classified as homeless that is a condition or status which is specifically prohibited  as a condition of enforcement under the constitution you can only enforce against  conduct and the conduct is the act of camping in a public place  now you're still subject to your agreement on on the warren settlement but you should not continue  to perpetuate misinterpretations and other things that could cause other legal problems  and for those of you ambitious enough to have read our motion for intervention in this case  we made the argument here with the with the background of the references to  why this provision is unconstitutional so i'll leave it with that thank you very much  thank you jessica giannola followed by  patrick newman  council um i have concerns for um i guess more criminalization of people without housing because  we really know in the end that's what this is about people in parks and how do we make it clear  how we can enforce them not being there and punishment is what it looks like we're deciding  on what kind of punishment should they have should they have an infraction which is far less serious  than a misdemeanor  and misdemeanor will be it can involve jail time and substantial fines which will stay on someone's record for at least 10 years  so what is our goal here do we want people out of parks not living in parks then maybe our goal should be  housing and policy around housing because if we take an approach of increasing um punitive  actions towards people who do not have a home cannot access a shelter for various reasons  then we are creating this cycle of  that just won't end. These people will have that much of a harder time in getting into housing  if it ever became available to them. So they're still going to be on our streets. They're still  going to be in our parks. They're still going to be everywhere but in housing because we've made  it even more difficult by punishing them for existing in a place they found nowhere else to be.  So I think that in the end, we should be looking long-term. How are our actions and our decisions  here when we're deciding these rules and regulations? How are they going to really  impact the city in the end? Is it going to hurt us more by doing this than taking a different  approach? So I obviously do not support making this a misdemeanor. I really don't. Long-term  should be our goal of housing for people in the city of Chico. They can afford it. Thanks.  Patrick Newman is our last speaker.  Going back to 2015 when Lieutenant Britt gave his presentations around town,  for the Protection of Public Properties Ordinance, which is a raft of laws written by Mr. Ewing that  pushes the envelope on criminalization of homelessness. That was the beginning of our  long history of criminalizing homelessness here, or at least a major watershed in that process.  One of the things that Lieutenant Britt said in one of his presentations was,  we need to be able to have a  joint legal joint  joint  joint  joint  joint  joint  joint ! This whole question of infractions and misdemeanors is the question of can you write someone a ticket or can you put them in handcuffs?  write someone a ticket or can you put them in handcuffs? So the word deterrence being in Mr.  Ewing's statement, it's there for a reason. What you do when you create a condition where more and  more of these kinds of social crimes, which are unavoidable if you're homeless, become misdemeanors,  those are arrestable offenses. And so what you do, yes, you create a deterrence, you create a reign  of terror, because what you've done is you have a community where you have layer upon layer of  criminalization laws. Now, most of these laws have not really been tested because we haven't had  enough legal resources to do that. And I think if we did, we would find that the city of Chico  would be in even more litigation than it is now. And in the future, it's going to be in more,  because I can see that we're heading that way, because this is how we're governing Chico. We're  when I said earlier that I see these two poor people working for the city, shoveling asphalt  off the back of the road. I don't know if you've seen that. I don't know if you've seen that.  truck with no traffic control. Where does that lead to? That leads to litigation. When you have  streets that are falling apart, it leads to litigation. The whole mentality of Chico has been  governance by litigation. So what you're doing here is you're bypassing what's in 920.070,  where there's enforcement already of a camping ordinance that specifies certain kinds of  warnings. That's the approach you would take if you couldn't just go and say, look,  look, I can arrest you right now for simply being here because it's now a misdemeanor.  That's what this is all about.  It's about arrest powers.  And it's about what Britt said, too, which is we need these tools.  And what you're doing as a city is you're creating more and more of these tools,  thinking that somehow you're going to dig your way out of some hole.  But what you're doing is you're digging your hole deeper.  So this is crazy.  And thank you.  So last speaker.  All right.  Comments?  We kind of missed an opportunity to ask staff questions.  Do you mind if I?  Just to clear up.  So this question of Chief Aldridge,  do your officers ever find themselves in a situation where they are willing to enforce this part code,  Chapter 12.18, as infraction, but they can't as a misdemeanor,  and that would change the outcome?  So if I'm correct, it's an infraction or misdemeanor.  That's the way it reads?  So the way I view that is it's a progression of accountability.  Right?  So typically we run across someone.  We've never had contact with them.  They're violating the rule.  We give them a verbal warning, tell them, hey, this is an infraction or a misdemeanor.  Educate them, right?  Okay.  So.  Second time around, we know they've been warned.  We exercise the infraction piece, write them a citation, send them on their way,  clear them from the area they're not supposed to be in.  And then subsequently, the third time, a misdemeanor, their third strike, so to say.  They've had ample opportunity, ample warnings,  and now it's time to utilize the misdemeanor section and potentially take them to jail,  depending on the situation.  And if you have a situation at hand, you can get a citation for a misdemeanor also.  Have we used some like this in the past?  Of course we have.  There was a time where we were using some of this stuff.  I think we more looked at the infraction stuff, but we did have some misdemeanors  that we cited and arrested for.  And we're talking primarily about camping?  There was a time when we were using some of the misdemeanors.  There was some camping.  There was some after-hours stuff like around the DTA here,  specifically the Civic Center area here, and then some of the park stuff.  We say after-hours stuff.  You mean people hanging out, drinking alcohol, doing other crimes?  Yes.  Okay, thanks.  All right.  Any further questions, discussion?  Entertain a motion.  So do you need it read in its entirety?  I will read it.  She can read it.  Okay. Okay.  So hold on one second.  So a motion by?  Is there a second?  All right.  We have a motion.  Do we have a second?  Second.  All right.  Second by?  Okay.  Council Member Brown.  And is that for?  This is for the urgency ordinance.  The first one.  The first one.  And it will go into effect immediately upon reading.  Okay.  Okay.  So whereas unauthorized camping, sleeping, and or storage of personal property on property,  public property by individuals has caused and continues to cause a disturbance of the peace,  health, safety, and general welfare of the community impose hazardous threats to camp occupants,  nearby residents, and businesses.  And whereas finding constructive alternatives and solutions for the homeless population  remains a top priority for the state of California.  As the lack of affordable housing compounded with the cost of living have contributed to  a homelessness crisis in the cities across California.  And whereas despite the city's extensive efforts to combat the problem of homelessness the  city's most recent point in time account identifies 393 unsheltered individuals within the city  of Chico.  And whereas on April 1st 2019 the United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held the Cruel  and Un 항 항  usual punishments clause of the 8th Amendment precluded the enforcement of a statute prohibiting  sleeping outside against homeless individuals with no access to alternative shelter. Martin  versus the City of Boise 902 F3D 1031 hereinafter referred to as the Martin decision. And whereas  based on the ruling in the Martin decision, enforcement of the city's current code can only  be effectuated under circumstances in which shelter space is available and voluntarily refused. And  whereas the provisions of the current version of chapter 12.18 of the code lack the specificity  required to enforce that chapter not only as infraction violations but also as misdemeanor  violations that carry a greater deterrent effect. And thus amendments to Title 12 of the City of  Chico Municipal Code are necessary to ensure adequate enforcement related to the protection  of public property including the city plaza, parks, greenways, playgrounds, and waterways  from the adverse effects of camping, sleeping, and or  storming.  And whereas the government code section 36937 authorizes the adoption of an urgency ordinance  to become effective immediately upon its introduction when necessary for the immediate preservation  of public peace, health, and safety. And whereas the City Council hereby finds that the presence  of homeless encampments, camping, and storage of personal belongings within public property  including the city plaza, parks, greenways, playgrounds, and waterways has created an  immediate threat to public peace, safety, and security. And whereas the government code section  to the protection of public property and safety and public welfare.  And whereas the Chico City Council finds that this urgency ordinance is necessary for the  preservation of the public peace, welfare, health, and safety of residents living within  the City of Chico and find an urgency to approve said urgency ordinance immediately. Now therefore  be it ordained by the Council of the City of Chico does hereby adopt the following ordinance  amending Title 12 of the City of Chico Municipal Code.  Section 1, urgency findings. The City of Chico, the City Council of the City of Chico hereby  determines and finds as follows.  A, the facts set forth in the above recitals of this urgency ordinance are true and correct  and incorporated into this urgency ordinance as substantive findings.  B, this urgency ordinance is adopted as an urgency measure pursuant to the government  code section 36937 for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare  and is adopted and justified based on the following.  One, the City must be able to enforce its anti-camping ordinances for the purpose of  protecting public health and safety on the City's property.  public health and safety on the City's property including the City Plaza Parks, Greenways Playgrounds,  and Waterways.  Two, current encampments pose serious and immediate public health and safety issues.  Recent cleanup operations at the City Plaza, City Hall, Lower Bidwell Park, Lindo Channel,  Comanche Creek, and Little Chico Creek revealed the improper disposal of extreme quantities,  tons of trash including hyperdermic needles and other drug paraphernalia, improper disposal  of human waste, evidence of illegal fires, and vehicles that have leaked chemicals, and  other illegal products.  Large amounts of garbage have amassed at and near encampments within the City's parks,  greenways, playgrounds, and waterways.  Four, within the encampments, grills and propane tanks have been found dug into the ground  to start fires, endangering both safety and the environment, and numerous brush fires  have occurred within or adjacent to such encampments in recent years, with the potential for fire  hazards to increase in the winter months when homeless persons create fires to try and stay  warm.  Five, based on the foregoing, this ordinance is not a good idea.  Classifications are still the case. Five, based on the foregoing, there is a current and immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare and an urgency ordinance is warranted and necessary to protect the public against potential negative health, safety and welfare impacts by creating increased deterrence of hazardous acts. Section two, city code amendment. The City Council of the City of Chico hereby amends Title 12, Chapter 12.18, Park Rules and Regulations by adding the following section. 12.18.46 violations. A violation of any provision within this chapter shall be a misdemeanor or an infraction and may be enforced by the filing of a criminal action by the city attorney or the issuance of an administrative citation in accordance with Chapter 1.15 of this code.  provision within this chapter shall be a misdemeanor or an infraction and may be enforced  by the filing of a criminal action by the city attorney or the issuance of an administrative  citation in accordance with chapter 1.15 of this code. This section is not applicable to  unsheltered individuals when there is no available shelter space as defined in section 9.20.020 for  the unsheltered individual otherwise in violation of this chapter 12.18. Section 3, authority.

Section 4, this urgency ordinance is consistent with the city's general plan,  municipal code, and applicable federal and state law. Section 5, this urgency ordinance will not  be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, and convenience or welfare.

If any section, subsection, line, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional,  either facially or as applied by a decision of any court or competent jurisdiction,  such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this urgency ordinance.  The City Council of the City of Chico hereby declares that it would have passed this urgency ordinance  on each and every individual section, subsection, line, sentence, clause, phrase, or word without regard to any such decision.  Section 8, effective date.  The urgency ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its adoption.  Section 9, certification.  The City Clerk shall certify to the passage and adoption of this urgency ordinance  and shall cause the same to be published or posted in the manner required by law.  The foregoing ordinance was adopted,  and I will take the roll call now.  to see if it will pass.  It does require a supermajority vote,  which is six votes.  So, Council Member Bennett.  May I have a quick comment?  Yeah, absolutely.  Maybe I missed something as far as why this is an urgency ordinance.  We've been dealing with this for years,  the issues that are listed in the ordinance.  We had to go through this whole process of litigation and come to a settlement,  and I've been watching the enforcement take place over time.  Thank you.  It seems like it's progressing according to the settlement.  I'm going to vote no on this because I see that raising these infractions and misdemeanors  offers to waste police resources,  expose the City of potential litigation and overburden jails to no good end.  Okay, Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  It carries 6-1.  So, do we need a second motion?  You don't want to read it again?  There's another ordinance, but it doesn't need to be read.  That gave me a heart attack.  Two hateful jokes.  Sorry.  Okay.  So, we are faced with that question of it being after 10,  and whether or not we're going to take any other issues.  No.  The AP&P 1010 was rewritten very specifically by me.  We are not to take new items after 10 o'clock.  We could set aside our own rules.  I'm happy to vote about setting aside the own rules.  Is there an urgency of needing to do any of these other items?  That's all I care.  Excuse me.  So, if you wanted to, if you would be willing to,  if you could please adopt the second,  introduce the second ordinance.  And just waive by reading of title only.  Okay.  So, do you need a motion to do that?  If you just make the motion, and I can read the ordinance title.  All right.  So, I'll make the motion.  Okay.  Second.  Okay.  And that is to introduce an ordinance of the City of Chico amending Title 12 of the City of Chico Municipal Code  to specify that violations of Chapter 12.18  shall be lifted.  All right.  So the 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항 항  if they need any of this, if it presents urgency  or if we can hold off until the next meeting.  Well, go ahead, Mark.  You go first.  I'm sorry.  There's some urgency.  I'm going to leave it up to council.  I believe both of the items are going to be pretty brief.  Yeah.  One of them is simply fixing a clerical error, an oversight,  and the other is an adjustment to engineering  that I believe we've discussed in the past.  So, again, your call.  And item 5.2, I know we have committees.  Right.  We wouldn't be able to have committee meetings  until that item is addressed.  Correct.  All right.  So first you have to vote to set aside the rules.  Yes.  So I'll make a motion to vote to set aside the rules  so we can hear these following items briefly.  I'll second it.  Seven.  Motion and second.  Okay.  All right.  To set aside the rules.  Okay.  To hear these three items.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Okay.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Sure.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Sure.  Mayor Coolidge.  Wow.  Yes.  Okay.  That carries 6-1.  All right.  All right.  So 5.2 confirmation of appointment of councils and committees.  Some changes were made to this.  We amended.  I amended a few today.  So if you follow along with this stuff,  I'll tell you what the differences are.  So Council Member Bennett will be serving on the Finance Committee.  Council Member Reynolds will be serving on Internal Affairs  as well as Council Member Winslow.  Three core.  Council Member Bennett would be the alternate.  Council Member Tandon would be...  the primary.  Vina, Council Member Reynolds will continue there.  And Council Member Winslow will be the alternate.  So that's the amount of changes to what we had prior published.  So do we have any speakers on this item?  No.  All right.  Any other changes?  Seconded.  Motion and a second.  Second.  Second. !  Just a moment.  Council Member Bennett.  Okay.  And Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  And thank you for letting me continue on Internal Affairs.  And Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you.  All right.  So next item is Item 5.3, Amendment to the City of Chico Budget Appendix B-1.  So this is a new amendment.  And I believe we have a report from there.  Go ahead.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council.  Before you tonight for approval is Amendment to the Pay Scale for the Chico Management  Employees Bargaining Unit.  The specific positions up for payment are the Senior Civil Engineer, Senior Development  Engineer, Senior Traffic Engineer.  Currently, we have seven budgeted positions within those three classifications and only  two or four.  We have three of those positions have been fulfilled.  We have posted the positions for over a year for recruitment.  We do not have any viable applicants.  We are asking Council for authority to raise the pay scale in hopes to attract viable,  qualified candidates for the position.  The City Manager recommends adopting the agreement or the amendment to the pay scale for three  senior engineering positions.  And I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  Thank you.  All right. Questions from council? Seeing none, public comment? No. None. Entertain a motion.  Move to approve. Second. Motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds. Second from Council Member Tandon.  Okay. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes. Council Member Winslow. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes.  Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. Item 5.4, confirmation of amended contract for Deputy  Director Community Development Planning Official, a report from Chelsea Peeble.  So again, before you tonight, we have just a simple clerical fix to a contract that was  approved by council in October 2022 for our Deputy Director Building Official, Dale Fletcher.  Typically, the building official has had historically a vehicle allowance associated  with the contract, this contract.  The  the  the  vehicle allowance was missed,  and so this is rectifying that oversight  and adding in the vehicle allowance to the contract.  And I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  All right, questions?  Speakers?  How much is the vehicle allowance?  400 per month.  All right.  Speakers, entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  All right.  All right, motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds,  a second from Council Member Bennett.  We'll give it to him.  Okay.  They were basically at the same time,  so when you're ready.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right, no items after the posting  of the agenda reports and communications.  Following reports and communications,  items are provided with Council's information.  No action can be taken under this section  unless the Council agrees to it on subsequent agenda.  City Manager's report?  No report.  All right.  Sun shining in the draft MOU is there.  Council Member requests item 6.3% AP and B 1010.  Council Members members may verbally request  the item be agendized at a future meeting  after stating what the item would be a majority vote  of the Council's need in order to fill the staff  of the agenda.  Council Members may also submit their requests in writing.  Do we have any?  One's going twice.  All right, with that, we will adjourn the meeting.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
