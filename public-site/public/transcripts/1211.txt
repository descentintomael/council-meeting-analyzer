All right.  Bo powell followed by David  blau.  I first came here in 2014 just  a few years ago.  I was in the city council  in July 2014 and the chico fire  city council, you know, chico  fire got a piece of I-beam from  the towers and that was, you  know, I don't know anything  about the way this council  works.  So that was my excuse to speak.  And my point was that they were  spraying firefighters, chico  firefighters out of Dayton road  when they come out of the city  and they're going to come out  there.  This since then, well, January  15th or so, or 2015, January  2015, butte county changed the  setback from 300 feet to 25 feet  making our roadways the most  chemical area, sprayed area.  Mr. O'brien should be well aware  of that because he was chief of  police when it happened.  Just got sworn in.  And this is chico state students  are driving right by there, you  know, to get to the college.  And you say that it's out of  your jurisdiction or whatever,  but this is the 11th choose  chico.  But this is the 11th.  And the city has covered this  up, so chico state students don't  know.  I mean, apparently, the fire  department still doesn't know  that they can legally be  sprayed.  Do the police department?  I mean, you would expect that  Mr. O'brien there would have  made sure that butte college  would, you know, tell cadets and  the fire academy would tell  cadets that, you know, this is  what the community thinks of  them.  They let them spray them.  But at least warn them.  After you hire them, I'm sure,  I mean, any dignified person  would let them know that they  spray in the orchards.  If you don't want your family  sprayed, you don't move in by  the orchards.  So they're going to have the  thing Saturday for butte college.  And apparently they're going to  give them an award to run the  firemen.  Well, I always wanted to call  the butte college spring gala.  I always wanted to call.  It seems like they have a local  person that stayed local and  somebody from out of the area.  Well, this is the first year  that I could get the phone  number for the person out of the  area.  So I'm having people call this  Mrs. York, the other one, so she  will know.  That she's being plagued.  Thank you.  Okay.  Our last speaker is Dave Blau.  Good evening.  So upper park is a huge value,  not only to the community but  also an iconic and proud symbol  of chico.  I've been in upper park more  than 400 times since 2018 since  I started keeping track.  Upper park trails are in  terrible shape.  The worst I've ever seen by a  large margin with no maintenance  for probably 12 years.  10 mile road is closed.  Upper guardian is closed.  Upper anny's is closed.  B trail is closed.  Upper north room is closed.  Upper middle trail and the end  of road is also closed.  Lower trail has big wash outs  and deep potholes.  North room is so rocky it's  unusable and it's very rarely  used.  It used to be a favorite bike  trail and now virtually no one  rides it because it's so  rocky.  Middle trail is so rocky and  there's no trail there anymore.  Middle trail is so rocky with  loose golf ball and softball size  rocks that it's risky to use.  Horses, bikers and even walkers  hardly use it.  More than 10 years of neglect  have taken a huge toll on the  trail.  When possible people have been  going around these various  hazards and that causes  widening and erosion that makes  the system worse.  Sunday I came on a tree that  was on the trail and I had to  turn around.  Topping off the damage is the  paving on the upper park road.  The gravel makes the road almost  completely unusable for dogs,  horses, bikes and even walkers.  Covered with sharp, loose, dusty  gravel.  The road used to be a community  place with people everywhere on  the road during good weather.  Now it's almost unused by  anybody but cars.  Just go down there and take a  look.  The road is a little bit  Nobody on the trail or other  road at all.  Every time people make a little  side trail without the gravel  the city covers it up.  All that's needed is a three  foot wide part not covered with  the nasty gravel.  I'm sure there are lots of  reasons like fires and heavy  rains but these are not new  things.  The only thing that's new is  the utter neglect this city has  shown for the greatest asset of  the community.  Any other comments on the road?  thank you.  s all.  thank you.  Public hearing.  Hearing to consider humboldt  world closure extension.  Mr.  Geffsen.  thank you, mayor, vice  mayor, council members.  Appreciate the opportunity to  speak to you tonight.  This is just another extension  of the temporary closure for the  upper part or excuse me, the old  eastern part of old humboldt  road.  It is a public hearing to consider  extending that closure per  California vehicle code 211.  01.4.  We last considered this or we  first considered this in June of  2020 and approved that closure  to vehicular traffic.  Of course it is still open to  bicycles and pedestrians and of  course the property owners that  still need their access up  there.  And part of that vehicle code  requires an 18 month temporary  closure.  So this is number one.  We have a number of !  Mr.  Van overbeck.  this has been a great  success.  I live about a mile from old  humboldt road and now it'  s full of cyclists, people  walking their dog.  I would add to the illegal  dumping and various other  nefarious activities, dramatic  reduction in fire danger.  We had some big fires there and  I think in the spring of 2020  is before it was shut down.  So this is a great idea and I  encourage everybody to support  it.  thank you.  Again, thank you mayor  robert?  thank you mayor.  This came up at the end of my  tenure as chief we had as eric  mentioned a significant number  of issues.  Not just dumping, we'  re talking  about dumping we'  re talking  about couches and appliances  but some significant  criminality as well.  And I concur with you tom the  difference between then and now  I think the time we have now is  significant and I want to thank  staff for bringing this forward  again and to me it'  s going to be a no  brainer but I know we have a  public comment.  council member winslow.  what would it take to make it  permanent are we on the path to  doing that eventually?  we have five more 18 month  periods and I think what happens  there is we would probably  re-accept or pass another  resolution again for referencing  that vehicle code 211.014 and  likely go into another 18 month  times eight temporary closure.  There may be some stipulations  closing it permanently with that  wording we would have to look  through and there are landowners  up there that still need access  those landowners likely will  want to develop that land at  some point in time.  I think we have a lot of  about that but until that time  comes we think it'  s best  that we continue the closure to  vehicles in these 18 month terms.  I didn'  t realize the  development up there was part of  the consideration on that it'  s nice to have the  recurrent 18 month rallies  reminding us how good of an idea  this was but I think it'  s interesting  to look at making it permanent.  we will open the public  hearing do we have any speakers?  we have two.  first we have priet  to effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  and health through education, advocacy, and community stewardship.  So this portion of Humboldt Road has been very popular for recreation users locally.  We have some data from a local app that we have over 100 users per month that use this  as a way for, that use a section of road as a way for recreation.  In addition to that, last year, Chico Velo worked with a private donor, and we were able  to repave that portion of Old Humboldt Road.  However, this repaving has not been done to vehicle standards.  It's only for pedestrian access standards.  But we had a grand reopening ceremony for that new construction, and we had over 120  bicyclists join us on a weekday afternoon to ride up the hill in celebration of the  repaving.  It's been met with great positivity from the local bicycling community.  Also, hikers, pedestrians, people.  People that walk their dogs, things like that, really enjoy using this space.  So from a recreation aspect, Humboldt Road is a safe and meaningful area for our recreational  community, and we support the continued closure of this section of road.  Thank you so much for your time.  Thank you.  Kirk Mumford is our last speaker.  Hi, I'm Kirk Mumford.  I'm a proponent of keeping the road closed.  And I went to the county meeting last week where they closed their part of the road.  They extended the closure, and they said permanent closure would happen in about, well,  they would, they'd just keep putting it off, just like you guys want to do.  And they put it off to 2034 when they'd have to do something else.  They might be able to extend it.  I don't know if they can.  But I don't want to take a lot of time.  So is there anything else?  Is there anything you'd like to know?  I mean, I could talk about the diminution of the illegal activity, the trash pickup,  the drug deals, all kinds of weird stuff that was going on up there.  I could talk about the thousands, literally thousands of people who've ridden, walked  it, run it.  And I keep getting thanks from people all over town in the park that I don't even know  that are really glad that it happened.  But I could talk about some of that.  If there's no questions, I'll just close it down.  You know, I think it's really impressive about the whole deal, in addition to you donating  a whole bunch of money for everybody to use this road, but the fact that it came in under  budget, the repaving?  Yeah, that's great.  And they were jazzed.  The pavement laying team was really jazzed about doing it because usually they do roads.  It was Knife River that did it.  And they were so happy because people were using it before it was even.  I mean, they were spraying oil and all this stuff, putting the second coat on.  And people were, Jenkins was the guy who was running the paving machine and he was running  the crew.  And they were so jazzed about doing it because they usually do roads and nobody cares about  a road.  But this was a bike path and people were using it and they were thanking these guys and they  were really jazzed.  They were really doing a good job.  Mr. Mumford, you're the one who made that repaving.  So thank you very much.  We owe you, the whole community owes you a big gratitude.  Yeah, it was the best money I ever spent.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  We will close the public hearing.  And do I have a motion?  I will make a motion.  This is government where it's working.  It's a win for everyone.  It's about the biggest no-brainer we will ever have.  So I will make a motion for a resolution of the council of the city of Chico.  Ordering continued temporary closure of a portion of old Humboldt Road pursuant to Chico  Municipal Chapter 10.53.  Second.  I have a motion and a second.  But did I miss something, Ms. Clerk?  No?  Okay.  I was just making sure.  I didn't mess up my first public hearing.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  I was the one that left it off your agenda.  Council Member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council Member Hawley.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Item 5.1.  Consideration of an ordinance amending Chapter 9.29 related to syringe exchange programs.  Our city attorney, Mr. Lamb.  Thank you, Mayor.  City Council.  Good evening.  Before you tonight is a proposed ordinance amending Chapter 9.29 of the Chico Municipal  Code prohibiting syringe exchange programs and the furnishing of syringes except as  authorized by California Health and Safety Code 121349 and other state and federal law.  On January 5th, 2021, the City Council adopted a temporary emergency ordinance that enacted  amended Title 9 and enacted Chapter 9.29 establishing a prohibition on the establishment of syringe  exchange programs within the city and other similar programs.  On February 2nd, 2021, the City Council adopted a permanent ordinance mirroring the temporary  emergency ordinance.  Fast forward to spring of 2024, the California Department of Public Health filed a lawsuit  challenging a similar syringe exchange program ordinance in the county of El Dorado County and  also the city of Placerville on the grounds that the El Dorado and Placerville ordinances were  preempted under Health and Safety Code section 1213.  The state of El Dorado County is currently under the preliminary injunction to approve  syringe exchange programs pursuant to a very specific statutory review and approval process.  In the El Dorado case, the court issued a preliminary injunction against El Dorado County  in joining it from enforcing the county' s ban on syringe exchange programs.  El Dorado County is currently still under that preliminary injunction and are still  in litigation.  The City of Placerville shortly after the litigation has been approved by the state  The court's court's court's court's litigation was filed and settled with the state and entered  into a settlement agreement which ultimately a syringe exchange program was allowed in  the city of Placerville subject to some limited restrictions.  Subsequently, North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition subsequently brought a suit against  the city of Chico.  On a similar basis.  The city' s ordinance was preempted by state law and it' s seeking a preliminary injunction against the city of Chico.  the state of the state.  The draft ordinance is  The draft ordinance is  The draft ordinance is  the proposed ordinance which  serves to clarify the chico  municipal code by prohibiting  syringe exchange programs and  furnishing of syringes unless  expressly authorized by state  law.  The draft ordinance also  establishes reasonable  regulations.  I wanted to highlight several  of them that are notable.  First the syringe exchange  program must have cdph approval  which is the state approval.  Syringe exchange programs shall  not be located within 600 feet  of any public or private school  child daycare center playground  public park community center or  library.  Hours of operations shall be  limited to 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  Lastly the syringe exchange  program shall not provide  syringes to anyone under the age  of 18 years old.  600 feet of any public or private  That concludes my report I'  d be happy to answer any  questions you may have.  any questions for  Mr. Lamb?  Mr. Lamb was the  placerville needle exchange  organization were they a sap  under the state rules?  that one the case there was  set of the law at that time  however they challenged the  fact the state law preempted the  local ordinance. I believe there  was a set that was in the process  there but they were not part of  the litigation.  the litigation was about  prohibition of sap so right?  correct thank you.  any other council members?  Mr. Winslow?  as per discussions we'  ve had the ordinance  proposed includes limitations  on 600 feet from a community  center but the current program  that'  s similar to this  that'  s in operation has been  operating with virtually no complaints but it is attached to a community  center and we want to consider  making an update to that in order  to not cause any conflict.  council member Winslow yes the goal  was to make sure that the  ordinance was to protect youth  oriented uses so we could change  community center to youth  centers which is consistent with  our cannabis ordinance.  one more thing I do see the  word amending is misspelled so  I think we can amend that too  just have one m in the word.  all right perfect.  how many speakers do we have?  we have one.  I just wanted to come up and  briefly remind you of the history  behind this as you recall we  had a needle  distribution  ongoing at wind chime park.  clients of mine  sued the department of public health  over that  permit and  entered into a settlement agreement with  the department of public health.  and in that agreement  was that they would not issue  a permit to distribute needs  without doing an eir.  so if your ordinance includes  approval by the department of public  health for a program they would be  required to do a full eir study on  needle litter.  so I just want to let you be aware  of that.  thank you.  all right any other discussion  by council or consider a motion?  move to approve.  we have to read it.  thank you.  thank you.  let me just say a few things  as mr.  barry alluded to there was a program  like this going on in wind chime park  it was a real lightning rod issue you  had these big protests you had  counter protests people dressed up as  clowns then you had a clown protest  it was a really odd and colorful and  kind of weird the whole time.  and then this program with the same  organization moved into an indoor  location their relationship with their clients improved.  organization we got I believe just one  complaint if I'm not mistaken it wasn't  even from somebody who lived or worked  nearby so it has been this dramatic  improvement in the conditions around this  and I think we kind of settled on  something good but now looking at  litigation state laws we are looking at  a different sort of compromise that I  think is pretty reasonable.  so I will make the motion to introduce  got to read it.  I will second that.  mayor and council just to clarify  is that including the amendment to  reference youth centers instead of  community centers?  Mr.  van overbeck is your motion.  accepted.  yes I think so.  thank you john that'  s why I asked first.  okay.  there'  e a motion and a second to introduce  an ordinance of the city of chico  amending chapter 9.29 of the city of chico  municipal code prohibiting unauthorized  syringe exchange programs and the  furnishing of syringes or  hypodermic needles within the city  except as authorized by state law and  establishing reasonable regulations of  same as amended to reflect youth  centers versus the community centers.  council member goldstein.  aye.  council member holly.  yes.  council member o'brien.  as far as historical perspective my  colleague mr. winslow mentioned a  I will tell you the genesis of this  was we had thousands of syringes  across our community that we were  finding and people were finding in our  schools and our parks they have done a  much better job now but it was not  like that in the beginning.  I know we have no control over this  but I'  m going to vote yes but that'  s the other side of the history of  this particular issue.  okay council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  council member holly.  yes.  yes.  council member holly.  5.2 closure of south park and  peterson drives in lower bidwell park  to vehicular traffic on weekends and  national holidays.  Mr. Gustafson.  thank you again.  vice mayor and council.  this item is a carryover from the  february 18th meeting where council  received a staff report that covered  previous discussions from 2023 at the  park commission level.  the headway transportation report and  survey that was conducted on the lower  park interior park roads.  a staff recommendation and then of  course robust discussion at the 18th  meeting.  council's direction was to come back  on march 18th with an implementation  plan and schedule to close south park  drive interior roads and the  road and peterson memorial drive  interior road on weekends and national  holidays.  we'  re able to bring that back now at  the march 4th meeting because it'  s pretty easy for us to close that.  we could close it starting this  saturday the 8th with our existing  gate system.  signs are being made and prepped and  in the event that it'  s approved tonight we will get  them installed by saturday and can  initiate the closures on weekends and  national holidays starting this saturday  the 8th.  re also and I want to be clear  this is for keeping you will see in  the recommendation we could conclude on  that but it'  s keeping south park drive open to  vehicular traffic from the cypress  entrance all the way to caper acres.  those facilities and areas are still  accessible.  we'  re closing it to vehicular traffic  from caper acres all the way to  centennial and then of course peterson  is being closed to vehicular traffic  and it'  s opening off of  closures will still be allowed on  weekends and national holidays from  the cypress entrance to caper acres.  recognizing I think to and again this  is for six months and we intend to  bring this back to reevaluate.  we also hope to bring it back a  little sooner recognizing that  engineering is in design for  reconstruction of south park drive  with the previous park commission  recommendations that include a  vehicle and bicycle traffic  understanding now the long-term  intent may be to keep it closed to  vehicular traffic that might change  the design and engineering intends to  bring back an alternative that would  not have to widen it if the intent is  to keep vehicles off.  that will be an alternative we wish  to bring back for commission and  council consideration late spring early  summer.  we also hope to bring this back to  discuss before peterson memorial drive  rehabilitation reconstruction starts  likely in late july.  we hope to bring it back and discuss  it then because peterson will have  significant impacts being closed to  not only vehicles but to pedestrian and  bicycle traffic during the construction  period as well.  recognizing that that kind of the  intent or long-term intent may be to  keep vehicles off south park drive  will present a design alternative that  we will consider in the future.  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively Lastly, maintaining vehicular access on south park drive from  construction will take place on  south park drive from cypress  entrance to caper acres allowing  access to parking lots at one  mile sycamore field and caper  acres until engineering completes  the design for roadway  rehabilitation.  questions for staff from  council?  Mr. Van Overbeek.  Mr. Gustafson I want to make  sure and maybe this is a  question for your colleague Mr.  Alderboni.  Mr. Alderboni the six month  trial opening period is not  going to delay the commencement  of construction the repaving  construction on peterson right  so you can make that start in  four months which is what it  sounds like you'  re not going to wait  because of the six months?  no.  thank you.  Mr. Winslow.  one question in the previous  staff report you mentioned  there'  picnic areas on the north side  and for weddings in particular  there'  s one site 37 that'  s really popular  we have reservations for those  are people still going to be  able to make reservations can  we provide for people to be able  to make reservations which would  allow them to have vehicle  access?  we have an existing wedding  reserved in late April that of  course we would not want to  change and disrupt somebody'  s wedding so we intend to make  accommodations to open it up to  vehicular traffic to accommodate  that wedding reservation that'  s been there for a year.  But moving forward it'  s likely you can still reserve  it during the week but weekends  still reserve it but vehicular  traffic won'  t be allowed we don'  t have the staffing  bandwidth to open and close gates  and try to flush those vehicles  out after their event.  So yes for reservations but not  to include vehicular traffic on  weekends.  not to new reservations that  would involve those  accommodations?  correct.  all right.  speakers how many speakers do  we have?  we have a couple of  speakers.  we have four.  okay.  30 minutes.  all right.  I'  ll call the first tune if you  can line up in the middle aisle.  catherine coddle followed by  whitney garcia.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  If you want to close it for Peterson Drive, okay, but open it up on the South Park Drive where it's been closed for 40 years.  Furthermore, people have complained about bicycle traffic and vehicular traffic.  In my experience, there are some drivers who are very responsible, both of bicycles and of cars.  It would be my preference for bicyclists to mainly stay on the roadway where vehicles aren't.  More than not, I realize there would be some crossover.  It would be ironic for vehicular access for people like myself who have mobility issues to be closed on weekends and national holidays,  especially when you consider Fourth of July, especially when you consider the way things are right now in our federal government.  A lot of things are uncertain.  Going to the park is a way for a lot of people to ease their mind.  Don't stop that.  I realize I'm not in the majority of people who have.  I'm not saying that I have mobility issues, but a lot of people do, due to disability, due to old age, or a combination of both.  And a disability is something that anybody can have or get at any time.  It could happen to anyone in this room tonight where you'd be permanently disabled from this night on, unfortunately.  I hope it never happens.  But it's a real thing, and I'm not the only person that loses the park in my vehicle by far.  Don't close both roads to vehicular traffic.  Please.  If you want to close one side, fine.  But open up the other side that's been closed for about 40 years now.  It's important.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Whitney Garcia, followed by Cynthia Perrin.  Hi.  Hi.  I am Whitney.  I'm a co-manager of Chico Velo.  We support the closure of Peterson Memorial Drive and South Park Drive, as described, to vehicles on weekends and holidays.  These times tend to be the most frequented by families with children enjoying the secluded nature of Big Chico Creek, as well as the adults looking to relax or exercise.  The presence of cars in the park causes crowding and unsafe passing between the scooters, bicycles, and pedestrians.  It also requires recreational users to remain hypervigilant about themselves, children, and pets in the ways of vehicle traffic.  Thank you.  Chico Velo supports the proposed closure implementations.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Cynthia Perrin, followed by Amanda Gerard.  Thank you.  So I think these trial road closures can provide really excellent data with adequate public outreach.  And I keep hearing about signage and things like that, but there's more needed here, I think, than just signs.  So I didn't really encourage staff to consider.  In addition to public notice.  True education through all different media, social media, people telling, you know, enlisting people to go out and help people understand not just that it is closed, but why, and that it's on a trial basis.  For over two decades, I lived away from this area.  The only time I came home was on the weekends.  And I probably wouldn't be keeping up with local city council meetings to understand that the park would have been closed at that time.  So it would just be nice to share with the people.  And I think it's a good thing that people who come in as tourists to our area, they plan ahead to visit the park, which is a major destination for people who come in.  So I'm not saying don't close it.  I like these trial periods.  I did want to point out that before South Park Drive was closed for safety reasons, and I believe that a lack of education still contributes to some accidents on that road.  I think it was closed to vehicles to help.  eliminate vehicle, bicycle, vehicle, pedestrian accidents. But a member of my family was  permanently partially disabled by a bike big wheel accident after the road was closed to cars. So  again, just more education on which side. There's several signs explaining the directions of the  road, but signage actually on the road surface where people are looking when they're riding a  bike or when they're walking can greatly improve the safety of some of those shared pathways. So  again, education, please, a little more outreach. And it's tricky to do in situ alone. So if you  just put signage up at the entrances, you're not going to cover every single entrance. We know  there's lots of different entrances that both bicyclists and pedestrians use. So signage at  the entrance will be fine for getting cars to not come in, but people with strollers who then come  up to a surface.  That they can't stroll on will be a little confused. So thank you and good luck with this  project. Thank you. Amanda Gerard is our last speaker. I don't know if you can see, this is my  son Ari. We actually enjoy our drives on Peterson together. We get to visit every three weeks. He  comes for a visit.  We do not live together in the same home because of his limitations due to his disabilities. And he elopes and he runs away. So one of the only ways that we're able to enjoy the beautiful park is from within our vehicle. And it's always on a Sunday afternoon. And I wish you could see how much enjoyment we get from it. I'm sure it's going to be a lot of fun. But we're going to try to make it a little more fun. So thank you. family, our experience, I want to echo what's already been said. Please consider people who have mobility issues and other  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem !  podem  podem  podem  podem  Don't have a voice who, if they were able to be here now,  to literally ask you to please don't take away our ability to go for a drive.  I know we can go drive in another park, but have you seen the price of gas lately?  We already have so many limitations,  and for him, as someone who gets the most enjoyment from routine,  and always doing the same thing, and it's extremely upsetting if we do something different,  we can establish a new routine, but I would hope that you wouldn't close it until you need to,  and that you would open it again as soon as it's available again.  Especially in the summertime when it's super hot,  we can have the windows rolled up and have the air conditioning on.  We always go very slow. I don't even touch the gas.  We just let the car idle.  We go down the road, and we've never had any other issues with any other pedestrians.  We've never even had any issues with other vehicles.  I have always had quiet, private enjoyment of the park.  Myself walking, running, taking my daughter, we ride bikes.  That's just one way in which people enjoy the park,  and I would just want...  I want to make sure that you all don't forget to think about that when you're making your decision.  I know it's really important to get the road fixed,  but please just minimize it if you could.  Thank you very much for your time.  Thank you.  That's it.  Speakers.  All right. Thank you.  Any further discussion or questions from Council?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  So, first of all, I want to thank Mr. Director Gustafson for your original,  your original report on February 18th,  and then your subsequent report today.  And I found in your original report,  your recommendation was to leave Peterson open,  and you did not find any substantive reasons why it should be closed.  And so I just want to thank you for that.  Originally, I thought a temporary closure would be acceptable,  but due to the input I've received from the public,  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I'll be changing my comments and other information.  I cannot find myself continuing to support even a temporary closure.  And I'll be changing my position to support leaving Peterson Memorial Drive open.  Seven days a week.  So that's my comment.  councilmember Hawley one second.  Yep.  would like to respond to some  of the speakers not only that  spoke in the last couple of  minutes but also people who  emailed us online. One I have  no doubt that staff will be  very efficient in updating the  website Mr. Gustafson has  already proved that he'  s very thorough in signage and  I hope we can have some  discussion of whether this will  be posted on our city social  media. And then secondly I also  want to let the community know  that accessibility has always  been on the forefront of my mind  during these discussions I think  there'  s also a greater plan going  forward when we are redoing both  roads to improve them for the  community as a whole there are  also so many intricate elements  at hand that will be improving  accessibility. I think that  accessibility of the city which  I'  m very excited for and I would  like to keep it on the forefront  of my mind when we are going  over those elements how can we  ensure that they are meeting the  community'  s needs. But this is just one  step so I will be continuing to  support this.  council member O'brien.  thank you Madam Mayor. I do  want to thank as I think all of  been working together with a  comprehensive plan. But I too  am moved by the people that have  mobility issues accessibility  does become an issue for them.  Is there a way that we can  partner with mike g ride and  coming into budget season or  someone like him and move people  around in the park and being  somewhat serious for those on  those weekends like miss gerard  something we can do to help  those people that will not be  able to access a park because of  that closure. I support this I  understand the concept behind it  moving vehicles out of the park  is generally a good thing except  for that one point the  accessibility issue. I'  m assuming somehow in this very  creative city that we have we  can figure some way to allow  people that have those  mobility issues to access a park  I agree with the spirit of  that. I too as previously said  I'  m really supportive of making  sure we don'  t have vehicles in the park more  than necessary and I love the  idea of the trial period where we  can see how that goes collect the  data as one of our speakers said  and make sure we can let people  with mobility issues access our  park. I think that'  s a great point.  I think we can be creative is  there any way in our trial period  we could look further into finding  those ways to include shuttles or  pedicabs?  perhaps we will consider that in  the motion.  council member van overbeek.  Mr. Gustafson when I read the  headway plan and I know you'  ve read it and you'  I think the idea of  accessibility was a big part of  that. I really like council  brian'  s idea that we try to find some  way I was very moved by the  mayor'  s comment at the last meeting  that you have a special needs  child so when we have these kinds  of situations where you'  ve got a group of kids and they'  re going to go on a picnic we  should be able to let whoever the  driver is with the van let them go  have access.  maybe we talk to  butte county transportation people  that run the bus system to run a  small shuttle for people who are  handicapped on the weekends there'  s got to be a way to resolve this.  maybe this can be part of what you  look at going forward is providing  access to people who are  impaired.  I'  m going to restate what I  stated last time to me the only  thing that makes sense is to keep  south park drive open from cypress  to caper acres close south park  from caper acres to centennial keep  peterson memorial drive open it'  s only open from 11 a.m.  until dusk this accomplishes  everything then while we'  re keeping  the one side open figure out the  ada issues before we cut it off to  everyone.  re making it inaccessible for a  large part of our community and I  don'  t support that right now.  Figure out the issues first and then  move forward that'  s my opinion.  I'  ll take a motion.  I would like to make a motion  to enact the recommendations of the  public works director operations and  maintenance.  deb you'  re not going to make me read all  that are you?  I can.  no eric actually read them  I will read the three.  If you reference staff'  recommendations that would.  thank you.  second that.  can I make a friendly amendment  to add the component of looking at  ways to make it more accessible to  those with mobility issues?  as long as it doesn'  t delay the closing on march 8.  absolutely.  thank you.  okay.  motion to second.  all right.  councilmember goldstein.  aye.  councilmember holly.  yes.  councilmember o'brien.  yes.  councilmember van overbeck.  yes.  councilmember winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  I have no problem with south park  drive.  I will not support closing  peterson memorial drive.  my vote would be no.  thank you.  mayor reynolds.  no.  it carries 5-2.  we will take a quick early  break because we literally came  straight out here.  what do we have next?  actually this is a quick one.  5.3.  internal affairs committee  recommendation barnacle parking  enforcement device and then  we will take a quick break after  that.  mr. o'brien.  it'  s an interesting name for  an interesting device.  I think I will have chief aldridge  explain briefly the concept of  that and I can explain what we  did in internal affairs.  chief aldridge.  thank you.  the barnacle device is a  departmental  device.  s a device that we place on a  windshield that can'  t be removed unless you pay a  fine associated to that device  remotely.  it'  s got a cell phone connection  to it that allows you to use a  credit card on it to pay the  fine and particularly the fine  that we'  re looking to associate with  that device is $200.  the fines that we place those  or the fines that we place on  the violations we place the  barnacle on the windshield for  are what are known as scoff law  violations.  it'  s folks who don'  t pay their parking citations  and we have several people in  town who have thousands of  dollars worth of parking  citations built up.  it used to be we would tow  vehicles for scoff law violations  vehicles that are being used now.  it does not cause any damage to  the vehicle.  it'  s just an extremely strong  suction device that' s placed on  the windshield and blinds the  driver from being able to drive.  they have to call us to remove  it or pay the fine and bring the  device back to the police department.  if they don'  t do that within a certain amount  of time they get charged for the  violation.  we would use those to deal with  those scoff law violations around  town.  the idea would be we would use  them for other persistent  violators of areas such as on  mansion drive where there'  s permitted parking only and at  the chico history museum where  they have their own parking spots  and typically we would tow  people'  s vehicles from their  spots to remove them so they can  have their visitors and their  typically it'  s students who are parking  there all day.  we would use it for that also.  then currently just so you know  we did a test with the barnacle  device and thus far we'  ve had six deployments of  it and we'  ve recovered those scoff law  violation fines.  and the remaining  requirements for the  barnacle device is that we  and the remaining use of the  barnacle would require your  approval as we just finished our  two-month test cycle on it.  all right perfect thank you  chief aldridge.  so internal affairs was unanimous  in our recommendation to council  to essentially amend the fee  schedule to impose a $200 release  fee as was mentioned by the chief  to recover costs related to staff  removing the barnacle device in  and this is again used for those  that we would deem as scoff laws  and that was our recommendation to  council mayor.  all right any questions?  just filling a little bit  I had a light disagreement on as  far as the application of the  fine we were applying it to  scuff laws who already owe a ton  of money in parking tickets and  are on the hook to pay that  anyway and there was also the  people parking in these reserve  spots and because some of these  people already owe so much money  and we talked about some of them  are business owners who have very  nice cars some of them are just  people more irresponsible don't  have such nice cars it was a mild  disagreement I wouldn't stick with  it as far as who we apply it to  one of the important things you  don't have to have all the cash on  hand to get that thing off your  car you can set up a payment plan  effectively effectively effectively committee so we did verify that thing is sticky it works. I think it'  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively Any other questions of council      No.  effectively  I will second that.  we have a motion and a second.  councilmember Goldstein?  aye.  councilmember holly?  yes.  councilmember o'brien?  yes.  councilmember van overbeck?  yes.  councilmember winslow?  yes.  vice mayor bennett?  yes.  mayor reynolds?  aye.  carries 7-0.  now we will take a super quick  break as I know this next one  will take a few minutes.  thank you.  thank you.  all right.  let'  s come back to order  here.  thank you for that brief  intermission.  we will move to item 5.4.  councilmember goldstein requests  tools to address homelessness.  councilmember goldstein?  thank you mayor reynolds.  at our february 4th meeting a  month ago we had discussed  methods of decreasing fire risk  in our parks and greenways  focusing on unhoused people in  those spaces.  I requested after many community  members brought up their relevant  concerns about our shelter  systems and the  the !  and after crisis I requested  we discuss methods for addressing  homelessness beyond just enforcement.  to me that looks like programs as  well as potential policy and code  changes.  we heard about a diversity of  approaches from community members  and service providers including  managed campgrounds, safe parking  sites, micro shelters, partnerships  with churches and increased behavioral  health services.  again speaking of community  community-based programs led by  our service providers with the  support of our city potentially.  we have a lot of service  providers in our community and  hopefully we will have some  voices from those folks tonight  as well as interested community  members.  really I wanted to bring this  forward so we can open a public  discussion and so we can learn  from our community more about  what topics we might address and what  might lead towards better addressing  homelessness in the community because  I think we'  re all on the same page  that is a huge issue.  there are some topics and ideas in  the little write up that I provided  but I think we will hear most of  those from our community and again  we can hear those ideas and  potentially provide further  direction to staff after the public  comment period.  that'  s my summary.  all right.  any questions?  questions from the council for  ms goldstein before we go to public  comment.  this could be a four-hour  conversation.  do you have something you want to  focus on or is it just everything?  trying to cast a wide net for  now because this is an opportunity  for the public to speak and for us  to share our ideas.  I don'  t think it will be a four-hour  conversation.  it won'  t be tonight.  but I'  m just saying it'  s a great  normally when we have items on  the agenda there'  s a specific  issue that we'  re being asked to  discuss and people to speak on  and decide and this is a huge.  it certainly is.  I didn'  t want to limit it to one  item because it is a huge issue.  we have heard in our emails we  have heard people saying support  or not support for certain things.  some of the topics presented by  those people who have emailed us have !  campgrounds and some other issues  too.  I don'  t want to limit it to just one  topic but I think hearing from our  public we can discern from that if  there are certain topics we should  as a council focus on.  I don'  t want to limit it yet.  council member wenzel.  I think there'  s a lot of value in having a  conversation like this and hearing from the public.  the discussion has been in closed session because the  city'  s strategy on homelessness is largely determined by lawyers  and courts up to this point.  we'  re getting to a horizon on that.  in any case it'  s worth while to reevaluate every once in a while.  we'  ve had some service providers have put forward different  proposals and concept that manage campground and safe parking  site and stuff like that.  I think it'  s good to hear all together what people do have to propose.  what they would need from the city and see if we can get as a  council if we can project some confidence to them that they would  have some support if they have good projects and hopefully  inspire some confidence to make those proposals more concrete and  we can actually be looking at something more specific in the  near future hopefully.  all right.  speakers?  yes.  we have 18.  we have 18.  so two minutes a piece.  okay.  all right.  I'  ll call the first two speakers.  if you could line up in the middle aisle.  marie rodriguez followed by felix mahoutian.  just so you know the determination of  time on speakers is because we have rules in our ap&p that says how long we can  receive comment and that's what that determines how long the speakers are for.  thank you.  Good evening. My name is Marie Rodriguez, and it might not look like it, but I also have a disability.  I'm a Far North Regional Center client, and I volunteer with several nonprofits supporting the homeless community.  And safety is a top priority in our town, especially for people who might have a mental illness and might be homeless.  And a lot of law enforcement doesn't know about crisis intervention training.  So Chico needs more resources like micro-shelters and managed campgrounds and better behavioral health services.  These would reduce street homelessness, leading to fewer sweeps and lower costs for our city. Thank you.  Thank you. Felix Mahushan, followed by Patricia Estrada.  Hello. My name is Felix.  I wanted to begin by talking about something I saw last week.  What?  While I was out walking with my friends, I saw, you know, at least 15 people working to clean City Plaza,  doing kind of a sweep of everybody who was living there at the time.  And this included heavy machinery as well.  I know these happen. These sweeps happen about once a month, once every two months, something like that.  And so if I do the math on how much money the city is spending,  to fund this work, it's got to be like millions of dollars a year.  And that money should be used to help people who live in City Plaza.  As it stands, these sweeps do nothing to help leverage folks out of homelessness who are there.  So these are just enforcement, not preventative.  And in terms of ideas, I know that mailboxes are a huge thing.  And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  information and their application status and all that stuff. So that's a really big thing.  And then I also want to echo the managed campsites and micro shelters and the other  ideas that were raised so far. Thank you. Thank you. Patricia Estrada, followed by Lori Mason.  Hi, City Council and Mayor Reynolds. I'm here because I pay taxes for our community,  and I'm very frustrated with the continual sweeping of camps where the people have nowhere  to go. You can always tell that a camp has been sweeped because they moved to another area.  We're not solving anything during the sweeps. We need to have more options for them to go to.  I highly support Charles Wentham's Northgate Shelter Team proposal for a camp,  but I don't think that's going to work. We have to do something besides tax dollars being spent  and manpower being used sweeping camps. It's not working. Thank you.  Thank you. Lori Mason, followed by Hillary Crosby.  Thank you for allowing me to speak. I've been to multiple City Council meetings  and have spoken at a few. I've noticed that when homeless advocates are being !

I came here tonight to speak in support of additional programs addressing the needs of those experiencing homelessness in our community.  I came here tonight to speak in support of additional programs addressing the needs of those experiencing homelessness in our community.  Options such as safe car parking and managed camp grounds provide safety for people when experiencing homelessness.  and are shown to be an entry point into services for many.  These programs provide opportunities for engagement with service providers  who are trusted messengers within the community that they are serving.  The City of Chico has an opportunity to work with nonprofit organizations  who are prepared to do the heavy lift,  but they do need to feel supported and that their work will not be undermined  or blocked due to red tape and bureaucracy.  Reviewing current zoning to accommodate navigation centers,  resource centers, and resilience centers  is something proactive that the city can do.  It is also my wish that the city can find ways to streamline the process  to utilize the Genesis shelter to its full capacity.  Daily, I have clients who wish to utilize the shelter and receive shelter there,  but have been denied access and a referral.  This is frustrating and feels counterproductive to reducing homelessness.  Again, this is something that can be done  with collaboration, desire, and goodwill on behalf of the city.  I am encouraged by this discussion with the community and council,  and I do look forward to seeing progress on this issue.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Amanda Gerrard, followed by Margo Lemner.  Thank you for more time tonight.  I'm just looking forward to hearing what ideas we have  to better help those of us in our communities who are struggling  and they do not currently have a permanent residential address.  I want to see what we can do to push for more affordable housing,  and better than affordable housing, safe housing,  and more affordable housing.  In the meantime, I think that we need to improve the campgrounds  that have been proposed and are looking at on the outskirts of town.  But people also need to be able to live in town  and near amenities and near doctor's offices,  near bus stops, near grocery stores,  and everywhere that you want to be,  that's where everyone else wants to be too.  And they are people too.  They are not just objects that need to be,  they need to be swept away to somewhere else.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Margo Lemner, followed by Charles Withoon.  Yeah, my husband doesn't want me walking the streets of Chico  because he thinks the homeless people make it too dangerous.  I think it's too dangerous for anybody to have to sleep on the streets.  I've seen people in just the last couple months  sleeping on a little couch,  on a little piece of sidewalk with no overhang  and both nighttime and storm clouds moving in.  Now, would anybody in this room think that would be okay  in the richest country in the world  that somehow can't take care of its own citizens  but can take care of other countries' citizens?  We need the will.  We need outreach.  We need more shelter.  I don't care how much shelter there is.  Either it's not adequately available  or there's not enough of it.  Where's the will?  There isn't a carpet big enough to sweep all these people under.  Nor should there be.  No applause please. Thank you.  Pardon?  I was just saying no applause to not.  No.  You're good. Keep going.  Okay. Well, my parents would be rolling over in their graves.  This has been going on for a long time.  It started with Reaganomics.  Services to average normal people have been going down, down, down.  People go do their thing for the country,  come back with PTSD or worse,  and they're left to...  Broken people are supposed to fix themselves.  In America.  I didn't pledge to that flag tonight.  You know why?  Because our money's going to fund the genocide overseas.  We're going to take a break if the outbursts continue.  Thank you.  So Charles with Houn.  Hold on, Charles, one second.  And if Sarah Salisbury could go ahead and line up as well.  Thank you.  Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council, staff, thank you.  We've studied this for years and we've been to the campgrounds.  Well-managed campgrounds offer affordable and a safe stepping stone  from street camping to positive placement.  Getting back with your family, subsidized housing, a regular home.  A managed campground provides a proven, safe way to address a shelter crisis  because of new camera surveillance systems in conjunction with new phone apps  and camp monitor rotation systems.  Now a camp can have affordable security 24-7  to keep the neighbors and the residents safe.  Most managed campgrounds have either lowered the crime rate of the neighborhood  or the rate has remained the same.  Denver, Colorado has three managed campgrounds called Safe Outdoor Spaces.  Despite the crime in Denver going up 14%,  crime in and around the campgrounds has actually decreased 3%.  Denver's recommendation 18,  cease all city suites,  or any variation of forced removal of homeless,  and invest the cost savings into safe outdoor spaces.  There are many other towns up and down the West Coast  that are saving money and are safer by taking care of people.  It's pretty obvious that if you have more despair,  more people in despair on the street, it's less safe.  If we have a safe place for people to be at night,  our streets are safer for all Chacoans.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sarah Salisbury, followed by Summer Chapla.  We absolutely need more shelter options.  I am a big fan of the idea of managed campgrounds.  I live at the south end of town,  and we had people sleeping in their cars at our greenway  that neighborhood people had worked hard to develop.  And,  it was pretty hard on the greenway,  but people did have cars.  Some people who don't have a house,  they have a shelter in a car.  So if there's a place they can park that car,  and they can have facilities,  we've got to remember that.  They've got to have toilet facilities,  and ideally some kind of garbage disposal, right?  So I think that that, managed campgrounds are a great way to go.  Other shelter options also.  Please let's do this.  It's more civilized.  It's right.  And it's really good for everybody.  For neighborhoods, citizens, unhoused people.  Let's do that.  We can do that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Summer Chapla, followed by Adam Fideli.  Hello.  Hello.  This is my first time.  I was actually just going to finish what Lori had started,  but she covered everything.  So,  I'm just going to say,  tomorrow is the two-year anniversary of finding my brother,  in his tent after he overdosed.  And so,  I don't know what the answer is.  I know that there has to be a better one than what's going on right now.  And we have to treat these people with dignity,  because they are human beings.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Adam Fideli, followed by Robin McCollum.  Evening, Council.  Thank you all for serving.  I want to share a brief experience.  I too live in South Chico.  I've been involved with the Comanche Creek Greenland.  I've been in the Greenway since its inception.  I walk it three days a week at least for my exercise.  And I can tell you,  when there was the out-of-control city camping site on Eaton and Cohasset,  the one benefit of that is that people were there instead of actually being in the Greenway.  You know, post-COVID, the Greenway took a severe beating.  Got it cleaned up.  Law enforcement did a great job monitoring it.  And afterwards, you know, there was seemingly some more options.  Once that camping place went away, people started filtering back into the Greenway.  Camps, you know, have been cleaned out downtown and nearby.  You know, there's six or eight new people in the Greenway camping.  You know, it's a semi-wild area.  You know, people shouldn't be there.  If we try the managed campground concept, I firmly believe we'll be better off.  If for no other reason, then people will be there and not in the park, not in the ditch,  not in the Greenway, not freezing their asses off.  You know, it goes on and on and on.  But I think we're at the point now where we should give it a shot.  So that's what I would request.  Thanks very much.  Thank you.  Robin McCollum followed by Mary Kay Benson.  Good evening, council members.  North State shelter team has provided quite a bit of information and proposals, ways to do this managed campground.  You know, the fourth of five reasons that the founders, you know,  wrote the Constitution was to promote the general welfare.  So I call on the council to at least support, if not lead the effort to establish these managed campgrounds.  Playing whack-a-mole with our homeless is not a solution.  It is very costly and totally ineffective.  They need places where they will stay and not be vulnerable or a nuisance to those who have homes nearby, homes and businesses.  They need basics like secure, lockable shelter, a place to toilet, showers, drinking water, a community center where they can establish their own rules.  Anyway, the number of camps must match the numbers of homeless.  Right now, that is not what's happening.  We may say we can't afford it, but we are spending more now on ineffective sweeps.  Houses and homeless alike need an effective solution.  The failure to provide that is generating an electoral backlash and rightly so.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mary Kay Benson, followed by Eric Chisler.  Hello, council, and thank you for holding the first public discussion on homeless solutions.  Yay.  So it's been four years of sweeps.  And $12 million spent in two years at $4 million each for the pallet genesis shelter for two years.  That's $8 million.  Leaving $4 million for what?  I suppose it's sweeps.  And that's our tax dollars at work.  Then the state also gave $2.7 million to chico for homeless solutions.  And obviously, we have to do something about that.  So I'm here to support north state shelter teams' managed campgrounds based on success models that's working in many other places, many of them similar size and population to chico.  So what have we got to lose by trying something new?  We could get more clean parks and public spaces, something that we all say we want.  Otherwise, repeating the same old thing and expecting different results, what's that the description of again?  Insanity.  So as taxpayers, we really would like to have solutions.  We can do better and spend taxpayer money more wisely.  So for the next step, I would like to ask one of you to please stand.  I would like to ask you to please agendize or get agendized a 15-minute presentation by north state shelter team.  They've done so much work and research on this that I would love to hear from them.  I volunteered with them for a year on the shower trailer.  And I can tell you personally, they do great work.  Thank you.  Eric chisler followed by david welch.  Hello, council.  Good evening.  I'm going to start with the council.  I'm going to start with the council.  For three years now, the council has hidden behind the proverbial skirts of the war and settlement agreement stating their hands are tied.  But this has never been the case.  The war and settlement has only created a bare minimum of action that must be met.  In short, the settlement agreement sets a standard for what can be done.  Inside of that standard are myriad solutions.  Managed campgrounds, more robust shelter support, designated parking lots, increased mental health services and standards, and so on.  It doesn't create a ceiling for possible solutions.  It creates a floor.  The decision to do nothing and resist nearly every attempt to pursue alternatives is an active political strategy and policy position.  The enforcement first model for solving homelessness isn't working and is currently off limits.  Enforcement is one very limited tool in the toolbox.  And enforcement itself has become a polite term for punishment.  But it has been shown over and over again that supportive services are more effective and more efficient at transforming trauma and getting people off the streets.  People will not stop doing what it takes to survive.  This is simply a universal fact of biology.  And that's where the ill effects of homelessness come from.  Survival strategies.  They will lean on the survival strategies they have until they've been given reason to believe it is safe to change those strategies.  Like it or not, approve of it or not, drug use, theft, and littering are survival strategies.  Punishing homeless individuals will not stop them from trying to survive.  So what we are asking for as citizens and service providers is to have a chance to change what survival means for the unhoused.  Thank you.  Thank you.  David Welch followed by Miranda Beyer.  First I want to second the previous speaker's very eloquent call for a range of options.  The managed campground is an important one, a safe parking place and so on is also going to be an important part of it.  My wife and I have perhaps an unusual perspective on it because we spend a lot of time bicycling around the country.  We have a lot of time around the community for both recreation and much of our transportation.  And in the process we ride pretty much all of the bike paths in the community fairly frequently.  And those are places where people end up camping when they have no other options.  And that's given us a kind of a window into this process where we have seen how many times the same encampment areas have been cleaned up over and over and over again.  Probably at a cost of thousands of dollars.  And that's a lot of money.  We're going to have to spend thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of dollars each time it's done.  And that just totally aside from considerations of human decency, that just seems like an incredibly wasteful process to be continuing to do.  And we really need to look beyond enforcement as the answer.  And if we go further in the direction of an enforcement-only approach and actually start jailing people for sleeping on the streets, that really raises the waste to a new level.  Because I'm sure that we're going to have to do that again.  And I'm sure the cost of a night in jail is far more than the cost of a night in a good hotel.  So we really need to expand that thinking, listen to the providers who have plans and who understand the problem.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Miranda Beyer, followed by Tayla Swanger.  Good evening, counsel.  Also, it's Talia.  So thank you.  Thank you for letting me speak.  As one of our council members said, we're a very creative city.  We have artisans.  We have people who are incredibly interested in solutions for this matter in particular.  And I just want to highlight a few while also maintaining the fact that I don't know very much about all of the details.  There are so many solutions to homelessness that we have yet to try.  Spending thousands of dollars on camp sweeps directly opposes our community members' efforts to avoid the effects of the pandemic.  We need to do our best to assist those in need.  I personally know many that have donated their time, their money, their produce to feeding people at their lowest.  And it's very disheartening to see so many of those resources be swept up in, you know, minimum $25,000 spent per sweep, knowing that the blanket my grandmother knitted that I donated is now in a trash can somewhere because someone couldn't carry it out on their back.  I just want to say thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem !  podem  podem  podem  podem  there are so many solutions.  Everhart Village is a great example.  Shower trailers and laundry,  the water can be reused to then create  a means of gardening to feed these people in need.  And I really hope that we can come up  with something together as a community.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ms. Swangler, so I don't mess up your name,  and I apologize.  Hi, I'm Talia Swangler.  I'm here to urge city council to take sensible action  to change the situation regarding the unhoused folks  here in Chico.  We've tried the expensive and ineffective sweeps  and been unkind and dehumanizing in the process.  And this conversation absolutely can take four hours.  And that is really frustrating and annoying and inconvenient.  And I'm here contributing to it.  And we've had evidence-based strategies  this whole time and some really bright minds  here in the community and really capable people  and bright minds up there as well.  That's nice.  So, but yeah, plenty of folks really care about this.  They're going to keep taking up your time  and bothering, being inconvenient  until the city moves in a more humane  and effective direction.  So please do something other than sweeps.  Thank you.  And our last speaker is Sharon Fritz.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you.  I'm sure you've heard it.  Pull this poll down just a little bit so they can hear you.  Thank you.  Thanks for the opportunity to speak to you.  I'm sure you've heard it this all many times before.  The cost of, I think I want to echo what the lady just said  about the cost of the  the cost of the cost of the  the trash, the filth, the unsanitary conditions,  the disease that has come up.  Lori here treats people at the shower trailer  for infections when people get cuts.  They can't clean them, keep themselves clean  so that it gets infected.  And one lady ended up in the hospital for eight days  because of an infection.  Charles spends a tremendous amount of time trying.  It costs $400 to bring a shower out there $400 each time they take it out  the !  we need more of it.  Thank you very much.  thank you that'  s it  for the speakers.  comments from council?  first since I started this  thank you to the commenters for  very brief powerful comments.  I mostly want to  I will open it up to the rest of  council to provide their insight  or any items that they heard  that we might be able to agree  on, move forward to direct staff  to whether provide more  information on, pursue or  anything we might want further  presentations on from our  community members or staff.  Those are the sorts of directions  I'  m looking to see  if folks would support.  staff I know there'  s been a lot of  different people involved in it  but north state shelter team has  had a few conversations about  some of their proposals. I don'  t know when the last one was  at least a few months. Can  somebody summarize where you'  re at with that?  Are there things we can do to  help them out?  me and other staff from the  planning department have met with  the council and shared their  suggestions and ideas. Following  that meeting we shared some of  the restrictions that are either  in our code or in the building  code or title 19 which is our  land use development requirements  for sequel review. The questions  were what do these other  communities do? Can you please  find more details how they  navigated those general  requirements?  We'  ve had subsequent meetings to  and discuss other things they'  looking to pursue and our  biggest question over every time  is it depends I think people  look for simple answers to very  complicated issues and so  usually the question comes up is  what do you want to do very  comprehensively and where?  managing the campground it'  s where and what does that look  like and so we'  ve challenged them to  get additional information for  us ordinances and other things  that were challenged on a  negative way in a collegial way  how did some of these other  communities do that? That'  s the nature of those  conversations.  thank you.  this was brought up as tools to  address homelessness and that'  s definitely an important  topic and one that elected  officials and service providers  are having on a daily basis I  well know. Starting at the  federal government the state of  california butte county all of  them are distributing and or  receiving funds and are tasked  with serving our homeless  population. Locally we have the  podem effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  went to the extinction campground  was the automatic step of the  next place to go I think before  we automatically go there there  is a lot of things to look at.  During the warden settlement  worth spending about $10 million  a year right now. The last pick  count that we have the current  numbers for which is 2023 to  2024 I couldn' t find that it'  s been put out yet maybe it has  have been looking at is the  was 1,237 people 925 of those  are in chico and 555 of them are  in shelter that was again at  that point.  Math right now says the city  is spending about $10,000 a year  per person we have a pallet  shelter and alternative site  that are having significant  issues and impacts on the  surrounding businesses and  neighborhoods some of which are  not in good shape.  I agree with a ton of what I  heard tonight whatever we do  needs to work for everybody our  unhoused our community members  and our businesses. With that  said my recommendation and  motion would be we create an  ad hoc committee chaired by  myself joined by hopefully mrs.  Goldstein and maybe councilmember  o'brien. The committee would be  in the middle of the meeting  and we would have a time  sensitive due date of coming  back in one of our June meetings  and we would bring a report back  to council with recommendations  for the full council to consider  at that time and the scope of the  committee would be on the three  items originally agendized one  ordinances to code changes and  three programs and I would ask  that we call in all the experts  from those individual items we  tackle them individually and come  back with a thorough report and the  reason I would like to take this to  an ad hoc committee because this  format just sucks because there is  a lot of things that I would like  to respond to and talk back to and  I'm sorry if I'm not allowed to say  that on the dais but it just is  not conducive to having a conversation  and we need to converse and we need  to take down this stupid wall and  we need to look each other across the  table and be like how are you feeling  what do you feel about this what do you think about that. Charles I want to  hear more about xyz rule.  You know  mail did you know in order  to get a mail to get an id  in order to get a bus ticket you have to have an id  in order to get an id you have to have an  address you know what you do when you don't  have an address you send it to the po box guess what you have to  have at the po box to get your mail  an id so your mail is sitting  behind the mail at the po box and  you can't get it because you don't have your id to get your  mail and you can't do squat without your  id so I agree we need mail we need  showers we need all these things.  do this and yes I did do a lot of outreach  and work during the fire and I do have a lot of knowledge on  this that a lot of people don't know that I do because I don't  talk about what I do.  So anyways if anybody else would be interested in doing an  ad hoc committee I would love to take this out of here and go do  some hard work.  can I ask a question and I am not interested in another  ad hoc committee.  I volunteer  council person O'Brien but at any  rate  is it your idea that we have a couple of  people like we have a five person  and with three people from the community  homeless services  providers or other people?  Absolutely experts in their  matter per say and then  what I would like to do is the three council  the members that are doing it to have a  meeting first discuss the parameters  set what it is going to be I have some ideas  but I don't have all the ideas in the room  I have some ideas but I definitely think  involvement from people that have a lot of knowledge  in each of those areas is super  important that includes say  going to be a space for  Did you make a motion?  I did make a motion.  I will second it.  I am going to agree with that as well  if I may make a comment.  If you will indulge me to do that.  And thanks for the vote of confidence  Tom I appreciate that.  I was the chair of the  jesus centre for eight years  been in law enforcement for 35 I deal with addiction on a daily basis.  The truest thing I heard in the  tonight was from miss lehman i believe margo when you said broken people don't fix themselves  that's true it is true typically they do not fix themselves when we're talking about addiction  and mental illness and that's really let's be honest that's what we're talking about right now  so i think this ad hoc can address all these myriad of issues there's a lot of depth to it  we understand that and i think the only way to have a real conversation like you said mayor look  people in the eye and get real answers is to have a specific dedicated ad hoc committee to address  this and i would support that yeah as long as we can have some applause there i'm just kidding  no i i have to agree i think that the format of not being able to ask questions of the people  from our service provider organizations because we're all the way up here is not really conducive  to the best  you  i would support that and i think that would be a great asset for public input so i could see an ad  hoc committee being a great asset.  council member winslow.  i was going to make one of my joke not jokes about accepting council member van over  recommendation this before our conversation and now i'm hearing that you guys will do that and we  don't we can stick with our ad hoc committee we already have i think that'  s i think that'  s a great idea i was on an ad hoc committee that was formed in 2021 i think we had a lot of really good concepts that came out of there that was also won by zoom it was a really broad the amount of people that came into these discussions and i think we'  re describing a little more targeted and also we'  re not under a court order to decide what we do and i think that helps for we can have a public discussion about what we should do and as somebody said here i don'  t know what the answer is but i know there has to be a better one than what'  s happening right now and i'  m very glad that we can have a public discussion about what we should do and as somebody said here i don'  t know what the answer is but i know there has to be a better one than what we should do and as somebody said here i don'  t do in solving homelessness I  podem do in solving homelessness I think we can get together and  we can get together and make our own decisions and I'm excited about that.  Councilmember Hawley.  Thank you Miss Mayor just to voice my support of this idea I think it's something that  I think has been missing for a long time and I'm really glad that this conversation has  resulted in you bringing this forward.  But I also want to add I am ready to take some very big decisive action from this.  That's what we want to get done.  So looking forward to it to hearing about it or else that would be a quorum of course.  Yeah I will say that yeah post motion I think there's a little bit more discussion I'd  like to have tonight too.  Okay well we have a motion and a second right so.  We have a motion and a second.  Okay.  All right.  Councilmember Goldstein.  Aye.  Councilmember Hawley.  Yes.  Councilmember O'Brien.  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Councilmember Winzlow.  Sorry one quick question.  So you said you're going to meet as a three member committee here.  And then you're going to come up with some parameters and then we're going to talk about  that.  Is it going to come back to council for?  No I was going to have us three decide how we want to run the actual ad hoc committee  itself.  I don't think that needs to come back to council.  Okay.  I want to do this as quickly as possible so we can get information back as quickly as  possible so we can start making some changes.  Okay.  We're going to put you under the gun all right.  I said one of the meetings in June.  Okay.  So Councilmember Winzlow.  Yes.  That was a yes.  Okay.  Didn't hear that.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Carries seven-zero.  Okay.  I'm not sure what additional did you have comments for.  Well I heard the Councilmember Hawley say we can take some decisive action tonight.  I think there's one thing that's sort of I think now the cooperation with service providers  I feel a lot of confidence going forward in that.  the city of california and  and I wanted to talk about the  pallet shelter for genesis for  a second according to the  state' s website there'  s 18  shelters open our last notice  that went out for three public  properties we cleared there were  a total of 15 people in them and  eight of those it said were  either had been ejected from a  shelter or they had previously  assessed so we'  re required to count  them in that. We'  ve had this because of  our legal strategy we want to  to keep the public spaces open  because we want to be able to  clear out the public spaces and  keep them open so we need to  have surplus beds in order to  meet the need to justify these  clearances but we'  ve got to the point  where these camps are so much  smaller we don'  t need the amount of  surplus beds we keep open so I  wonder if we could get some  direction in order to better  utilize the pallet shelter while  keeping just enough open to  maintain our schedule of  clearances but every single one  of those people could have been  offered a pallet shelter and I  know they'  re not they'  re offered the tourist  shelter more often if anything  consider that as well. I wonder  if that'  s something we can consider as  direction.  I would rather consider  that and take it up in the actual  meeting and have it come back  with the report but that'  s my preference.  I think it'  ll be worth making a motion  on unless that would preclude us  from further discussion on it.  can we get feedback from  staff scuffs and sorensen?  we currently have a  safely rely on our experts to  make those assessments. We have  been down as low as single  digits I think we had 1.5 or 6  vacancies and you'  re right as soon as  they'  re all full we run the risk of  no more enforcements.  my supposition is that  number has changed and what we  need in order to safely make  that risk. It might be other  information I don'  t have I know the  minister is in the audience  and I don'  t know if you'  d have any  feedback.  I would also say there'  s quite regularly  people that are offered pallet  shelter don'  t go. I could think of one  person who was mentioned  previous council meeting refused  pallet shelter refused tourist  shelter refused alt site. We do  have that situation to contend  with.  do you have an update on  the shelter interest line for  the pallet shelter?  I don'  t that'  s spelled out in detail  as to how it works in the  settlement agreement. That would  be something that ms. Bass and  her folks manage and would have  to report on.  I think these are all good  discussions to have as part of  this ad hoc committee. I think  anything else is premature.  That'  s where it really belongs in  my opinion.  I think some basic direction  around better utilization of the  empty beds of the pallet shelter  without interrupting our schedule  of clearances. I don'  t feel like I need more  information in order to say  that'  s a good idea. Some of  these people who are out on the  street who we'  re spending money to clear  out of our parks could be in  pallet shelters. Some of them  would accept them I think even  though some won'  t.  if I can add also maybe I'  m missing some information but  it sounds like there may be more  opportunities to fit more people  per pallet shelter. I think  determine that. I know there'  re some rules on that but I  would leave it to our subject  matter experts and the pallet  shelter to determine that. I do  feel like there'  s an opportunity  for us to better utilize the  spaces. I'  ll make the motion to direct  staff to ensure better  utilization of our pallet  shelter.  I'  ll second that.  and I'  ll go to our next  podem effectively. of the pallet shelter without the enforcement component? I would say that'  I guess I assume the enforcement component is implied. We can'  podem effectively.  podem effectively.  podem effectively.  podem effectively.  podem effectively.  podem effectively.  motion by council member  goldstein seconded by council  member Winslow.  I suggest we do if I can offer  that as a friendly amendment  we'  re not seeking to interrupt  the schedule and say we can'  t move forward with clearing  some people out of an area  because there'  s a shortage of beds.  Improving utilization relative  to now but without impacting the  schedule.  if that'  s a friendly amendment I'  ll make the amendment.  okay.  all right.  council member goldstein.  aye.  council member holly.  yes.  council member o'brien.  is there information that  the pellet shelter is not run  well?  I know it'  s run well.  I'  m voting no.  this is part of the ad hoc  committee in my opinion.  no.  council member van overbeck.  I think this is part of the  ad hoc committee too.  I can'  t think of a greater success  than the pellet shelter and I  don'  t want to I think we need to  tread very carefully with the  carefully if we'  re going to give them input.  so I vote no.  okay.  thank you.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  I agree with councilor o'  brien as well as mr.  van overbeck.  this is premature and I think  we need to let the ad hoc  committee do its job.  they can take a look at this at  that time.  so I'  m going to vote no.  okay.  thank you.  mayor reynolds.  I'  m a no as well but I promise  that it will be part of our  ad hoc committee.  okay.  and it will be part of our ad  mayor bennett failed three  four.  all right.  all right.  with that leave me your  microphone on.  items posting after the agenda  we have none.  reports and communications.  the following reports and  communications are items  provided for council's  information.  no action can be taken on  items under this section unless  the council agrees to include it  on a subsequent agenda.  city manager's report?  no report.  no report.  chico fire is information only.  that is on your agenda.  the city of midway park and  the city of midway park and  council member request do we  have any council member request?  thank you Madam Mayor.  this relates to the bid will  park and playground commission  I'  ve been having  conversations with them we had  a speaker earlier about the  condition of the trails in  upper park we have a lot of  things going on we talked about  the road closures the  rebuilding of the one mile pool  so I would like to ask the  council to allow the bid will  park playground commission to  put an item on their agenda for  them without hiring a consultant  for them to come up with a 20  year plan of what are the  priorities both maintenance  priorities but also a vision for  what the park can be I'  ve heard a lot of  ve been to I used to  run a lot before my knees gave  out and I would always when I  travel stay at hotels near parks  and so I run through a lot of  parks in the united states and  other parts of the world and we  have an extraordinarily  spectacular piece of real estate  that is in my mind under I don'  t like to use  the word development but it'  s underutilized and we could do  some great things with it and I  think it'  s a great task for the  playground or park commission and  it won'  t cost us anything.  I'  ll second that and I'  ll add this is a comment I'  ve been talking to the bid will  park playgrounds commissioner about some things they might like to  discuss because we have this process where they have to ask us and we  have to ask to agenda and then we  agenda sending it to them I don'  t have those things yet but I  might come up with a list at a later meeting.  we have a motion and a second.  thank you.  thank you.  we have a motion and a second.  to refer the discussion or refer  the duty to come up with a 20-year  plan and priorities without using a  consultant is that correct?  we'  re bringing that back here as a  discussion.  right.  okay.  my proposal was that we allow  the bid will park and playground  commission to put on their agenda  coming up with a 20-year plan for the park.  well the council can just refer it to  them and that goes automatically on  their agenda then.  all right.  then yes.  wait are you saying we don'  t need to have a meeting to discuss our  referral of an item to the.  no I'  m talking about you don'  t have to refer it to the bid will park and playground commission to put it on their agenda.  if the council at the meeting where you take this matter up and you direct it then it just automatically goes on the agenda.  and staff takes that forward to the commission.  it'  s not like we have to put it on their agenda or they have to put it on their.  it'  s anything that the council ever wants to refer to a commission that'  s how those things get done and that'  s because it'  s in alignment with your priorities that you set or the budgetary constraints or whatever.  so it'  s always driven by council was what the thought process was.  great.  thanks.  okay.  all right.  and this is to agendaize a future discussion.  so council.  member goldstein.  aye.  council.  member holly.  yes.  council.  member o'brien.  yes.  council.  member van overbeck.  yes.  council.  member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  mayor reynolds.  aye.  carry 7-0.  any others?  all right.  we are adjourned to our strategic planning meeting at 5 30 next on the 11th.  correct?  sorry.  do I have it?  yeah.  next tuesday.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.
