 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sorry for being just a couple minutes late.  We got out of closed session just a few minutes late.  In a call to order, our meeting and start with our invocation by  Chaplain Hockins.  Hockins.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  Let's pray.  Almighty spirit of light, come to us with the power as that of  our rising sun.  Let there be light in our words and on our path that we walk  each day that our council members walk each day.  Let us remember always that you give us the gift of a new day.  And never let us be burdened with the sorrow by not starting  over again.  Spirit of love, come to us with power to make us courageous,  with the power to make us strong.  When cold winds blow across the land, give us strength and  endurance for everything that is harsh, everything that hurts,  everything that makes us squint.  Let us move through life ready to take what comes to us from  your hand.  Spirit of life, when we face the direction of the sundown, let us  remember that the moment will come when our sun, too, will go  down.  Never let us be burdened with the sorrow by not starting over again.  Let us remember that we are called to live in and through you.  Give us the wisdom of beautiful color.  Give us great courage so that when it is our time to meet you,  we can come with wisdom and light.  Spirit of creation, send us the warm and soothing winds of summer.  Comfort us when we are tired from the work you have given us.  As you give to all the earth your warm, moving wind, give us the  strength to give it to us also so that we may grow close to you in  warmth.  Remind us that we did not create the web of life.  We are but a strand in and of it.  Whatever we do in this web of life, remind us that we have done it to  you and to ourselves.  Grant us wisdom as decisions are made which impact all of creation.  For it is in your presence, God of love, that we pray.  Amen.  All right.  Please rise for the pledge of allegiance.  Salute and pledge.

I know these things can move quickly especially  when you guys got stuff done. I'm sorry.  So I wrote this speech. It's ladies and  gentlemen. Tonight I want to shed light  on the pressing issue that continues to  plague our community. The low income  housing scam which has become an  unimaginable burden on taxpayers while  failing to provide effective solutions  to the housing crisis.  Jamboree housing examples boast over  20,000 units and a staggering 3.2  billion in asset value all under  management of a state senator's daughter.  This raises crucial questions. Are these  programs truly serving our community or  are they simply vehicles for profit?  While I've seen these programs work  effectively in the past, the current  approach appears to be misguided and  is fraught with issues. We now face  a crisis of the low income housing  scam.  solution where inviting homeless  individuals to our community is not  merely a discussion. It's a grand vision  championed by figures like Gavin Newsom.  This vision seems more concerned with  headlines and real needs and desires of  our residents. Offering enticing  subsidies such as $3,750 a month for  unrented units will only attract more  individuals seeking aid without  providing the necessary framework for  their integration into society.  It's essential to the community to  distinguish between genuine support and  superficial promise of a system that  fails to address the root cause of  homelessness. Furthermore, this  influx of individuals can overwhelm our  resources, compromising the well-being  of residents and long-standing members  of this community. We must ask  ourselves whether we are truly  prepared for the consequences of this  grand vision or whether we are simply  setting ourselves up for further  disappointment. As we move forward, I  urge you to demand accountability for  the actions of our leaders and  the actions of our community. We need  to ensure that our policies serve our  community's best interests, not merely  political agendas. We need solutions  that prioritize stability and general  support for those in need. Thank you for  your attention and let's work together  to create a future that truly benefits  our entire community.  Feel free to contact me. I know all  about these Senate bills, Assembly  bills, how they work. We're going to be  I'm not going to be the only one  who's going to be the only one.  We're kind of going to be under attack.  I've looked into these programs myself  and I'm like, hell yeah, I can make  350 G's a month. You guys are going to  invite a lot of negativity. Adam Schiff  was here secretly last night at the Farm  Bureau. That's a danger to our entire  society, as we know. So I would hope that  you guys would pay attention to what the  federal government's doing. I'm not  going to be the only one. I'm going to  being attacked by the state and not  what our state governors are attempting  to do to our city. Reimagine how we're  under a kinetic attack from our  politicians. That will serve a few.  And there's a lot of people out there  asking today. Thank you very much.  That's your time. Thank you. I  appreciate it. Have a good day.  Thank you. Bo Powell followed by  a friend of mine.  Everybody supports our police and our  fire departments.  Even our military and our vets.  We all support them.  Respecting them is something different.  Nobody lets farmers spray the children  of people they respect.  Nobody.  Now I went to that Tuscan water meeting  out at Durham Park. Because I knew the  white with chemicals. Action News, the Enterprise Record, and 7R all set up, and the county  couldn't have set it up any better. They have a podium right in front of a white orchard,  chemical-laden orchard. They did their spill, and I said to the reporters, boy, that's going  to be hard to edit out, huh? The reporters couldn't believe it, you know? They wanted  my name and what kind of chemicals it is and all that. Well, I gave them the name of a  real reporter and told them that the building that now is the Ag Bureau, the Farm Bureau  building, is the most sprayed building in the county.  They took Adam Schiff there, and right across the road, it's surrounded, four corners,  orchard. There's even a great winery right there. This is Adam Schiff's phone number.  I called his office, told them what they're doing. There shouldn't be a mayor in America  that doesn't know they're spraying your children, your family, the people who voted  for you.  The same goes with police and fire chiefs. Mr. Winslow, you seem really intelligent.  You asked about sharing taxes. These people automatically come up with amnesia. There was  a $10 million overpayment that was in the article January 18th, the News and Review,  or January 4th, 2018.  $10 million. It started a couple years before they started the methyl bromide. Okay? You  need leverage. There's your leverage. You need leverage. Senator Schiff, if you folks  don't call him, he's going to know. Thank you.  Okay. Gina Backs is our last speaker.  Okay. Gina Backs is our last speaker.  Good evening. I am here tonight as a concerned immigrant and American who recently came across  a city council member post on Facebook promoting a migrant watch workshop. As someone who went  through the legal immigration process, this feels upsetting. It seems to encourage people  to resist immigration enforcement, which doesn't sit right with me.  As I came to this country 30 years ago, followed the rules, paid the fees, and waited my turn,  effectively effectively effectively  effectively But when public officials endorse such events, it can send a confusing message. It might make people think that breaking the law is acceptable and that's not the message we should be sending. We need to focus on unity and lawful solutions. Instead of promoting actions  Instead of promoting actions that might lead to fear and division, our leaders should educate  the community about lawful avenues to residency and citizenship.  I know that there are tons of resources and ways to enter and stay in this country legally,  but it takes time, money, and patience.  Promoting workshops that could be perceived as encouraging resistance against law enforcement  does not help our community.  It risks creating an environment of mistrust and fear, which is counterproductive to the  goal of integration and unity.  All this training might inadvertently encourage individuals to interfere with law enforcement  activities potentially leading to legal complications.  Public servants could also be putting the same people they want to protect in risky  situations, especially if they lack proper training.  I urge our city leaders to consider the broader implications of their endorsements.  You got elected to represent all of us, and that includes legal immigrants like me.  Public hearings.  The hearing to consider the draft 2025-2029 consolidated plan and draft 2025-2026 annual.  podem Okay. Okay. Hello. Good evening, Mayor,  Vice Mayor and Council Members, tonight we present to you the City's draft 2025 through  2026 Consolidated Plan for the use of Community Development Block Grant and Home Funds.  Along with discussing the Consolidated Plan, staff will also go over next year's annual  plan, which will be for 2025-2026, and it includes proposed activities and budget allocations  for next fiscal year.  The City contracted with Housing Tools to assist with the completion of the Consolidated  Plan and the Community Development Director, Sherry Murado, is here in attendance and will  be available for questions after this presentation.  The Consolidated Plan is a five-year strategic planning document developed through a collaborative  process that allows jurisdictions to define a vision for housing and community development.  It aligns HUD-funded programs with locally identified needs.  It promotes coordinated planning, community engagement, and efficient use of resources.  The plan establishes overarching program goals, specific objectives, annual goals, and measurable  benchmarks to track our progress.  The City receives CDBG, which I discussed, is funding that can be used for community  development and housing needs.  It focuses on serving low and moderate income individuals, households, and neighborhoods.  The City also relates to the City's plan for the use of Community Development Block Grant  to support the development of affordable housing.  The City also receives home funding, and that is to be used to develop and preserve affordable  housing.  Both of these programs are administered by HUD, the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  through its Office of Community Planning and Development.  As part of this planning process, the City's requires us to demonstrate how we will involve  the public.  Tonight's public hearing is one of the many ways that we've involved our public through  this process.  Also outlined in the  City's Participation Plan, which was included as part of my staff report, also talks about  the steps that we took to make sure that we were including residents and those impacted  by the use of these funds.  HUD requires that the Consolidated Plan address significant national goals focused on serving  low and moderate income individuals.  That this year is defined as a household that is earning at or below 80% of area median  income.  For example, a household of four would earn $72,500 or less per year.  So we're talking that is the max of income that we're talking about for those assisted  with these fundings.  The goals include decent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic  opportunities.  The Consolidated Plan is a substantial document that includes various components.  I've listed those above.  It includes the following.  The Consolidated Plan includes a summary and process that gives an overview of how  we went about putting the document together.  The needs assessment provides a thorough analysis of housing, homelessness, public housing,  community development, and economic development needs.  The housing market analysis is a comprehensive review of local housing conditions and identifies  trends, gaps, and barriers that may be affecting access to affordable, safe, and stable housing.  The strategic plan is a description of all those and talks about how we're going to  reach the goals that we've identified within the five-year plan.  Included in this plan is next year's one-year plan, which is our annual plan.  And I will go into more detail about that in the future presentation.  So also included with the Consolidated Plan is a Citizen Participation Plan, which was  slightly updated from what we had previously had from the last five years.  And we have an updated analysis of impediments to fair housing.  And also included is a list of how we provided public notices and outreach to our public.  This is, everything is included in attachment B to my staff report.  I would say that the report comes from an online portal that we use through HUD, so  it's a system.  It's a system-generated document.  And so excuse us if there are some formatting inconsistencies within the document, but it  is what we get when we put all of the data in there.  Speaking of data, this is a list of data sources that were used to put together the report.  Not only are we using HUD data sources, we're using community surveys, census data, we undertake  numerous.  We're also using local agencies to do surveys with local agencies such as the COC, the Public  Housing Authority.  We talk with service providers.  We look at the local market.  We provide community input through meetings.  And we also look at adopted local plans and reports that are currently being undertaken.  So the five-year Consolidated Plan includes five overarching priority needs.  We're also looking at the five-year Consolidated Plan.  Those are listed here, including 12 goals as shown on the table.  The priority needs and goals were developed through our public engagement process, like  I said, through interviews with our stakeholders, with an overarching goal of aligning those  goals with directives outlined in the City of Council-approved housing element and through  our last five-year Consolidated Plan.  Priority needs, one, are the needs of the public.  One is affordable housing.  Goals of this priority include the development of homeowner units, the development of multi-family  units, rehab of rental units, rehabilitation of owner occupied units, and infrastructure  to support affordable housing.  Some examples of what we have spent funding on in the past include the development of  a couple of affordable housing projects, the foundation including one.  We also have a project that we're working on right now with Habitat Butte County, it's  called Roslyn Court.  It's going to be five units, which includes an ADU.  Then Creekside Place, which was completed a couple of years ago, and then also in the  bottom right corner is the North Creek Crossings 1 and 2, which also receives CDBG and home  funding.  Priority needs, two, are the needs of the public.  The next two and three revolve around homeless prevention and homeless services.  Those can include providing rental assistance through our tenant based rental assistance  program and providing non-homeless public services.  For example, funding Chico Meals on Wheels, Peg Taylor Center, homeless services include  funding non-profits, different emergency shelters, and agencies that provide homeless services  in town.  And then also funding Camperside.  We also have a project that we're working on right now that will be used for homeless  public facilities.  Priorities four and five include neighborhood revitalization, which includes code enforcement,  and that is the hope there is that together with other city improvements and services,  code enforcement can mitigate the decline and will support the neighborhood improvement  of these areas in our town.  Another goal is capital and public improvements.  That could include sidewalks, improvements, curbs, gutters, lightings, accessibility,  including ADA compliance.  And the last is economic development.  And the goal for that is micro enterprise assistance.  This is helping small businesses either with one-on-one counseling or training.  And the city has funded small business development center in the past.  Okay.  Now that's a lot.  Those are some lofty priority needs and 12 goals that serve as a strategic framework  for maximizing the impact of our limited HUD funds.  I want to highlight that this plan reflects a commitment to leverage those CDBG and home  funds with partnerships with our local agencies, non-profit organizations, and private sector  stakeholders.  Proposed programs and activities were prioritized because they aligned with past HUD funded  initiatives and the city's commitment to leverage those funds to support and assist  staff in implementing the housing element.  And here's the reality.  Despite increasing community development and affordable housing needs, the city's entitlement  allocations have remained relatively flat for almost two decades.  Unfortunately, our allocations have not kept pace with inflation, rising construction costs,  or the growing demand for services and housing, particularly in our area.  I know this is a busy graph, but I want to focus on the two dotted trend lines that  represent the two key trends in our area.  The first trend is the increase in the number of home funding and CDBG.  You can see that those have slowly been trending down, while the solid yellow line, which represents  national CPI, which is the consumer price index, has steadily trended upward.  That being said, I do want to highlight that the city has seen an unprecedented infusion  of funding in the form of disaster tax credits and federal CDBG disaster recovery funding  over the past five years.  That's helped in funding the development of over 1,200 affordable housing units.  A breakdown of those units is included in attachment B of my staff report on page 191.  If anyone is interested, it's also posted on our website.  I won't go into the details of that at this point.  Even with those projects, the strain on the city's housing stock and infrastructure has  continued to grow.  The demand for affordable housing, public services, and neighborhood reinvestment far  exceeds the capacity of the city. funding alone. Before you in this slide is the proposed annual plan allocations for next fiscal year.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem resource allocations and expected outcomes. ! Based on the continued resolution passed by Congress and signed by  signed by the president last month the city is assuming continued flat funding  but then again we do not have our final allocation from hud at this time  so this is an estimated budget we do plan to return to council  in june and i hope at that point to have final allocations which  i'll be asking you to approve at that time  proposed cdbg activities for next fiscal year align with past funding priorities  these include housing programs and projects capital and public improvement projects  economic development code enforcement program administration and public services  as we've done in the past several years we've utilized the cdbg citizens advisory committee  to provide recommendations to council and this is  for the first time in a long time  for public service funding we  are allowed to expand up to 15%  of our cdbg allocation.  The citizens advisory committee  provided these recommendations  and they rated all of the  recommendations based on a  scoring matrix and the top six  applicants out of nine were  proposed to receive equal  funding.  Again, there is a contingency  plan proposed in my budget since  we don't know the final amount  but when I will come back at the  next public hearing you will have  the final numbers.  Right now you will see I estimated  50% of our cdbg and split that  six ways to come up with this  proposal for public services.  Our proposed home activities  include continuing home  activities with the housing  authority and service providers  through the tenant based rental  assistance program.  Homeowner development, the habitat  project that I talked about.  Staff is also proposing putting  money aside to assist with  rehabilitating existing housing  units at a turning point  commons complex that is owned by  chip and then administration  expenses.  As mentioned, staff and housing  tools undertook a significant  public outreach process to  encourage citizen participation  during the development of this  plan.  You will see here that we have  been working on this since last  fall.  We did hold two public workshops  in the fall and that feedback is  provided as part of an appendix  to the consolidated plan.  We also implemented an online  public survey which was the first  year doing that.  We did receive 450,000 dollars  in responses.  The responses to that survey are  also included in the consolidated  plan if you would like to read  through those.  We took all of that information  and put that into our plan as  well.  Okay, so next steps.  This is public hearing so we will  receive comment tonight.  Any comments received during the  next 30 days will be incorporated  into the consolidated plan.  I will be coming back to council I  council to see if we can receive  the HUD allocation in time and  then at that point I will be  coming back and asking you to  approve the plan and our annual  plan so we can submit that to HUD.  The public is welcome to email  public comments to the city  housing email or you can do this  online as well on our website.  The documents are posted there.  If they want a physical copy they  can call our office and request  that and we can have them pick  that up if they want to view it  in paper copy.  This concludes my report and  sherry and I are available if you  have any comments or questions.  Does anybody have a question for  mayor joe?  Yes, thank you madam mayor.  approve the funding recommendations  that come from the committee.  You will approve the final  recommendations.  Why isn' t the jesus center on  there?  jesus center did not apply for  funding this year.  good answer thank you.  I had one quick question.  The plan for the public service  is part of it.  Who sets those priorities and how  does the ranking happen and does  that get revisited every year the  one through six for assisting people?  Yes, so the priorities are established  in the consolidated planning process  because we were not completed with  this process of 25-29 we use the  priorities from the last five year  plan which are very similar to these  priorities.  So the committee takes those  priorities we have a scoring  rubric that' s based on what the  application is and we have a  committee that takes those and  scores the applications and then  the committee takes those and  scores the applications and then  public service the applicants come  and give a presentation to the  committee and then the committee  discusses those with staff and  comes up with their recommendations  that then come to you guys.  gotcha.  So if we wanted to see children  for instance higher on the list is  that something that we could make  a recommendation on?  Yes.  Okay thank you.  All right we will open the public  hearing and do we have speakers?  We do not.  All right I guess we will close  the public hearing.  I think we' re opening the public  hearing here tonight and we' re  still taking comments online.  All right now vice mayor.  I just have one question.  I have a quick question for you  mayor joe.  Do you feel the four people on  the selection committee do you  are you happy with those four  people and I didn' t say it let  me rephrase that.  Of course you' re happy with  them.  Do you feel that four is adequate  because it used to be I think  there was six or seven a couple  of years ago.  yes we have an administrative  policy procedure that we can have  we had this year.  And one of them was absent at one  of the meetings.  But all five review the applications  I like to have seven just in case  if somebody can' t make it for instance  to have a backup.  But the five worked out this year  very happy with how the committee  has been going and it' s a huge  task for them to take.  I mean they have a binder full of  applications they have to review  and then two meetings that they come  back and that' s a tough decision.  So hopefully it lightens your load  a little bit.  It does.  You' re doing an excellent job.  Thank you.  All right any other questions or  comments otherwise we' re all right.  Thank you Mary Jo.  4.2 residential readiness amendments  phase two code amendment 25-01.  Kelly Murphy senior planner welcome.  Good evening mayor vice mayor and members of the city council.  My name is Kelly Murphy and I' ll be presenting  this agenda item this evening.  Before you today is a series  of amendments to title 19  of the Chico municipal code.  Which are recommended to ensure  consistency with state housing law  implement pro housing policies  and address  excuse me  address actions from the 2022  housing element. The proposed amendments  also resolve minor inconsistencies  formalize interpretations by the  community development director  and clarify terms and definitions.  The amendments represent the  second phase of a planned  multi-phase code amendment program  referred to as the residential readiness  program. As the majority of amendments  are intended to streamline existing  permit processes reduce barriers for  residential development.  And facilitate housing production.  These amendments are also intended  to provide more flexibility in zoning  regulations particularly for key  commercial and mixed use areas.  The first phase of the residential  readiness program adopted by the  council in June of 2024 implemented  a total of 10  residential readiness  residential readiness policies.  Included in this phase of code  amendments is an additional housing  element action, action 812.  Amending the Chico municipal code  regarding low barrier navigation  centers as defined by assembly bill 101.  A little bit of the legislative  background here.  Low barrier navigation centers provide  action that will be allowed by  right in areas zoned for mixed  use and non-residential zones  permitting multi-family residential  uses.  Amendments to the land use tables  and chapters 1942, 1944 and 1946  are proposed to create a new  land use category for low barrier  navigation centers.  And the application procedures and  In addition several new laws  affecting accessory dwelling units  or ADUs took effect this last year  further reducing regulatory barriers  and encouraging small scale infill  housing including senate bill 1211  which increases the maximum number  of ADUs allowed on multi-family  properties from two up to eight  depending on the number of existing  primary units.  or a limited number of adu units.  Amendments to the city's adu ordinance  are necessary for consistency with  SB 1211.  AB 1033 allows cities to permit  adus to be sold separately from  the primary residents provided they  are a part of a community land  trust or similar affordable housing  model.  This expands a local jurisdiction's  authority but does not require changes to be made.  the city of chicago has  approved a new code amendment  AB 976 permanently eliminates  owner occupancy requirements for  adus removing a restriction that  previously limited rental  flexibility. Owner occupancy for  adus have been previously  eliminated citywide so no code  amendments are required or  proposed.  Finally AB 1332 requires local  jurisdictions to establish  preapproved adu programs. The  city of chicago launched its  adu program in 2020. These plans  are preapproved by the building  division streamlining the permit  process and reducing costs for  homeowners.  The city of chicago is actively  pursuing a pro housing  designation from the california  department of housing and  community development or cdc  to demonstrate its commitment to  removing barriers to housing  production and implementing policies  that promote affordability and  development efficiency. This  designation awarded to jurisdictions  that adopt pro housing policies  enhances the city's competitiveness  for state housing and infrastructure  funding. As part of this effort  proposed amendments to chapter  1962 density bonus law  are recommended  to  expand local incentives and  incentives for affordable housing  projects. These changes do align  with the government code ensuring  chicago maximizes density bonuses  concessions and parking reductions  for qualifying developments. By  streamlining affordability incentives  and reinforcing pro housing policies  these amendments support the city's  application and broader housing  production goals.  These amendments do not propose any  construction demolition or other  activity that has a potential to  negatively impact the environment and  The proposed amendments are exempt  from the california environmental  quality act pursuant to  CEQA section 15061 b3.  Any future development projects  would be reviewed on an individual  basis for compliance with CEQA.  At its meeting on march 20th the  planning commission voted  unanimously to forward a  recommendation of approval to the  city council on the proposed code  amendments. There were just two minor  revisions to the planning commission's  clarify that the reference to a  cmd in section 1928 stands for  chicago maintenance district.  This minor addition is supported by  staff.  The second revision requested by  the commission was to keep the  rooming and boarding houses land use  category and tables 42 and 46.  Staff maintains the recommendation  that this land use category  definition and corresponding  references should be deleted.  The rooming and boarding houses  land use category and definition  should be removed from the code  because it is outdated,  inconsistently applied and  unenforceable in practice. The  city has observed that many single  family residences function similarly  without obtaining a use permit  highlighting a disconnect between  the regulation and actual housing  patterns. Enforcing the permit  requirements selectively could raise  legal concerns including potential  first amendment issues,  term maintaining the category does  not serve the public interest as  it creates unnecessary regulatory  burdens without providing  meaningful oversight or benefits.  Removing it aligns with the city's  broader goals of streamlining  housing regulations, reducing  barriers to residential uses and  ensuring consistency with modern  housing needs.  Staff would concur with the  CalHDF's note on the legislative  reorganization of ADU statutes in the  government code and recommends that  references to the previous government  code sections be updated accordingly.  This is a clerical error that does  not significantly impact the  ordinance's legality or enforceability  but we would like to see it updated.  Additionally, where CalHDF references  square footage limits for attached  ADUs in the ordinance, staff recommends  that code sections be updated  Section 1976-130  C4A is amended to clarify the only  attached ADUs greater than 800  square feet are limited to 50% of the  size of the primary dwelling unit.  I think most importantly the city's  ordinance has been certified for  compliance with state law and will be  resubmitted after it is amended for  certification by HCD.  I would like to note that the  ordinance is not a recommendation  to the city council.  The community development director  recommends the council hold a public  hearing regarding the proposed amendments  and introduce an ordinance to amend  Title 19 by reading of its title only.  Again, you have two adopting ordinances.  Attachment A reflects the recommendations  of the planning commission.  Attachment B includes staff's  additional recommendations.  That concludes my presentation.  I can take any questions.  All right.  Thank you.  Madam Mayor, quick question for  senior planner murphy kelly.  Just this whole rooming and boarding  thing which is an antiquated term we  don't use that anymore.  Is that essentially someone running a  room to someone?  Would that be considered a rooming and  boarding?  Yes, the land use definition  defines it as three unrelated persons  living together in a home.  Again, an antiquated definition for  a land use that would be a  rooming and boarding.  We don't really see it being permitted.  All right.  Thank you.  Council member holly.  Thank you for the recognition,  Miss Mayor.  I'm really glad that you cleared up  that planning commission recommendation  especially.  I think we did get an email from that  planning commissioner saying it was a  mistake and so I think that the staff  recommendation is a no-brainer because  of her comment and your clarification of that.  had a parking square footage adjustment  for the general requirements of ADUs.  But I was also curious about the  cal ADF parking requirement  alterations that they suggested and  if that is also suggested by staff to  be adjusted in our code amendment.  So at this time we believe that  our ordinance is in compliance with  all the state housing laws as it  pertains to parking.  We are not proposing any additional  parking amendments as it relates to  ADUs at this time.  We will be continuing to update our  ordinance for consistency with state  law in the future.  Thank you, Miss Murphy.  Thank you.  All right.  Anybody else?  No?  All right.  We will.  Thank you, Miss Murphy.  We will open the public hearing.  How many speakers do we have?  We have two.  Okay.  First speaker is Ann Byker-Kaufman  followed by Jacqueline Chase.  Hi.  So I was the planning commissioner  who made the mistake.  So I had just thought that taking out  room for parking is a  mistake.  rooming and boarding houses would  make that illegal.  And it was a rookie mistake.  It was my first meeting as a planning  commission.  So I do urge you to go with the  staff recommendations and eliminate  all references to rooming and  boarding houses in Title 19.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jacqueline Chase.  Good evening, council, staff.  I'm Jacqueline Chase.  I participate with Smart Growth Advocates.  And in that capacity, I support equitable,  climate-friendly, and cost-effective  growth in Chico.  And I think that the residential  readiness plan as described encourages  the production of affordable housing  in Chico's urban core that is in line  with the city's general plan,  especially with its focus on infill  growth and on housing.  And I think that the city's  the city's housing is affordable  access and affordability.  There was just one thing I read which  wasn't discussed tonight is some  details about drive-through.  I think this is part of the bigger  Title 19 revisions.  And I would just say that I hope  in the future sometime the city  council just decides to not allow any  of these changes to be made.  a great way to sort of align and  make sense to bring up here when  we're talking about smart growth  principles.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That is it for speakers.  All right.  We will close the public hearing.  And any other comments from?  Okay.  We'll move on.  4.3, assembly bill 481, annual military.  We need a vote on that, mayor.  I' m sorry.  We' re still in public hearing.  Sorry.  Opposed?  Attachment B, the staff  recommendation be approved.  I' ll second that.  With the addition of the other  recommendations that are at your desk.  Yes.  Someone got to read it.  Okay.  And that would and that includes the  ordinance of the city council of the  city of Chico, proven code amendment  2501, amending title 19 of the Chico  municipal code to support residential  readiness city of Chico.  Council member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council member Holly.  Yes.  Council member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  s attachment B, staff  recommendation.  Now we'  ll go to assembly bill 481,  annual military equipment use report.  Chief billy aldrich.  thank you and good evening,  madam mayor, vice mayor, members of  council and to our community who are  here today.  I am pleased to present to you the  annual reporting requirements.  I do not have a powerpoint presentation  tonight.  You should have received my report with  your agenda packet.  As you are aware, I presented the  required information for future budget  requests related to assembly bill 41  during the regularly scheduled city  council meeting on March 18.  We also held the required community  engagement meeting on March 31.  We presented the annual report and  heard from our community members.  We had a very productive meeting where  we answered questions and addressed  concerns.  Tonight I will highlight the improvements  we have made to our annual reporting  and use of equipment to ensure we are  providing the greatest amount of  accuracy and transparency into our  program.  I will also provide our request for  additional equipment, the overall budget  impact, inspections with violations and  other costs, and finally our total cost  for the previous year.  As I begin with the information, please  feel free to stop me if you have any  questions or concerns that I can  address.  You probably noticed the annual report  format looked a little bit different  this year than it has in previous years.  That is because we have done a few  things.  Number one, we have gone to a calendar  year reporting instead of when this law  was passed.  We had to start reporting as of April  1st and then we went a year from that.  What we found is it was difficult to  capture all the data in one year without  sometimes either missing something or  double counting it.  We have now gone to a full calendar  year cycle.  This is the last report where we might  have some things that slipped through  the cracks where we double counted  certain things.  We are pretty hopeful we didn' t do  that and we will continue to do that  We did the best we could to not  double count those incidents.  You also notice the report itself is  very streamlined.  When I initially did the first one,  it was pretty detailed and busy.  I felt like as the initial report was  built it needed to provide complete  transparency and let you be educated on  everything we had internally and what  it looked like and what the  answer several questions that some  groups I met with in the community  wanted to see in it.  Now we have streamlined it a bit so  it' s not so onerous but still  provides the required information by  law.  We have changed the reporting email  for complaints to one email.  We were having it go to two emails  before that.  We now have one location for  complaints to be received from the  We have a revisions in the  inspection reporting process.  What that means is that we have  found different ways to do  inspections to ensure we have  accuracy of reporting and use.  New items that we would like to  look at acquiring in the next  fiscal year, I presented those at  our meeting on the 18th.  I will run through those for you  fairly quickly. !  We would like to add to the  inventory one 40 millimeter  multi-shot launcher.  Currently swat has one of these.  We need two of those on hand to  provide proper coverage at those  critical incidents.  Drones we are still trying to  replace some drones and add to  that fleet so we requested one small  providing us with the ability to  get cameras and audio equipment  into tight spots where drones  can'  t provide that coverage.  That is one that we had some  people in the community that  wanted to donate to that program.  They identified this is a  technology that is out there and  we want you to go buy it.  Unfortunately we had to tell them  we can'  to you through that donation  account.  It still requires your approval.  Command and UAS vehicles are a  must.  What we initially requested in  our budget that you probably saw  was the command vehicle which was  one of those large diesel pusher  kind of vehicles.  community as we have grown as a  community our critical incidents  have grown right alongside of it.  We are finding ourselves in those  situations where we need to have  a mobile command vehicle in the  field just like you see in other  cities.  What we found here as we have  done some more work is it is  actually better for us to reduce  the size of a command vehicle  instead of having one of those  larger ones.  As you know our streets are pretty  small and a lot of our incidents  happen to occur on those small  surface streets.  What we have looked at is kind of  separating out those three units  to smaller sprinter vans.  Each would have its own mobile  command center in it.  One for the drone team and one  for our hostage negotiators and  one for our swat team or the  tactical commander who runs that  team.  It also allows us to only have to  We have a lot of vehicles that  we can use to do that unit is  needed in the field instead of a  large vehicle.  I know the director of public  works would appreciate having  smaller vehicles to work on than  one giant diesel pusher.  I think the ability to work on  that is a lot easier also.  the cost we are seeing on  that the $515,000 is for each one  As you recall I told you we made  a change after the budget was  submitted and to respect barbara  and her staff'  s request of not making any  changes after submitted we didn'  t go in and change the price but  we still believe that number  actually probably a little less  is what we would spend on those  we will be using those three  smaller sprinter vans to create  that.  We will continue to add to our  patrol rifle fleet and the idea  behind that like I explained  before was we'  re really focusing on  getting assigned weapons to each  officer and so over time we have  been slowly adding those rifles  so it wasn'  t a little bit !  So we had a little bit more !  So we had a little bit more  of a  a  a  a  a !  I think I  yeah so that was one of the and  I will get to it back here but  during our inspection we actually  found that we miscounted somehow  the rifles so we reported that we  had more but we actually had less.  Got it!  So if you look in that report  maybe that'  s where you saw it in the  inspection process we found that we  had 71 rifles.  I take that back 71 rifles is what we had.  s what was reported we actually had 72.  Okay I understand so I did see the  expense in 2024 was  $83,373  and  it was reported as being used once in  2024 but sometimes those numbers don'  t tell the full picture so I'  m curious if that was an expense  from late into that reporting year  and there really wasn'  t a lot to report as far as use  goes or if that was an expense  So what is the expense or are those  really just not used that frequently?  Great question.  We don'  t report a use if it'  s simply deployed in the field.  What is reported as a use is if it'  s fired and we had one incident last  year where an officer fired a rifle  so that'  s where you get the one use out of it.  The expense was as you recall we  actually you weren'  rifles to get to the number we needed  which is a build out of roughly 120  rifles but the plan was to slowly build  that out to defray the cost out quite a  bit.  Does that answer your question?  It does thank you chief.  Also within those rifles we have  to replace our two sniper rifles on  the swat team they'  ve timed out.  The one that'  interesting I want to explain it a  little bit it'  s called the spot robot it'  s the robot dog.  And we'  re not asking for the city to fund  that we just need your authority to  see grant funding on that.  There'  s plenty of grants out there for  this kind of stuff.  And this thing is pretty amazing  with the sensor technology and things  like that on it places you can put  it where you can'  t put a human.  But one of the big things that I thought about was the community engagement piece with this thing for STEM students.  They'  re using a robot.  around the nation for those community engagement events for those students in schools for stem  technology you know so i know we have a big stem program here in town and i'd love to be able to  have something like that but again that's only if we can get the grant funding to get it i would  never ask the city for that because those are roughly seven hundred thousand dollars  moving on the budget impacts most of these items are coming out of our general fund  like i said there's donations for those rc cars others are already budgeted in our overall  operations budget such as those launchers and drones some have been requested in the current  budgeting process which has been presented on march 18th where i requested your approval for  me to move forward with the city manager as we move on to inspections and violations violations  discovered were procedural meaning that some of the staff didn't realize  that they were going to be able to do that so we're going to have to move forward with  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively purchased small drones they were  effectively  effectively  effectively [inaudible] [inaudible]  implement that within policy  for the use and deployment of  all equipment. What we'  ve had to do  with that is figure out how do  we catch these things during  before the inspection process  and what we'  ve done is change  the way any kind of request for  purchasing of that equipment  comes forward there'  s a different  process for any kind of  procedure or  training that'  s going to be  ongoing and we'  ve already completed  some of that in house one of the  big changes was captain  pina who'  s actually in the  room watching me did this report  right now created a really nice  and detailed process for deploying  this equipment so any time an  officer deploys it there'  s a qr code they  just scan they go in and do a  quick form it auto populates into  the system so we actually  use to accurately capture all of  the deployments in the field.  And then during this timeframe  there was no complaints about  the deployment of any of this  equipment.  And then lastly total costs  acquisition maintenance and  training of the equipment and  the munitions totaled $131,126  all of that was out of a total  budget of over $39 million for  the police department or roughly  three-tenths of one percent of our budget.  So as I close you can see we'  re very transparent and  judicious in our use of all  equipment council has previously  approved and are being good stewards  of our community members tax dollars.  My recommendation to council tonight  is for the approval of my request  to continue with our assembly bill  481 program our policy and the  city'  s ordinance on the use of it.  Your continued approval will ensure  that the community'  s police department  stands ready to protect them and  the community while also keeping  your police officers safe.  This concludes my report and I'  m happy to answer any questions  or address any concerns you may have.  All right any questions from  council?  Council member van overbeck.  Chief I had a question about  the 40 millimeter and 37  millimeter projectile launchers is  that like a recoilless rifle is  that how that works?  Say that one more time.  Is it like a recoilless rifle?  It looks like a short  barrel shotgun with a giant barrel.  Okay.  Yeah so it'  What'  s the propellant though?  So you can use there'  s gas grenades that you can put into  it there'  s smoke grenades you can put into  it I don'  t want to get too detailed but  basically it'  s just large canister items that  you can accurately place into  locations from a distance.  And the foam whatever those foam projectiles will that knock somebody down?  I don'  t think I'  ve seen one knock anyone down but it  definitely grabs your attention when it hits you.  It'  s meant to distract you right?  It'  s not meant to knock you down or hurt you it'  s a distractionary device.  Okay interesting device.  Council member goldstein.  You were mentioning the robot  dog technology were you saying that  we'  re proposing to acquire that do we have any already?  Yes we'  re proposing to acquire that through grant funding and no we don'  t have that at all.  And what'  s the purpose of those?  So the purpose of those is they have multiple options for sensors on those  bomb detection, chemical detection,  camera systems, audio systems that you can put them into places where you wouldn'  t necessarily want to put a human and it'  s a robot so no danger to a human in what they'  re doing and then like I said I'  d love to be able to use it for a community engagement with  people.  And we are working on that with the  STEM programs in town.  Okay and is that different than this transcend robotics vantage with hot gas delivery system that'  s also I think being proposed?  Yeah that'  s something we purchased during the last cycle.  That'  s a it looks like a little tracked vehicle that'  s on the ground.  This actually if you'  ve never seen it'  s a dog looking thing that walks it'  s a way different system way different.  And that'  s the one that we'  ve already acquired?  The robot that'  s like a little RC car on the ground pretty much just a larger version of an RC car.  Okay thanks.  All right thank you.  I think that'  s it for right now.  All right thank you.  All right so we will open the public hearing.  How many speakers do we have?  We have five.  All right.  Okay.  And I'  ll call the first two speakers and if you can line up in the middle aisle.  Margaret swick followed by Diane Suzuki.  Good evening council and good evening chief.  The goal of AB 481 is for elected officials to curb and regulate the militarizing of our police.  It is not to celebrate the growth of a military style arsenal.  I have two points I would like to make tonight.  The first one is our continued investment in military equipment is wrong.  The second one is our continued investment in military equipment is wrong.  Chico has plenty of issues we could solve by redirecting money to perhaps painting and improving crosswalks so that children, bicyclists and pedestrians are safe.  Have you seen the lack of clearly marked crosswalks around Chico?  It'  s dangerous.  And how about eliminating the urban blight at second and main?  I do want my members to understand that the state of the state is not the state of the state.  I do not need to effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  a symbiotic relationship between the Chico Police Department and Downrange Indoor Training Center?  Are any of our military equipment dollars being spent at that business? For instance, to train,  to purchase or sell weapons, for gear or for uniforms? I asked because a friend shared a photo  of a large outdoor banner at Downrange that is deeply disturbing. It shows a picture of  California Governor Newsom, a silly picture of him, with a huge letter F, and you know what that  means. It's a threatening banner and a menacing banner with a target on it, of course.  So, does the city of Chico really do business?  With a company that threatens the governor of California with violence?  I ask that you clarify this situation publicly for all of us. Thank you.  Thank you. Diane Suzuki, followed by Ann Polivka.  Good evening. I want to begin by saying I appreciate the new system that Captain  Pena created, which assists officers in the mandatory reporting of the use of the department's  military equipment, according to AB 481. One of my biggest hopes is to see our society have a lower  rate of gun ownership in our communities, similar to other countries such as the UK, Taiwan,  and Japan. The U.S. has the highest in the world. I don't understand why there even exists assault  weapons and high-capacity magazines and all those other ones. I don't understand why there even exists  those. You know, those are the ones I can't even pronounce. So, to me, the root of our  country's real problematic—this is the root of our country's real problematic safety issue.  Even though California has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, it's still  such a huge problem. The majority of the military equipment used last year was during the incident  on August 9th, in response to a woman who was firing a firearm. I'm happy to hear that the woman  who was having a mental health episode—a Army  Army  safely gave herself up.  I'm also curious about the details of the latest killing of Michael Oxley,  which we'll hear later, I guess.  I'd like to reiterate what I commented on at the community engagement meeting,  that beanbags, which are considered less lethal,  are actually filled with lead pellets and shot from a 12-gauge shotgun.  There have been deaths and serious injuries associated with the beanbag rounds,  but fortunately not in our area, and I hope they never will be.  For many in the community, a major issue with the Chico Police Department,  including more military-grade equipment, is the question,  would these be used on peaceful protesters?  They have been used during Black Lives Matter protests and Standing Rock.  I request that Chief Aldrich make a public statement  reassuring us that Chico PD will follow the law,  according to AB 48,  which restricts law enforcement's use of less lethal munitions to disperse protests  and also increases frequency of mandatory use of force reporting  and keep our public safe.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let me just get back to that.  Ann Palifka, followed by George Gold.  Good evening, Council Members, Chief Aldrich, everybody present.  I'm a member of Concerned Community for Justice, C.C. for J.  We really appreciate the fact that...  Can you use the microphone?  Oh, sorry.  There you go.  I'm a member of Concerned Community for Justice, also acronym C.C. for J.  We appreciate law enforcement's low profile at the hands-off protest rally in March, April 5th.  It just happened 10 days ago, and it was a very peaceful rally, peaceful march,  and law enforcement was part of keeping a low profile, and that was wonderful.  Due to the nature of these times,  we request that Chico Police Department make a public statement,  like Diane was saying, in the local newspaper, Facebook, social media,  providing assurances that the department intends going forwards  to keep our community safe as we exercise our First Amendment assembly rights.  Hopefully, all Council Members also...  We're aware, under California law, kinetic energy projectiles and chemical agents,  so that would be rubber bullets and other kinds of projectiles,  and tear gas and other kinds of chemicals, are actually military equipment.  They're classified that way.  We request that before Council approves the Police Department's Military Equipment Use Report,  that the Police Department actually describe specifically what uses of the kinetic energy projectiles  and the chemical...  and the chemical agents will be authorized during First Amendment assemblies,  because there will be many more First Amendment assemblies, I suspect, over the next few years.  That would be under CPD Policy 466.  So, will rubber bullets and other kinetic energy projectiles and tear gas or other chemical agents  only be used by officers who, number one, have received crowd control training by post?  That's the Peace Officer's standard in training.  As the law requires.  And number two, also as the law requires,  have determined that using these weapons is objectively reasonable  to defend against a threat to life or serious bodily injury to an individual  or to bring a dangerous and unlawful situation safely and effectively under control.  Use of these projectiles, like rubber bullets and tear gas for crowd control,  is prohibited unless all the requirements of CPD Policy 466,  13, which is based on the penal code,  California penal code,  are complied with before use.  We request that Chico PD develop a use policy for each item of military equipment it possesses.  That means giving a lot of specifics, much more detail than has been provided so far for use.  And it would include how the equipment will be used and also under what circumstances  uses are unauthorized or prohibited.  Concerned community for justice also...  That's time. Thank you, Ann.  Okay. Thank you.  Thank you.  George Gold, followed by Chris Nelson.  Good evening.  The other day, Chief, you gave a detailed and comprehensive review  of all of the new weapons the police department is going to buy this year.  When can we expect a complete and comprehensive review  of the department's de-escalation process and procedure?  Ann.  Vanilla chai latte.  In checking the police department's website, there's no contact us link.  There's no email address for the chief of police.  I have a habit of inviting friends to my morning sojourns for a latte among several lovely  coffee houses here in Chico.  If I don't have your email address, Chief, how can I invite you for tea or a latte so  I can share my wisdom and perspective with you?  Ann.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And our last speaker is Chris Nelson.  I never do.  You don't start until you start talking.  Absolutely.  You've got to take your time.  Don't start talking yet.  Still not ready.  Okay.  Okay.  Hello.  Um.  We're going to start talking.  We're in the midst of a constitutional crisis.  Our founders rebelled against a king and set up a government based on checks and balances.  But the congressional majority has capitulated to the executive and the executive is flaunting  the highest court in the land.  What that has to do with Chico is this.  In cases like the Warren decision, many of you said terrible things about the humanity  of—and rights of unhoused people.  And you used city dollars to fight the decision.  But you respected the court.  The police followed the court's decision and we had structure and purpose.  It's no perfect outcome for anyone.  Now we are looking at a budget for military-style surveillance and aggressive offensive and  defensive capacities for a police department that has always been able to convince city  council of their needs.  My concern.  Under democratic and revolutionary law, we are not going to be able to do that.  We need to effectively effectively !  podem  podem  podem !  podem  podem  podem !  podem  podem !  podem !  as if it's something fun and good and, you know, to be, I don't know, it's terrible.  But in the constitutional crisis of the rise of a dictatorship  and loyalty to a sovereign being pressed on firms and institutions,  I hope you can remember the Constitution, the First Amendment rights of free speech,  and the Fourth Amendment right of protection against unreasonable search and seizure.  This has everything to do with the weapons that you own, the weapons that you allow,  and the people that you hire, like the ones who go to the down low and shoot at the governor's face  or say terrible things about Representative Schiff, which I saw on the news today.  So anyway, we have to work together. We have to maintain our democracy.  We have to stand strong against for the Constitution.  And I have one more thing.  One more thing is that today was Tax Day, and for context,  I'm going to leave you each where your income tax money really goes  so you can see the cuts in social spending and the increase in militarism,  of which you are a part when you have these military weapons that you own.  Here you go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  She's our last speaker.  All right.  We will close the public hearing.  Any further questions or comment from counsel?  And consider a motion.  Council Member Hawley.  Yeah, one speaker brought up hoping that there would be more publicity  about the use of kinetic energy projectiles and chemical agents for crowd control.  There is a section on that attached for military equipment use on this item,  and there are A through K requirements for those uses.  And I think it's a good idea to do that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Council Member O'Brien.  I just want to say these conversations are healthy.  We need to have these conversations.  I think chief Aldridge is very clear that he wants to have those conversations with  the community to hear all sides of this.  And I think we have heard that.  And that is one benefit of this particular law is that we do hear about these concerns  and these issues.  I think that's healthy.  should be healthy that'  s how we should  police. I think we also need to  be clear that this equipment  mostly is defensive in nature  and designed to save lives. I  think it'  s hyperbole to  classify it just as military  equipment because a number of  different uses of this  equipment occurs in society. The  bottom line for me is that this  equipment will keep our community  and officers safer.  council member  wenzel.  thank you mayor. I'  ve been through a few of  these. I talked to chief aldridge  before he was chief and before I  was on city council on one of  these. My concerns remain the  same. There'  s a balance you strike in all  of this. It'  s a tremendous amount of  responsibility to be holding this  arsenal of weaponry and means of  violence. I think we need to  do and what we do not do. I  want to say that I think that  ab 481 is great because we have  these conversations and we have  this reading on how we'  re using  this weaponry and all of this is  good details to have but also  this measure of the culture of  militarism we have because we  need to moderate that over time.  Hearing these things about people  shooting at a sign of our governor  is horrendous. It should not be  tolerated in any connection with  the military. We need to  be more aware of where we might  be acting in excess. I think where  I come down on the balance of  these things is different. We  look at things like how many  officers need to have rifles and  crowd control weaponry. What  kind of things should we have on  hand? I appreciate the effort the  department has gone into this. One  thing I will say as far as  glorifying violence and  militarism I think there'  s a slippery slope. People are  attracted to the profession who like to do that. There'  s a  lot of people who like to do that.  I think we should be  celebrating this. I think this is  a success. It'  s worth  sharing.  thank you.  council member van  overhek.  thank you madam  mayor. No one suggested there  were chico police officers shooting  at a poster of the governor. I  think this is a  great point. I would suggest  that the political idiocy is  equally distributed in our society  on the fringes. I go to downrange  quite a bit and I'  ve never seen anything like  that. My take on this chief is  that almost every one of those  items it protects your guys,  protects the police officers and  it protects the citizens because  it gives you more nonlethal  protection. I think that  there'  options when you'  re dealing with a  difficult situation. That'  s point number one. Point number  two is I think you'  ve demonstrated  through your service that you'  re an excellent judge of the  tools you need to do your job.  I'  m fully supportive of it.  council member  guelton.  thank you mayor. I want to note  that I'  m not sure yet but many things  we can get from grant funds or  perhaps the military surplus can  have ongoing costs too. I should  have asked earlier if those costs  are reflected in the projected  costs for this. I'  m always a proponent of public  safety and want to make sure  we'  re investing our taxpayer dollars  into proactive public safety  measures. I'  m sure we'  re working with the  legislature to make sure we  have a great report here. I'  m grateful for this assembly bill  making it so we can have this  conversation. I want to bring up  that we need to be fiscally  responsible here. I also want to  reiterate what some of our  concerned community members for  justice brought up. I'  m also concerned in our  current political climate about  the potential for military  equipment being used against  people exercising their first  amendment rights. Thankfully that  That'  s all I have to say. Thank you.  vice mayor bennett.  I'  ve won two elections and one  of the main reasons I think I  won is how often and when I  visited with people how often  people would say do you support  the chico police department. I  said absolutely. For the most  part those people said then I  will vote for you. I was  surprised at how many times I  police department. I'  m a strong advocate for the  safety of the community and I  think you'  re doing a wonderful job.  You need these pieces of  equipment and tools to be able  to do your job. I thank you  very much for your service and  I strongly support you and all  of your efforts by all of the  officers. I see lieutenant  pina back there. How you doing?  captain.  are doing well. Anyhow that'  s all I have to say.  if there'  s no further comments  I'  m going to make a motion.  I'  ve got nothing. You  covered it all.  I will make a motion that we  receive, council receive the  annual military equipment use  report, review the ordinance to  adopt the military equipment use  policy, approve the military  approve the proposed acquisitions  for 2025.  second.  we have a motion and two  seconds.  I'  d like to make a  subsequent motion with the  recognition of mayor reynolds.  substitute?  yes.

Before we go to a strategic planning update, we're going to take a quick  break and we'll be right back.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Welcome back.  Sorry for the brief delay.  Strategic planning update.  Ms. Deborah Preston.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  As you will recall, you dedicated a large chunk of time on March 19th for a special meeting to go through a strategic planning process that was brought to you by Jeff Bowen of Morrison & Company.  And the council spent a lot of time with a focus on quality of civic life for all Chico's citizens.  And I thought that since we had received the report, the promised summary from Jeff, that it might be nice for him to come up and talk to the council and see what next steps you would like to see happen.  So, Jeff.  All right.  Jeff, come on up.  Thank you.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmembers.  Great to see you all again.  Sorry, I was joking.  I put a collar on for you.  And I know that I don't have a clock, but I'm going to keep it to three minutes.  So, you should have in front of you probably three pages, four pages, given as Exhibit A, which is just a really brief summary of the work that you all did on March 19th, as Debbie mentioned.  You'll see that I basically tried to have it be kind of a cascading waterfall effect based on the discussion that went from what's the city council's why, what's our winning aspiration,  what are the priorities?  What are the priorities for this upcoming fiscal year?  And then, where do we talk about what a successful future looks like?  So, we talked, if you remember, four-year, which is long-term, two-year, mid-term, zero to one-year, short-term.  On the third page, you'll see that we start with the three main goals, which, as we already discussed, safe community, number two, long-term viability, and number three, protect and enhance primary community assets, which were defined on the other document as being a priority.  And then, we talked about how effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively ! !  effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  those four four hours on march 19th so um that's really all i have to say you've seen this it's  pretty brief um any questions or comments and i know that there's some discussion as far as next  steps that will take place uh jeff i've sat through i don't know a lot of these in my career  and you did a really good job thank you um and i think also you did a good job in capturing what  we talked about i think at this point we're in the starting the whole budget process is you know  how do we translate these priorities into uh actionable things for the city to do yeah so  we now we have to do our homework yeah that's right now the hard work begins  and then comes yeah just i echo that as well tom and jeff you did a great job um walking  um  some people  with uh independent minds through a process which is never easy so i appreciate your skilled  ability to do that but like you said tom really the next step is the coming budget cycle  and that will go a long way in achieving what we have identified as a primary objective for  our city a high quality civic life for all our community that's where push comes to shove that's  right budget time  nobody  you ! . .  . .  . . . . .    . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . .  our  our  our  our  our  our ! [inaudible]  budget season probably because we'  re going to start those  presentations here in a couple  of weeks but I think under the  objectives where we have the  vision zero infrastructure  staffing I think for us to take  the time to talk about those  objectives and how they would  play out for the next two years  and then we can review again in  January and see where we'  re at and how we'  re doing on it I think  that'  s an exercise that might be  worth us considering to do.  That'  s just my opinion.  I agree.  I'  m looking at our agenda  forecast and we'  re talking  about the 20th is when our  budget hearing is so if we were  to develop some of these  thoughts in this presentation  more to inform that we probably  should do it the next meeting.  I'  m open to that.  Can we take action on this on  there if we decide that we do  want to do an additional two  hours on that?  Yes because it'  s part of the  discussion.  If you want to bring it back at  the next meeting we can do that.  Bring it back to have an  actual work study at the next  meeting or set the appointment  at the next meeting?  I believe whatever you want to  call it.  If it'  s a work session just on the  strategic plan or it'  s a regular item, it'  s the first item or you want  to I'  m not sure about availability on  a Tuesday night at 4 I mean  were you thinking earlier?  I think it would be easiest  since we'  re all coming here already.  Is there something else that day  to just do it before?  We'  ve been having our  ad hoc meetings.  We might have one on DVD.  Oh.  And in addition I think you have  class.  No?  It works for me.  Okay.  Or any Tuesday at 4 o'clock would  work for me.  We can make it work.  You can make it.  We can do ad hoc maybe a little  bit earlier because I think you  guys are wrapping up.  Can everybody check their  schedules?  I normally would not do that  but can we talk about doing let'  s see.  So if we and we need to get  closed session and there'  s some  time to do that.  I think we would need to be  here at 3 at least.  I'  m sorry Madam Mayor what  day are you talking about?  At our next city council  meeting and maybe we move  closed session to the end of the  meeting.  So are we just going to meet  for an hour?  Is this what this is designed  to do?  I'  m thinking an hour and a  half maybe.  I don'  t think it'  s going to take that long.  I think 90 minutes would be  great.  I'  ll meet at 3.  We'  ll go to closed if we can  after that.  And then go to closed and  if we have to.  And then roll right into the  regular.  Okay.  Do you need a motion or  anything on that?  Just clarifying questions.  So is the intent to go over  these goals and objectives that  we created and tie them more  specifically into the budget or  what'  s kind of the  To talk about tie them to the  budget and to tie them and to  help hold ourselves accountable  to the budget.  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively ! . . . . .  I have a meeting that goes to  3 that day but it'  s in sacramento.  that'  s not going to work.  we will not set a date and time  right now.  We will e-mail out some dates  and times and get some approvals  because miss preston has your  availability so we will send  some out to council and see when  we can get that done.  we will send that out tomorrow  and we will get to working on  it.  thank you.  we will get to working on it.  you are clear generally what  we are talking about which is not  super clear but if you were  authorized to assign homework for  this what would you say?  great question.  I would say look through the goals  and objectives and I would start  to prioritize the objectives as  far as your perspective where they  should be.  we know the goals are there.  they could be 1, 2, 3 or 2, 3, 1.  we will figure those goals out as  far as priorities should be placed.  that will expedite the conversation  when we do get together to talk  through what that looks like and  where we should be putting  prioritized effort.  thank you so much for coming  and thank you for the process.  it was very enjoyable actually.  I think some people were not  necessarily looking forward to it  and it was better than expected.  5.2.  2525 sanitary sewer master  replacement plan.  Mr. Ottomani.  yes and senior civil engineer  David keen will be giving the  presentation.  welcome, dave.  good evening council.  vice mayor bennett and mayor  reynolds.  good evening council.  my name is david keen with public  works engineering department and  tonight I will be presenting the  sanitary sewer master plan update.  so the sanitary sewer is our  collection system.  it's about 280 miles of collection  system that collects sewage from  the city and sends it to the  wastewater treatment plant.  tonight we will discuss the  purpose of the plan, go over the  background, analysis, and  outreach and collaboration that  was completed as well as the next  steps.  so the purpose of the plan is  threefold.  first thing we do is update the  sewer model.  we have an existing model so we  go ahead and update that.  we use the updated model to  identify existing and build out  condition deficiencies.  build out conditions being  aligned with the general plan,  the 2030 general plan.  from there we have the  deficiencies.  we are able to create a capital  improvement plan.  so the previous sanitary sewer  master plan was completed in 2013  by corollo engineers.  the chico 2030 general plan gives  us an action item to update and  maintain our sanitary sewer master  plan as well as the system model.  therefore in 2022 the city  retained corollo engineers.  tim loper is here in the audience  with us and he was one of the  leads on the project and also  presented the 2013 plan here at  this council in 2013.  so thank you for helping us with  that.  thank you.  we will now go to the  the analysis performed consisted  of a flow monitoring program  which led to sewer model updates  and then that led to wastewater  flow projections which i will get  into what those are a little bit  later.  lastly the major outcome of the  updated plan is an updated  capital improvement program.  so the first part of completing  a sanitary sewer master plan is  to have a flow monitoring  program.  this is where staff hired a  contractor to go out into the  system and physically install  gauges or meters into the system  in strategic locations to  understand where the wastewater  is coming and what time of day  for different events that  happen.  we installed the meters during  the winter so we captured both  a dry time and a rainy time.  also a time when chico state was  in and out of session because  enrollment does affect the flow  in the system.  and the reason for installing  the gauges in the winter is due  to a thing called inflow and  infiltration.  so in sewer collection systems  the flows can triple in the winter  due to water coming into the  systems from cracks, private  laterals, clean outs that are  left open, cracks and manholes in  a variety of ways.  this is pretty typical three is  actually not a bad number a  multiplier for the city so we're  in line with industry standards  for there but it is something  that we want to capture as those  higher flow rates or how pipes  are sized.  so on the top is a flow diagram  of the sewer model update.  we have the existing model  we did the flow monitoring we  calibrated for dry weather and  wet weather.  we're able to understand with  our model what flow is coming  from what type of zoning so for  commercial or residential or  specific types of use we're able  to understand what type of flow  is generated from those areas.  once we have a calibrated model  we can then use it for build out  conditions.  so for parcels that are  undeveloped but we know the  zoning we can assign them a land  use category and base the flow  that's coming off of that off of  those wastewater flow  projections.  so this is an important outcome  of the flow model.  pattern of the plan.  these numbers here you can see  they range from 200 gallons per  acre per day all the way up to  5800 gallons per acre per day  and that's per acre so that's  split spatially using the sewer  model.  and the punch line the capital  improvement plan that comes out  of this roughly 100 million  dollars over the planning horizon  this is split between existing  users and future users and  that's because existing users  will get a benefit when a new  pipe is installed in front of  their property.  if that wasn't the case then  they would be included in the  sewer main replacement plan  so either way the existing users  will eventually need to replace  their pipelines or the pipelines  serving that property and the  future users cost those will be  paid by development through  development impact fees.  the map on the bottom the  highlighted lines are the new  lines that will be needed to  serve build out conditions per  the chico general plan.  outreach and collaboration we of  course made the plan available  online.  we did a media release which  was picked up by a couple local  news agencies and we also  completed the sequa mandatory 30  day public review.  you can see in the paper there.  for meetings with the  stakeholders we conducted a  technical workshop in person  with local developers and  engineers this was held here at  city hall which provided a good  opportunity for those engaged  stakeholders to understand how  the plan was developed and how  it will impact them while  developing properties throughout  town.  and then for the public we  conducted a virtual meeting in  the evening and that was a bit  broader general audience but  still designed to inform the  public.  so what are the next steps?  we are going to be looking at  the project and the project  development plan and we will  incorporate the identified  projects into a nexus study and  the city sewer rate planning  process as I talked about the  nexus study will be for the  development impact fees.  city sewer rate will be for the  existing users.  and then how do we know which  projects are first?  we do what is called a flow  trigger analysis so these  projects are designed for build  out conditions but what projects  are coming first depends on how  much flow is coming in the  pipeline also we work with our  community development department  to understand the status of  different developments  throughout town so that we can  we'  re able to prioritize  projects.  and that concludes my  presentation I'  m happy to answer any  questions.  any questions from  council member van overbeck?  Mr. King great presentation  thank you for being so succinct  what is the max capacity of the  system in terms of flow and how  close are we now?  the system the collection  system has capacity constraints  at different locations within  the system so the major capacity  constraint would be a  system that is not only for  but also for the wastewater  treatment plant which I believe  is rated up to 27 million  gallons a day so we have plenty  of capacity with regards to the  treatment plant and different  lines have different capacity  issues so one of the outcomes of  this project is that we only  have one existing deficiency  today and that'  s a great thing  for our system so there is one  small section that we could work  on today with our sewer rate  money that we could use the rest  is all going to be paid for by  future development.  so what'  s a high flow rate  day now?  I mean 10  10 million gallons a day  25 million gallons a day.  in our capacity is 27?  yes and that'  s called peak wet  weather flow.  I was just going to confirm  that that'  s peak wet  weather flow our typical dry  weather flows  five or six million gallons a  day.  so inflow and infiltration is a  major concern and for all  wastewater collection systems  because that'  s how you size  the pipelines so typical flows  are on the order of five to  eight million gallons a day  that'  s our summer average daily  flow when we have a big long  rain event and we have a  lot of rain and multiple days  of rain the groundwater table  rises that'  s when we see those  high flows.  right so what happens if that  number that 27 million gallons  a day number is exceeded what  breaks?  the treatment plant has  contingency plans they have  ponds where they can store extra  water and keep in mind that that  water that'  s coming in it has to meet  regulatory requirements for  water quality but if it'  s mostly  groundwater coming in and it'  s mostly stormwater it'  s fairly clean coming in it'  s not the high density high  strength of the water that'  s coming in in the summer so as  long as they'  re able to meet those  water quality requirements then  that'  s part of the plan.  thank you.  any other council member  questions or comments?  vice mayor bennett.  i was amazed at the map you  have which in orange was  residences and commercial  attached to the sanitary sewer  system and i was amazed at how  many areas were white and  clean.  effectively effectively  effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively !  effectively  effectively  effectively  on his side of? No.  Okay.  Final comments? No.  Entertainer motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Okay.  That would be  Council Member Goldstein. Aye.  Council Member Hawley. Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Good report. Thank you. Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck. Yes.  Council Member Winslow. Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett. Yes.  Mayor Reynolds. Aye.  Carrie 7-0. And if I could just  interject real quickly, Jeff texted  me back and indicated that May 6th  at 3 o'clock would work  for that special session.  Does he have a jet?  Actually, I think  on a different day.  Okay. Perfect. So we are on.  Everybody put on your calendars and  then I will have. And then we will send a reminder.  We will send a reminder on the  city email in  calendar.  5-6, 3 p.m.  Okay.  Council Member  Hawley's request. Code enforcement  penalties. Council Member  Hawley, you' re up.  Sorry I' m putting that on my calendar.  Okay. It' s in.  .  .  All right. This agenda item is in the  I think the first item request comes from a  previous conversation about a month ago when we were talking  about how we can  I believe how Council Member Bennett  described it.  Encourage downtown property owners to make use of their  buildings.  This is just one specific idea is potentially changing code  enforcement penalties. I did have a discussion with Mr.  Vig about this and we went over that increasing those penalty rates would likely not have an effect just due to them being limited by state ordinance and as well as even property owners who have been neglecting their properties for years and years and years. This is a tool that has been used and followed up on.  By code enforcement.  And our code enforcement staff  reflected the same opinion.  But I do think it should at least be  considered and entertained by  Council if this is something we want to  look at again.  I did attach it for your convenience.  And the  2024-2025  master fee schedule  is $0 for under 11 days  for  the  And then  11-20 is  $100.  21-30 is  $200.  31-40 days that goes up to $400.  And over 40 days is I believe an additional $100 on top of that.  That is  $100 per day.  Per day.  So we will  try to  make it  flexible.  So I think  we will  try to  make it  more flexible.  So we will  try to  make it  more  flexible.  I think we  have to open it up again.  Was it about the  dcba kick starting initiatives?  No.  This was about the penalties  that  the frequent  violator  penalty.  And can I just get a quick run down of what that looks like?  I mean somebody who has  been  cited for an issue within the last 12 months and now they'  re repeating it.  But is that different than  okay so that'  s if there'  s a new issue  instead of the ongoing issue continuing to rack up fines.  Is that?  Well as I described if we had a property that had a particular issue they were cited.  They cleaned it up and then a few months later we'  re right back where we were.  That would be a frequent that would fit the definition of a  frequent violator.  Okay great.  Thanks I just wanted to clarify that.  Yeah and I have the nuisance code in front of me and section 1.14.230 goes over penalties.  And I should have clarified this earlier but each penalty does already have an exception that frequent  violators may be fined $100 during that initial 0 to 11 day period that other violators would only be fined.  a  little  bit  But I  You know those  have  no  fee  associated  and  for  all  of  those  10  day  increments  frequent  violators  do  get  an  additional  hundred  dollars  on  top  of  what  one  first  time  non  frequent  violators  get  So  the  question  is  do  we  think  that'  adequate?  So  when  you started  the  conversation  just  to  remind  myself  before  we !  Mr. Vig and code  enforcement said they didn'  think adjusting or doing  anything with these fees would  essentially do anything was that  what you got out of the  conversation?  correct and I would say after  we talked through it. I  definitely agree I think there  might be other tools in our  toolbox that can have an impact  but I don'  t believe  that this is one of them.  got you so it sounds like no  action really is needed at this  point but maybe we agendize a  different conversation if it'  s a different action that needs  to be taken. It'  s what I'  m hearing I'  m not sure.  Mr. Vanoverbeek.  I like the spirit of this but I  think given Mr. Vig'  s take on it and the fact that  we put these in place fairly  recently so we want to give  them a chance to see if it  works. I think it'  d like to revisit  this in some period of time six  or eight months or a year and  look at what we have in place  now and if it'  s not  working then go back and  consider some of your  suggestions.  councilmember goldstein.  I guess I'  m concerned  that it seems as though the  current fee structure may not be  incentivizing all of our property  owners to take care of their  that many of us brought up. Is  there any room to adjust fees  based on something else like  property value? Because what if  a $100 fee is nothing to a  certain property owner but then  we don'  t want to be  levying huge fees upon somebody  with a small house?  Mr. Veague can you answer some  of this is tied to state law  correct?  correct. I think most  importantly we feel the fees get  people'  s attention. This isn'  t a tool we'  re often  using and when we do usually  within the first 11 days things  get corrected and then when  they'  re getting  deemed with $100 it'  s not just often  they'  re not paying the fee that day  it'  s something that then  there'  s usually something wrong with  the situation. I think it'  situation maybe a hoarder or  maybe some other weird unique  circumstance the family building  may be in probate there'  s usually  something strange and so there'  s a lien put on the property  and so we find this is a good  tool to get people'  s  attention and that'  s the goal of it. I  have always tried to suggest the  one property we keep talking about  downtown is a one off and I don'  want to keep changing all of our  very unique. I will say and I  shared at the last meeting we  discussed this that those fees  were being levied and I don'  want to see any eye rolling but  my understanding is that  construction will begin this  Friday and I'  m not sure if it'  associated with these fees or  not and again that'  s what I'  ve been informed.  Fingers crossed that that issue  will hopefully be initiated and  wrapped up in a reasonable time  frame and we won'  wait until the end of the  I will be talking about that  property as it relates to code  enforcement.  Did I answer the question that  I think the tools we have are  effective?  I just wanted to know if  there'  s room to go higher and if  there'  s a need but it sounded like you  said it'  s not going to make much of a  difference.  I would agree let'  s revisit this. It'  s fine to go back and review and  see how this is working. Let'  s give it like council member van  overbrink said six to eight  months whatever and let'  s see how it'  s working. If we need to make  any adjustments and revisit that  but I'  m perfectly willing to listen  to this again and hear how it'  s actually working for our  community.  absolutely. Thank you for  bringing this forward council  member holly and go ahead I'  ll let you have the  just the last thing that I should  add further context to is that  second note about how the dcba  is trying to somehow take  ownership over this issue as  much as they can. I think it'  s  work on this. Audrey did follow  up with me on this because she'  s  super on top of it and always  checking the agendas which I  love. She did send me the  downtown building enhancement  committee initiative run down  which I believe Jen is a part  of.  wonderful. As of now it looks  like this isn'  t something that necessarily has  goal is to create a vibrant and  welcoming physical downtown  destination. I think this could  be a tool in the future that  could be worked with but maybe  we'  ll revisit that in around six  months.  if you'  d like to add any further  context to that initiative.  we just had our first meeting  last night. I'  m not going to say anything at  all because it would be extremely  premature to speculate on what  the possibilities are. We just  started and hopefully we'  ll make some progress soon.  I'  ll leave it at that.  we'  ll have more information on that  when we talk about this again in  six or eight months. we do have  one speaker on this item.  okay. rob berry.  I thought I was going to forget  you.  I want to say I actually  enjoy listening to a little bit of  discussion before I speak because it  gives me a lot of understanding of  what you'  re talking about and what you'  re thinking. it'  s clear in your discussion you'  re talking about a very specific  issue as opposed to the general issue  of compliance with code violations.  I want to make a couple of  observations on that broader topic.  process. When you identify code  violations that they'  re complied with,  corrected and so forth. Whether you  have the incentives to do that or  not is a question I'  m not prepared to answer. I would  also like to observe that the  code enforcement violation process  right now is report generated  which means you would not be  aware of a code violation unless a  I would like to see at least  discretionary proactive enforcement  so that the code enforcement officers  can recognize a code violation in  the course of their travels and  raise a code enforcement issue  without having to depend on citizen  reporting.  Then the final observation I want  to make is sort of a very broad  topic which is you may recall that  we submitted a voter initiative for  a program that was  called public nuisance and this is  what we'  re talking about is the  public nuisance aspect here. That  put the city of chico on the same  footing as a private property owner  with regard to public nuisance. It  gave citizens a mechanism to report  public nuisance that were generated  by the city or on city owned property  as opposed to private property. One  of the problems with that is when  citizens attempted to use it, the  city was not able to address the  We found that the city claimed  that they could not address the  nuisance because of the warren  settlement agreement. Now we have a  decision from the court that the  warren settlement agreement is going  to basically stay in place and you  have now placed property owners in  the position where they cannot  address a public nuisance that is  having direct and economic impact on  their properties and businesses  because the city is not able to  address that problem. The city is  sort of created this rock and a hard  place situation where you have a  public nuisance that you would  normally abate but your hands are  tied because of the warren settlement.  The only option for a citizen in  that situation is litigation. I  would suggest that you talk about  that problem and try to find a way  for citizens to resolve that without  resort to litigation. Thank you.  thank you. That'  s it.  I did want to make a comment on  I will make one correction there are  some proactive code enforcement cases  that are opened up so it'  s not all dependent upon  citizen complaints and strangely  enough even I give some to code  enforcement.  city manager and I said we don'  t proactively do that I think you  made one of your neighbors mad.  Unhook your truck. I don'  t think it was the city manager  different neighborhood.  I think we'  re good we will just monitor it  and we'  re not taking action on it so we  can bring it back at any time and  we don'  t have to do the year thing or  anything since we'  re not having a vote on it.  Reports and communications the  following reports and communication  items are provided for the council'  s information no action can be taken  on these items under this section  unless the council agrees to include  it on a subsequent agenda.  City manager'  s report. We'  re going to get one someday.  Councilmember requests pursuant to  APMP 1010 council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after  stating what the item would be.

Discussion on supporting parklets  downtown informed by a staff report.  can I just make a friendly  amendment that we instead of using  the word supporting that we  research?  and get more information on it?  hopefully support it just because um yeah i can't talk about it because you know shorten it to just  discussion on parklets yes perfect staff report perfect love it right let's have a discussion on  it because i love the idea but i know there's some strong feelings and i want to make sure we're  getting all our information so you so you want a staff report to come back no no at this meeting  no no no we're going to have a discussion that okay will hopefully lead to that well if we all  agree that it's worth i had i talked to brendan about this not to put you on the spot brendan  out of bonnie um but i just i wanted to talk about um i i felt like if i just agendized discussing  parklets that there wouldn't be too much to discuss unless we can ask staff questions about  like what's the history of the parklets uh how might this look so if there's a way that at our  discussion we can have that be to some degree informed by our staff yeah so if we all vote to  put it on when you do your request  and you type your thing up you can attach anything that brendan gives you and so we have that ahead  of time coming to the meeting and then we can all have that and review it that sounds good  we just can't discuss it now because it's not on the agenda  okay council member goldstein  council member holly yes council member o'brien yes council member van overbeck no  council member winslow vice mayor bennett yes mayor reynolds  aye carries 6-1 okay council member goldstein all right um so this one might require a little more  context um but i would like to agenda as discussion of a study to revitalize the park avenue corridor  for a little context i've been meeting with a group of stakeholders including business owners  developers architects real estate professionals planners and community members called the park  working group and they see that there's a  significant opportunity right now for park avenue with the upcoming downtown revitalization project  and the barber yard redevelopment that it's at a key time to plan ahead for the impacts and  opportunities to park avenue as far as things like zoning development opportunities and the  infrastructure and so it's a little unclear what this study would entail yet but i would like to  bring it forward that council would like to have a look at it and i would like to have a look at it  and i would like to have a look at it and i think it's a good idea to have a discussion with the council  can start that discussion so yeah i would like to agenda this discussion of a study to revitalize the  park avenue corridor i'll second that okay council member goldstein council member holly yes council  member o'brien i'll agree to discuss yes council member van overbeck yes council member winslow yes  vice mayor bennett  yes  mayor reynolds  yes  kerry seven zero  all right  all right  all right  i can do one more i feel like this is going to be a lot but somebody brought this up earlier so i might as well make it real quick per public comment from item 4.2 would like to discuss policy on drive-throughs  and for a little context i'm thinking discussing what zones they're permissible in and if they're in a !  okay  council member goldstein  aye  council member holly  yes  council member o'brien  no  council member van overbeck  no  council member winslow  yes  vice mayor bennett  no  mayor reynolds  no  fails three four  all right anybody else  no  okay we will adjourn to our tuesday may sixth meeting at uh three pm  all right  have a great easter  song  song  song  song
