 All right, we will call the regular city council meeting in the city of Chico, April 5th, to  order, and we will start with an invocation from Reverend Penny DeRogier.  Hopefully I didn't massacre her last night.  You did great.  All right.  You can come up.  Just come on up to the podium.  The microphone's built in.  Thank you.  Dear Lord, we thank you for this evening, Father.  We just pray a blessing over every single person in this house that sacrificed time  to be here.  Father, for the community of Chico, Lord, I pray that everything that we speak, Lord,  be wisdom from you and that benefit the city and the people here.  Lord, I pray a special prayer amongst each person that is making decisions, Lord God,  that they base their decisions wholly on the community of Chico and for its benefit.  Lord, I also pray, Father, that our words and our actions be pleasing to you, and I  pray all these things in Jesus' name.  Amen.  All right.  Thank you very much.  If you'd please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  All right.  Welcome, everybody.  We'll start with a roll call.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Here.  Council Member Brown.  Here.

Anyone wishing to address the council on any of the items listed on the agenda needs to  complete a card which are found in the back of the room.  Turn them in to the city clerk once they are completed, and then speakers will be taken  in the order the cards are received.  And once the first speaker begins, no additional.  Additional cards will be accepted.  I have a housekeeping issue first.  I'd like to table item 7.9 if the council has concurrence on that.  Just do the length of the agenda and move that to a future agenda.  It's a closed session item 7.9 conference with a labor negotiator.  Are we good?  You don't need a vote, right?  You just need to shake your head.  Is everybody cool?  All right.  Good.  Yes.  Oh.  Oh, the sunshine negotiation proposals.  No, it's at 7.9.  Can't hear you, Sean.  7.9.  Okay.  So 7.9.  Okay.  So 7.9.  7.9 has been coming back up, and I think it's just going to depend on how long it takes.  Okay.  But only.  Well, we can table it at that time.  It's canon.  Yeah.  If I'm fine with 5.1.  All right.  Is everybody all right with that?  Okay.  All right.  So we'll move on to the consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and enacted in  one motion.  Do we have a motion to approve?  I'll move to approve.  Second.  All right.  Motion and second.

So when I call both your names, if you could please come on up.  Nicole Nava followed by Jeff Crean.  Good evening, council.  So I feel like I need a preface by saying it's Nava nightly news because I'm trying  to give you the rundown for what happened between last time and this time.  this time that we sometimes don't hear about in the news. Today we had some lovely individual  throw a bucket of apparently feces and urine out in the street right in front of our council  building. Welcome to Chico. This is what your residents have been putting up with. By the way,  if anybody is in doubt, that's what we see. The encampments are lots of trash. There are some  individuals I will note within the encampments that do actually keep extremely clean tents. So  full props to those that are actually doing their part to try to be a part of the community.  We've had, you know, the gang stuff, the shootings, you know, it's just out of control  because I believe we're doing the broken window theory here where enforcement doesn't occur with  some on some individuals. It's not being applied equally to all the citizens of Chico.  Props to Chico PD because they actually very quickly secured a very dangerous situation.  And I think that's what we're seeing. So I think that's what we're seeing. So I think that's  what we're seeing. So I think that's what we're seeing. So I think that's what we're seeing. So  they've been doing their level best to try to help this community. But I think a directive needs to  come out from this council about what is enforceable because I feel like we're still using  the blanket of some nebulous gag order that no one's seeing and nebulous thing about what we  can and can't enforce. What we cannot enforce is moving humans from the encampments and we cannot  move their personal possessions. We absolutely 100% can go ahead and take care of any other crime  that is occurring.  No matter what. So I think that's what we're seeing. So I think that's what we're seeing. So  I think that's what we're seeing. So . . . .   . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .   take time  And there are some unknown costs.  And mind you, this is startup and ongoing.  And you have to think of this total number as being through June 30, 2022 at this point.  Plus, it includes the annual for the remainder of the year.  So we have $5,188,745.75 at the low end and $5,831,565.50 on the high end.  And that accounts for the food and whether there are two people in the unit or one person in the unit.  We only are paying a chunk to the operating person through June 30.  So we don't know who will be doing things beyond that, of course.  So that's another cost.  This is all taxpayer money.  Yes, there are ARPA funds used.  But let's be clear.  Those are taxpayer dollars at a federal level.  All the rest is city coffers, potentially your general fund.  Thank you for your time.  Have a good night.  Jeff Creed, followed by a hair.  Well, congratulations.  I think you finally took a step forward for the first time since you were elected as this body to move Chico in a positive direction.  I just wish you'd listened earlier.  And maybe Chico wouldn't be stuck in this lawsuit.  If you listen the first 30, 40 times, I recommended that here's going back a few years.  So where do you go now?  What's the next step for Chico to actually have a positive future?  What's the next step on the little chalkboard you worked up?  I don't think you had this in mind when you had those planning meetings.  I think those planning meetings were very esoteric.  Making Chico the jewel of the North State is a good goal.  Making Chico the business hub of the North State, it's beyond laughable.  How and why would it be the business hub of the North State?  It's not on a major thoroughfare.  It's not on I-5.  It doesn't have a big attraction for corporate industry.  In fact, it's got a big detractor.  It was like five years ago, a recruiter for medical doctors stood right here and said,  I can't get doctors to come to Chico because of crime.  And what's happened to crime since then?  It's gotten a lot worse, right?  So what's the next step?  The next step is you need to go convince this community that they need a sales tax.  Because despite the fallacy that you can't tax a populace into prosperity,  being pushed by some people, you have to provide the basic infrastructure.  Mark Orm said the consequences we are seeing on the roads right now are the consequences of his decisions  to cut the budget so drastically and not seek funds for years.  Go back.  Go back and watch the State of the City address and look at what's said.  But then you've got the mayor and other people following up Mark Orm in the State of the City  floating all these crazy, stupid ideas.  So where's your confidence in the voter?  What voter is going to listen to you guys with any objectivity or positivity  or look forward and go, yes, I can trust you to tell me the truth?  I don't see any voter that would watch.  What?  You?  You've said and go, oh, I can trust that person implicitly.  And I think you've seen it when you complain about people not turning out, not being engaged.  You've taught them for years, not just you, but councils before you.  And some of you have been here a while.  You've taught them for years to disengage because it's not worth their time.  So what can you do to get that confidence back?  What can you do to get the respect of the voters back?  That's the question.  That's the question I would be asking yourself when you go home tonight.  And you might pontificate on how low will you let Chico slide before you support a sales tax, Mr. Morgan?  Hare, followed by Robin Engel.  Hi, it's Paul Hare.  And I got to agree, I wouldn't vote for any of you anymore.  And I got this problem.  You see, I got to eat my bike.  And I go to the store.  I get attacked on the way all the time by the pawn out here.  And it's got so much garbage.  You have 32 tons of garbage in the pawn and alongside the pawn and the trails.  But to get over to the store, I go that way.  Otherwise, I got to go three miles out of my way.  And that's three miles back, six miles out of my way.  I've been attacked twice.  I've called the police.  Each time, nothing gets done.  I get this number.  So I called to find out what they did.  And it says, oh, well, there's nothing.  Nothing written there.  Oh, thank you.  What a waste of time.  So they can attack us and run into their tents and nothing gets done.  Why are they attacking us?  I would imagine it's robbery, but they didn't get the robbery.  But I can't prove nothing because I'm mostly blind.  I come by here Sunday.  There's a guy over here.  He's got this long rod.  Now I'm getting hit with something.  I assume it was a blowgun.  Then he's screaming, he's going to kill me and steal my bike.  I would have went and said something to the police, but what are they going to do?  Same thing they've been doing.  Nothing.  I want to know when it's going to be safe to come down to Chico or to go to the store on the bike path.  The cop tells me, well, you know it's dangerous.  Don't go that way.  Oh, well, that's Chico for you.  It's all dangerous.  That's Brown.  Robin Engle, followed by Addison Winslow.  Hi.  Hi.  Back in September, we were told, in late September, we were told as we were moving forward with the ice rink  that the fence around our public plaza was necessary for the ice rink to,  to be constructed, built, and contained.  The ice rink was open officially to the public between November 26th and January 30th.  That is 34 days, I believe.  Yeah, 34 days, if my basic math is correct.  That fence has been surrounding our public plaza for 100,  182, possibly plus some change, days.  That is one half of a year.  One half of the year, we have not been given access to the public plaza.  That's approximately 150 days extraneous beyond the ice rink activities.  So there is no reason for this.  We have been.  Given no reason for this, we're very thankful that the restrooms are finally open to the public now.  And yet the entire fence remains an eyesore for half of one year.  We are being robbed of our public plaza for half of a year.  That is completely inexcusable.  Thank you.  Addison Winslow, followed by Patrick Newman. .    .     .   . . . . . . . . .  . . .  . . .     .       . .  Thank you. . . . . . . . . . .   .  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. .    .   .   . .  sewer operations budget. There will be no projects to replace pipes for decades, and he said 30% of  our sewer network has reached its useful life. Like one in three Chicoans may as well just poop  outside. But really, the prospects are bleak. With our current road maintenance budget, we'll see  unabated decline. In order to maintain our current poor condition, we need to increase close to three  times the current budget. In order to reach the state average, we need to increase seven times.  Because it's considerably more expensive to replace bad pavement than to treat newer pavement,  the city is going to prioritize keeping good roads good and letting the bad ones get worse. The good  roads being largely spread out in the outer ring suburbs and the bad roads in the central  neighborhoods and inner ring suburbs suggest that the general decline in the quality of  infrastructure is going to be worse for the people living in the central areas. Kind of as a pivot,  there's a group that's been doing land value analyses nationwide to compare the costs of  maintaining public infrastructure and maintaining public infrastructure. And they're doing land value  analyses nationwide to compare the costs of maintaining public infrastructure and maintaining public  infrastructure that serves land to the revenue that's generated by that development. They're  called Urban 3 and they produce these beautifully elegant maps. The pattern they've uncovered  consistently is that productive places are where things are close together, there's more people and  there's more businesses sharing infrastructure, and people invest more heavily in the land because  it's valuable with all that going on. Everywhere you go, this is always walkable mixed-use areas,  particularly downtowns. And Chico would also name Merriam Park, still under construction, and the  West Sac Shopping Center, where a lot of people live close by and frequently walk and bike.  In spite of the infrastructure. On the flip side is suburban sprawl, combination low density, single  use residential areas and commercial box stores with wide arterial roads for access. Because of the  scale that infrastructure required to service them, they're consistently drains on city finances.  This is the way that Chico's developed for the last 70 years, since after World War II. And it's  the way most of the future growth is looking right now, with Merriam Park being a major exception.  We're using lots of state and federal grants in order to subsidize infrastructure necessary for these  developments, where you have lots of people spread out and all relying on automobiles. And it's adding  on to the liability that we're not prepared to afford. In spite of any sales tax that might be improved,  we're not going to see any improvement in the future of Chico if this doesn't change.  Thank you. Patrick Newman, followed by Salona Rain.  I agree with Addison and Jeff. Ten years ago, we should have had a 1% sales tax. Maybe two.  $200 million in the hole because we didn't institute one ten years ago. All you have to do is drive around Chico,  and you can see what the pavement expert was saying. It's catastrophic. The streets are deteriorating rapidly.  I don't know how people sleep at night. But anyway, I'm not here to talk about that.  That fence stands around the plaza. It's a monument to really the moral failure of our city.  That's a public space that should be utilized by all citizens, especially the poorest people who need it the most.  Whether that's an eccentric point of view or not, it's one that I think as a matter of conscience you might want to examine.  So it's a moral failure, not just because of what you're doing.  It's a moral failure not just because of what you're doing. It's a moral failure not just because of what you're doing.  It's a moral failure not just because of what you're doing. It's a moral failure  because the response of the city to that fence which cuts off the most  suffering people from that public space and did for months and months and months  to the restrooms and the water fountain there.  And it will increasingly be an issue with shade  and other issues that are seasonal.  That failure extends to the entire community  because there's been very little consciousness  or concern about it.  People think that authoritarianism is going to come  in the form of flamethrowers and rocket launchers and tanks.  That's not how it happens.  It happens incrementally.  You take away people's freedoms and you just etch away  at what's left of what they have,  the poorest and weakest and most scapegoated people.  That's how it happens.  It happens that way every time in every society  where totalitarianism takes over.  That's been the drift in Chico now for seven or eight years.  So that fence is a monument, again, to our moral failure.  We ought to see it that way.  The night we talked about putting that,  I stood here and said,  that fence is being put there to exclude the poorest people.  If I remember the quote correctly,  Mr. Morgan told me that was absurd.  Well, now as the months tick by  and it's obvious that it's left there  to keep the poorest people out month after month,  does it really sound that absurd anymore?  What I said that night?  I don't think so.  So anyway, the last six or seven Saturdays  we've been there with signs.  And 10 to 12,  maybe some of you could join us there  to protest the existence of that fence.  And we can have a longer conversation about this.  It takes more than three minutes to really unpack,  along with all the other violations  against the poor in the city.  Thank you.  Our final speaker is Salona Rain.  Good evening.  Thank you.  My penmanship is poor.  It's Raymond, R-E-Y.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Homelessness is an extreme form of poverty.  There's been a cycle of decline in the U.S.  for about 40 years.  Homelessness at its core is caused  by a severe housing shortage  across California and the nation.  It is not a matter of behavioral health or climate.  It's not enough housing.  The so-called homeless are a widely diversified,  diverse population suffering all sorts of contributing factors  that led to being without shelter.  Most are economic refugees as a result of job loss, evictions,  trauma, mental illness, addiction, poor health,  or maybe just one catastrophe that was unexpected  and the person didn't have the resources,  a fire, a head injury.  Things happen to people.  More middle-class people are finding themselves living  in cars.  Fencing off the community,  these plazas seem like a punitive,  even violent method to keep the homeless out of sight.  But unhoused people cannot be disappeared unless,  of course, they die or are murdered.  The fenced-in plaza, including the ice rink fiasco,  is an embarrassing symbol of the city's failure  to address the plight of the unsheltered with any level  of compassion or competence.  Those of us who are housed would be completely undone if forced  to live on the street.  Soaked in the cold rain of winter,  no respite from summer heat while sick, thirsty, hungry,  desperate for a bathroom makes it tough to go to school  or apply for work, although you'd be surprised  at the number of unsheltered people who manage to eke  out some survival system by finding a job or two.  Whereas having a safe shelter of one's own home serves  to calm anxiety, trauma, survival fears,  housing is the first step in moving from chaos to stability  and supportive housing is the first step in moving from chaos to stability and supportive housing.  Housing is the most critical health a community can offer.  So today's plaza is just not a good look.  When protesting on the plaza, visitors go by and say,  well, that's awful.  It is not good aesthetically for citizens or visitors,  and morally it really is offensive.  I think it's got to go.  Thank you.  She's our last speaker.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much.  We'll move on to item four.  So business from the floor is done.  Public hearing 4.1 redistricting city council districts  in the city of Chico.  Public hearing number five, second reading and adoption of ordinance,  adjusting boundaries, adoption of final map.  I believe, Mr. Yoon, are we going straight to?  You can go straight to the demographer.  Okay.  Yeah.  Welcome.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Good to be back.  All right.  So as with each hearing, have a brief presentation that kind of brings the council and the public  up to speed of where we're at, what's going to be discussed, and where we're going.  So district proposals.  Last meeting, 12 maps were considered.  The five maps that were originally elevated at the third public hearing and variations of those maps  done by the demographer or submitted by the council.  The city council took public comments and we have received numerous emails supporting  or opposing the various maps under consideration.  City council has moved three maps forward for consideration, which are demographer map  5B, as well as public submissions 2C and 6C.  Demographer map 5B.  Oh, that's color.  Okay.  Just the outline here.  So this is demographer map 5B.  Original version for some reason had it colored in.  That's almost better.  This is demographer map 5B for everyone's review.  Demographer map 2C.  I mean public submission 2C.  And public submission 6C.  So next steps, April 5th, today, hold a public hearing, take testimony, receive comments,  choose a final map and adopt by resolution, vote on second reading adoption of redistricting ordinance,  and then April 17th, California state law deadline for submission of final map to Butte County.  That concludes the presentation on either entertain questions or,  um,  proceed to public comment.  All right.  Questions?  Any?  All right.  Get back to you.  I'll ask you to come back after comment.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  How many speakers?  We have 16.  Okay.  So open the public hearing and refresh my memory, because it's a public hearing.  Do we have a timeline or requirement or can we do two minutes because we're over the 15?  Um, you can, you can act.  I would  I believe you can do 2 Minutes.  Okay.  In order to get them all in.  Because typically it's 30 to 45 Minutes.  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  So usually when we hit 15 we take 2 Minutes.  2 Minutes.  So let's take 2 Minutes.  Okay.  Our first speaker is Margaret Swith followed by Nicole Nava.  And if your name is called second,  just line  up behind the person who's speaking we'd appreciate that so we can move more  swiftly I think I did the paperwork wrong wrong I want to speak to 5.2  please okay all right and so Nicole Nava followed by J Pumazi good evening all  right so back again in support of map 6 C because I believe it best reflects the  communities of interest in Chico as per a plethora of feedback in the prior  meeting there was a big old packet and a ton of the comments were in support of  6 C this one also has a majority of your community for 6 C there'll be people  tonight that speak I'm sure about several of the maps but you have to keep  in mind there's also written things because people are at work so why does  it fit we solicited a ton of feedback from the public I went over that at my  last one so I won't belabor that point  you  what I'll jump to is that map 6 C also included elements of the climate  vulnerability study that was done it was referenced for Senate bill 379 to try to  meet some of the tenants of that for our general plan safety element that was  required for actually completion this year so there were a couple of items in  there and a high priority for them was to promote climate change adaptation and  resiliency for this community and the  city of Chico has a lot of work to do with that and I think that's a great  way to keep the city's roadways infrastructure and flood zones  disadvantaged communities and sensitive species habitat were among the most  vulnerable to climate change impacts so when taking into consideration some of  those things such as the disadvantaged communities and the extreme fire risk in  certain areas of Chico that was what also went into formulating map 6 C  submitted by the public and again lots of feedback tours of the city etc I like  that it keeps the communities of interest together I think it's important  and any parts where there was a little bit on outer edges was to try to keep  the population deviation low. I believe this map had the lowest population  deviation at 3.13 percent and really I do feel it reflects the will of the  people because they've come they've driven around your city and they've  emailed you. Thank you.  Jay Fumazi followed by Bill Munro. Good evening I came down here tonight to show my  support for 6C. I feel that it represents my district most efficient  way and I hope you will consider 6C for your consideration. Mr. Fumazi can I ask a quick question?  Which which district is yours in 6C? District 3. Thank you. Bill Munro followed by Kirk  Mumford.  Hi I'm Bill Munro at 234 West 4th Avenue and I believe the Gettysburg  address was two minutes so this is this will be okay. The I would really  appreciate the the Goldstein 2C map but the Demographers map is also excellent.  If you look at those two maps side by side and the and in color it's a lot  easier to see.  They're very similar because they are taking into consideration the Fair Maps Act and the  and the requirements thereof. They're slightly different. Somebody could argue that that  Goldstein is partisan and but nonetheless her map is very similar to the person who  was paid by the city as a demographer. The demographer map is is very similar to the  teacher .   . . . . .  . .   has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  What is that?  You know, and why was that done that way?  We don't know.  So I am hoping that the, as I said in a letter to the editor the other day,  that the better angels on the council will come to the fore  and that a vote for the demographer's map or the 2C map will be the result.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Kirk Mumford, followed by Rita Smith.  Hello.  I want to support what Mr. Monroe said.  Both 5B and 2C are very similar in that they both seem to recognize  the communities of interest that are important.  For example, D7 is exactly the same as far as I can tell.  There's a slight difference in D5.  Yeah.  5B, the demographer's map, in that I think it does not include Rancheria  and it extends farther up Highway 32.  And if you flip over, you'll see that 2C does include Rancheria  because the piece, the little pink piece just above D4  goes a little further.  I can't read the streets, but I think it includes Rancheria  or mainly a student neighborhood.  So 2C seems to do a somewhat better job of capturing the student neighborhoods  and consolidating them and leaving D5 to pick up single-family residences  and, you know, normal middle-class people across Highway 32.  There's some difference between D1 and, or 2C,  District 1 and District 3 between the demographer map and 2C.  And I'm not familiar with what that would be,  but it's up in the northeast section there.  There's a little difference.  But other than that, the maps are very similar.  I would like to talk against 5C or 6C because it's nuts.  I don't see that it preserves communities of interest at all.  It takes...  It takes Mansion Park and puts it in a student neighborhood  rather than making it part of the Canaan neighborhood.  Our chair lives in Mansion Park, actually,  and it tears, as Mr. Cooley said, it sunders...  That's fine.  ...that piece.  That's fine.  Okay. Thank you.  Rita Smith, followed by Karen Duncanwood.  Hi there. I'm Rita Smith, 28-year chairwoman,  Chico resident,  and I'm here to support Map 5B.  I do believe that Map 2C is the better map.  It follows the guidelines from the Fair Maps Act.  It keeps our neighborhoods of similar needs together.  But 5B does do an adequate job of that as well.  And I think in choosing 5B,  we will not...  exacerbate the divide that is in this city,  that partisan divide.  It will not exacerbate that,  and it will help, hopefully,  to put a little bit in bringing us together.  I love our city.  I don't like the divide.  And I think this simple choosing a good map in 5B  will help not make things any worse, at least.  Thank you.  So, Karen Duncanwood, followed by Adam Fadela.  The microphone's on the podium.  What?  The microphone is on the podium, or in it.  Yes, thank you.  I always get disoriented when I come up here  because I can't know where the microphone is.  I'm sorry.  My name is Karen Duncanwood,  and I live in District 1,  roughly east of Esplanade,  about a block and a half from it.  So the different maps treat that area,  very differently.  I think the maps 5B and 2C are acceptable.  They're very similar.  They take into account natural boundaries,  communities of interest.  I think they're easier for residents to learn about  and remember,  and advise other city folk about their districts.  I think 6C is a blatant, partisan,  drawn map that does not follow natural boundaries,  does not keep communities of interest together,  and would be very difficult for citizens of Chico  to learn and remember,  because it doesn't make sense.  I would strongly urge you to select either 5B or 2C.  I think it's good that the consultant came up with a map  that, you know,  as the previous speaker said,  does not exacerbate the split in the city.  I think 6C does that clearly, very clearly,  and should be clearly rejected  because of that and other reasons.  So I thank the council for listening,  and I hope District 1 doesn't chop off the part above 99,  which 6C does.  It radically changes.  It changes the boundaries of District 1, among others.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Adam Fideli, followed by Angela McLaughlin.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds,  council, thank you all, as always, for serving.  Tonight, I'm here in my capacity as a member  of the Barber Neighborhood Association Steering Committee,  representing District 7 and the Southwest neighborhood.  I'm here to speak to the City Council  for the improvement plan adopted by council in 2008.  Just to refresh everybody's memory,  Cana's plan was adopted just before ours, I think in April.  At any rate, our organization and group is very much  in support of the Demographer's map or Ms. Goldstein's map.  We believe that those two maps preserve the integrity  of the neighborhood planning process, and we hope that they will be used in the future.  And 6C has this appendage on it that reaches over  East 8th and East 9th and runs up into the park  along Ballantyne, Progia, and as a 21-year realtor  here in town, 21 years worth of driving around the city,  I mean, those neighborhoods are not anything alike.  District 7 in the Demographer map, District 7 in the Goldstein map,  keep that in mind.  We've got the community of interest  of Southwest Chico together.  We're very compatible with the addition of the Chapman area.  We don't have anything in common really with that appendage.  So I would respectfully ask that you take either  the Demographer's map or Ms. Goldstein's map.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Angela McLaughlin, followed by Addison Winslow.  Like many of the speakers, map 5 and 2C are the ones  that should still be under consideration.  Both of them are excellent maps.  I would lean a little bit towards Ms. Goldstein's map.  She has local knowledge that the Demographer,  even though his map is good, does not bring.  She has knowledge of the neighborhoods  and communities of interest,  and it's reflected in the map that she produced.  It's also concerning with 6C  that the lack of geographic contiguity,  I am concerned that the city's gonna end up  in yet another lawsuit.  There are clear problems with this map.  It doesn't comply with the fair maps act.  So I hope that the council will do the right thing on this.  Addison Winslow, followed by Bryce Goldstein.  I don't have a ton to add to all the other speakers, except for the 1C,  first two who I think spoke really well on these issues. I look at like all the maps that they  started out with and besides a couple tweaks, like they're all great maps, you know, when I think  about it just by the low standards that I might have. I don't have super high expectations, just  that you don't take a whole gaping area with like lots of construction going on right now and then  tie it into a completely different area. Or you have like geographically discontiguous districts  where we have to walk into a neighborhood, in this case Hancock Park, where it's all developed  together. People have a little bit of identity there and you tell them, oh, you're not in that  district, you're in that district. And just to put yourself in like the mind of a canvasser at some  point talking about a city council election that's coming up and coming to explain somebody in this  little wedge right here, like a right angle cut and saying, oh, you're not in that district, you're  in that district because the city council took the map that was designed by this woman, Nicole Nava,  and then they were like, oh, you're not in that district, you're in that district. And so I think  that's a really good way to explain that process. And then wait until they like pull out a comment  from Nicole Nava, just read it to them just to explain that process and how we came to have  districts like these. So these other ones are really decent. I guess it's too late to add any  amendments to them, but yeah, I hope you go with one of those. Thanks. Thank you. Bryce Goldstein  followed by Robin Engel. Good evening. I'm here tonight to urge you to adopt either public map  2C or a demographer map 5B. These maps comply with the Fair Maps Act by keeping communities of  interest together so that all Chico residents have a fair chance to elect somebody who represents  them. One speaker made a note of the climate vulnerability assessment, but I want to note  that all of the maps that are on the table tonight include the city of Chico's wildfire  vulnerable areas in one district as was recommended by council. And as I noted,  I support public map 2C or demographer map 5B. As others noted, these are pretty similar.  And it felt like we were coming towards a consensus a few weeks ago before map 6 got  pushed forward and then modified. And I don't quite understand that. That map splits communities  of interest. It divides the avenues into three districts. The east streets get split into two  districts somewhat along 8th Street and other streets in a weird jagged way.  It just puts dissimilar neighborhoods together, places that wouldn't necessarily have common  interests and need to organize around them, such as my neighborhood, Barber, gets put  in a district with Merriam Park. Somebody last time advocated for that, but I would  advocate against that unless it just made sense as far as compactness. I mean, we live  in a historic neighborhood, and the district shouldn't be based on who's building new developments.  It should be based on neighborhoods that are in close proximity and have common issues.  So I'm concerned about gerrymandering. I'm concerned about who drew the original map 6.  My PRA was not fulfilled by the time of this meeting. I submitted it a couple of weeks ago,  so we don't know who originally drew that. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was somebody with  partisan interests. Yeah, so next time, nonpartisan citizens redistricting commission would prevent  this drama. Adopt good maps. Thank you.  Robin Engle, followed by Katie Posey.  I want to bring or remind us of a little bit of history the last time we went through this  two-plus years ago. And we also were concerned about gerrymandering then, as we should be,  and as we should be now. And the room was full. It was full of people on both sides  of the political spectrum.  There was a strong, strong favor for the Goldstein map or maps. I don't remember if it was one or  several. Council ignored us and did what they did anyway. And the results were not good for anyone.  So I just want to remind you, as we think and talk about trying to avoid gerrymandering and  partisanship, and I thank you, Dale Bennett, for bringing that up at the last minute, I think it's  time for us  that  the  Goldstein  maps  have  done  that  consistently  and  so  I  think  it  has  a  chance  to  redeem  yourself  with  the  people  and  go  with  2  C  because  otherwise otherwise  we  are  not  being  heard  at  all  year  after  year  redist  redist F F !  Ooooh F !  we've all seemed to acknowledge is very close to 5B,  which is the demographer's map.  But now's a chance for you to give the people the real message  that you're listening to us.  So 2C is the best.  It's my vote.  Thank you, Katie Posey, followed by Christine Mueller.  Good evening, Council.  So last time I had talked about 6C,  I continued to look at the maps,  continued to look at some of the discussion that was elicited  in different groups in person and online.  But you know that the climate vulnerability assessment report  was mentioned.  And so you know that page 29 lists the map  of the disadvantaged communities.  So the reason why I still support 6C  is because I'm a member of the Council of the Disadvantaged  because in District 7, my district,  there are disadvantaged communities that are kept together  that are not kept together in the other maps.  Also, you know, everybody's talked about,  and I think everybody agrees,  keeping communities of interest together.  We're in agreement with that.  And it's important that people can recognize  what district they're in.  But the Fair Maps Act shows a priority  of keeping communities of interest together over that.  The thing is,  if people aren't sure what district they're in,  there usually are tools that they can plug in their address,  they can look that up,  and then they're going to know,  and that's going to be the same for the next 10 years.  So that is helpful.  So that is why I continue to give my support to 6C.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Christine Mueller, followed by Susan Baldwin.  Hello.  I am here to express my support for public,  public submission map 2C,  which I believe best meets the criteria of the Fair Maps Act  and the criteria of generally a lowercase fair district map.  It respects the geographic integrity of local neighborhoods  and communities of interest,  as were demonstrated by the demographer during the last meeting.  And the district boundaries are easily identifiable  and would be understandable  to the residents.  Districts are also geographically compact.  As others have noted,  the demographer map 5B is similar to this  and I believe would also be adequate,  I believe,  to see better meets criteria,  in particular on the student housing district.  I believe that map 6C fails to meet the criteria  of a good,  good district map.  I think that the districts are not easily identifiable  and would be very hard for residents to understand  the district they're in.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Susan Baldwin, followed by Ruth Sarnoff.  Hello.  I'm asking if you would please choose map 5B.  What I have to say here,  I think, is kind of across the board  about all the things that are going on in the city,  maybe even the country,  but most of us learned as children  that it benefits no one to be greedy.  Let's use a pie as an example.  Don't take more than your fair share of the pie.  We might try to justify taking more with excuses like,  well, Sally has diabetes,  or John should be on a diet,  or it's my recipe,  or I brought most of the ingredients,  but the pie was brought to the table  for all of the people at the table.  Don't be greedy by coming up with your own reasons  to justify your decisions.  And realistically, taking more than your fair share  of the pie may give you an instance of pleasure,  but it will have a negative long-term effect.  Thank you.  Our next speaker is Ruth Sarnoff.  I've been working on a book that I think will show  through a period about three, three and a half years now,  that climate change is the big thing,  and it's really happening.  And it shows it by following the colored maps  in the enterprise record.  And I have them for every day for about three years,  and also some older and some back in the 20s and that.  So.  What I want to say to you today is,  that I think we need to think ahead,  in terms of redistricting,  that the purpose of this was to create equity,  and it had to do with the right to vote,  and who would vote.  And I think that the instability of this area here,  in terms of people that are moving about,  just to keep a roof over their head,  right now is is an important factor to think about I watched a once again  chasing coral and I'm really disturbed by the dumping of garbage all over the  place because there really isn't any garbage anywhere so one of the things  about districting is to you know let everybody take some of the heat and let  everybody take some of the sharing and if you don't start sharing you probably  won't have food a year from now and I'm saying that because the in the east it's  pretty iced in if you go day by day and look at that and look at the AP articles  and that's what I'm putting together and that's why I was late to  Ruth was our last speaker  all right well close the public hearing and Claudio help me with your last name  to go Legos Legos okay now I can go it goes mr. guy a ghost  yes questions from mr. guys would you be willing to pull up the online  website and put it on the screen and put it on the screen and put it on the screen  tool sure that's what I was actually heading to right now I figured got some  new people in the room today and I think it's an important exercise  oh wait that's not it I'm sorry here we go  you  you  you !  you're looking this up can you explain how you identified communities of  interest on that first communities of interest out overlay so the first one  was from a list that was given to me from the City Council of various areas  which went back research also communicated with the city planning  department who sent me a couple documents that helped  guide me to determine where some of these boundaries were at as well as some  of the email input and resident input at the first couple public hearings which  neighborhood communities of interest were provided to you by staff can you  point those out so one was here this Amber Grove Miriam  Park  Dana  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh !  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh ! ! . .  . . . . . . . . . . ! !  Ooooh  Sure. We will start with 5B.  Just briefly explain what we're looking at here.  Can you just briefly explain?  Sure. So here, 4B and 5B were, when those were done, were meant to try and keep as many within one district as possible.  That was the idea. To keep that equity, sometimes it's next to impossible to have the perfect map,  but try to keep them together. Early on, an early version that I did divided Barber, lesson learned,  and made it a point to keep that neighborhood together above anything else.  But did the best, as I mentioned, part of that student area.  Got cut off at the north end. Bidwell Park, or the lower Bidwell Park, a small section, was divided into a separate area.  But overall, tried to maintain the integrity of those communities of interest as much as possible.  Great. And for the good of the public, why would something like that happen?  A little bit of a neighborhood getting cut off or spliced into a different district?  Population equity, sometimes it's a matter of the streets in the area,  especially when you go into newer neighborhoods.  They're not as linear in neighborhoods built after the 60s.  So sometimes it gets a little trickier to try and do that and keep that equity.  So that's where you may be forced to divide a certain area.  And when you were drawing these maps, what other considerations did you make as it relates to the Fair Maps Act?  Keeping the districts compact.  Obviously, when this was, 5B was all about, you know,  it was altered to include the entire fire, the fire vulnerability area,  based on a study by Chico State.  The climate vulnerability assessment?  Yes.  Thank you.  And so what, and sometimes those little factors can contribute to a district maybe being,  looking a little, you know, large or not as compact as someone may think it should be.  So,  you know,  those are some of the factors was try to keep them compact as much as possible.  Anything else?  That's it.  Okay.  Can you move to the next one?  Sure.  Obviously, you can't speak to these, but helps to look at them.  Yes.  So here,  seeing several of these communities of interest are,  oh, sorry, it's,  it's map public submission,  2c  that's  Yeah  Great  You  would  see  K  a  has  kept  together  a  small  portion  of  the  32  corridor  is  split  the  lower  bid  wall  park  area  has  kept  together  a  portion  of  the  32  small  portion  of  the  that student area are split into a couple of other districts.  In the previous map, your 5B,  you maintain the length of the 32 all the way to the end.  Can you explain why you did that?  On this here?  Yeah.  It worked out for population equity.  Okay.  That was the primary consideration.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, great, next one.  All right, and back to this one or are you ready?  I'm good with moving forward.  Okay, so here is public submission 6C.  So some like Amber Grove, Pleasant Valley,  Merriam Park and Barber are Chapman Tower kept together.  Cana is split between three,  or based on this community of interest map  is split between three different districts.  Student area, it's roughly similar to 5B,  kept between two small couple blocks at the end.  32 corridor is in one district as well,  but notable split that are in three districts  is Lower Bidwell Park and Cana.  All right, thank you.  Thanks for answering my questions.  And that's any other?  Other questions?  So I just like at the last meeting,  Mr. Gallegos, first of all,  let me thank you for your work on this.  It's a thankless job for sure.  And I appreciate your effort.  But again, all three of these maps,  I want to get this from you,  straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak.  All three of these maps are legal.  Excuse me?  All three of these maps are legal.  They may, yes, they meet the bare legal criteria for consideration to be.  They may, yes, they meet the bare legal criteria for consideration to be.  So what makes them each legal?  So making sure they're within the 10% deviation,  making sure that they don't disenfranchise  communities of color.  And while federal VRA is not relevant to Chico  because there's no way to draw a majority minority district,  all three maps do maintain a district with a CBAP  of more than 20% Hispanic, at least in one district.  All right, thank you.  You're welcome.  Those items that you noted about keeping districts compact,  neighborhoods of interest being preserved  are also part of the Fair Maps Act, correct?  Correct.  But not legal requirements of the Fair Maps Act.  There are guidances to consider when drawing a map.  I would have to defer to legal counsel on what they say.  I would have to defer to legal counsel on what they say.  I don't know what legal vulnerability the city has,  but as far as basic federal guidelines,  all three meet those basic federal guidelines.  So if there's things like shelves,  what some people call the appendages,  districts looping around other districts,  those aren't illegal things,  but they may not be in line with the guidance  of the Fair Maps Act, is that right?  Correct.  Thank you.  Sir, I believe I heard you say bare minimum.  Did I hear that correctly a second ago  with Councillor O'Brien?  Yeah, like the bare, like basically they, yeah,  they all meet the legal guidelines.  The bare minimum, or at least the bare minimum or more.  Okay, thank you.  Council Member Tanner.  Could you please pick up,  bring up our current map right now?  Excuse me?  Our current map.  Our current district map.  Could you please program?  Oh, sure, hold on.  Let me.  Oh, the old presentation's gone.  So let me, I have to rely on the.  Takes a little bit of searching to find that one.  Do it a few times.  See here,  I'll just do a traditional Google search.  Here we go.  Oh wait, that's.  Ah.  Ooooh.  Wait, can you pause right there?  That map that you're just in the middle,  it says a council divided a city confused.  That was the map the last council wrote, right?  Yes.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  Let's see.  We had it on an old presentation, but that was...  That's been erased off the computer.  You can just pick any one of those.  I have a quick question.  Oh, okay.  There we go.  Oh, it's...  Districts.  Oh, it's the...  State Council.  State Council, okay.  Go to department, go back here.  Departments.  Go to departments, community development.  I believe the website was changed as we're updating,  so that's why...  GIS.  It's not readily available.  Go to interactive, go to public map...  There we go.  Under election...  Oh, under election...  Oh, under election...  Thank you for the hard work everybody.  I wanted to check in that in this map the North Avenue corridor is labeled as District 5.  And in the map 5B and 2C that is somehow it has an even district number 4.  So that will take the right, the people will not be able to vote looks like in this election.  Who didn't vote.  Who didn't vote last cycle 2.  Is that correct?  Okay.  Oh I see.  So 4 and 5.  Yes.  So that is a potential risk or yeah that unfortunately would be the cases because of the numbering.  Okay.  But if we somehow go and add up 6C that would correct that?  Because that is.  So we don't just name D5 as per our current districting numbers because we vote odd and even every 2 years.  So people who don't vote this past election were in districts 4 right.  they would be voting this December, two, four, and six.  Correct.  But for some reason, if we adopt the reverse numbers,  then one district would not get to vote for four years,  and two districts will get to vote consecutively.  Is that correct?  Well, so whatever one is two, four, six will be up this November.  Just wanted to clarify that.  So thanks.  You're welcome.  So obviously that happens from time to time, right?  I mean, people are moved into a district that they didn't vote last time,  that they have to vote this time.  Correct.  It happened in a few processes.  Yeah.  All right, further questions?  Vice Mayor?  Sorry.  So you mentioned that you referenced the vulnerability assessment  by keeping the fire district together,  but you didn't represent it by bringing the disadvantaged communities together?  So on the disadvantaged community, and that's where a debate,  because I'll give an example.  In Santa Ana, there was a similar debate over an environmental justice corridor  where certain areas that had, in a similar situation as this disadvantaged areas,  this disadvantaged areas,  two various communities were a couple of miles apart.  And there was the debate, do you somehow stretch them out and bring them together,  or do you try to, you know, put them into two?  And that's been the debate on some larger communities of interest.  Is it, you know, if there are, they have similar concerns,  but there's a little bit of distance, are they better off in two districts,  or do you try to stretch it out to make it one?  That, you know, so when I did it, it was about trying to keep compactness  and use certain lines as far as the fire,  because of the fact that it was less dense out in those outskirts,  it was easier to bring that together and make it look contiguous.  And then can you also address, there was a question about can a highway  or a road be connected to a highway?  Can a highway or a road be a natural boundary?  So they're not a natural boundary,  but they are considered a major consideration when putting together district maps.  A highway, Main Street, those are in the upper tier of consideration  when you put in the boundary in.  So, yeah, they're not natural, but they're...  Yeah, so like when we have a road that everything on one side of the street is east  and everything on the other side of the street is west,  it's kind of already...  Yeah, so like when we have a road that everything on one side of the street is east,  we take a  So that's a consideration.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. [inaudible]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Agenda is...  Actually, if you go up,  that'll be your agenda in a minute.  Yeah.  All those are the archives.  Here we go.  Yeah, the four or five.  If you just go up to the agenda at the top.  Yeah, there we go.  That's planning, I think.  Oh, it's loading still.  Okay.  I think it's not loading.  Let's try it.  So go to the...  Can we try this?  There we go.  And then just scroll down and put in the stack.  Okay.  All right, and then if you go to page,  let's see.  Looks like page four.  So I just wanna talk a little bit about the minority groups  in terms of how they're ranked.  And you made a point about this earlier,  and I can't remember exactly what you said.  So, yeah.  So obviously we can't,  because of how the minority groups are spread out  in this agenda,  we can't create necessarily a minority district.  Is that correct?  Yeah, there's no creating a majority minority  or even a plurality district in the city.  So what's suggested in terms of doing that?  Is it suggested to have a greater number of districts  with a certain percentage,  or I remember at some point you mentioning 20% or something?  So a best practice is to try and if they can,  you can maximize their number,  which about the best you can do,  and what you gotta use the benchmark is citizen voting age,  population.  Sure.  As in doing the research was finding out that it's the best  you can get to is between 22 to 23%.  All three maps pretty much have at least one district  where they're over 20% of the CBAP and are fairly close.  They're within about a little more like six tenths of a  percent from each other and did all in district four.  Okay. So on the first one, if you go to the first,  is this the, which map is?  It's 5B.  That's 5B.  And so that has?  22.59 in district four.  Okay. So that has one district over 20%.  And what about the 2C?  Let's see, 2C is 22.37%.  All right. And that's in one district too.  And then the next one?  So I just want to verify this.  And it's actually district five is 21.97.  Okay. And then the previous page is not the voting  population.  That's just general population.  That's just population period.  Yes.  Okay.  All right. Yeah. That answers my question. Thank you.  All right. Further questions can help.  All right. I have 10 motion.  I have a comment slash statement.  I wrote it down.  I've been thinking about this a lot this week.  First, I want to say I'm not even a huge fan of districts,  but we were forced to go there a few years ago  and it is what it is.  And so tonight we have to vote on our final map.  Second, I want to say that this process has started,  since it started, I've been one of the biggest advocates  for more community engagement.  The city council began soliciting feedback  from the public on our new districts more than two months  ago at our February 1st meeting.  10 maps were submitted for consideration prior to the 14th,  deadline, but myself and others wanted more feedback  from the community.  So we extended the deadline to submit additional maps  or revisions until March 21st.  This gave the public a total of about 50 days  to submit their maps and proposals.  Through that time, 19 map concepts came in,  have been submitted, some by members of the public,  some by the city hired demographer.  Since February 1st, the city has also solicited feedback  from the public to divine communities of interest.  As we have learned from our demographer, minimizing communities  of interest in division is the top priority  of the Fair Maps Act.  In total, 14 communities of interest were identified.  In this process, they can be found on the city's website  as we were just there on the mapping tool.  I've taken the time to review them all.  Many of them are straightforward.  We don't have any issues with it.  Those including Barber, Neighborhood, Chapman Town,  California Park, Amber Grove, Merriam Park,  Highway 32, Pleasant Valley.  Those are all pretty easy, straightforward,  not many questions.  There's a couple of communities of interest  that are not so straightforward and where the band is.  They're not the same as the boundary lines should be.  There are disagreements on what the community interest  boundaries should look like for the avenues,  student housing population around Chico State.  There's a couple other communities of interest  I want to highlight.  First, the wildfire severity zone.  As I stated before, was the district I represent,  I believe it's important one to have the city council  made up of districts of residents that share  a fire concern for danger.  Essentially, people living in the northeastern  and southeastern portions of the city,  should be grouped together in the same district.  This would ensure these residents have a city council  member who make fire prevention a top priority.  Some of the visited maps took this into consideration.  However, some of them proposed only took in large parcels  at risk in fire danger that didn't actually include  residents living in the fire danger.  To me, this is a mistake.  It's the people living in these, not the land that matters.  Creating a district that cares most about the fire,  and cares most about fire danger is super important.  Yes, it may result in district lines that look funny,  but given our history with fire potential,  and for disaster, I think it's important this community  of interest may be made a priority.  The second community interest I want to highlight  is this severely disadvantaged area in South Chico.  The Vulnerability Assessment, and I have it right here,  the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment  of the City of Chico, not exactly a far right  conservative assessment.  It makes a case why Barber, Chapman, and Merriam Park  all belong in the same area.  Disadvantaged communities share a lot of the same challenges  and opportunities.  Several of the challenges and threats in these communities  have common outline in the city with the vulnerability assessment.  Additionally, I think people living in Barber, Yard,  Chapman Town, and Merriam Park share the same common social,  economic interests and should be kept together in the same district.  Two of the largest communities in the city,  the largest revitalization projects happening in Chico,  are located in Barber, Yard, and Merriam Park.  They're both being spearheaded by the same development group,  and many of the people are engaged in these projects,  care deeply about the future of Merriam Park and Barber.  In many ways, Merriam and Barber represent the future of Chico,  therefore should be represented by the same city council member  in order to ensure that these are well represented.  Finally, after reviewing the MAP proposals,  the communities of interest testimony,  deviations, the clear choice to me is MAP  6C.  It has the lowest population deviations of any map submitted.  It uses Highway 99 and Esplanade as identifiable boundary lines,  and most importantly, it does the best job of minimizing division  amongst the communities of interest that were identified.  I know this map isn't perfect.  None of the maps before us are tonight,  but I believe 6C to be the best options for the reasons I've stated.  Thank you.  Is that a motion?  I'd make a motion that we adopt MAP 6C.  So, were you going to say something?  I will second it, but I also want to say,  keeping equity, to quote the demographer, is nearly impossible.  The communities of interest are not clear.  Some people don't even know they live in a community or communities of interest.  I apparently live with my Amber Grove neighbors.  And to be very clear on both sides,  one person's partisanship is another person's  attempt at population equity, depending on who you talk to.  The demographer himself is a former Democratic Party operative,  which we made clear when we hired him.  So, we can throw those accusations back and forth all day.  We're not going to get to a good map.  We didn't have a good map last time, because District Dean is broken.  But we've got to come up with one.  I appreciate the work that the Vice Mayor has done.  I will second her motion.  All right. We have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk.  Okay.  There was a motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds,  seconded by Council Member Morgan,  to adopt the resolution and to adopt the ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico  to adjust the current City Council district boundaries  in accordance with Chico Municipal Code Section 1.30.250  and California Elections Code Section 21601,  and that would be map 6C that would be attached to the resolution.  Council Member?  I have an opportunity for comment after a motion and a second in discussion.  So, I have a motion.  I'd like to make some comments.  Go ahead.  I've gotten in trouble for making comments before my vote.  No. Go ahead.  I'm not surprised at all.  It's unfortunate.  I wrote in, I was just really trying to understand the logic behind this map.  It's not logical, and that's why I can't find it.  It breaks up Cana.  I wrote lip, lip, shelf, loop-de-loo, island, appendage.  These are the things that I can't find.  These are words that have been provided to us by members of the public  because they have eyes, and they can see this map,  and they can see that this map is not fair,  and they can see that this map does not contain compact districts,  and they can see that this map is not contiguous in their district,  and they can see that this map does not keep neighborhoods of interest  or improvement plans in that context.  I'm embarrassed, and I will absolutely vote no.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We ask that you not applaud at either comment.  Regardless, commenting or booing is not allowed in the Chamber.  Thank you.  Council Member Bennett?  No.  Council Member Brown?  Absolutely not.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 5-2.  All right.  We'll take a short recess.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  We're going to reconvene.  All right, a little before we start item 4.2,  I just kind of want to go over how these work.  So first we start with the ex parte communications,  then a staff report.  We have certain time restrictions too.  So staff report can take up to 15 minutes.  Madam Clerk, can you help me with the timing?  Then council discussion or questions is 10 minutes.  Open hearing for the public, no more than 50 minutes.  The applicant gets 15 minutes, additional speakers totaling 30.  And then a rebuttal from the applicant of three minutes,  and then we close the public hearing,  and then council discussion, motion, et cetera.  So we will start with item 4.2, Chico's best appeal hearing,  and start with announcement of ex parte communications.  So, Mr. Mayor, I...  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.  I apologize.  So I don't recall if they even had a name at the time,  but prior to my time on council and prior to my appointment  as the event of commander,  I did meet with one of the groups here in town  to discuss some security issues.  They asked my opinion on a few things,  so I did have a conversation with them,  and I wanted to disclose that in full transparency.  All right.  And, yes, I've had a brief conversation,  with the appellant,  only to the extent of knowing that the application was denied  and that an appeal was filed,  so no substantive information.  All right.  Anyone else?  We don't need to disclose them sending us an email  and answering back,  thanks for the email, you know, before the scene.  Okay.  Because I did that, but I don't know.  And we probably all got emails.  So, all right, we'll move on to the staff report.  I believe that's Ms. Dillig.  Ms. Dillig.  Dillig.  Dillig.  Yeah.  I do that, too, when I talk to Scott.  Sorry.  Okay, good evening.  I'm here to outline the cannabis application process  and highlight the appellant's challenges with the process.  The city contracted with HDL,  our consultant,  for the application process,  and this process was created by them.  Additionally, HDL helped provide subject matter expertise,  application review,  and helped facilitate the interview process.  Matt Eaton and David Ross of HDL are present  to answer any questions you may have  about the application process.  The cannabis application process  is broken into four different phases.  The city has gone through phases,  one and two,  and this is the appeals for phase two.  So, phase one,  you already heard the appeals on those.  It was the initial application screening  and the zoning done by city staff.  The screening just allowed for a general overview  to ensure that the application had, you know,  the major components, signed forms, that kind of thing.  And zoning was done for sensitive uses  and to ensure that business locations  were in the allowed zones.  So, phase two consisted of the application screening,  which consisted of two parts.  Phase 2A, the application scoring by our consultant, HDL.  The scoring was done in alignment  with the Chico Municipal Code  and with the application guidelines  that was provided to all of the applicants.  Phase 2B consisted of an interview  of the applicant by city staff.  So, there was fire prevention officer, Adam Young,  police captain, Billy Aldridge,  accounting manager, Catherine Mathis,  community development director, Brendan Veague,  and the city's mayor, !  I myself and HDL also attended the interview  to facilitate and provide their expertise,  but they did not score the interview.  The first item in Chico's best appeal,  and I have bolded it and put it in quotations  because it's coming directly from their appeal.  Obviously, it doesn't include everything in their appeal  because this would be a lot longer.  But the decision to deduct 10 points  from phase 2A score of item 1.3,  the daily operations for failure to identify  the proposed product line to be sold,  the application guidelines required extensive details  in the application and points were deducted  for failure by the applicant to identify the products.  All of the applicants that went through the scoring  of phase 2A that did not identify products  were deducted points.  Can I ask a quick question about that  just truly for clarity purposes?  Yeah, absolutely.  Is it like types of cannabis products being sold  or brands or all of the above?  Yeah, so kind of the same thing.  If I was going to own a shoe store  and you would want to know,  am I selling Adidas?  Am I selling Nike?  That kind of thing.  Oh, okay.  So brands specifically.  Okay, thank you.  Yep, specifically.  Okay, so the next one.  The second item for their appeal  was a decision to deduct eight points from phase 2A  for the score of their premises diagram  being too small in font, size, and blurriness.  There was an FAQ on the city website  that all applicants were directed to  and to keep apprised of.  And on that city website,  it stated that any diagrams should be legible  on that USB drive.  So they were deducted points accordingly.  Items three through six are an appeal  for Chico's Best for the scores they received  in both phase 2A and phase 2B.  So phase 2A scores were done by HDL,  as I previously just said.  And phase 2B scores were scoring done by city staff.  It was the interview panel that reviewed them.  They reviewed the materials,  they listened to the interview,  and they scored accordingly.  So applicants were given the detailed guidelines  and the above scoring mechanism  for how they would be scored.  So you can see the criteria for phase 2A  and the points  and then also the criteria for phase 2B.  The scoring rubric that the city used  that was provided by HDL,  you can see here what was considered  an exceptional answer,  what was considered a good answer,  and what was acceptable.  And that's it for Chico's Best.  I don't know if you have any questions.  And then again,  HDL is here to answer any questions  you might have as well.  Question?  This question may be for HDL,  and it kind of applies across the board.  With so much of the conversation  about prioritizing local ownership,  did that play into any of the scoring rubric  or conversation in the interview process?  So part of the reason I'm saying something about that  is because I think it's important.  I think it's important to have a good understanding  of what you said about brands,  is that if it's a new business,  which if somebody's local here  and starting a new business,  they're not going to know,  it doesn't seem like they would know  what brands they would carry.  Like existing businesses would know  because they probably have,  I don't know,  I'm speaking from a very naive place right now,  existing relationships with distributors or brands.  Can you speak to that?  I'm just trying to understand.  I'm going to let you speak to that, Matt.  So with regards to the business plan,  as you saw in the last slide,  there are multiple areas within the category.  In the business plan, there is an element,  and then there are several sub-elements.  One of the elements is identifying  the proposed product line.  That is designed for the business plan  to be able to provide a good understanding  that is designed for the applicant  to give to you, the licensing body,  an idea of the type of products.  And oftentimes it was broken down into categories  like flour, edibles, concentrates,  things like that.  And then what we want to be able to see  is that the business plan is well thought out  and that they understand the types of products  that they're going to have,  and the percentage of breakdown within that.  A person that did not provide that area  or that level of detail did not get a zero.  They just did not get the maximum amount  of points available for that section.  So if I'm understanding correctly,  they're outlining the various percentages  that each of these different product types,  from flour to edibles, et cetera,  and there's another layer of where they're sourcing those from?  That's part of it as well.  The brand.  Okay, thank you.  Just for clarification for the public,  can you describe who you guys are as HDL,  your experience, how long you've been doing what you're doing,  and just a brief so everybody else knows.  Yeah, thank you.  My name's Matthew Eaton.  I'm the deputy director of compliance for HDL Companies.  HDL Companies has been in business approximately 40 years.  They started with a company  that was doing government tax analysis projections  for municipal agencies.  We have a variety of different services over the years,  tax, TOT tax, property tax, sales tax,  and approximately six years ago,  we started a cannabis division that did projections  and analytics for possible tax revenues.  We have a variety of different services  for state, I mean, I'm sorry, county and local agencies.  Within that, as our services expanded,  we conduct application reviews, we write ordinances,  we try to assist our clients.  We have approximately 175 city and county clients  that we provide a variety of different services for  within the cannabis arena.  That would include the application review process,  and then compliance and audit.  During the last six years,  we've been involved in approximately  6,000 application reviews.  We have a staff of 22 people that do the compliance and audit.  And within that, we've done somewhere between  500 and 600 interviews to assist our clients  in the vetting process for licensing.  All right, further questions?  Any other questions from council?  No?  All right, thank you very much.  All right, now,  so we will go ahead and know  for another council discussion,  so we'll go ahead and-  I'm sorry, I have one more question.  Actually, my question didn't get answered,  and it was in the conversations  with the Cannabis Citizens Advisory Committee,  there was a desire to, in whatever ways possible,  prioritize local ownership of businesses.  Was that-I didn't see that in our process.  Was that considered-was that discussed in the-in the-in either phase?  It wasn't in the guidelines,  and it wasn't in the code to give that preference to-  Yeah, from the podium,  or they won't be able to hear you.  Thank you, thank you.  Sorry about that.  Thank you.  It was not in the guidelines,  nor was it in the code to give preference to local-locals.  I mean, of course, we'd love to see locals,  but it was not part of the application process.  Thank you.  Yep.  All right, so we'll open the public hearing.  And how many speakers?  I don't have any at this time.  All right.  So would the applicant like to come forward  and speak on this?  And if you don't mind running me a timer.  And that would be 15 minutes, correct?  Yes, ma'am.  Okay.  Hi.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Thanks for taking the time to see us today.  We will not try to use up all 15 minutes that we're given,  but I am glad to not have to rush through  and speak like I'm on the radio  during a 30-second sweep.  We are Chico's Best.  We are the representing owners that are here.  We're a body of six people with 85% local ownership.  We're missing three.  Gold medalist Ruthie Bolton,  who we brought onto our team to represent social equity divisions,  is in Arkansas with March Madness,  so we're rooting for her.  And then my wife, who's a part owner,  is home with my kids.  Charles' wife's home with his kids.  That would be the whole body of who we are,  the six of us that are Chico's Best.  I'd like to start by saying I have no disdain for the decision.  I'm incredibly impressed with this process so far.  I commend Angie.  She's done an incredible job.  HDL did an incredible job.  Everybody involved in this process has, I think,  gone above and beyond.  The six items that we put in our report seem like a lot.  Four of these points, though, we only added to our report  because they aren't really contesting our score.  They were contesting the process  on behalf of all of the applicants.  As a former medical cannabis advocate,  I was a cannabis delivery service  who operated compliantly in Chico  until the city council asked us to shut our doors.  With the passage of Prop 64, we stopped.  We were all a very unified cannabis community.  Not a lot of backstabbing and going around each other.  We met together frequently to talk about shady characters in town,  people who were using fake IDs, all this type of thing.  So I've formed, we've all formed,  some very good alliances in this town.  We were all pretty excited about compliant cannabis  and licensed cannabis and getting to come forward  and be the locals who will open the shops  instead of many of these out of town.  Companies that might just be franchising.  Now I've asked a lot of the other applicants,  are you going to appeal?  And they said, I can't afford it.  I can't afford the appeal and I don't even know what I'm appealing  because the second half of our score wasn't explained.  And that's what four of the points that you saw  at the end of the screen were.  It wasn't that we don't agree with our score.  Maybe we do deserve that score.  But there was no explanation of the score.  There was no criteria.  I know, like, I'm pretty sure Sean's a professor at a university,  so some of you have graded tests,  usually tell the person why they failed,  what was misspelled, what was wrong,  and then you have the opportunity to come and present an appeal.  Unfortunately, we didn't have that opportunity in the second half.  It was just kind of like a diving scorecard lifted up.  You get an eight.  Okay, not exactly sure why.  I think that could have been a little bit more transparent.  But again, our score might be well deserved.  So we're not really here to contest that score.  It is puzzling to us, though, that we did get a 68%  in our neighborhood compatibility,  which according to the scoring rubric that Angie put on the screen,  is not even on one of those top three tiers.  It's not excellent, it's not good, and it's not even acceptable.  It's below acceptable.  And we thought we did a really fantastic job in the interview.  So we're a little puzzled.  But again, perhaps we deserve the score.  We just don't know why we got it.  So we don't really have a chance to present a fair defense.  So those four first points, that represents the entire community.  I believe everyone should have had a little bit more clarity on the second half.  The first half, HDL did an incredible job detailing every single point.  You lost five points for this.  You lost six points for that.  You lost ten points for this.  That was really easy to understand and a great asset to us coming here today.  In fact, we found there to be an error there.  We found there to be a point where they said you lose five points  because you went over your page count.  We didn't go over our page count.  We're sticklers for instructions.  We've been studying this.  You've seen my face.  Some of you have been the city council for three mayorhoods,  and you know we've been at this, and we did not want to fail.  So we didn't go over page count.  We brought that up to Angie.  She brought it back up to Flagpole and said,  oh, you're right.  You didn't go over your page count.  Here's your five points back.  That left us with a deduction in two other areas,  and those are the two you heard us defend.  The first of which is the resolution of our floor plan and our security plan.  When this security plan was given to us,  it was by a Sacramento sheriff, former Sacramento sheriff,  who we hired to do our security plan.  He did an excellent job.  He got a perfect score on the security plan,  except the resolution was blurry.  And that is because the version he gave us was perfect.  As we compressed it into a PDF, we had some compression loss.  We've all been guilty of that.  If that's our bad and we accept those eight points,  we are deducted.  And at this point, I'd like to point out we were six points from the top ten.  We're not here to fight a hard battle.  If we were 15th place, take one on the chin.  But we were six points from being able to continue to the next round,  and we lost eight points for this resolution.  Now, this is also a clickable image that expands,  and you can see it in full resolution.  But maybe we should have put it in a different place.  We should have put a better eye on making sure that this particular copy  of the floor plan was more clear.  I'd like to fight that, but at the end of the day, it's debatable.  I'll admit that.  It might be a weakness in our application.  Now, all the things I said above are sort of irrelevant  compared to the product line question.  I'm glad Alex asked a few questions about that.  Because I believe HDL's intention to have us identify some brands is a great question.  As I mentioned, we're a compliant delivery service.  We've made a whole bunch of great connections with a lot of brands.  But I'd like to, again, read the information.  I'd like to read the exact instructions.  We have the time and provide you with our answer.  And I'm not trying to sound smug,  but I think it's a slam dunk that we answered the question properly.  Even Alex had to confirm, were you looking for brands?  We didn't have the chance to ask that question.  So we did not know we were supposed to include brands.  We were asked, verbatim, and it's in your staff report,  describe the proposed product line to be sold  and estimate the percentage of sales of flour  and manufactured products.  Maybe they intended to say, please include some example brands.  And we would have done it.  Again, we lost no other points in the first half of this round.  So of course we would have done it.  I don't know if I'm allowed to disperse anything to the council?  You can hand it to us.  These right here are the pages out of our application  that explain our exact word for word of what our product line we proposed.  Would you mind moving over to the microphone?  It's in the podium.  This is the exact pages from our application  that describe our product line,  how we thought it was supposed to be verbatim out of the question.  So, sorry, I was explaining what you passed out.  This is out of page 42 and 43 of our application.  Again, in the answer to the question that I just phrased,  and it's short enough to say it again,  describe the proposed product line to be sold  and estimate the percentage of sales of flour and manufactured products.  Our answer in the section titled,  Proposed Product Line and Percentage of Sales,  says, Chico's Best will initially offer a product line  based on both our personal direct experience  in operating a medical cannabis delivery enterprise  and our ongoing research of the California market.  There's a graphic accompanying that you'll see below that.  Specific product types will range from flour, pre-rolls,  edibles, tinctures, concentrates, topicals, and extracts.  This answered the first half of the question.  We anticipate that the percentage of sales of flour  will make up 36% of our sales,  and manufactured products will make up 64% of our sales.  This answered the second half of the question.  There's an accompanying graphic.  On the next page, we conclude in saying,  Over the course of our past experience in the cannabis market,  we've established relationships with licensed supply chain operators.  If you'd like us to right now, we could list you at least 15 great brands.  With strong reputations for providing safe products,  and we intend to reinitiate contracts with them,  as well as, and this is important to us,  newly emerged distributors once we've been licensed,  which could be a year or two years after this document was written.  Lori could speak a little bit on why we wouldn't have specified brands?  Yeah, we didn't specify because it wasn't requested.  Because we're a local company,  and we're not affiliated with a national brand or a national company,  that leaves us very nimble.  We can have high standards of care.  We can also be nimble  and change brands if we want.  For instance, if we selected a brand today,  it may not be the same brand we would select when we open the doors.  There could be quality control.  I, by the way, I'm Lori Bluett.  I'm sorry.  I own and operate a jazz club,  but several restaurants and bars.  And so often in that business,  you may start with one brand  and find out that they're not providing you adequate educational material,  or they're not interacting well with your staff and training your staff.  They also may not have the ability  to supply all of the products you need  because they have a shortage of supply.  Given COVID, there's lots of shortages of supplies.  So their quality control may go down.  Their ethical and social practices may go down.  We can choose between BIPOC, minority-owned businesses,  women-owned businesses, local businesses.  It appears Sierra Nevada just took out a license to manufacture.  That didn't even exist when we did our application.  So we just wanted to stay nimble,  be able to hire and fire brands  so that we always have the best brands.  The best products that are out there and available  and according to what our customers need.  Yeah, I want to expand on what Lori said about local preference  because we have been in a process right now  to issue licenses to local distributors and manufacturers.  And obviously, if the intention is to stay local,  we're going to wait and find out what those brands are  before we select any brands.  But none of that really matters as much as the fact...  One more point I had is when we talked about brands,  it kind of begs the question,  if we were to specify the brands  and then six months down the road realize  that that brand had an economic problem,  perhaps they're about to file bankruptcy,  and we're concerned,  then it also begs the question to report  that we're changing one brand.  You know, if you go from Coca-Cola to Pepsi,  is that something, since it would have been in the application,  is that something that then is reportable  or there's an obligation to police it?  And Chuck, you mentioned something about Stizzy,  a brand we used to carry.  Some of the brands that we've been looking into  and some of our friends and things  have had legal problems over the years.  So some of the brands that we've been looking into,  some of the people we might have put in our application  might at this point not exist.  So, you know, we did not want to associate ourselves  with the brand,  such as if somebody came down here and put cookies,  that might not be a brand  that we would like to be associated with.  We're looking for brands that came from friends,  that came from wholesome places.  We were not looking for the big names and the bad names  and the people that were known.  We wanted to not identify ourselves with anybody.  We were looking to come as our own team  and as our own people  and not be associated with any brands.  So we could talk to our blue line,  put them in the face about why we didn't add brands,  but the most important point of our appeal  is that it wasn't asked.  It was not asked to please identify example brands.  Again, you guys in the council had to clarify that question.  Now, I think HDL might have intended that  to be in the instructions by what they just said,  but it didn't make it to us.  If it made it to us, I guarantee you on my family,  it would have been in our application.  Why does that matter?  We lost 10 points for that.  You give us back those 10 points,  we are in the top 10 and we deserve to move forward.  I asked Angie if that happens,  do we bump the 10th guy out?  Like, how does that work?  She says, no, you would just be additionally accepted  in the next round, it would be 11.  So that's good because we're not here to step  on anybody else's party.  We just believe, based on what I presented to you today,  that there's no reason we shouldn't have been  in that top 10 selection.  If we had the 10 points that were incorrectly deducted  from our application, we should be in the top 10.  Pardon?  You spoke to Mr. .  Mr. who?  You spoke to someone who said  that he'd have to have it for everyone.  Oh, that's correct, yes.  So thank you for bringing that to my attention.  Mark Orme did reply to me before he ceased to be working  for this city when I brought this up,  because I've been in many communications with Angie  and with Mark asking questions, trying to understand the process.  Mark Orme told me, well, just so you know, everyone,  not just you, everyone who didn't include brands  was docked that 10 points.  Okay, give everybody back the 10 points.  We're 11th place, that's going to make a difference for us.  It might not make a difference for everyone else.  But in fairness, sure, give everyone back the 10 points  that were incorrectly deducted for failing to include brands  that weren't listed.  If you ask me what's in my fridge and I told you  I have milk, mayonnaise, and ketchup,  I wouldn't know anymore.  I would have wanted to know it was Heinz  and all these other brands unless you told me to do that.  So I don't want to be overly redundant,  but that's where we feel we deserve our appeal.  Any questions?  All right, thank you.  Okay, do we have additional speakers?  No.  All right, no additional speakers.  Rebuttal to nothing.  If there were additional speakers,  you could read that at this point.  All right, so we will close the public hearing.  Thank you.  All right, council discussion.  I'm just curious on, it wasn't addressed at all,  but the neighborhood compatibility,  it seemed like there was a pretty big deduction.  Does that have, can staff speak to that?  So the deductions on neighborhood compatibility,  the panel would have listened to the interview  and they would have scored based on  what was in their compatibility plan  and if they felt that it should be scored higher or lower  based on how the applicant had responded to the questions  and then also what was in their application.  So we don't get to know why?  There's not a report for it, no.  It was just, there was a panel,  it was all management for the city,  and they responded accordingly.  They listened to the interview,  they reviewed the materials,  and they scored accordingly.  So if they felt that their neighborhood compatibility plan  was lacking in certain areas,  they would have docked them lower.  And they would have used the scoring rubric  that I showed earlier.  It makes this job difficult.  I'm really glad it's been pretty removed from council  up until this point,  but it makes the final decision,  especially given some of these really fine points,  literal points.  Difficult.  But I understand.  Thanks.  Mm-hmm.  Any more questions?  Discussion?  So the focus was on,  I'm sorry,  I'm trying to really understand this,  and I really want to give you guys a fair shot,  and I want to,  before I vote on this.  So on,  I'm going back to the neighborhood compatibility.  You lost almost 100 points on that.  So is that,  because there was 100 points there,  the 10 points is what they're worried about here,  but had that had been a lot higher,  would that have offset that 10 points,  or is that two completely different?  Am I asking that the right way?  Does that make sense?  Yeah, it does make sense.  So yes, that would have made a difference.  The points were put together for phase 2A and phase 2B,  and then all of the points were tallied  wherever they fell.  So they fell in number 11.  So if they had gotten more points, yes,  they would have lost.  So they moved up.  Gotcha.  And to follow up on that,  the 10 points,  the eight points,  had they received the 10 points  and the eight points that are being contested,  would they have been in the top 10?  Yes.  Okay.  Wait, I have a question.  Do you want to explain?  Matt can explain some more.  The three of you don't mind just staying up there?  That would be great.  So Matt,  if you wouldn't,  and this you might want to include in there.  So I appreciate what everybody's saying.  We can say,  well, here's this appellant.  They just had 10 more points that have made the top 10,  but whoever's in the 10th spot that didn't have to appeal  could also be standing there going,  wait a minute,  if I just had points over this,  I would have been nine.  And this is just a broad statement.  We either got to trust the people from HDL that did it  or we're not.  Because every single applicant can be a peer argument appoint,  including the top 10,  if anybody were to get moved out.  I appreciate no one's going to get moved out,  but they don't even have to explain themselves.  Is that not true?  May I explain the actual point and scoring?  Yeah.  I think that's an interesting point.  I think that's an interesting process to help kind of understand.  So the criteria,  there were multiple criteria is within the score category.  There are a business plan,  labor and local enterprise plan,  neighborhood compatibility plan and community benefits and investment plan.  Within that,  during the interview,  there were 11 questions.  There were five Raiders.  Those five Raiders entered scores for,  each one of those categories.  We had 45 minutes of interview and time and questions were asked.  The applicant was provided an opportunity to provide a response.  And if the staff was expected to write a report or to provide detail analysis,  they would not be able to hear the response and adequately assess the  completeness and thoroughness of the scoring.  So each panel,  all five individuals had four scores to enter at the conclusion of each category.  So you ask the business plan had four questions.  The four questions were asked.  The applicant was provided an opportunity to respond to each one of those four questions.  At the conclusion of that,  a score was entered and then we moved on.  To the next section.  We did that 24 times.  Was each point,  was each question worth a certain number of points?  No, the entire response for that section was scored.  Okay, thank you.  So the scoring was based off of their response to completeness,  adherence to state and local law,  adherence to the ordinance following the application process and the procedures.  The procedures guidelines outlined all of the criteria that was required and no question was asked beyond what exactly was asked for and published in that procedures guidelines.  So the scores at the end were a total of all five individuals,  all five panelists entering a score for each one of the categories being evaluated.  Follow up question.  Was product line a part of any of those evaluations?  Product line was.  Where's the recording?  Oh, I'm sorry.  So product line was evaluated and scored in the application review,  was not a component of the interview.  Okay, just clarifying.  Thank you.  I have a follow up question.  Is this the same process you've used in all the other cities you've done this?  We have done application processes for about seven years.  We do our own process or a proposed process that meets the needs of our client.  This is one of those.  We also do other application processes as designed by our client.  So we don't do this 100%, but this is an HDL proven process.  Thank you.  All right.  Further questions, discussion?  Follow the council.  Entertain a motion.  Just so we don't sit here all night and then someone can make a substitute motion if they want.  I will follow the recommendation of staff to deny the appeal.  All right.  Motion from Council Member Morgan.  I'll second it.  Second from Council Member O'Brien.  Madam Clerk, take the roll.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  Council Member Bennett.  So my question is, yes, a yes, a yes, and a no, a no.  A yes would be the adoption of a resolution that would deny the appeal by upholding staff's recommendation.  And I vote no.  Okay.  Council Member Brown.  On the basis of transparency in the process, no.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  No.  Mayor Coolidge.  Yes.  Carries 4-3.  All right.  So moving on to the next one, which is going to happen in the same way.  So again, I would ask the Clerk to help us out with the time.  Item 4.3.  And we will welcome Ms. Dillig back.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  You need to get...  I'm sorry. .     .  .   Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank  Thank  Thank  Thank  Thank  Thank  Thank  Thank  of Chico's decision to deny a submittal of a letter with attachments dated July 26, 2021,  in favor of TMG Chico. The applicant requested to submit materials after the application period  closed. Per the application guidelines, it stated that no supplements could be submitted after the  application period closed. The applicants were responsible for full review of their application  to ensure they have everything in the application submitted properly. Since the period closed on the  16th of July and the letter was sent on the 26th of July, the city denied receiving any additional  documentation from TMG. The second item is the matter of the missing evaluation process scoring  rubric, that they're appealing the absence of an effective and objective evaluation process scoring  rubric from the city's application procedures guideline. We've already gone through this. This  is the rubric that the city used along with this scoring rubric.  You see here. Item three for TMG was the matter of phase 2A scores. They found that the  designee HDL, their scoring was inconsistent, capricious, and unjustifiable. The phase 2A  scores were done by HDL in accordance with the application guidelines and the Chico municipal  code. The fourth item of appeal for TMG was for the phase 2B scores issued.  Again, they felt they were inconsistent, capricious, and unjustifiable.  The phase 2B score was done by the city panel. They reviewed the materials. They listened  to the applicant's answers and scored accordingly. I think Matt did a great job just explaining  that process.  The fifth and final item for TMG's appeal was the Professional Services Agreement with  the city of Chico.  TMG is appealing the legitimacy, the authenticity,  and the transparency  of the Professional  Services  Agreement  committee  committee  professional services agreement with HDL was done in accordance to the  municipal code and the budget policies for the city.  Any questions?  All right. Questions or discussion by council?  Okay.  All right. We will open the public hearing.  Any speakers on this item? We do, and I don't know  if they're actually the... Okay. So we'll start with the applicant first, and then  speakers. So does the applicant want to come forward with 15 minutes?  Madam Clerk, if you could put up the timer. I will. Yes.  Welcome.  Good evening, Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor,  Council, and staff. My name is Max Del Real.  I am the president and  CEO of TMG Chico LLC. It's an honor to be in front of you tonight.  As a 25-year resident of Chico, California,  this is my hometown. I appreciate your work, even when it's difficult,  and I appreciate the opportunity to address you tonight.  This has been a long time coming. In fact,  the first time I was in front of you on the issue of medical cannabis was 2010.  You see, I've spent the last 15 years working as a  cannabis business consultant.  I am recognized by the California legislature and the California Superior Courts as a cannabis  expert in the work that I do, and I've actually worked with multiple cities and counties throughout  California, specifically law enforcement communities, creating local regulations of  cannabis businesses. I was involved with Prop 64, which was a legalization effort for adult  use cannabis in 2016, which went into effect in 2018, and it's the reason we're sitting here.  I was very proud and honored to be a part of Councilmember Brown's work in 2019 when we had the  dozen community-held meetings over the summer, the hot summer at the Old City Hall building.  Let me just say that HDL was not present at any of those meetings.  What I'm going to ask you tonight to think about is what is best for Chico, California,  because tonight I am here representing my hometown.  I'm wearing the  silly red jacket and sweating a little bit only because I've worn this jacket proudly for the last  eight years. My children were born and raised in Chico. They went to Chico public schools,  and they were on various sports teams at Chico High and Go Big Red.  I have, for eight years, traveled the state of California cheering on Chico and its community,  representing and supporting our kids, our kids and our community, and I'm very proud of that.  And I'm here tonight asking you to consider voting for something that is very Chico-esque,  not cannabis, not marijuana. We're not voting on marijuana. Marijuana has always already been  passed. Whether you like it or not, like wine and tobacco and beer, it's here and it's here to stay.  In fact, I'm not even a user myself. I like a glass of...  wine at dinner. With that being said, though, I'm asking you to think about my application,  my team's application, and a team that I built with all Chico representatives. Let me read their  names. My team includes Craig Pikes, the celebrated architect here in Chico who's been in business for  over 30 years. My safety consultant was Mike Lopez, is Mike Lopez, who was a 30-year Cal Fire veteran  and a battalion chief. He currently...  is number two firefighter in the California Firefighters Association in Sacramento as the  largest firefighters association. My security consultant was a 15-year police officer with the  City of Chico, Gary Caldwell. Kelly Love, Craig Rigsby, and Nathan Reinhardt on my advisory board,  and the local attorney, Steve Ramazzini, is our attorney. I submitted a 200-page application at  the cost of $10,000.  I submitted a 75-page appeal that cost nearly $5,000. As a businessman, of which I am an  entrepreneur, I'm asking Chico to give me the opportunity to create a new business. I find it  insane that we are saying no to potential businesses in Chico considering the climate, the  economic climate in California today. I am here today to say thank you to all of you who have been  engaged  in this committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee  committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee  committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee . .   committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee  committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee  committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee  committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee committee  business plans on employing 30 retail jobs that would pay a living wage and  offer full health benefits to our employees. But beyond that I'd like to  start by stating a couple of facts. There are two municipalities or communities  that have either engaged or are engaging this same issue today in the North State.  One is Redding, California and one is Red Bluff. Two years ago Redding had an  application process very similar. They did not hire HDL. They had a local  selection committee that essentially focused on local applicants. They issued  six retail permits that are active and open today. I'm proud to say that there  have been no safety issues.  Or security issues with those businesses operating the last two years in the North State.  The city of Red Bluff currently has an application process. They did not hire  HDL and they have created a local selection committee as well. Fact number  two of the ten applicants currently moving forward to phase three, eight are  from Southern California and only two can  claim local connections. And finally fact number three, and if you don't  believe me Google it, HDL is currently being sued and or has been fired in the  city of Fairfield, the city of Fresno and the city of Placerville. I'm here  today to ask you to support a very Chico project.  And allow my team to move forward to phase three. With that said I'm turning to  argument one. I'm not going to read this to you. I will simply give you a quick  overview of the facts. In any business application that the city of Chico  collects, whether it's for a parking garage, a pizzeria, a bar, restaurant, if  something is missing from that application there is something called  harmless air and curable errors. If you are not aware of that, please contact me at the address on the screen. I will be happy to help you. Thank you.  That applicant can submit material after the fact. In fact the city of Chico  recognizes curable errors in its guidelines. My team did miss the  opportunity to submit two documents. Those documents, both of which are a  security plan or a security diagram rather and a safety diagram, are on the  next pages in your packet.  And that was submitted to the city of Chico. With that being said, we were docked  significant points because we did not have those diagrams in our initial  application. Argument number two. The matter of the missing evaluation process  scoring rubric. In every city where  HFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF  are. There was no scoring rubric provided  to applicants. There was no direction given to  the amount of points that were allotted or going to be given by the scorers.  In fact, what we saw today is made after  the fact, I believe.  There was no scoring rubric provided  and in my opinion, because of that, my team should have  received full scores in the sections  wherein we submitted all material.  Argument three.  There is a breakdown here of points.  Of the three owners,  we were docked  16 points because one of our resumes is 1.5  points.  1.5 pages instead of one page.  In a 200-page application, my team lost 16 points,  which is a lot of points, because one of my  partners has done a lot of work.  Nowhere in any rubric  or guideline did it say you would be docked points if you turned in a resume  at 1.5 pages. We're asking for those points  back.  We believe we deserve 100 out of 100 for section 1-1.  In section 1-2, we received 82 out of 100  for proof of capital.  In fact, my team submitted two  financial packages showing over  $7 million available to our project,  and yet, we received 82 out of 100 points for section 2-3.  section 1-2. For section 3-2, the safety plan, written by a former Cal Firefighter and Battalion  Chief, we received 75 out of 150 points because we turned in one page of diagram late.  For a security plan that was written by a former Chico police officer,  we received zero out of 90. Zero points out of 90. Even though my security plan is endorsed by  Security, Eagle Security of Chico, and Private Security Forces of Chico.  Two local security companies. Zero out of 90. We believe we should receive  90 out of 90 for section 4.  I have included here the point breakdown for you. Notice that these comments from HDL  are not provided in phase 2b. There are no comments, and you'll see this in a second,  there are no score sheets, no record of any scores for phase 2b. I don't believe in conspiracies,  but if I did,  I would think there might be one here.  Argument 4.  The interview was conducted by HDL.  The five,  at least for our interview, the five city members did not say anything.  They had no questions.  And it looked like they were taking notes on the  Zoom call.  When I asked the city for record,  a living proof of phase 2b scores,  here's what was said. Fourth bullet.  Mr. Del Real, there are no notes, comments, or any other records regarding phase 2b.  That's a quote from the city of Chico.  And that quote, that email,  is in my 75-page appeal.  What we received was a random percentage,  77.96,  with no justification,  and no credentials and no comments.  If you were a teacher and you did that, you would be fired.  You'd be run out of town.  At an elementary school,  middle school,  high school,  Chico State.  It's unacceptable.  There are no score sheets for phase 2b.  We believe we deserve 1,600 out of 1,600 points for phase 2b.  And finally, and I appreciate your time,  we spent many years,  many years,  trying to get to this point.  There are people in our community that need medical cannabis.  There are people in our community that are going to Redding and Red Bluff and Sacramento,  taking their dollars and spending them elsewhere  because we don't have retail cannabis dispensaries.  With that said,  there was no talk of HDL contract  during the summer  of our exploration of this topic.  In fact,  it's not just about the !  According to my research,  and what I found online,  is that the HDL contract was signed  two days before the new year in 2019 when City Hall was closed.  And I have no record,  and I cannot find any record,  that this contract was put out to bid  to other cannabis consultants.  And if that's the case,  the HDL contract is a farce.  In closing,  I ask that my team be awarded  full points for our application,  which we stand by,  and that we are allowed to move forward  to phase three.  Thank you.  All right, additional speakers?  We have two.  The first one is our  Allison Rayo-Ramos,  followed by Jessica Giannola.  All right, and how do we do the time on this?  Three minutes for the additional speakers.  All right, so up to our limited.  Go ahead, please.  All right.  Good evening, Mayor and Council.  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity  to speak this evening.  I'm Allison Rayo-Ramos,  and I am here today to support  Mr. Del Riel and TMG Project.  I have worked with Maxine,  Max Del Riel,  for about 10 years  on special industry projects.  I have also been in the cannabis industry  for about 10 years plus.  With this project,  I have been offered a position  as a store manager  with full health benefits included.  In addition, as Mr. Del Riel has mentioned,  we would be creating 30 new local job opportunities.  So we are asking you today  to let us proceed to phase three  with this project.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola is our last speaker.  Council, gosh,  I remember the last time  that we've had people up here  asking about their cannabis business  that they want to have here.  And there's a reoccurring theme,  and I've heard it expressed time and time again.  There's been unclear rules set for them to follow,  and then they're essentially penalized  for something they could not get clarity  despite how hard they asked the city for that clarity.  And that accountability really needs to stop with the city.  And not punishing the business owners  that would like to run a business in our city  for our residents.  So I think that when we're,  when our city management is proceeding like this,  what kind of faith do we have as potentials  or existing business owners out here  have in you in a process  that we're expecting to be fair and clear?  And then I'm just seeing denials,  appeal, denial, denial, denial.  It's like there's no faith in any of this process.  It's just how are you awarding these,  any of this?  So I just think that really,  these people have gone through a lot just to appeal.  And how, what is it hurting to add them into the 10?  They're proving their point.  They're proving their argument,  but they're still being denied.  And I think let's have some fairness here  and allow them to at least participate moving forward.  And,  and change however this happened with the next topic.  There's gonna be more topics down the road  and more processes and just be clear with people.  Thank you.  Jessica was our last speaker.  All right.  Would the applicant like to come forward  and use some three minutes to respond to the comments?  Yes, Mr. Mayor,  Vice Mayor, staff, council.  Thank you again for the opportunity to present to you.  There are significant facts at your disposal tonight.  What I would ask is that you put aside your individual opinion  about marijuana or cannabis.  Tonight is not about marijuana or cannabis.  In my opinion, tonight is about David versus Goliath.  HDL versus TMG Chico LLC.  If we had a fully Chico selection committee,  I guarantee I would not be sitting, standing here today.  My team would have been celebrated.  We would be moving forward.  We would be looking forward to phase three.  Phase three, by the way, is an interview  and a presentation in front of the city manager.  In fact, I would argue that there, to date,  there's been no instance where a Chico staff member,  elected official,  or someone that actually cares about Chico,  is invested in Chico,  has actually seen my full application.  It hasn't happened yet.  If you brought the HDL folks up here,  and let me be honest with you,  HDL is a big, major corporation.  I've been walking around with a bumper or a pen that says,  shop local.  Right? Get outside the big box.  Because I love Chico and we care about Chico.  But if you brought HDL to the podium and asked them,  where is Lower Park?  Where's Bearhole?  Right? Where's Schubert's Ice Cream?  Right? Name three beers on tap at Sierra Nevada.  They couldn't do it.  They care about the money.  And I question, openly question,  their position.  Their professionalism, number one,  because there are missing score sheets.  So that's an issue.  But number two, I question, openly question,  their commitment to Chico.  Eight of the ten groups moving forward  are from Southern California.  A simple Google search will show you this.  I don't know how you say no to a team that includes  local people,  that are here raising their family,  riding their bikes with you,  and one mile,  raising kids with you,  owning businesses with you,  trying to deal with all the issues that we have.  My team is committed to Chico.  We're proud of that. I love Chico.  I'm wearing my jacket tonight.  Tonight is not about marijuana.  It's not about cannabis. It's not about weed.  It's about Chico.  And you have an opportunity tonight to allow a very Chico team,  and you got emails from all my team already today  and yesterday,  to allow a very Chico team to move forward to phase three.  That's all we ask. Thank you.  All right. Thank you.  Close the public hearing.  Council discussion.  I have a quick question.  I think I'm getting a little stuck.  I mean, obviously this has come up twice.  With the second round,  the second phase not having any outline of the scores.  Like, I'm not understanding the logic  of somebody not being able to see how their scores broke down  at the end of that process.  Can somebody speak to that?  It may or may not change anything,  but it's an issue of transparency,  so I'd love to hear from you.  The application process  with regards to the interview,  the interview phase was not designed  to have subtotals.  They were scored,  the total number of points was outlined  in the procedures guidelines.  I apologize.  I don't remember the exact number.  So in the procedures guidelines that was posted,  the interview phase 2B says  the business plan will be worth 600 points.  The labor and local enterprise is 300 points.  The neighborhood compatibility is 300 points.  And community benefits and investment is 400 points.  So the responses that they provided,  it's very hard to compare apples to apples  with regards to the variety of different businesses,  the different business models, the sizes.  So the goal and the objection was to ask  open-ended questions for the applicant  to provide clear and unambiguous detail  with regards to the detail and criteria  that was provided in their application.  The interview, I'm sorry,  the interview was conducted by an HDL staff member  who only read the question.  The question was asked.  It was opened up to the applicant to respond,  and then the five panelists,  the three panelists were tasked with listening  to those responses, entering responses into the computer,  and asking any follow-up questions  that were deemed appropriate or needed at the time.  Thank you.  If there were no additional questions.  Those, the way the program was designed  is to enter all of those data points,  and I do the math, but there's 24 different applicants.  There were four different applicants  and there were five different criteria  by five different people.  I think it's something like in the area  of 194 different data points that were entered  and processed in a matter of those interviews.  So the sub scores were not provided.  The program calculated out and provided a total score  for each one of the applicants which was provided to the city.  Why is that?  Can you explain it?  It was consistent with how you,  the city conducts their RFP process.  So everybody submits a score anonymously,  no score breakdown, but it's been put into a system  that averages out the total scores  and gives you the ultimate number  that you shared with the applicants?  That we shared with the client, the city.  And we in turn shared it with the applicants.  Okay.  All right, thank you.  I have a question.  Go ahead.  Captain Interim Chief Aldridge,  were you part of these interviews?  Yes, I was.  How's your commitment to Chico?  100%.  Thank you.  All right, any other questions?  All right, thank you very much.  Will the council?  I'll make the same motion I made before,  approving the resolution of the city council  to deny the appeal.  I'll make the same, second.  All right, we have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll  for a resolution of the city council,  the city of Chico denying an appeal by Chico's,  no.  You don't have to read the title.  Wrong page, for the disqualification of TMG Chico's LLC's commercial cannabis  permit application.  Council Member Bennett?  No.  Council Member Brown?  Abstain.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  No.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 4-2 with one abstention.  All right.  So we're moving on towards the next item.  The third and final.  All right.  So we'll start with the, again,  announcement of ex parte communications.  In regards to Chico 580 LLC.  Any?  All right.  Seeing none.  Staff report?  Ms. Do?  Mrs. Do?  Sorry.  That's always going to be a struggle.  So I will skip through stuff we've already covered.  So the first item for Chico 580's appeal was the business operations storefront hours.  The applicant stated that they would sell cannabis goods between the hours of 6 a.m. Pacific  time and 10 p.m. Pacific time.  Points were deducted by HDL because the Chico municipal code says that the operating hours  for cannabis businesses must be between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.  The second appeal for Chico 580 was the startup budget, which was mentioned that the business  plan did not include product purchases, operational, and commercial use.  The application guidelines required a complete startup budget.  And in the startup budget assumptions on page 11 of the application, the applicant failed  to include the product purchases, operations, and maintenance and was docked accordingly.  And finally, item three, the neighborhood compatibility and community benefits and investments  plan.  The score that Chico 580 received was based on city staff's evaluation of their neighborhood  compatibility plan and the  community benefits and investments plan.  And again, you guys have seen this already, as well as the scoring rubric.  Any questions?  All right.  Questions?  No?  Thanks.  All right.  So at this point, we will open the public hearing and hear from the applicant for 15  minutes.  All right.  So we will be asking the applicant to speak or less so they choose.  It might be less.  Everything is heard.  Hi.  My name is Jaswinder Dhillon representing Chico 580.  Could you speak louder, please?  My name is Jaswinder Dhillon representing Chico 580.  We're actually fighting for the scores for Phase 2A for Section 1 with security and  we lost 15 points on that one.  We definitely don't want a plan of not abiding to the City of Chico regulation hours from  8 to 9 p.m.  It was a type of error done by our preparer.  We did notify and have asked them to submit a right timing on it.  And on Phase 2B, we did specify the right timings on our interview.  So it was an error.  Could have been.  I don't see the points where they would take 15 points for error.  And we would never plan.  We would never plan on opening different hours which are regulated.  And for Item 2 on Phase 2A regarding finances, they specified that we didn't have product  purchases, operations and maintenance on Page 11.  We submitted Page 12 as an operation budget assumptions.  I don't see any of that.  And on that one, we did specify 40% of the revenue for cost of goods and maintenance  is on there and personnel, everything is listed.  We can submit this.  I think there's a copy of it in the appeal, but we can just hand it out.  You guys can look at it.  And as far as Item 3.  Okay.  So on Phase 2B, we were not given an opportunity to answer properly for those for our health  benefit investment and compatibility plan.  And we never got to answer any questions.  You know, we didn't really specify or ask any questions related to it too much.  So our partner who has been an active member of this committee for 20 years, he has owned  the property for 20 years.  And it was a grass station.  And it was a grass station.  And it was a grass station previously.  So my cousin, he's not here today because he had a flight emergency, had to go.  Otherwise he would be here standing with us.  But he has been helping in the community for the last 20 years.  And last year, the murals at the city plaza was, they were deteriorating and they needed,  there was damage and bullet shots on those murals.  Actually got in touch with the original artist.  His name was...  I don't know.  His name was Williams Ever.  And we asked him to donate his time to redo those murals.  And we put our time and effort to grab materials from local stores, sourced from Ellis Art  Stores and all our engineering materials, we grabbed them from the Broadway Street.  But we also did put in time in local volunteer for food banks.  And we did that.  And he actually also did help two families who almost lost their homes due to back taxes.  And helped them get their homes back.  And I would...  I don't see what the point where they actually deducted on, I think it was on...  What's it called?  In the community benefits investment, it was out of 400 points.  They only gave us $1,000.  They gave us $290.  And on the compatibility plan, they gave us $209 out of $300.  Everything is detailed in the application and we submitted.  And I don't know what else is there that's missing that we should have...  I mean, we always...  There already been presence in the community helping out.  We did fundraising and stuff.  So it's just...  I don't see how they're grading us.  And I think we should have deserved all those points.  And we're already been existing and we're still in the community.  And we would love to move forward and keep on helping the community of Chico.  And one more thing for drug and drug prevention.  We were able to source a local doctor.  His name is Dr. Richard Pruitt to give classes to people who needed help with prevention.  And...  And even moving forward, we want to be able to...  If we're making the money, we want to be able to spend it here and not take it somewhere  else.  And at least the people of Chico would benefit in the long run.  And that's it.  We just want you guys to reconsider application and...  Go ahead.  Yes.  And also in the community benefits and investments, we were scored pretty low on that one too.  Yeah.  See, because our partner, Ajit, pretty much like...  He works with the city.  He knows the people in the city or any community they need help.  He provides everything he can.  As in the interview, what he said was he's willing to work with the council, the city,  the community, whatever they need help in.  But see, there's some things you just cannot list in there.  As an example, like in Texas, there was a flood, right?  He has 400 clients.  He collects 200, 200, 300 from each client, put his 10, 20,000 in.  Same thing with our third partner.  She's in transport.  They have 400 trucks in one side, 800 trucks in one side.  If we know from the community side they need help in something, if it's 30, 40,000, we  just gather up a group.  And those type of things we cannot list in there.  Like...  It's like, you know...  We're willing to help the community any way as the community needs it.  And we've already been doing it.  And it's not like we're not doing it.  And I don't see why would you guys not give us the opportunity when we've already been  an active member where all these companies are coming out from different parts of California  and they're going to take the money with them.  They're barely going to spend anything here.  All their consultants from...  It's like...  I don't know how it's going to help in the long run.  Well, they have probably a lot of money because they're major corporations, you know.  And you have to realize that it's like...  For us, it's a new business.  We have never been in a cannabis business.  We have owned a wholesale operation.  We got liquor stores.  We do distributions.  And we have a sense of it, but it's something new we're getting into.  And I think we can work it.  You know, it's not...  And work with the community and the city officials to do it properly and in the right way.  So...  And also, tobacco wholesale is pretty much like the same thing as cannabis.  It's a tree.  It's a tree.  The only thing is you just got to go by the guidelines and the regulations.  That's what we need to go by.  It's like when working for McDonald's...  Please reconsider our appeal, you know.  That would help us.  And we actually invested a lot already in there.  And we already did renovations.  The property is properly cleaned and everything.  And it's been empty for a while, so we do want to put it into good use.  Well, thank you.  Thank you very much, guys.  Could I get the name of the other gentleman who spoke?  Could I get your name, please?  My name is Jess Wong-Singh.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Do we have additional speakers?  No.  Okay.  No.  All right.  So, no general public?  No?  All right.  All right.  So, we will skip the...  We'll assume the applicant will not be present.  We'll skip the rebuttal since there were no speakers.  Yes?  You're okay with that?  Skipping your rebuttal?  Okay.  Just got to check.  All right.  So, we'll close the public hearing and move on to council discussion.  I'll make a motion to file staff's recommendation to deny the appeal.  I'll second that.  Second.  Second.  All right.  So, we have a motion from Council Member Morgan, a second from Council Member O'Brien  for resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico denying an appeal by Chico 580  LLC and thereby upholding staff recommendations regarding the disqualification of Chico 580's  LLC commercial cannabis permit application.  Madam Clerk, you can take the roll.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Thank you.  We'll take a short notice.  I was going to tell them he's not here.  Oh, those are brutal.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you [inaudible]  Thank  Thank  Thank  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. [inaudible]  All right.  All right, reconvene.  If that wasn't obvious, it was item 5.1  that we're going to skip, not the closed session item.  My mistake.  But if everybody's good with that,  we tabled that at the beginning.  So move on to item 5.2,  consideration of an ordinance adopting military equipment  use policy in compliance with AB 481.  Captain Aldridge, interagency please.  Yes, sir.  I'm just happy to be here.  Call me when you'd like.  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.  Mayor, Vice Mayor, council members,  thank you for having me here tonight.  I'm just here tonight to answer any questions  that you may have for the first reading  of our amendment to the ordinance.  As of,  as it contains the military equipment use policy.  We have the ordinance in place through the Chico PER and RS 2.28.  We're just looking to add one section  for the military use policy.  That's all I have.  If you have questions for me, I'll be glad to answer them.  All right, question.  How is what's happening tonight different  from what we did like two weeks ago?  Because you got up here and you talked about what the law did  and how we weren't like getting anything done.  We didn't have any new equipment.  We just had to come to the council and say,  is this okay to do what we've always done?  So the way, and certainly there's members of the public  that think that, right, we're having F-16s delivered tomorrow.  So the way the law is written is you have to,  it's essentially a six week process from start to finish.  So we did the first piece, which was post the policy  on our website for a 30 day review by the community.  We had to come to council to start the conversation  about the ordinance itself, the amendment to the ordinance.  And so that was the first meeting.  So then we had to wait two weeks  for the next council meeting today  for the first reading of the amendment,  and then two more weeks for the second reading,  and then it all goes into place.  All right, other questions from the council?  Yeah, I have a question.  You mentioned that this had been posted to the city website  for review by the public.  Was that announced anywhere  or was it just added to the website?  We had just added it to the website,  but we had submitted the staff report for council.  Right, but you're counting the dates back  to when you added it to the website  for that public comment period, correct?  Yes, which was one day.  You added it to the website one day  before adding it to the city council agenda?  Okay, before the city council agenda was announced  or before adding it to the agenda?  Before adding it to the agenda.  Okay.  I have some more comments,  but that's all I need for now, thank you.  Other comments?  In your...  Go ahead.  No, I'm sorry.  No, please.  In your city council agenda report,  and I didn't realize this,  I thought it was very interesting,  a comment was made that the Chico Police Department  has responsibly purchased and utilized this equipment  within our community for decades.  And it's been a very successful effort  without misuse or abuse.  So I've received quite a few emails, as you have,  from the public about their concerns, which is good.  We do want to hear from the public.  But it seems to me that the reason the public is concerned  is because this has come to light because of the AB 481.  Otherwise, this has been going on for decades.  Okay.  But it hasn't come to the attention of people,  and now they're concerned about it.  So it doesn't seem to me to be that significant of an issue,  other than the fact that it is now before the public.  And again, I'm gonna say,  great for the public speaking and commenting,  but this isn't anything new.  So I thank you for that clarification.  Thank you.  And I think that made a big difference.  I do actually have one more question, if you're willing.  You'd offered as the public engagement tool an email,  which is outlined in the policy.  How do those comments get recorded?  Where are they put?  Are they responded to?  Can you speak a little bit to that?  Absolutely.  So we had the IT division create an email address.  That email address is sent directly  to our Professional Standards Division,  which is Internal Affairs.  I also had them add it to my email accounts.  So that I can see those comments.  As those comments will come in,  and just so you know, in tallying them up,  we've received a total of 10 emails to that address,  two in support, one which was neutral,  and seven which were against.  And then looking at engaged Chico today,  I saw that we had nine in support and two against.  As I read through these comments,  they weren't really questions for me.  They were just comments about the policy itself.  So there was nothing for me to truly respond to.  So I felt the need to just wait till tonight,  and then clarify any questions that came up.  That makes complete logical sense to me.  I'm just thinking like moving forward,  if somebody were to pose a question,  there would be somebody receiving it,  there would be somebody working on a response to that,  so that the public could expect a response  if they did have genuine curiosity.  So there's two people that are getting those,  myself and our Internal Affairs Sergeant.  And I have instructed him that I will do the comments on those  if those questions come forward.  Okay, thank you.  I really appreciate the clarity.  And to Council Member Bennett's point,  this is the equipment we have, maybe nothing new.  The policy is, and the policy was instituted  to increase transparency with the public, right?  So that they could be aware that these things are happening  rather than them in some cases,  and I'm not specifically referring to our case,  happening behind the scenes, right?  So for better or for worse,  that is the purpose of the policy,  which is why some of the financial information,  and kind of where it's tucked away in the policy,  was an issue to me last time.  And there's a couple of other things  that I want to make a quick note of after the public comments.  But I received an email from one of the,  I don't know if this group helped write the bill  or commented on it or whatever else,  but they had made some very specific notes  about where the policy's out of alignment with AB 481,  and that's obviously of concern to me,  and I'll make a note of it after public comment.  So I'm not going to go into that.  All right, further questions?  Okay, I've got one.  So are all the agencies doing this around the state now?  It's codified into law effective January 1st of this year,  so we all have to do it.  Okay, so how long do they have to do it?  Do you know if it's up?  They have to start this process  that we are currently going through by May 1st.  Okay, perfect, thank you.  All right, other questions?  Thanks so much.  Thank you.  All right, how many speakers?  18.  Two minutes.  Okay, so if you could please,  when I call both of your names,  if you could go ahead and get in the middle aisle.  Margaret Swick, followed by Nicole Nava.  Two minutes each.  I will distill my three minutes to two, I hope.  Okay.  So just a quick summary  language barrier between  language barrier between  language barrier between  language barrier between  language barrier between  language barrier between  language barrier between .   .         .  .  . . . . . . . . . . .  difficult people offensive people or even people acting with criminal intent  but these misbehaving people are Americans and entitled to due process  they are not enemy combatants our police are not entitled to treat a Chico  resident as the enemy what we have seen with the Chico Police Department  shooting to death Desmond Phillips Tyler rushing and Stephen vest is that  they resort to deadly weapons in difficult situations regardless of the  availability of other more humane options a be 481 mandates that the  police department shall hold at least one well publicized and conveniently  located community engagement meeting to  determine the outcome of the crime and the crime is not a crime it is a crime  that has been FF . .  .    .  .  . .  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  has  enemy combatants.  Thank you.  Nicole Nava, followed by Jay Fumazi.  So, again, if we could stop any  applause or snapping or booing  or anything of that nature as it could  intimidate speakers and we want free speech  here so people can speak freely. Thank you.  All right.  So, I support the proposed  ordinance. The law  dictated that the law enforcement departments  provide a complete description  of what is covered by the term  military equipment. However, if  people would have continued reading the  entire attached report to this  agenda item, they could also then  see where following that is  an inventory of the actual items  that the Chico Police Department has  and they are reasonable and they are needed  items. Today's criminals  are a different threat than in many years  past. Today, our police officers  risk their lives on the daily and have become  targets of misguided fringe of  individuals who've lost humanity  and have become cold-blooded assassins  lying in wait for a police response.  In addition, we have criminals who are  hopped up on the new and ugly drug  P2P, which studies have shown  that even to reach someone emotionally  enough to try and intervene and connect  can take from eight months to a year.  That is how much  the brain wiring gets messed up. They will continue  fighting many times and they can be  overcome physically, but many times it takes  many officers and unfortunately, yes,  sometimes firepower is needed.  We also have gangs who are  extremely violent and well-armed  with fully automatic weapons.  They shoot indiscriminately and oftentimes  innocent people in neighborhoods  or shopping areas are killed.  Mass killings at school is a real thing.  So of course one hopes things don't go badly  and that military grade equipment  isn't needed, but common sense people  want to be protected and don't want our police  under-armed in a potential  firefight. We also  want prompt response times and if we don't  arm our police adequately, Chico faces  an hour and a half delay in getting  help. I don't know about you, but I don't  want anyone I love at the mercy of a  wait time for a response to be deployed.  And just this past week we've had  mass shooting in Sacramento involving  gangs, well-armed. Rancho Tehama,  a man who was shooting up a neighborhood,  shot an armored  SWAT vehicle, shot at the  officers and we had Los Angeles with  full body armor. We need this help.  Jay Fumazi  followed by George Gold.  Good evening.  I come out here tonight in support of this  movement. I want to thank the  police department for their  support and their  intelligence. I think that  the chief's  recommendation is a good one. I think  that you should vote for this.  Our police department needs to be armed  to respond to threats. Criminals have  gotten more sophisticated in their  gear. The police department needs to be  able to match that. You all remember  the Hollywood shooting  back in the 90s.  The bad guys had  military grade  . The police department was  underprepared. They had to go to an  ammo store to get weapons to compete with  that. So I  totally wholeheartedly  support this. I hope you all  can vote for this.  Thank you. George Gold followed by  Ann Polivka.  In 1987  there was a bank robbery in North  Hollywood, California. I remember it because  the bank robbers were heavily armed,  dressed in body armor, and the police  on the scene, as they say, were outgunned.  As the shootout went on for some time,  some of the cops actually went to nearby  gun stores to get more powerful weapons.  This event has been used by police  departments across the country to arm  themselves with ever more powerful  weapons. This bank robbery was tragic  and horrible, but there's never been  another one like it, certainly not in  Chico. And yet police departments  have continued to arm themselves,  and then we, as law-abiding people,  are treated as if we are aligned  with the bank robbers of North Hollywood.  Chico is not a war zone.  We do not want to live in a world  where it's us against them.  In 99% of all police interactions  with the public, it is not and should  not be us against them.  In 99% of all interactions,  no matter how confrontational,  we the public and the cops  have to learn how to de-escalate  all sorts of conflicts.  The police are the professionals.  If we don't know how to de-escalate  an interaction, the police have to  show us the way.  The city of Chico tells us that our  police officers all take in  de-escalation training, but I'm more  concerned that after class,  Chico's police history,  is that too often the police have  not been able to apply their classroom  training in the field.  Is it an easy ask?  It is not, but that's why we pay  our police more than the average  person's salary, and why we want  them to show us how to de-escalate  confrontations.  Spending our precious tax dollars  to buy more and more weapons  is not the path to peace,  prosperity, and happiness.  Our police complaining  that we have to learn to be compliant  and cooperative is a recipe  for disaster.  We care about our community.  Let's work together. Let us help our police.  Let us in, rather than  keep us out with secrecy  and a lack of transparency.  Ann Polivka,  followed by Diane Suzuki.  Good evening,  council members,  chief, other assorted public.  The Chico Police Department  failed to hold a  well-publicized public  hearing about AB 481.  In a convenient place,  convenient location.  I understand that the police department  put a notice on their regulatory section  of their website about this,  but most Chicoans probably missed it.  There is also  no public participation  in the development of  CPD policy  number 709,  titled military equipment.  It was written by the for-profit company  Lexapol.  Why is the Chico City Council  at this point in time  encouraging the acquisition  and continuing the acquisition  of military arms?  This is the antithesis of de-escalation,  which is what the Chico Police Department  says it's trying to do  in crisis situations with the public.  This equipment  will not protect us from more shootings.  Why does good policing  require the tools of the military?  I have  some questions, some things to consider.  For the first,  is the city getting military equipment  at the expense of unmet community needs?  For instance, mental health services?  Good schools?  Adequate housing  for all our population?  Just a basic thing like road repair?  Where I live,  on Humboldt, there's bumps, bumps,  potholes destroying cars all the time.  Just a basic thing like that.  Another question,  which probably none of us  have really thought about,  is the policy  of providing military equipment  against residents of our city.  Does the policy define  authorized use of the equipment?  I don't know if folks have thought about that,  but it actually does not define  authorized use of the equipment,  which 481 says that it has to.  That's it.  That's it?  Okay, thank you.  Diane Suzuki, followed by  Karen Duncanwood.  Good evening.  I'm appalled and frightened,  frankly, to read Chico Police Department's  policy 709 on the military equipment,  that long list.  Chief Madden had been  increasing de-escalation training  for his officers,  but the possession of all these  military equipment is the antithesis  of this training.  Militarization of our police only increases  the potential for more police violence  against the citizenry,  as we have seen used against  peaceful protesters the past years,  in Minneapolis and other cities.  That militarized response brought criticism  by military personnel  and politicians from both sides  of the aisle.  Many citizens don't want the police  to grow their militarized mindset  because it threatens our constitutional rights,  our public safety,  and our peace of mind.  Just the fact that our officers appear  wearing armament that look like soldiers at war  makes us feel less safe  and less free in this country  as a democracy.  The streets of our country  shouldn't be battlefields  and the police are not an occupying force.  The police are not at war  with unarmed civilians.  A 2017 study showed that  the law enforcement agencies  that use military equipment  are more likely to display violent behavior  and more likely to kill civilians  that they're supposed to protect and serve.  Let's diminish the weapons  and instead teach skills  and tools for solving problems  such as more de-escalation  and less bias training,  crisis intervention training,  and other skills.  Someone I know just suggests officers  be enrolled in sociology curriculum.  The militarization of the police  goes back to the Reagan era  and must stop now.  And if you do adopt it,  we must have a much more transparent process  of future allocations  of any military equipment  acquisitions or purchase  with public notice  required by AB 481.  Karen Duncanwood followed by Marian Evans.  Good evening.  I want you to know  that I come from a military family.  Both of my parents  were in the military during World War II.  My mother was an immigrant.  All three of my brothers  have been in the Army.  One won a Purple Heart in Vietnam.  Another served in the Army.  Another served in Korea.  None of them would think  this was sane.  None of them.  We do not need  more equipment  on Chico's peaceful,  almost peaceful streets.  And I just wanted to say  I don't care  if they've been around.  Every year they've been around  more than a year.  Our money has been spent  on storing them,  maintaining them,  replacing parts,  training people to use them,  etc., etc.  All of that money takes away from  repeated and deep training  in our police force  and de-escalation  over and over and over.  And had that training happened,  we wouldn't have  the civilian murders  that we've had.  There is no way he can get out of the way quickly  when military war weapons  are used on the street.  I have several friends  who have mild mental disabilities.  They don't understand  what it means  when they're confronted  with somebody in military gear  trying to exercise their rights.  Fear, fear, fear.  Those who can't do better  try to whip you  up into fear of your own. FirFF  Marion Evans, followed by Robin Eagle.  Recess, if you like.  Hi.  I just think this is a bad fit for this community.  And it's like putting an ocean liner in Chico Creek and expecting it to work.  Robin Eagle, followed by Bryce Goldstein.  If we look at numbers and percentages of our general budget that's poured into the police department,  we get a sense of our skewed values or the city leadership's skewed values.  Of the tens of thousands of cities across the country,  the highest level, the highest percentage of the general budget,  going into the police department, is about 50%.  We are at over 52%, however.  So I could not find any city that pays more of its general budget into the police department.  And I've researched this quite extensively.  Okay.  Minneapolis.  Minneapolis, excuse me.  For example, 30%.  35.8% of their general budget goes into the police.  Boulder, Colorado, which is the same size as Chico,  actually a little bit smaller in terms of population,  only 7.7% of its general budget goes to the police.  And it's a very relatively safe, pleasant city.  I'm sure if anyone else has visited, you'd agree.  Over 30 of our citizens in the past couple decades,  have been in the police department.  And that's because they have died in police-involved shootings.  Most all of those did not have a weapon on them,  or a lethal means of killing on them.  And most of those were having a psychotic break.  Our police department has not actually implemented de-escalation training.  That is a hands-on training.  The PCIT model is one example.  And you have to practice.  I've gone through this many times as a social worker.  You have to practice with hands-on.  You can't be lectured to about how to de-escalate,  because it's not natural gestures that are involved.  I'm 4'8". I've saved lives.  That's time.  Without weapons.  Bryce Goldstein, followed by Angela McLaughlin.  Hi again.  Our community would be a lot safer if we had things like good streets  with safe crossings, sidewalks, bikeways, shelter.  But we're told...  We're told it would cost too much to fix our infrastructure  and provide basic services.  But when the police want something, they get it with no questions asked.  And that's just how it's been.  But I feel that's unfair to taxpaying citizens like me.  And it lacks transparency.  So I'm happy that AB 481 is at least creating some transparency  around this topic of police militarization.  I am deeply concerned about militarization of police.  Citizens should not have to face violence for exercising their rights to free speech,  or even for calling police.  I'm not going to be calling 911.  And as another speaker said, this is not de-escalation.  De-escalation.  This is escalation.  A council member implied at the last meeting that we need weapons because of Ukraine and  Russia.  But Russia is not coming to attack Chico.  Let's refocus on keeping our community safe in the form of housing and infrastructure.  Better uses of our funding at the moment.  As for the transparency of this process, again, I'm glad that we're not going to be facing  violence.  I'm glad that this assembly bill has made it so that we at least get a say, not that  that's going to do anything.  We see how city council likes to vote, and we know what's going to happen.  But as a very politically involved person, I read the newspaper, I follow city social  media, and I go to city council meetings, but I barely saw any notification about this  public input process.  As others have expressed, it would have been better to get some better notice about this  process.  So I'd like to see an actual public input.  I don't think we're going to have a public workshop outside of city council or stakeholder  groups.  Something that actually is public engagement in giving our police more weapons.  And I know they've already been using these weapons.  But yeah, I think that we should have more public engagement in the process.  This is the first step to doing that.  So thanks.  Angela McLaughlin, followed by Addison Winslow.  We don't need local officers equipped with cameras.  We don't need police officers equipped with chemical weapons, armor penetrating bullets,  and yet another armored vehicle.  Rather, we need Chico PD to turn towards true community policing and to formalize ways to  address community concerns, all things that have failed to happen under the past three  police chiefs, two of whom are here tonight.  They have been asked to work with the Citizens Oversight Committee for years, and we still  do not have that.  We have formal community engagement of any kind, not just an oversight committee.  In fact, after cherry picking people to serve on a chief's advisory committee, Matt Madden  disbanded it when questions arose about the lack of diversity and about pro-police stance  of those chosen.  Asking law enforcement agencies to engage directly with the concerned public is not  radical.  Rather, it's the bare minimum we should be able to expect.  We should be able to expect transparency and accountability from the agency, and we should  be able to ask for and receive direct engagement when the community has concerns.  What we have received instead is obfuscation, refusal to engage, and refusals to comply  with public records requests from journalists, private citizens, and other public officials.  We have received a lot of questions about the !  The list of equipment they intend to purchase includes armored vehicles, chemical weapons,  and riot control.  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh !  Ooooh !  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  What we are seeing is a list of military equipment that has not been justified in the past in Chico's history,  the need by the police department.  They use it in trainings, but they don't necessarily use it in the field.  And as I understand, riot control hasn't been called out in Chico since the 1990s.  Having them on standby during the George Floyd protest, I think, does not count.  I was bothered by the fact that in the staff report it said there was no fiscal impact for this,  even though there is a blank check given to the police department to repurchase all of these on an ongoing basis,  depending on how much they might use in trainings.  And with sewers recently, there was a finance committee recommendation that said that while we don't have the money to fund the system,  and they wanted to raise rates in order to cover that, there was a recommendation to come back with a cheaper alternative for sewers.  The police department has not given the same ask.  They said that we could reduce the cost of some of this, maybe tier it to historical need, and decide how we can better use that money.  But the police don't get the same requirements put on that public works do.  And the process of public input was, as Alex said, began when the police published this on their website.  But the police do have multiple people, I believe, on staff for communications, social media, propaganda, and there was no announcement made.  And I think that speaks to their being not, they're not taking seriously this process of public input,  and that the state is requiring it for good reasons, and people should be involved and able to speak to it.  Thanks.  Benson, followed by Ruth Sarnoff.  Yeah, good evening.  Yeah, I'm actually in favor of acquiring military equipment or just anything there.  Please.  I think that's what the police department needs.  However, the military equipment, we're going down a different road, and I think it needs more consideration than acquiring just equipment in general.  We need a bigger discussion on military equipment.  It's not so much whether or not we're going to acquire military equipment, but which military equipment are we going to acquire?  And I think we need a citizens group.  An advisory group that can do the research that we need to decide whether or not we're going to acquire certain equipment.  And even though our play, our, you know, Billy Aldridge, our current police chief, I trust him, but every five years we get a new police chief.  We don't know how that's going to, what equipment's going to be acquired and how it's going to be implemented.  So I think, again,  we need an advisory group to oversee our acquisition of military equipment.  We've seen, we already know it's going to be over abuse.  I remember we were doing a march in San Francisco, and you got police officers up there with ARs pointing down at us.  So military equipment can be abused.  We all know that.  That's not a, that's not a, that's the, that's a given.  So we need a citizens group to oversee the acquisition of military equipment.  Thank you.  Hey, Benson.  Yep.  Good to see you again.  Oh, yeah.  Glad to be here.  I was going to say the same.  We'll do the pun.  Missed you.  So Ruth Starnoff, followed by Sasha Anya.  Yeah. . .        .  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  And they have torches, and they parade up there, Stone Mountain.  And then the next day, with their clothes off, they're Sheriff Benson, you know.  And it reminds me of a song that I remember from that era, and I'll sing it to you.  If you ever go to Houston, well, you better walk right.  And you better not stagger, and you better not fight.  Sheriff Benson will arrest you, and he'll carry you down.  And if the jury finds you guilty, it's penitentiary bound.  So let the midnight special shine a light on me.  Let the midnight special shed its evergreen.  Let the midnight special shed its evergreen.  Let the midnight special shed its evergreen.  There are times when just get over it.  If you don't like black people, you don't like brown people, you don't like homeless people,  you don't like people that smell, you don't like people that are disabled,  you don't like people that don't wear a suit,  you don't wear people that don't want to keep building until there's nothing alive,  you don't like people that don't want to be on this earth.  And that's what's happening.  You're destroying life.  There's a lot of people out and off the grid that know what's happening,  and they're a part of life.  Thank you, and you are an amazing singer.  Sasha Anya, followed by Liz Moser.  I don't know how I can top that.  Council members, Mr. Aldridge, thank you for being here.  I think everybody's got some common ground here.  I think all of us do.  We've seen hard times.  We've seen terrible stuff go down by police.  We've seen terrible stuff go down by populations.  We've seen terrible stuff go down on newsreels.  We just, there's just, you know, it's tough times.  We have.  Father.  We have.  Father.  Father.  Father.  Father.  We have drug use now that has put the police in a totally different situation  that's ever really occurred at the levels that are unprecedented.  I understand that.  And it's scary for a lot of people, including the families of those people  that are on those drugs and the people that are on those drugs themselves.  There's a lot going on in Chico, and I really am sensitive to everybody,  all the different stakeholders here.  Everyone's involved.  I don't think we're on opposite sides.  I think.  I think most of us are pretty close to being on the same side.  We just have to figure out how this goes.  After the Patriot Act was passed, and Americans were led to believe that there was this huge  domestic terror threat, it was a bunch of BS.  Most of us have realized that now after fact.  None of those laws ever really get rescinded.  The Patriot Act is still valid.  It's still out there.  During that period.  There was a program called 1033, and that was to transfer a ton,  a ton of military weapons into the cities around the United States.  That already happened.  That was 20 years ago.  That's all been done.  And that was how that all got rolled out.  The question is, now that it's all in place, and this is the new normal,  do you feel comfortable going out on the street,  demonstrating for whatever you want to demonstrate for,  with really hardcore police units standing,  all weaponed up?  I don't.  We need some help.  We need to have.  That's fine.  Thank you.  Okay.  Liz Mosher, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Hi.  Are these weapons really needed in Chico?  I think we've heard a lot about that.  Okay.  Okay.  I wanted to read a letter to the editor I wrote a couple years ago,  because it deals with guns in general,  and how most people don't use guns.  And the mass amount of guns that have been sold recently  are stockpiled by most of the gun owners.  Anyway, this was from,  because,  a man from LA moved to Chico,  and he was going to offer grandmas a gun safety class.  Regarding grandmas got a gun,  and the opportunity to attend a gun safety class,  hopefully it includes the facts that guns aren't as protective  as the instructor or most gun enthusiasts want you to believe.  First, it's unfortunate.  It has been a time when  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  just for handgun safety because  accidentally finding and using and criminals stealing and finding lost guns.  Third, please don't include fear-mongering from the gun industry and its lobbyists.  The wish of the instructor to arm all women against rape is a threat like the NRA  asserting that all teachers should have guns after Sandy Hook.  We don't need any more military-style weapons.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Jeff Creed.  Council, because we have existing supplies, I wouldn't see that as a valid excuse to continue on.  There have been many policies over time that have changed once we realize we don't need them  or they're harming citizens.  Some citizens may applaud this request, while others are highly concerned.  I'm one of them.  Chico PD has a growing track record with unequal application of the law  and poor judgment regarding the law.  It's a record of reporting excessive force, intimidation, and loss of life,  resulting in expensive litigation,  subsequently covering inconsistencies with reporting and documentation.  I have personally witnessed a visible difference with the people of our city  when it comes to Chico PD and events.  Someone from the liberal side, I see a line of Chico PD out there.  I see a conservative voting base out there blocking streets.  They're getting pats on the back and handshakes.  Chico PD has not proven to me,  that they can be trusted peacekeepers with the lives of our neighbors.  The city is moving in the wrong direction when they allow our peace officers to obtain and keep  military grade equipment against the people of Chico.  The people have requested additional de-escalation trainings and techniques to be used here  to save lives and to keep the peace.  Instead, we're seeing them handed a blank check to continue with their arsenal.  Wars from the city against poor citizens, that's what we're seeing.  Poor, that's I think where this is coming from,  is the fear against the poor people on our streets.  Our PD, they are not military personnel.  If a war breaks out, we have a National Guard here.  We don't need our police officers to be military personnel.  We need to have the peace put back in peace officers.  Jeff Creed is our last speaker.  Well, how to bring out the illiteracy.  The illiterate and the caring people who don't understand what they're talking about.  I think that was the goal of Brown last time this was brought up when she pulled it off the consent agenda.  Mr. Creed, if we could not insult people as we were at the podium, we'd appreciate it.  I'll try.  It's hard here.  So, I think that was the goal when Brown pulled this from the consent agenda  and used a lot of inflammatory words.  And words keep coming around, military equipment.  And when I saw it on the agenda a couple weeks ago, I looked at it.  It had a lot of concern.  And then I asked about it during a break and I saw it before the meeting.  And I saw, when I finally saw the list, I kind of laughed.  And as a 23-year veteran of the National Guard, I'll tell you,  they're not going to be here in time to replace you or support your police in an imminent crisis.  I was in L.A. in 1992.  I was there for two weeks.  It wasn't fun.  And all these people who cried, no weapons, no weapons,  were running.  They were running into the streets and hugging us when they saw us.  The police need the basic minimum weapons.  And that list is not military weapons.  There's very few weapons on that list I would have wanted with me in Iraq.  There are some there, yes.  But it's not overly abundant.  And what people are doing tonight is they're bringing up all this craziness  to try and sway you, but they don't really know what they're talking about.  Boulder, Colorado was brought up about using such a small,  small portion of their budget.  But Boulder, Colorado spends $100 more per capita on their police than Chico.  That's at police record whatever dot com.  Sure, they spend a lower percent because they have a 9% sales tax.  So it's a lower percent of their budget.  So these people, you know, it's just inflammatory.  And it's irresponsible.  Know what you're talking about or don't talk.  That was our last question.  Thank you.  Again, please, comments to the minimum.  Those are less.  Both sides, I did.  All right, no more speakers?  None.  All right.  Council comments or questions?  I just want to make a quick note.  I mentioned that I received an email unsolicited from a, I don't know the group,  American Friends Service Committee was the representative that wrote it to me.  And the only kind of main thing that stood out was they had been involved in the writing  of AB 481 and they mentioned a few things that they said.  I cannot confirm or deny this, but I think it's important to note and it's important  for us legally to look at.  Chico PD's military equipment policy doesn't conform to AB 481 and to other legal standards  in several ways.  It doesn't describe, quote, authorized uses, procedures required for use, or any other  mechanisms to enforce the policy as is required by AB 481.  It doesn't include restrictions on tear gas and impact projectiles for crowd control as  required by another new state law, AB 48.  It doesn't restrict the use of LRAD's high-pitched alarm tone in a crowd or protest, which can  cause permanent hearing damage and lead to successful litigation against New York PD.  I'm adding this for the record.  I don't know the details of it.  I think it's important for us to look at.  And the primary purpose.  The primary purpose for pulling the agenda item before and for my continued no vote is  the issue of transparency.  If the bill was passed for the sake of being transparent, more transparent with the public,  then that shouldn't have been on the consent agenda.  I shouldn't have had to pull it and I shouldn't have had to ask those questions offline.  Some of the issues with where the budget, you know, with no fiscal impact and, you know,  there's clear costs associated with maintaining and replacing.  Some of these issues are not in the agenda.  I think that's an issue for me.  And then, of course, some of these unanswered questions around whether this does indeed  confirm conform to the bill and its purposes.  That's all the reasons I would be voting no today.  All right.  Other questions or comments from Council?  I have a question for Mr. Ewing.  Oh, sorry.  Vice Mayor Reynolds, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Just for Mr. Ewing, maybe, can you address the one publicly held meeting and is there  further things that we will be doing?  Or need to do to finish up this process?  Certainly.  Certainly.  Thank you, Vice Mayor Reynolds.  So as detailed in the staff report today, Chief Aldridge has provided notice of this  upcoming policy item at a prior meeting in March.  In addition, consistent with the statute, the police department posted a, on their website,  notice of the upcoming policy.  This is an opportunity for the public to provide comments.  An email was provided.  They could have provided those comments, or they did, on that website at that email.  So this hearing today is another opportunity for the public to comment as they did at a  duly noticed public meeting, 72 hours per the Brown Act.  So that happened at the meeting in March.  This is the first reading.  So the notice went out for the meeting in March.  The notice went out for this meeting today.  And this is the first reading.  So there will be a second reading at a duly noticed regular council meeting.  The public has an opportunity to come and express their views.  In addition, they can express their views on Concern Chico by emailing the city and  providing comments.  Many council members have already indicated that they've received comments from the public.  So these are the various opportunities that the public has.  So we'll take a quick time just to take a quick time just to take a quick time just  take a quick time just take a quick time just take a quick time just take a quick time . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . .    to come out and voice their concerns or their support  at another duly noticed public meeting.  Thank you.  All right, Council Member O'Brien.  So I wanted to give Interim Chief Aldridge  a chance to respond.  I think Council Member Brown brought up some good points  and questions relating to policy.  I think I know the answer to those,  but I wanted to give you a chance to respond.  Thank you for that.  There was a couple questions  about it not complying with AB 481.  I worked with our administrative lieutenant  who controls our Lexapol policy manual,  made sure that we reached out to Lexapol  to ensure that their policy they would release to us  was in compliance with the law as codified  on January 1st of 2022.  We confirmed that it was.  We compared it against other policies at multiple,  different levels of the legislature,  different cities.  We even used some language from other cities in that policy.  I attended Cal Chiefs Conference with then Chief Madden,  and they provided language to use within the AB 481 policies  and we utilized that language.  So to answer your question  and to answer the concerns of the community,  we have looked at this in detail and we have compared it  against other agencies.  And we have found that it is in compliance  with AB 481 requirements.  And if I could just add to Interim Chief Aldridge's,  because I was a chief when we were working this out,  and probably to answer a little in depth on that question is,  remember this is reporting the types of things that we have.  It doesn't undermine all the other policies that we have,  such as our use of force policies.  So when it says it doesn't say how do you use this,  well, some of these tools fall under our use of force  and we have very specific policies regarding that.  And in fact, your use of force policy  from the police department has been looked at  in the last couple years with all the things going on  multiple times on multiple levels,  and that policy continues to uphold  that it's well within certain laws.  So remember, this policy is talking about the things  that we have, but it's not gonna talk about all the other,  other policies that tie it all together on when and how you know these things work and specifically  some of these uh when it relates to use of force which is well documented in in the policies as  well so thank you both for that that's what i was looking for and so my statement is this  military equipment is really a misnomer we have had this equipment for years many of the items  the police department will never attempt to acquire through this program i do not believe that  as multiple active shooter incidents occur far too often in our communities to include  the recent tragedy in sacramento having a well-trained and well-equipped police department  capable capable of responding to these horrific events is necessary i wish that was not the case  i do i wish that was not the case  that we had to respond to these horrific events but that is our reality we cannot afford to be  unprepared all right further comment from council all right i have some questions  chemical agents and smoke canisters what situation would that be used  so we can just be general okay um a riot it would have to be a  very significant event in a riot situation for us to use that because there's some case law  surrounding that currently uh i will assure you that right now as it stands the only folks who  utilize that are our swat team who go through you know certifications and ongoing training every month  pepper balls  again the only folks that we currently are allowing for use with that is our swat team  it is not deployed on the ground we have to be careful with that and we have to be careful with that  right now on our patrol teams at this point would that be a riot situation correct or it could be  used um in multiple different scenarios i could go through multiple different scenarios but the the  the true reason for that would be a riot situation chico ever had a right absolutely chico had ever  had a right at 2000 uncontrolled people overturning cars and analyzing multiple buildings it was  before my time but yes i was 15 i watched on tv  the same channel that had their news van turned upside down, I believe.  Sean was apparently there.  So as crazy as some of this sounds, it is for those kind of situations.  Is that your opinion?  Absolutely.  It's very unique for us to have.  It's very unique situations that would require us to use these types of tools.  We don't use them every single day on every call we go to.  Thank you very much.  Entertain a motion.  I'll make a motion to approve this.  Do you need it read, Debbie?  Yes.  So you want me to read that?  Is that what I mean?  Or I'm happy to do that if you want.  So the motion is an ordinance of the city of Chico, California, adopting military equipment use policy and amending Title II, Chapter 2.28 of the Chico Municipal Code by adding Section 2.28.050 entitled Marriage, Military Equipment Use Policy in Compliance with Assembly Bill 481.  Second.  Yes, that's it.  All right.  We have a motion by Councilmember O'Brien and a second by Councilmember Morgan.  Take the roll.  Councilmember Bennett.  Yes.  Councilmember Brown.  No.  Councilmember Morgan.  Yes.  Councilmember O'Brien.  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right. . .  .  .  . .  It is 10.04, so we cannot take new items.  We will move on to item 6, reports and communications.  Following reports and communications, items are provided for council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda.  Interim city manager's report.  Mr. Mapp.  Well, we've had a long night.  I know you still have closed session.  I'm going to keep it short.  What I do want to do is just recognize my colleagues here, all your public or your department directors.  It's been a little bit of a bumpy road for us, but we're faced with some adversity.  It's not the first time we've faced adversity as a city.  I just want to recognize their hard work, their leadership, supporting their staff.  You've got great men and women working for this city.  I've been proud to do that for 20 years.  I've been proud to do that for 25 years.  And so I just want to recognize them for their support.  We made a promise to stick together until such time.  You can find a quality person to be sitting in this seat.  So thank you.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Item 6.2, council member requests.  Pursuant to AP and P 1010, council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting  after stating what the item would be.  A majority vote of the council is needed for staff to agendize.  Council members may also.  Submit requests in writing.  I have one, and this one's time sensitive.  I got this email from the director of Butte County Behavioral Health, Scott Cannelli,  asking for the council's letter of support for the county's REST program,  Resiliency Empowerment Support Team Innovation Project,  that supports their tiny homes combined with homeless street outreach team.  The funding is all MHSA innovation funding.  There's $3.5 million.  So the county behavioral health specifically has to present on April 15th.  So my request would be A, are we willing to set aside our AP and P to let the mayor sign a letter  of support to the director of Butte County Behavioral Health for this project?  And I have them if you'd like to see them.  Do you have multiples?  I have lots.  Okay.  It's one of the county's programs.  I'm not going to read the whole thing.  The framework includes intensive outreach and engagement to connect with individuals experiencing homelessness  who could benefit from various health interventions.  It's going to be a referral source to Everhart Village, the emergency shelter consisting of a cabin.  You all know what Everhart Village is.  It's just the county doing its part to help citizens in need.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . .  .   .    . . .        .              . . . . . .  . . . .  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. . . . . . . . . . .      Yes, certainly.  All right.  I just want to make sure we're following the proper procedure.  I'll make a motion to set aside the AP and P-1010 so we can take action on having the mayor sign this letter.  Second.  When you're ready.  Thank you.  That was to waive AP and P-1010.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  So my second motion would be for the approved the mayor to sign this on behalf of the council in support of the county's program.  Second.  And who is the second?  Council Member Tandon.  Thank you.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Thank you, Council.  I'm very sensitive to setting aside those rules, but if the county can get that funding, it's just going to help everybody.  And Madam Clerk, I'll get that letter to you.  Well, don't I have that?  Oh, yeah.  I did.  Thank you.  I'll get that letter for it, too.  You already have it.  And I'll print it out on the letterhead and get a signature.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  All right.  Item 6.3 and 6.4 are information only.  Do we have any speakers on closed session?  We do have one.  So are we skipping the sunshining and just, I mean, those are information only?  Informational.  Okay.  Monthly financial.  On closed session, we have one speaker, Nicole Nava.  Ooooh.  Ooooh.  Ooooh. [inaudible] !  Ooooh.  Ooooh. !  Ooooh.  Ooooh.  Ooooh.  Ooooh.  the city attorney again and so for me I would note again for regarding clerk  Preston to me she's the gem of the city and I feel like most everyone agrees  that she is professional thorough helpful articulate and gracious under  the worst and most stressful conditions as a public servant it's hard to imagine  our city struggling more but not investing in our quality staff would  make make that a reality kudos to miss Preston and to her staff  for this care of our community for city attorney Ewing you're one of the only  people who kind of really knows what's going on related to the settlement and  having that information be transparent is as vital as possible here for our  city to be able to heal we'd like you to bring your expertise to bear and note to  the judge that our city has to move forward and that the plaintiffs  attorneys don't appear to be acting in good faith because reading between the  lines from the very little we're allowed to have  you're not going to be able to get a job in the city and that's not going to  things are not progressing and we are struggling with chaos still I brought  up to you last time about the stabbing on my street there was one right on it  and then one right inside of the park it is very stressful I've taken to  basically hunkering in because I don't feel safe in the park I get anecdotally  other people do great for them I truly am happy they have a great day not  everybody has that experience and just because you haven't had an attack or been screamed  at or actually had to save someone who has been ODFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF  say I appreciate that. I appreciate what information was in it. What still is danced around is that we  do have some enforcement that we can be doing that I believe is not being done as it relates to the  voluminous amounts of trash. There are plenty of trash cans all over the damn place and there's  porta potties yet we're getting things thrown in the street, draining into drains, probably killing  our fish. I don't understand why climate embracing people are literally the ones holding the city  hostage to filth and degradation. It is breaking my heart. It's gross and I just I don't know what  more we can be expected to do. We've been waiting over a year what over almost over a year or exactly  a year now. We need to get this together again with the cost spreadsheet. I did math and it's  not pretty through the end of this year and they're still unknown. Again we're over five  million dollars out of taxpayer funds and we know this is going up for five years. Thanks.  All right we're adjourned in closed session. We're going to take a short recess before. Thank you.  Ooooh [inaudible] [inaudible]  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh  Ooooh
