All right, we are waiting for the city attorney to get into our Zoom meeting. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, we're going to take two here on our adjourned regular city council meeting, continued from April 20th, adjourned in its entirety to today. We will call the meeting to order, and because we had the invocation at the last one, we are going to skip that, but if you could please rise and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag. I continue to public for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. All right, Madam Clerk, could you do roll call, please? Okay. Council Member Brown? Here. Council Member Denley? Here. Council Member Huber? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Tandon? Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Here. And Mayor Coolidge? Present. All right, public participation. This meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N-29-20. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or the city's website. Public participation prior to the meeting, the Engage Chico Civic Engagement Program was available for citizen input on individual items prior to the meeting with that program accessed through the city's website. The commenting period for Engage Chico closed at 4.30 today. Public participation. The public can participate during the meeting, accessing the Zoom meeting information found on the agenda posted on the agenda. To speak on an item using Zoom, after I call the item, the staff will begin the staff report. Click to raise your hand at that time if you would like to speak on that item. The city clerk will call your name when it's your turn to speak. When your name is called, you'll be prompted to unmute yourself. When your time is up, you will be muted. We will repeat this process for each item you want to speak on. So if you want to speak on multiple items, we suggest you raise your hand at the beginning of each of those individual items. If you'd like to speak on the consent agenda at this point, please raise your hand. The consent agenda is for those items routine in nature and can be acted in on one motion. But prior to that, we do have a few items that we'd like to remove. Item 2.5. Item 2.5 is going to be continued to a future meeting. That's the amendment to the City of Chico budget appendix. B1- or B1-B3. And then I believe Vice Mayor Casey Reynolds had an item as well. Yeah, I was just going to ask that 5.6 be continued to a regular meeting. We've got a lot on the agenda tonight, and I think just one less thing to take care of this evening would be great. All right. Do we need to vote today, or we can just do that? Okay. We'll move forward. Thank you for your consideration. All right. Consent agenda. Is there any council disqualifications or no votes on a particular item? Realizing that we have to do public comment, of course, first. Yeah, this feels like Groundhog's Day. I want to pull 2.2, just like I did at the last meeting, and that's where we got cut off. All right. And I want to pull item 2.4. So do we have anyone interested in speaking on any of the items on the consent agenda? Please raise your hand and zoom. We do not have any. And then what was Council Member Huber's item? You want 2.2? Okay. So 2.2, 2.4, 2.5 continue to a future meeting. All right. Okay. And at this point in time, we'll vote on the consent agenda item 2.1 and 2.3. Is that right? Yes. All right. So we have a motion. Do we have a second? Second. Motion and second. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. Mr. Huber, the floor is yours. Yeah. I found the text in 2.2 to be sort of confusing, and I was just hoping for some clarification. All right. Thank you, Chief Madden. Thank you. All right. Regarding 2.2, the determination of the meeting and the second, this is looking at this plan that DBA's Argus Monster Crate would like to do a delivery service of alcohol, and they need a Type 21 license to do that. Under the rules of ABC rules. So essentially, this would normally be a Type 21 would be a liquor store, an off-sale department frontage store. That's not what they're looking at doing. They're actually looking at not having off-sale at the business, but a delivery service. So in order to accomplish that, they need a Type 21 license, and if they were to change their plan. If it's approved today and want to go to a storefront Type 21, they would have to come back through the police department for their PCN, and it would have to come back to council. So it really is just, it's, they need that particular type of license to do that particular type of business. Okay. Do we have a lot of those licenses operating in the city? Well, because most of your storefront liquor stores are Type 21. Because most of your liquor stores are Type 21. Uh, they're in charge of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders of the borders law enforcement standpoint, we don't see any negative impact. So do any of the liquor stores that have a Type 21 license deliver? I don't know the answer to that. And could applying for a license that allowed a business to deliver effectively get them around the limitation because of the number of licenses within their area? No. As counsel, you have the ability to approve that license once it's made it up to your level. So at this point, I'm not sure if other liquor stores have this particular type of license, but I'm not sure. But it enables them to ship the beverages out into the community. But what's interesting about their business model is they're open Monday through Friday, 11 to 5. And then because the Type 21 still falls within the city jurisdiction, all the other rules would apply. So some of the rules that we have in place when we talk about closure times for, for certain holidays, you know, Halloween and some of those restrictions that past councils have placed on those licenses would still be in effect. So I don't know why I'm a little bit uncomfortable with this, but if there's a house full of teenagers, for instance, and they have someone call in a liquor order for them and it gets delivered, what has to happen is, whoever is at the answers the door has to show an identification that shows they're of age. Yeah, they still have to follow all the ABC rules and guidelines that go with that particular license. So that's what would have to happen was the sale would have to be, and it's on their responsibility to make sure that they're providing alcohol to over 21 participants. To the best of our knowledge, is that business? Is this in good standing with the ABC? Do we know of any challenges or problems? I have not heard, and nor my lieutenant that oversees and works with ABC that prepared the staff report have had no issues with this particular business. This is a business that also operates at Type 47 in downtown Chico at Argus. It's the same company. We haven't had any issues. Great. Thank you. All right. But the other businesses operating with the Type 21 could already do delivery, correct? They could if they, well, because of the type, they would have to bring it before you as a PCN because they're changing whatever, how they obtain that Type 21 had certain rules and restrictions. So just like in this case, if they want to go and do a storefront, they're going to have to re-approach the process with the city to make those changes. Okay. But we do have delivery in terms of like wine and other things coming to people's houses. And, you know, through, through FedEx or UPS or, yeah, Costco. Yeah. All right. Thank you, Chief. Thank you. All right. Action? Anyone? Okay, I'll move approval. Motion and a second. All those in. Who was the second? Kimmy was. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Denley. Sorry. Madam Clerk, if you'd take the roll. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Aye. Council Member Huber. No. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. And then item 2.4, I didn't necessarily, I'm very happy about the donation of the surplus. I'm very happy about the donation of the surplus mailbox to the Veterans of Foreign Wars post. But I did want to actually draw attention and perhaps Mr. Orme could follow this up. I definitely am interested in approving it. But due to our fire regulations, we are actually not able to burn flags in the City of Chico, is how I understand it. So, because when a flag has hit the ground or is old, the proper disposal is actually burning it. So I'm happy about that. Some people don't know that. So I believe, and unfortunately our local group which does that actually sends them down to Yuba Sutter to get them disposed of properly. So I think our local groups that dispose of the flags properly would appreciate that. I don't know if that needs any formal action from Council. If it's Council's direction for staff to look into that, we're happy to do it. And if there is a ban or limitation on our local VFW, we're happy to do it. But if it's Council's view of conducting those ceremonies, I'd be happy to look into what it would take to allow them to do that if that's Council's will. All right. Any further comments? So with that, I make a motion to approve item 2.5 with directing staff to look into that item and bring it back to Council at a later date. Second. Motion and second. Madam Clerk? Second. Second. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Denley? Aye. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. Thank you. Business from the floor. Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the Mayor based on the number of speakers. Council cannot take any action at this time. We are now at a time and make sure to please raise your hand so we can't take any action on this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. And again, if you're in Zoom and wishing to speak on business from the floor, please raise your hand now. How many speakers? They are, um, they're coming in. Eight so far. So we can start with the first one. The first speaker is Nicole Nava. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead, Nicole. Okay. Thank you. Good evening, Council, Clerk, City Manager. I am speaking tonight on a couple of things that are not on the board. One, I just want to say thank you. I would like to let you all know that I'm quite sure that one of the requests will be to discuss a sanctioned campground. And I just want to let you know that I understand that you may be feeling impetus to act swiftly because of the three-week period that the judge has a stay. But I would encourage you all to think carefully on what's been discussed previously. Note that Huber was the one who went along with the vote to not have something be out near the airport as a sanctioned campground. And to state that if there is such a campground that is thrust upon the citizens, that it be on the outskirts of Chico and not within the, you know, what's considered the inner city limits. If something like that happens, I would, of course, hope that they would have a vote. Thank you. Thank you for that. and new arrivals. And I think people keep dodging those very driving issues that are impacting this community in a negative way. So I think I speak for a lot of the citizens when I say we're concerned about our health, safety, and welfare as well. And I have had numerous interactions now to my front door just this very week, and I'm tired of it. So that's one. The other is I would like to say to the citizens of Chico, we are protesting that NBHRC is trying to come have another footprint in this community in a facility at 18th and Park. And I would encourage anyone who's concerned about that to show up with a sign objecting to having needles be handed out, exchanged, or have it become a safe injection site, which I'm sure would be next on their agenda. So anyone, please join us tomorrow, Tuesday, May 27th, 530. Thank you. So yeah, I'm Jake Ewald. I'm a Chico State graduate student, and I'm imploring this council and this city to dispense with the toxic ideologies that racially divide us. So I grew up in a diverse Los Angeles suburb where as a white person, I was a minority. My close friends, or brothers as I call them, reflect this diversity. Abhilash is Indian. Adam and Chris are biracial. Aleric is Chinese. Casey is Jewish. Jeff is Irish. Nicholas is Lebanese. I grew up in a multicultural home. When my dad remarried, it was to a South Korean immigrant. Mom's children, two long-term children, were born in the same neighborhood. I grew up in a multicultural home. When my dad remarried, it was to a South Korean immigrant. Mom's children, two long-term children, were born in the same neighborhood. I grew up in a multicultural home. When my dad remarried, it was to a South Korean immigrant. Mom's children, two long-term children, were born in the same neighborhood. I grew up in a multicultural home. When my dad remarried, it was to a South Korean something huge. If so, I want to apologize and I want to do better. Masai replied, Jake, I've never seen you treat everyone equally with love. My father, a college administrator, advised a black student shortly after Floyd's murder. Dad asked, how are you doing? The student replied, no, Dr. Eagle, how are you doing? We see this is tearing you apart. Yes, racism exists in this country, but we know you're not a part of it. So if black lives matter, why are Masai's voice and my father's student's voice is being ignored here in Chico? Judging people by skin color, rather than behavior, is racism, not progress. And yet Chico has promulgated this lie over and over again. If we truly have a continuing duty to love one another, Chico's ideology must be disavowed. We must judge people on merits, not melanin. Actions, not ancestry. Personal compassion, not privilege or conviction. Yet Chico's institutions suggest we should be racially divided. University President Gail Hutchinson condones the dogma of inevitable white racism that's regularly taught on campus. This city government joined Chico State in endorsing even more racism. Chico's ideology is not just racism, it's racism. Chico's ideology is not just racism, it's racism. Chico's ideology is not just racism. Chico's ideology is not just racist, it's racist. Chico's ideology is not just racist. Chico's ideology is not just racist, it's racist. Chico's ideology is not just racist. Chico's ideology is not just racist, it's racist. Chico's ideology is not just racist. Chico's ideology is not just racist, racist, racist, racist, racist, racist, racist, racist, racist, speak up. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Jessica Giannola. Hi, counsel. We have a housing crisis. We're neck deep in it, and our city cannot make it go away by denying that it exists. As federal Judge England advised the city attorney, we're not the only city experiencing a housing crisis, and our city ordinances are invalid due to the clear violation of the law. We have a failing system, and instead of finger-pointing at the victims or community partners, the city needs to own their role in this situation today, which has been to refuse to partner in resolutions. Prematurely ending our declared housing crisis forfeits funding for critical programs in our area, meant to prevent homelessness. Since the September 2011 18 declaration, our crisis has only increased, emphasizing the need to extend the declaration in June, not end it. Judge England emphasized the need for the city to provide accurate information about our housing crisis, and to educate itself about the legality of current ordinances. He expressed frustration regarding local social media groups that spread misinformation, confusing citizens on what's legal and correct in favor of what sounds good to them and support stereotypes. The city's! We've been those unable to obtain housing or costing our city millions in avoidable litigation fees. It is incredibly important that we take partisan issues out of this crisis, that we work with community partners that have been on the ground with these folks for years and heed the advice of those that hold degrees in fields of social work, mental health, and public health. During the April 6th council meeting, DSS Director Shelby Boston explained our history of homelessness and Behavioral Health Director Scott Kinley explained in depth the need for Chico to step up regarding our inadequate number of HUD eligible housing units and provide an explanation of our situation in great detail. We have many professionals in our area to advise you in our housing reality and it's past time that you stop punishing our poor and start working within our city on protecting our unhoused. Jessica, it's over. Your time is up. Thank you. Our next speaker is Mary Kay Benson. Mary Kay, if you can unmute yourself. I'll go ahead and move to Donald Robert while Mary Kay is locating whatever she needs to on her computer. So Donald Robert. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . interconnected. As a community and society, in order to truly educate home, to eliminate homelessness, you must tackle all of the issues that surround homelessness, not cherry pick the issues that are easiest to fix. You must tackle the more difficult, controversial, and sensitive topics within this much larger issue, the issue of homelessness, and how we as a community and society can alleviate and ultimately eliminate homelessness for good. One of the ways that is growing to do that is a safe, organized space, or SOS. These safe, organized spaces, or SOSs, are an interim shelter approach to allow dignified and safe sleep. Safe, organized spaces, or an SOS, are usually comprised of tents, easily transportable secure structures, or stable micro-homes. And just a few little statistics here for you from the data from California Continuum of Care Homelessness Response System, which showed a lot of the issues that are most important to us. One of the things that we've been doing is of 1,760 homeless individuals in Butte in 2020, 1,293 are individuals, and 495 in families with children, with 148 unaccompanied minors as of January 2020. The increase from 2019 was about 25 individuals, and up from 1,484 in early 2018. According to Ed Mayer, March 2021, Butte County has about 7,000 homeless people, including 500 plus children, since the 2018 fires. Thank you. That's it. Okay. Thank you, Donald. Our next figure is Angela Rydston. Angela, are you there? And can you unmute yourself, please? Hi. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead. I believe that the citizens of Chico should have a full accounting from the city of Chico on its disparity in the treatment of protesters, as witnessed at two recent city council meetings. I'm referring to the fact that several weeks ago, two individuals, in acting, were protesting their freedom of speech in the manner of their choosing, recited by the Chico Police Department. The two protesters did not prevent city councilors from entering the building, nor did they disrupt or prevent the meeting from taking place. Yet one was arrested, and the other cited later. Just last week, three women entered the city council chamber, deliberately ignoring current safety protocol to wear a mask. These women were not escorted out of the building. They were not arrested. In fact, they were permitted to disrupt and ultimately cause the postponement of the city council meeting. Everyone deserves equal treatment. We deserve answers. Is this just yet another tale of our two cities within one? Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Mary Kay Benson, I believe, is on again. I thought I spoke already, but if you didn't hear me, I'm happy to repeat. I just wanted to say that I'm a member of the North State Shelter Team, and we have sent in six proposals to the city council, and I would just like to reiterate that. I think we lost you there. Are you there? Right. I think we did. Okay. So, Mary Kay, if you can hear us, we cannot hear you. I will call Jeff. Hey, good evening, council. So, I don't know if you can hear me or not. My phone's kind of acting funny. We can hear you, Jeff. I just want to say, you know, I'm pretty tired of living in a dirty, nasty, violent city. And it's easy to point the finger without coming up with solutions. The problem I have with that is I came to the city with solutions four years ago, five years ago, I forgot. Talked to the police chief, talked to the city manager. What I tried to articulate, what I saw on the streets and the way they were handling homeless on the streets and the way they were handling trash and campers, they had no coherent plan from top to bottom. They had no coherent plan from top to bottom. They had no coherent plan from top to bottom. And the police chief kind of blew me off, said I didn't know what I was talking about when I've talked about enforcement strategies I've had experienced personally in multiple other communities. And the funny thing is between February and now, I've been rousted four times for illegal camping in my car. Isn't that funny? How many times has that happened in Chico? Never. So, what I would recommend is you really need a plan like Nicole was saying, kind of stole my thunder there. kudos to her you need a plan top to bottom you need to plan where people are going to exist you can't you know pull a harry potter and make people disappear with a magic wand and you can't just run people around like cattle with no clear objective and no clear goals like you have for the last three or four months i mean you're literally treating the people out at manchi creek like pigs in a pigsty there's not proper services out there there aren't enough toilets there's not enough hand washing and you keep them caged up just like pigs i'm not calling the people out there pigs i'm telling you the city's treating them like pigs and that's despicable and there's no reason for it the only reason for it is you haven't effectively come up with a plan in here and if you're not going to come up with a plan you know the judge is going to right judge is going to come down and come up with a plan for some of you contempt of court i wouldn't want to be there um so you know there's a million ideas out there you guys just need to come up with one and but it needs to be a complete plan it needs to talk about everything like how are you going to enforce you know and i have very little faith because like you know i'm out picking up trash this weekend trying to support my mayor and council and you know i'm looking at private properties that have been reported for years literally years i walked around one property with some people from the city you know in november december and i went back by it it's still trashed and if you can't do the basics you know that really doesn't give me any confidence or hope in your abilities as a management team and i know some of the council are new thank you jeff your time is up thank you um our last speaker is ben greenleaf hello can you hear me yes good evening thank you for the opportunity to speak my name is ben greenleaf april is sexual assault awareness and child abuse month so my story is appropriate i have lived in chico for 40 plus years as a child our family was poor and my parents had active drug addictions we hitchhiked from ukiah to chico approximately 1976 is when i got here i had my backpack and the boy scout tent were my belongings my parents found out i was smoking cigarettes by me by poking burned holes in my tent a stranger raped me in my tent by camping out by the russian river i learned that 70 percent of homeless youth report experiencing some form of violence 32 percent of which includes sexual assault the national runaway switchboard estimates that young people who identify as lgbt two-spirit are seven times more likely to be victims of crime and sexual assault than those who are not victims of crime and sexual assault than with their straight peers to attend school my parents and i would hitchhike me 16 miles to participate i did my homework in my tent i was a homeless child chico california is my hometown that is in my heart and i love it i have no hate for no one i love and forgive my parents they are professionally respected seniors and one of them has 35 years of sobriety and has parkinson's i am proud of them and i love them my journey is taking me out of the area and i want peace i'm living chico chaos because of the crises of no affordable housing in chico and butte county one of my daughters has been homeless since campfire is no longer living in her car she is a professional chico is moving out of the area to rent her house with other chico resident siblings as my wife and i are moving out of the county i'm attending the chico council zoom to demand the remaining council members the mayor the vice mayor and sean to revoke the declaration ongoing shelter first declared in excuse me i ask all of you to go beyond reconsidering your vote we need to take the time to think about this through the planned issue of long-term funding is settled what the chico city what the city council does now not back then is magical thinking chico will not ever be the same as it was we all must accept this fact because of our large population of the unsheltered local community we cannot control them through bullying constant harassment from the chico police department and the city council to be involved in these bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi bushi

bushi bushi bushi bushi without potentially violent mob. Also, employing more police officers to deal with the homeless is uncomfortable. We do not use our funds to arrest and find unsheltered people. We have no money. It's a continuous insane cycle of no resolve. The unsheltered are not business deals with the local police station and courts. Unsheltered Chicoans have been abandoned and dismissed. Ben, your time is expiring. Thank you. So that person had indicated. Can I ask you a quick question, Ms. Brossard? Yes. I know that it's probably quite difficult for folks to see their time. Is there any possibility of looking at a solution to that for Zoom? Yes, and I can check with the video booth as well. I believe that there should be a camera on that speaker timer. That is why we wanted to make sure. It was integrated, so I will double check that. So, yes, we can follow up with Kayvon on that one. But in addition, we had been asked for additional time on that person. That was our, well, we do have one more speaker, Marty Dunlap. What do you mean we were asked for additional time? Originally, we were told they had a speech impediment that would limit their ability to speak. And by law, they, okay. I didn't know. All right. And so, Marty Dunlap. Thank you. So, I just have two points that I want to make this evening. The first one has to do with the TRO in place and now having 40 tents at the Tichert Pond area, how important it is to be able to provide for the sanitation of those people camping there while the TRO is in place. There has been communication with the city as well as the provider of the porta potties. And they are awaiting that, okay, there has been a location that would work well. But we do need to make sure that the sanitation needs are covered during this three-week period for those who are camping currently at the Tichert Ponds. My second point has to do with how important it is to extend. The shelter crisis declaration. It makes no sense to not allow the city and the service providers access to those funds to not only provide for people who are unhoused, but also for people who need low-cost housing. And so, as things change within our area, the shelter crisis declaration and the funds that it allows to come in, to the city are critical. It makes no sense to not extend that beyond the date that it will be expiring on June 30th. Thank you. Okay, that is our last speaker for business from the floor. And I would like to make a note that we just checked with the video booth and what the speakers can see is the actual camera focused on that screen back there with the timer. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. So we will now move on to item four, public hearings. First, 4.1, a hearing to consider the 2021-22 draft annual action plan for the use of federal community development block grant CDGB, CDBG, and home investment partnership home funds. If you would like to speak on this item, please raise your hand in Zoom and you'll be called on when the public hearing is opened. And we will start with a report from Reed Demers. Demers. Demers, our housing manager. Or perhaps it's Mary Jo. Okay. So Mary Jo, go ahead. Yeah, can you hear me? Yes. We can. Okay. Can I share my screen perhaps? I believe you can. Stine is giving you. Uh, perhaps we've got enough commission to do that. Uh, perhaps we've got enough commission to do that. Uh, perhaps we've got enough commission to do that. Uh, perhaps we've got enough commission to do that. Uh, perhaps we've got enough commission to do that. Uh, perhaps we've got enough commission to do that. Uh, perhaps we've got enough commission to do that. Uh, perhaps we've got enough commission to do that. Okay. There you go. Okay, Mary Jo, you can go ahead. Sorry. I didn't realize that I was muted. Okay. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council members. I'm Mary Jo Alonzo, Housing Specialist for the City, and I'm before you tonight to present the draft 2021-2022 Annual Plan for Public Hearing as required for use of our federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, known as HUD. The City is an entitlement community whereby funds are annually allocated by a formula based upon a number of demographics. The funds assist the City in addressing the needs of low-income households and neighborhoods in our community. Every five years, a consolidated plan is developed with broad goals to be achieved over the subsequent five years. The priority needs identified in the 2020-2024 plan include affordable housing, homeless prevention, homeless services, neighborhood revitalization, and economic development. The draft annual plan represents the second year of the currently adopted Consolidated Plan. The City has been notified that it will receive $909,886 in CDBG funds and $532,834 in home funding for the 21-22 program year. This represents a 4% increase in CDBG funds and a 2% decrease in and home funds from last year. Staff estimates that there will be an unexpended CDBG funds of approximately $629,000 available to carry forward into the current year. And it's anticipated that there will be a carryover of approximately $2.7 million in home funds. These carryover funds are included in the total amount available funds shown on the proposed budget, included with the staff report as attachments seen. These figures may change if the city receives program income, which is the repayment of loans during the remainder of the current fiscal year. The annual action plan was drafted by staff based on projects, activities, and goals established in both the city's federal consolidated plan and the city's housing element, which satisfies state priorities. As detailed in the budget, a lion's share of the CDBG and home funding is going toward affordable housing projects, two of which are located on city-owned land and have been in the pipeline for development for several years. The city has invested interest in continuing the funding for these projects and activities. The home funds have limited uses, and eligible activities include the tenant-based rental assistance, or TBUR, program, the construction of rental housing, such as Creekside Place in 1297, Park Avenue, and Grant Program Administration. Proposed CDBG activities have a broader overall range of eligible activities than home, but somewhat restricted housing uses. Staff's recommendations for this grant are also in accordance with the priorities identified during the city's update to its current consolidated plan and the city's housing element. Utilizing CDBG funds, the draft plan includes funding for housing programs and projects. This includes sewer connections and program delivery, offsite infrastructure for a habitat humanity site at Wisconsin St., and for development costs related to the multifamily development at Creekside. Housing services such as TBUR administration and labor compliance monitoring are included. included. Economic development activities are provided through the Small Business Development Center. Code enforcement activities also fall under CDBG and program administration, which includes general program administration, fair housing, and also money for the COC. The last planned activity for CDBG funds is for public services. The funding recommendations for these funds came from the Ad Hoc Citizens Advisory Committee, which was selected by the City's Finance Committee. The Citizens Advisory Committee met twice to listen to applicant presentations, then met to review, rank, and rate the public services applications. The committee came to a unified consensus for funding the top five rated applications based on the following. Funding recommendations were directed at organizations that were providing services directly to individuals. The committee was also directed to organizations that were providing services directly to individuals needing the assistance, rather than for utilities and or maintenance costs. The committee weighed case management services higher, especially for those who are mentally ill because there aren't as many sources of funding for those services. Funding was recommended for organizations whose budgets showed the greatest need and was presented in a clear and accurate manner. Each of the five funded organizations were recommended at funding at 80% of the requested budget, with CHAT receiving the remaining balance. Outreach to the public on the annual plan has been made through notices in the local paper, on the City's website, and through community meetings, and at tonight's public hearing. The next steps in the process. The draft plan has been available for review since last week and is open for the public to comment until May 18th. It's available to be on the City's housing website and comments may be made either at today's hearing in writing to the email address on the screen or at the City Council public hearing on May 18th. Conclusion of tonight's meeting, the committee development director recommends you schedule a final public hearing for the annual plan at the May 18th council meeting. This concludes my report and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. I have a question. Can you explain the process you used to kick off one of the ad hoc committee members the finance committee voted to put on the ad hoc committee? Which meeting in particular would you like me to explain? Say that again? Which meeting did you want me to explain? No, I didn't ask you to explain the meeting. I asked you to explain the process you used. The finance committee voted on a certain amount of ad hoc committee members and your group got rid of one. I would like to know the process you used to do that. I'm not asking you to explain the process. I'd also like to know by whose authority because it did not come from the finance committee. The authority for that decision was made by the city attorney and the city manager. The city attorney? Yes. I'll check on that. Thank you. All right. Further questions? Go ahead, Abby. Go ahead. Thank you. I see the meeting minutes here in the report. Were the advisory committee meetings open to the public? Yes. The advisory meetings were open to the public. There was emails went out and the link to the meeting was live on the city's website. Okay. And then for the good of the public, can you explain why funds may not be expended and would be carried on to the following? Yes. That's a good question. I would say like a normal budget, there's planned uses for the funds and different priorities may get shifted through the year on different projects. Marie may want to talk in specific about maybe why certain money was set aside, but the HUD funding doesn't have the requirements of having to use all of the funding in one year. There are timeliness requirements, but they're not. So you can set aside money for a project, for instance. How have we've done that with the home funds? Thank you. I had a couple more questions and this might be slightly out of the scope, so just let me know if not, but this is my understanding that there are over 200 affordable housing units. And that's a lot of money. a better, a better secure a schedule to revert to market rate and then your future. Can you share any impacts this would have on inventory and what's being done to secure the needed units for the community as a whole? Yeah, I would feel more comfortable if Marie was a bit, I know that she's on and hopefully she can speak on this question in particular. I know that we keep track of that and we work closely on, you know, to keep track of that. We try to keep those affordable, but she may have more details than I do. Is Marie on? She's not on actually. We'll be able to take these questions down and we'll get the information back. Oh, it looks like she's on now. I think she just got on. Marie, you're on. Are you there? Hi, I'm here. I'm Ben. I trust you hear me now? Yes. Okay, great. Yes. So, Council Member Brown and the rest of the council, those units are tracked. I'm usually in good communication with Ed Mayer of the Housing Authority because we both have interest in making sure that the units stay affordable. And right now there are two projects and they are in basically in different stages of planning. One is of negotiating their continuance. I don't know all the details, but I did check in with Ed and we definitely, they're on track to continue their affordability. Good. I'm hopeful to hear that. As it relates to the new affordable housing coming online, is that also being built with covenants? Oh, absolutely. And how long will those be for? They're 55-year covenants. Okay. And then the last question that I have is that the $120,000 is being spent on the housing fund for land use for code enforcement listed in the report. Can you explain how that's expected to benefit the people who live in low income neighborhoods? Yes. So, basically those funds have to be utilized within the low income census tracts. And it essentially makes sure that things are, you don't have substandard housing, you don't have extraneous trash or other things that shouldn't be accumulating in people's yards, et cetera. So it just keeps the neighborhoods in tidy order and can identify issues that the other thing could be substandard housing. So if you have a landlord or, you know, that's not taking care of their property, if there's a complaint made, then a code enforcement officer would go out there and work with that property owner to bring the unit into compliance. Thank you. And sorry, I actually do have one more question. When we count the home ownership rate in our area, are we counting mobile homeowners? I don't know that off the top of my head. I'd have to check. I know that we count units, types of units, and mobile homes are definitely a separate one. I don't know if that's considered home ownership or not. Or if it has to be on a permanent foundation. Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks, Marie. If you want, I can also answer that other question in regards to the carry forward of funds. A lot of those have already been allocated. And so it's just a matter of like, for instance, the Creekside Place project, we're due to close those loans next week, hopefully. So those funds have just been sitting there waiting, you know, for those loans to close. I appreciate it. Thanks. All right. Further council questions? I had a question. Councilman. In regards to the agencies that were chosen to receive the CAC Public Service Awards, I noticed that Youth for Change and CAA were not included in the five. When I looked into that, I know that you decided on budgets that indicated need. And CHAT had an ending budget of $375K plus in Jesus Center. And CHAT had an ending budget balance of $680K plus. Whereas Youth had only $23,000 and change. And CAA noted zero. Which would make it seem that the budget need is a lot higher for Youth and CAA instead of CHAT or JC. Could you explain that for me? Sure. This is Marie. So that was just one of the factors that the committee considered. There were numerous factors. And as you can see, oh, we can't really see that slide right now. The total request was so much greater. I think it was almost double or I can't remember exactly. And so obviously there had to be some choices made. So budget was just one of the factors in how they were presented. All right. Further questions? I have one quick question. On Creekside, can you give me an approximate of when that is breaking ground? And will that be finishing this year or next year? Or do you know? They hope to be breaking ground within the next couple of weeks. Fingers crossed. We're going to close that escrow next week. And then as far as completion goes, they would be coming online early 2023. All right. Any further questions? I do have one. So in terms of code enforcement, so I think that was $120,000. Is that correct? Correct. So does that designate one code enforcement officer who deals, I would guess it would be somewhere in the ballpark of one that would be just designated for that issue in particular all year long? No. So it's actually a few areas. So it's a city that have, there are low-income census tracts. So if I recall correctly, I think it's about two out of the three code enforcement officers. And a portion of it is for the administration as well, the person who handles that. Okay. But do you know if we track that back to like hours spent in terms of, or is it just lumped into the general? It's definitely tracked. It has to be tracked for other purposes. Okay. All right. Just wanted to make sure. So, and Mr. Arm, you had something as well? Yeah, I think it, whenever there's a council question, I think it deserves answering appropriately. And I didn't authorize the removal of any appointee, just so you know. And I wasn't aware whether the city attorney did or not. I think it was an error that was made by staff to have a conversation with the individual. I think there was some mutual agreement. Okay, we'll just go ahead and leave it as is. That's been corrected. I think staff understands. That when there is a direct appointee of a body of the council, that they will bring that back to then bring that recommendation forward. So, for whatever that's worth, staff learned a lesson through this. And so, thank you. Thank you. You bet. This is Alex. I actually have a clarification question, not necessarily for Mark, but on that topic. Did council vote to have finance committee appoint these members? Yes, that would be 2015. 2015. Okay, so that's the standard practice. Correct. Thank you. All right. Further questions or clarifications? All right. At this point in time, we will open the hearing. Are there any speakers on this item? We have two. The first one is Jeff Creed and followed by Anastasia Snyder. All right. And we'll let them go ahead and proceed. Madam Clerk? Okay, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Good evening, Council. This is Anastasia Snyder, Executive Director at Catalyst Domestic Violence Services. I just wanted to pop on and thank the Council for the continued support of our work and the work of the agencies funded under public services. And if you had any questions specifically about the Catalyst application, I'm here to answer that. Otherwise, I will just say thank you. Okay, thank you. We'll try and see. Jeff, are you available now? I don't see him any longer in the queue for this item. All right, so at this point in time, we'll close the public hearing, and then the recommendation is schedule a public hearing on the final annual. So do we have any Council member direction? I guess you're looking for a motion to schedule the second presentation. I am indeed. Of this, and is that supposed to be 30 days away from the date that was? Correct, yeah, it would be the meeting on May 18th. Well, we moved this meeting back a week, so I'm not sure it's the same meeting. But regardless, yeah, I would make the motion. I would make the motion that we schedule a second meeting to whatever date it needs to be by law. Is that what's on the agenda? All right, we have a motion on the second. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Dinley? Aye. Council Member Hubert? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 7-0. All right, thank you all. All right, moving on to the regular agenda item 5.1, unmanned aerial system program presentation. Mr. Mattin. Chief Mattin. Welcome. Thank you, Mayor. Yes. Vice Mayor Council, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this topic tonight. Let's see if we can get that computer up and going. So just a couple things. One, I have a question. I have a PowerPoint for you tonight, and I appreciate it. I did get some questions from Council previous, so we tried to create a presentation that will answer a lot of the questions that came up early on from that. And then certainly at the end of the presentation, I'll be able to answer any additional questions that you would have. So can I kind of work away from... I'm going to talk specifically about the Chico Police Department and what we're doing and what our technology looks like. So this is our unmanned aerial systems in the future of public safety. I want to give credit to some of my staff. This is a PowerPoint that was really designed by Lieutenant Mike Williams, Officer Jack Diddy, and Jordan Saldana for a community group. That was looking at ways to assist your police department with technology. So just the introduction, just purpose and use of drones. We're going to talk about drones as a first responder. Development of the Chico Police Department unmanned aerial system program. And we're going to talk about training and certification. Now, I'm going to just tell you right now, growing up in... I'm going to talk a lot about the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration. Although growing up in Butte County, I grew up around FFA. So I'm just going to apologize now because I've done it several times. Moving forward, if I happen to mention FFA, I'm actually referring to the Federal Aviation. So purpose and use of drones. So one thing I want council to understand is that we, as a police department, have been looking into drones for the last several years. As far as actually deploying them. And we're not looking at the agency, our size, and budget. We're behind the times of this technology. But we also understand our community. And we really wanted to slow walk this through to make sure that we do it right. This is really, really important stuff. So some of the things that we're going to use drones for is crime scene photos, setting perimeters, locating suspects, missing persons, search and rescues. We've already used it in both of those missing persons and search and rescue operations. When we collaborate with the fire department, but you can search and rescue and things like that. We were successful several months ago in using fire system to help us locate somebody who was missing and suffering from dementia. Major accident investigation, MATE, is what we call that. When we have a major accident, we are required by the state of California to put together a factual investigation. Especially if it's a crime scene. Especially in fatalities. So being able to obtain that evidence is important. Surveillance on criminal activity and narcotics, trapping, child control, critical incident management. Community relations. We are a member of the Explosive Ordnance Detail, which is a regional team here in Butte County. And, of course, training. And I'm going to get a little more in-depth on some of these topics here. So aerial visibility and intelligence is critical. Better, faster situations. And I'm going to get a little more in-depth on some of these topics here. It keeps responding officers safe. It replaces traditional costly tools such as manned aircraft, which is very expensive. Improves our response time and ultimately will reduce crime. So drones as a first responder, proactive versus reactive. Now, I want to establish this right off the bat. These types of systems do not replace police officers. They are just an extension and a tool for us. So as I go through and explain this program, I want you to think about some of the other programs that law enforcement has, such as the K-9 program. That K-9 is just an extension of that police officer, and that K-9 can only do exactly what a police officer can do, can only be where a police officer can be. There's not much difference when we're talking about this system as well, so there's a little bit of comparison there for you. Fully integrated into emergency response operations, we're seeing that on a regional basis. You'll have a video a little bit coming out of Reading where they used theirs during the car fire and integrated with fire, and we're able to work together on evacuations and other things. Focus on telepresence and sharing intelligence. Again, does not replace officers, but rather enhance what officers are able to do. This one's interesting. Enhanced de-escalation, providing officers with critical information. To formulate plans and tactics as a response to emergencies. So I know we've heard, this council's heard a lot about de-escalation and crisis intervention training. There's two things that you really need for de-escalation to be effective. You need some time and you need some space. And so drones potentially could allow that, depending on the circumstances, and could assist us in facilitating that type of response. Lower cost options. Again, don't be afraid to be Normackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackack We've gone to just about every one of these agencies. We've looked at their technology. We've talked to the officers and really kind of built the program up from that. Obviously, this was a community slide, but you know, we are the largest city in North Sacramento, largest city in Butte County, 136 square miles. We have no helicopter unit or air unit, so we rely on a mutual aid from Butte County Sheriff's Office. Their helicopter is not always available as their helicopter is designed to do certain functions for the Sheriff's Office, not just in the sky, flying around, waiting for us to call. And that also goes with CHP. So what's interesting is there is a CHP helicopter in Redding, but that is not in our area. Our area requires us to ask for air support from CHP out of Auburn. So, and it's not always available. And being in the Sacramento Valley region, competing against larger agencies with those requests tend to be a problem for us. So just some perspective from command staff and how we went with this. You know, like I said, this really started the process under my predecessor, but I also believed in the technology. For me right now, concerned over our HOUG profile and national instances involving these forces, Chico PD has great training equipment, but no routine aerial support. No one wants to be in the air. No one calls under stress. And often do not communicate crucial details to dispatch. That's actually your people that are reporting crimes. So sometimes that information can be lacking. Officers respond to scenes with limited information, which can put them and the public at a greater risk. Technology enhancements get crucial information to officers before they arrive on scene and are critical for de-escalation. We're going to talk about some of those technologies you're probably going to see coming forward in the near future. So some of those technologies is live 911. That's where technology is heading for law enforcement here in California. Where at some point a police officer responding to the scene is actually going to be able to listen and hear real time 911 calls going directly into dispatch. They're going to hear the descriptions. They're going to hear the locations. And so kind of where this technology is all going. Transparency and data dashboards. Currently right now your officers all have what's called an MDT, mobile data terminal, in their car. That gives them the call that gets the description. It gives them a mapping system to get them to where they're going to go. We've got department wide body-worn camera program. At some point we're looking at technology where a lot of the body-worn camera technology right now is real manual. You've got to physically turn it on. You're going to see integration where an officer actually gets out of the car. It's going to know the officer's out of the car. It's going to turn on the camera. It's going to notify everybody that the camera is on. So it takes away some human error under stressful conditions. Cell phone deployment. You've already seen that. Cat on cell phones with GPS. We have that now where some of our supervisors can actually run that call on the cat system right from their phone. And so now you're talking about unmanned aerial to assist them in their efforts. So again, we've been thinking about this for a long time. We wanted to get desired outcomes and missions that were very well defined and what this operation and what this system looks like. Instead of focusing on procuring the equipment, we actually started a working group and studied the issue to find the operations and develop policy ever before we came out and started looking at actually purchasing the equipment. This working group watched other agencies, researched, and did a lot of follow-up. Again, we kind of slow-walked this approach, making sure we're going to do it right. All UAS presentation will be provided to police. We already did this. So just so you know, Council, we did do a presentation on this program to our Police Community Advisory Board. Council Member Reynolds is on that board. And also we are here in front of Council tonight in our community to talk about the program. Unmanned aerial system operations policy. We posted on the city. We posted on the city website. Another recommendation coming out of that, along with that, coming out of PCAB, was to do a FAQ along with that to answer some of the more common questions people will have regarding this technology. So again, the Federal Aviation Administration oversees the use of this type of equipment. So for the police department, before we can even get this program up and going, we're going to have to get a certificate of authorization from FAA. That's going to require them to look at our policy, our procedures. It's going to require that any operator that's been assigned to this team has also received all the FAA-required training. It's going to require us to have a program coordinator of a management-level personnel to oversee and monitor the program. And they're going to look at operation applicable laws. And they're going to look at policies and procedures. So we, as your police department, is in that process right now. Officers are receiving FAA training. And we are currently working on obtaining that certification of authorization. All of these things will need to be in place prior to going operational with this type of equipment. So some of the FAA certifications is that we need the LA Regional Training Center as the location where that training goes. Each operator, if anybody is operating one of these, they have to have the basic ground school. And they have to have the tactical and operation support certificate. And then they also have to have a nighttime operator's course. So pretty extensive training. Our officers have not completed all that training yet. There's a lot of studying and a lot of requirements because they're required to test on all these different laws to make sure they know and they can pass those tests. Just like a canine. So we're talking about policy. So most of you have been engaged with the police department. You understand our policy. We have a vendor by Lexapol. Lexapol continues to provide updated best practice policy to your police department that falls in line with state federal law. So it's going to give, that policy is going to have a purpose and scope. It's going to talk about the privacy issues pertaining to UAS operations. It's going to talk about authorized uses. It will definitely talk about prohibited uses. And it will also address the data retention. So we've also talked about the fact with Lexapol that they can produce a policy, but your police department can actually make it more stringent. They can't take it back because that's the best practice. And a lot of that they won't allow you to change because it's all based on law. So we are looking at several different policies from different agencies. I can tell you from the original Lexapol policy that I saw, we will be adding some additional and more. We will be adding some additional information into there. Talking specifically about use and training. That goes above and beyond the scope. So this is where we get into the capabilities. I think this is where a lot of the questions come in when you talk about law enforcement and this type of equipment. So the law would not allow and we will not have equipment that will have technology for facial recognition. We also will not have the technology on this equipment for automatic license plate reading capability. This equipment will never be weaponized. It will never be armed. It will have no use of force capabilities. And it will not be a tool for violating the expectation of privacy or the protections on the fourth and 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The fourth amendment which addresses privacy. This amendment addresses search and seizure. And the 14th amendment that addresses due process and equal rights and protections under the law. So where do we get from here? So again, slow walk this. It has been a process of a couple of years doing the research. We got approached by the Chapino Feed folks, a fundraising event. We started talking about this. And we came out and did a presentation. They were very thought this was really important technology for their police department. This came to council on consent to accept that donation of approximately $26,000. That was approved. And so we're on our way on trying to build out this program. Currently right now, one sergeant and four officers were selected onto the UAS unit. And the program director is Lieutenant Mike Williams, a management level officer in the organization that will oversee this program. Now, here's the interesting part. Only those officers that have that training, those four officers right there, can operate these. That's it. You can't just go, well, they're not working right now and we really want to put the drone up. It doesn't work that. Remember, this is equipment. This equipment is an extension of a police officer. It can only be where we have the legal rights to be. And you can only use it under very strict guidelines. And that training has to be there. So the one thing that we're going to add to our policy is a patrol sergeant who oversees supervisor, frontline supervision, can request the use of this. So we're going to make sure that our sergeants understand what the laws are. But it's up to the operator to control the equipment who is trained in that. So that's the important part. Got a little video for you? . . . . . . . . . . . . What do you mean? Anyone's looking? Being a plumber on 17th, sorry. Backyard, 17th, sorry. Black flipper, black hat, black pants. One at gunpoint. One at gunpoint. This is one way Modesto police are using drones to combat crime. Drones are helping local law enforcement step into the future. The Clearwater Police Department has two drones in its arsenal. Situations like the one just last week where a robbery suspect wanted on gun charges was on the run, trying to escape from officers by attempting to hop over a fence. In a northwest Modesto neighborhood, unaware he was being watched from above. A suspect comes out. He's a felon that's wanted for a robbery that had occurred recently. He comes out of the house. He's not able to get out of the backyard before we're able to direct officers to where he's at. For all agencies using drones right now, privacy is a big concern. And it's written into state law. We don't want to use this and will not use this and cannot legally use this for a patrol function just to see what's happening. Or what may happen. And while a chopper is very costly to operate, drones are much cheaper. When you have this helicopter, the fuel cost, the maintenance cost, the manpower cost, there's a lot involved in that. Drones pose much less of a risk to the public and pilots. We can also use it for looking for suspects in certain areas. We can monitor one of our canines tracking. New technology some residents we talked with said would help reduce crime in a city suffering from a shortage of officers. And if they can't have more officers on the ground, they'll at least have more eyes in the sky. We've been using our UAVs a lot as of late to help us on patrol. But we've also used them in mass incidents or mass or critical incidents, I guess you'd say. With the car fire that came through just a couple years ago, we were able to use our UAV team in its, I guess its infancy, before we had a lot of officers on the ground. So we've been able to use a lot of these bigger pieces of equipment. And also just allowing, assisting with outside agencies with fire status. In a live fire, we're able to utilize our UAVs to check to see if a fire is still active in a certain area. Using heat vision, we're able to give live up-to-date information to firefighters saying, okay, this fire still has hot spots here, here, here, here. Or give that information, whatever they need from us. We have a lot of information. We've been able to be diligubes in operations for operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related to operations related limited uses of our UAVs and it's very important that we are not violating the trust and the privacy of our citizens. There's a lot of issues regarding fourth amendment, search and seizure, and reasonable expectations of privacy that can be violated with these things if a department is not responsible. So that's why whenever we are operating our UAVs, we have to follow policy. We require supervisor approval for every flight and we use these things in accordance with this policy so we don't create a bad reputation regarding this technology and it allows us to keep the community and the public on our side. As being a police officer in Northern California, it's exciting to see that this technology that we have been utilizing here at the Reading Police Department is catching interest in other areas as well. And it's an honor for myself and I can speak for other officers at this department to be able to be a department that others are looking at for the implementation of their own. I appreciate the fact that Chico Police Department is looking at our specific UAV team as a potential model for moving forward with their own and I have no doubts that implementing a UAV program for Chico PD will make that community a better and safer place for its citizens as well as a better and safer workplace for its officers. So again, just our unmanned aerial system operators. It is the extension of that operator. If we can go into a backyard to go after a suspect, we can use the drone. If there's Fourth Amendment issues that don't fall under exigent circumstances, just like any time out, you'll need to obtain a search warrant from a judge. Again, so just to answer a few of the questions that we've had in the past, I'm going to go ahead and ask a few questions that kind of came up. And so when we looked at some of the potential uses we would use them, a question came up, well, how would you use them in a, or why would you use them in a crowd control environment? Well, lucky for us, when we've had protests and different things, at least the last few years, they've maintained peaceful protests and we defend people's constitutional rights to do that. The only time you would probably ever even consider using something like this is if you had a protest, if you had a protest, if you had a protest, if you had a protest, where you had agitators or somebody starting to commit a crime or agitate the crowd, and typically you want to address those people that are the bad actors and not your citizens are out protesting, you could use something like this to identify who they are, descriptions of who they are. I got a question about swarming capabilities. I didn't even know what that meant, so I had to do some research. Remember, these will never be operating in a crowd control environment. I'm not saying that they're not operating in a crowd control environment. I'm saying that they're operating under artificial intelligence, meaning you can't have some machine or something using it. It's man controlled. It is a designated officer working the machine. It's a line of sight, by the way, too. It's not anything that you can sit here and take a drone and fly it up to Upper Park five miles away. It's got to be a line of sight for the officer. Okay, so that's in the policy. Data retention. That falls under any other data retention issues that we have on city rule. When it comes to law enforcement. So just like body cams and other data that we extract off of this, we have to maintain it for a certain amount of time. So that data retention policy applies for just about everything we do at the police department, whether it's a police report, evidence in a crime, video surveillance, you know, that we pulled off, you know, off of a camera. It's the same concept and the same data issues are there. Again, no ALPR. No staff, no facial recognition, no weaponization. And then finally, I think I've answered all those questions. So at this point, thank you for the time to do the presentation. And I will take any questions if you have any. All right. Questions for the chief? This is Alex. I have a quick question. Fire away. Thanks, Chief. I actually answered a handful that I already had. So you can take the first one. I'm sorry I missed that presentation. You mentioned researching mistakes in other communities. Can you tell us some of the mistakes departments have advised that we avoid in our deployment of this technology? You know, I haven't been a part of that UAS working group, just getting reports back. So for us, I can only really speak for us of, you know, being two years of researching this and exactly when and where other agencies had met that threshold to put their programs into service? I don't know. I would imagine that and just knowing that technology that probably the main concern for most community groups would be the privacy issues and the officers using these. So for us, I don't want to speak for us, and that is, you know, we want to make sure that officers are trained and there's specific policy that this whole thing is implemented before they ever go into the sky. And so that's why this working group's been in place for several years. Great. And just on that note, if somebody feels that their privacy has in some way been infringed on, how can they go about resolving, reporting, or addressing that issue? It'd be like any other time that you would have either a complaint or more than likely a service complaint to the police department, basically just saying, I don't think that it was used properly. Those are, we investigate those. We investigate administratively. And we're all, you know, from the police department, we're all accountable for our actions. So that would be a normal complaint process. And we would certainly do an investigation on that. Even if it wasn't, it's just a service complaint where somebody's complaining about the drone itself and maybe not the actions of an officer. Got it. Thank you. And for the sake of transparency, will we track the deployment of this technology so that the public can know when it is used? Yes, we will track that. And because I think it's going to be very successful just looking at the other agencies and what they've been able to accomplish. So that's certainly something that I want to track. And I appreciate the fact that you had a citizen group that purchased this for your police department. I'd like to make sure, counsel, and ensure that, you know, statistically, if this is very successful moving forward, potentially expanding it. So, yes, that will be tracked. And again, also, I think we want to be very, very careful about the amount of data that we're going to be tracking. And I think that's going to be very, very important. I think we're going to be very transparent with this. So we're going to create a page on our website, on the police department website, with the policy, with the FAQ, and we'll be very open and honest about what we're doing. Thank you so much. And then during your presentation, you noted that the drone technology will reduce crime. Can you explain your respect on that? Are there data to kind of support that? Yeah, I think we're going to be much more successful in apprehending criminals. When somebody runs into a creek and we can't find them and there's not a canine, more than likely we're going to locate them with this type of technology. That's what I see, is the ability to slow the officers down and use this technology to systematically conduct searches. And, you know, these things will really, really help us, especially in this community where you have lots of parks and waterways and trees and foliage and greenery and all the things that are going on, it makes it difficult to search and locate and apprehend criminals. Great, thank you. And for other communities who have implemented this technology, have they seen reductions in crime? They have. You saw right there with Redmond Police Department, that was a spokesperson in one of their drone operators that we worked with for the last few years. And statistically, they have seen a reduction in crimes with the utilization of the program. Thank you. I couldn't hear the video on my end, so I appreciate you filling that in. And the last question that I have is, the Police Community Advisory Board, am I understanding correctly that you have reinstated that group? I have. Can you advise the public on when they can expect to be able to attend or participate or listen in on those meetings? Because this was the first that I'd heard of the reestablishment of the group. Well, not so much reestablishment. It's been there since 1995. But when I took over as Chief, there's been some changes. And meeting with the police, I've been able to do that. Uh, I've been meeting with the advisory board, and we're making some changes to the Board. I anticipate bringing that forward to Council and bringing that Board before you to ask those questions and see what it looks like. But ultimately, when I took over as Chief, I've talked to the current Board Members and I've talked to many former Board Members and several of you in this room, and I've got a lot of feedback and a lot of information on where potentially that's going to be discussed. board needs to go and it's in a different direction than how it was designed when i took it so i'm more than happy when i believe i don't know if i'll be ready but i think we did put it sometime in may to come back to you and bring that board in front of you and have that conversation thanks i'll look forward to it and is the intention to have the public outside of the board be able to participate or listen in or comment that is the ultimate goal right now what we're looking at is uh revamping that creating a new mission statement taking in a different direction and creating a board where we have agendized meetings we produce minutes from those meetings and ultimately produce an annual report to the community as to that board's actions and recommendations that they will make back to the police department thanks chief thanks for the thorough presentation tentatively scheduled for may 18th tentatively scheduled for may 18th all right mr huber you had a question thanks yeah thank you very much chief man i had asked the city manager to to have you answer some questions and i really appreciate the thoroughness of your presentation i think you did a great job and i think we really learned a lot from it it answered a lot of the questions that i had and some community members had directed to me so thank you for that i guess maybe the the one question that i have is what what's the trigger what what triggers the use of a drone what what is it uh that what sort of event do you wait for to happen to decide to use one or is there some criteria for that that's a great question so it could be uh tree selected let's say that uh our narcotics officers have obtained a search warrant to search a house you know we may have have information that, you know, anytime that goes, that's a dangerous situation. We can actually insert the information into the search warrant for the judge to allow us to use a drone in that situation, provide extra security, things like that. What really is going to spur the use of this is exigent circumstances where you are actively engaged in some type of going on with the police department, like a vehicle pursuit that ends and the suspect takes foot mail and runs into a neighborhood. Remember, it's anytime an officer can be there, that's where it can be. Think of it also as a helicopter, because the rules apply exactly the same. So you can't just fly your helicopter around at the sheriff's office and fly around into people's backyards and see. You can't just see what they're doing just because you want to or you're just curious. You can't do that. And so we're under those same, you know, the mindset, if you think about if we had a helicopter, we're only going to be able to use that. So we get a vehicle pursuit, something that maybe we can back off and track the vehicle. I don't know we're going to have the type of technology that's going to track it 30 square miles around the city, but, you know, those are options. That's where that technology can go, and that's what you're seeing other agencies. Use. But really it's going to be under more exigent circumstances. Search and rescue issues, a missing person, a suspect fleeing, you know, potentially other serious crimes that are occurring that can help move officers into positions more safely and effectively. So there will be a lead officer that would be contacted to make the decision, and then the additional officers that are qualified to fly the drones would then be able to fly the drones. So that's going to be empowered to go forward. So the way it's going to be designed is you're going to have a lieutenant, a manager that oversees the program. From there, your field supervisors are going to receive training on when and how they can use it. If a field supervisor, say right now who's in charge out there on the streets, says, oh my gosh, we had this and I need a drone, he's going to ask his watch commander or that program director, I want to deploy this. Then he's going to have to have the drone. So you're going to have one of those four officers that's certified to use it. If they're not available, they're going to have to maybe look at another agency for a mutual aid response or something like that, which by the way, we will also be able to provide to our law enforcement partners as well with this technology as well. So I'll give you an example. I think last year, Blaine County had a chase that came into Chico, several armed subjects, I think it was an armed robbery, and crashed over in San Diego. And then we saw the town and everybody took the foot bail and it was just a mess. But now it's our problem because it's in the city of Chico. I'd like to be able to control those situations better because that's now our scene. And in something like that, we can slow it down. We can get a larger perimeter and take our time and do more systematic type of searches with technology to locate. We can communicate through the drones. So if we had somebody hiding in a bush and we have it surrounded, we can talk to them. Right? We can say, hey, you know, whatever, and try to use that technique. So for me, I understand exactly what you're saying, but the vision of this is going to be when you need something up now to help us provide safety, lock things down, and protect your community, that's when we're going to use them. Thank you again. All right. Further questions for the chief? I don't necessarily have a question, but one thing I did appreciate from the presentation at PCAB was how many hours of training it was that they went through to be able to get the certification. Like, it wasn't easy, and it's not a very, it sounds like some are a little bit nervous about taking the test. Like, it's not an easy test to pass. And also that this isn't just like, oh, that officer's not on, so we're just going to grab any old pilot and we're going to throw this thing up in the air. Like, it's only going to be the four or six people that are trained for it and very, very highly, yeah, a lot going into it. So it's not just willy-nilly throwing it out there. And I think for you, you know, knowing that the City of Chico, we have some of this technology in other departments, but what we don't want to do is put somebody from another department that hasn't had the level of training that you have to have to be law enforcement to go and put them up and maybe put other staff in a situation where they don't quite understand that technology. So I'm sorry I don't have the hours, but Councilmember, you're right, because she actually got the program director, so he knew how many hours. But right now I know they're studying for a major, major test that they have to take and pass. So thank you for that. All right. So just if you would take one minute and talk about this group that donated it, I'd love to hear about it. Yeah. So I don't know much. They're kind of just a fly, kind of low type of group. It's the Chipino Feed, the Chico Community Group. They host this luncheon every year, Chipino Feed, and they raise money. But then they come back. And they're not going to be able to get the food. They're going to be able to get the food. And then they look at how they can reinvest those donations back into their communities. So it's not just law enforcement. I know they've done a lot of great things in our community with parks and different areas. Particularly, they approached us and said, hey, we had our Chipino Feed. We've got some funding. And is there anything out there the police department? For me, we were just getting to the point where we're like, okay, I think we're getting close. Now we've got to try to secure funding. And I think we've asked for funding a little bit in the past. During budget. But obviously with all the other things going on, that wasn't very much of a priority. So I appreciate what they've done because they're essentially getting a program up and running. It'll be up to the police department to come back to you during budget, provide the information and statistical data on whether that's working or not, and whether council wants to continue to fund a program like this. All right. Well, many thanks to them for that as well. So, Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have? I think we have about a quarter. No speakers on this item. Thank you very much. Thank you, Council. Oh. Did we have someone or no? Okay. All right. So this was an information only item. So at this point in time, we'll take a short recess. Just to be clear, I'm very tired and I'm thinking it will disappear in a long time. Just a moment. Okay. Thank you. We've got about 15 minutes for questions. We've got about 15 minutes for questions. We've got about 15 minutes for questions. We've got about 15 minutes for questions. Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Okay, we'll reconvene. Item 5.2, confirmation of Deputy City Manager appointment. And if you wish to speak on this item, please raise your hand now in Zoom. Mr. Orem. Yes, Honorable Mayor, members of the Council, thank you very much. Trustworthy, dedicated, and honest local officials who can get the job done effectively are necessary to combat the ever present black eye government earns at the federal level, the state level, all the way down to the various other government jurisdictions throughout the nation. Overall, Chico has been truly blessed to have steady leadership that exudes such qualities and our organization is always looking to continue building upon those essential attributes. That is why I'm truly excited and very thankful that Ms. Jennifer McCarthy has accepted the role of Deputy City Manager for our fine city. After starting in local government over 27 years ago and forging a path of excellence through tenures at the community college level, serving many years at the Tri-County Economic Development Corporation, and finally serving with the County of Butte, ending with her Deputy Administrative Officer role, she has served faithfully, respectfully, and successfully in a leadership capacity. Well respected in and reliable, Jennifer is the right fit for Chico. I will tell you that I will have her immediately jump into all things economic development and all things strategic planning, two vitally important aspects of what we do in local government. Without further ado, I seek to do the following that I as City Manager am proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Ms. Jennifer McCarthy as the Deputy City Manager. I am also proposing to appoint Ms. McCarthy with an annual salary of $163,000.00. and 163,000.00. thousand dollars i respectfully request council's confirmation of this appointment and wish to thank miss mccarthy for being here tonight to make your acquaintance with that i seek your confirmation thank you all right questions do you have any public comment we do we have one uh jeff hey good evening sorry i guess you called my name earlier i'm having some phone problems um so i'm just kind of curious because the last plan i was told is there wasn't going to be a replacement for mr constantine and you know i'm looking at that wage and i'm looking at the other people at that wage in the city say the police chief or fire chief and there were a lot of people who were saying that they were going to be replaced by mr constantine pretty extensive recruitment processes to uh vet the appropriate person for those positions and i didn't see or hear anything and maybe i'm just you know too out of the loop but uh just kind of curious what the recruiting process was and was it as voracious or thorough as you know other positions of similar uh stature in the city were so just food for thought if you want to really think about that and i'm just kind of curious what the recruiting process was really avoid the black eye of uh you know whatever mark was babbling about you know it's it's good to be transparent so thank you have a good night all right that's it and you're yes go ahead this morning thank you uh so i would just like to say uh not just in your intro uh if your new deputy city manager is half as good as you have been talking about her for the past few weeks that um i'm ecstatic that she's here i'm happy she's part of the team and just for the general public uh the city manager isn't required to bring these appointments to council i don't believe uh he does it in the very interest of transparency uh as will be her contract and all the work she does so uh given how well the city manager's review went i think that was a week a week ago uh i'm excited to have you and have you part of the team and look forward to getting to know you better and what you can do for the city so thank you for being here and i'll be in here and mark thank you for the due diligence and with that i'll move to approve the contract even though we don't need to second mr hubert i'll gladly give him the second so and can i just say welcome as well so we're glad so all right council member brown hi council member denley i council member huber yes council member morgan council member tandon yes vice mayor reynolds hi mary coolidge hi carry seven zero all right item 5.3 authorization authorizing authorization authorizing validation proceedings related to the issuance of issuance of pension obligation bonds and if you wish to speak on this item please raise your hand in zoom and then you'll be called at the conclusion of the staff presentation and do we have mr dowell with miss katherine mathis we'll be doing this today gotcha good evening mayor coolidge vice mayor reynolds members of the council and katherine mathis i'm the accounting manager for the city of chico this evening we're presenting a resolution authorizing the city to begin judicial validation and other matters related to the issuance of pension obligation bonds as an option to restructure our existing pension debt this is not an action to issue bonds at this time issuance of bonds would require a standalone approval by the city council mha advisors are financial advisors for the city and jones hall legal advisors for bond issues for the city are joining us via zoom to present details of the process and answer any questions you have mha and jones hall have also agreed to participate in a community education session where they would answer questions from the community our plan is to record that and make that available on our website sometime in the future with that i'd like to direct your attention to the screens and our website and introduce eric scriben from nha advisors and james rosiniak from jones hall for legal advice thank you good evening mr mayor city council we can't the presentation is that going to be flipped up we have really only four pages that would be discussed in the next hour and we've got to be clear on theackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackackack and we believe should continue with more education for the community on the pension obligation that the city has on its balance sheet. The brief background before I hand it over to James Worziniak of Jones Hall is that the city does have a $146 million unfunded liability, which has increased greatly over the last seven years. That unfunded liability, the payments structure that the city must make to CalPERS each year has grown greatly and will, in fact, grow significantly over the next 10 years as well. So the creation and discussion of a pension funding plan of which a pension obligation bond might be a solution is a great opportunity. That is yet to be determined by city council. We think it's very important with the full array of options being discussed and debated over the next months. And the judicial validation that James will go into on the documentation is a part of that. So, James, I think the idea was for you to carry the third bullet in the next couple of pages. Thank you very much, Eric. And good evening, Mayor and Council. James Worziniak at Jones Hall. Nice to be with you this evening. We are serving as the bond council on this potential bond issuance. And as Mr. Scriven introduced the slide here, there has been some prior discussion at the council. We intend there to be future discussion as well. And we're going to be doing that. And I'm sure you'll be taking on education. But the action tonight is a resolution of the city council giving the go-ahead to move forward on a pension obligation bond and file a validation action in superior court to confirm that that is a valid and legally viable option for the city to address its unfunded pension liability. And this is something. something we do for all of our city clients throughout the state that are pursuing pension bonds to have the court validate the existing obligation owed to PERS and then permit the issuance of a refunding bond to pay off that obligation via the bond, which would be payable from the city's general fund going forward. As indicated here, there is a process with the court. It typically takes four to five months to complete this validation process. So as I said before you tonight, for your consideration, it is a resolution that would hire this team, NHA advisors as financial advisor, Jones Hall as bond counsel, approves the issuance of bonds, and we would come back to the city council for finalization. Board Board and any future bondholders making your payments to those bondholders in exchange for the upfront payment, which would pay off the calipers unfunded. So, again, we've been continued until tonight, April 26th, and have the resolution and the form of indenture in front of you tonight. We're here to answer any questions. Assuming we do get your go-ahead, we would want to file that validation paperwork with the Superior Court later this week to commence that, again, four- to five-month process, during which time that would allow time for education, workshops, et cetera, with the council and public. Eric, I'll turn it back over to you. Great. I think that we were planning on stating in... I think that we were planning on stating in... on every single page. This action tonight by City Council is not obligating the city to issue bonds. It is preserving the right through this validation action to be pursued to potentially issue bonds in the future, say, four or five months hence, if through the education process, City Council, with community, support and participation in the process, quite honestly, agrees that this is an option it wants to be approved. So as City Council knows, over the last couple of months, actually going back to September, there has been a process where there's been several meetings and actual meetings with stakeholders in the community. This last month, Bond Council was hired through an RFQ process. And Jones Hall was selected via very strong proposal. This evening, the council decides to pursue the validation with no obligation to issue bonds. That would start the clock, if you will, where Jones Hall, James Wersminiak and partner Dave Bama would, after they received some documentation including the executed written evidence, resolution from this evening would file the judicial validation complaint. During the next couple of months, we would foresee additional workshops, whatever is needed by city council and the community to answer questions. As the financial advisor, we feel strongly that this is a very important, extremely important decision by the city council and requires a full understanding of all the background options, particularly the risks, the pros and cons of that decision. At some point, city council will say move forward or stop if the council decides to move forward. Additional documentation on the credit standing, credit position of the city, disclosure information. For investors, would be put together with the idea that once the validation is approved by the courts, which might be September, in the fall, this is a lengthy process, that those documents would come back to city council for approval closer to a potential bond sale. So we don't know when the court will go through its process to approve. We're hoping that the court will go through its process to approve the validation action, but we expect it would be sometime in the fall, September perhaps, after the timeline. The city council will have at least one or two additional points where decisions will be needed to be made to approve or stop the process. And that concludes our presentation. Let me stop this. trip there we go glad to answer questions alright questions at this point in time no alright okay do we have public comment I do not see any of just one hand taxpayer so that might be let me get that in there real quick yes I have a question thank you Dave go ahead if this works will it make the pension sustainable I'd be glad to take a stab at that the objective of this proposed financing is to increase the rate of our sustainable repayment schedule for the city of Chico that to us along with the potential savings from a lower interest rate versus what you're paying to CalPERS are the two primary objectives fiscal sustainability through a more a smoother more budget friendly repayment schedule on this liability is a primary objective and the options that would be put forth in these future workshops on how to smooth that out would be an important component for city council to consider all right so that's all the public comment we have that is all right thank you entertain a motion I have a couple comments fire away so finance committee has seen a presentation by the group a private group of citizens funded the group coming in to answer a bunch of questions a private group of citizens by the way who were probably opposed to pension obligation bonds thinking that the city was taking on new debt meaning that we had X amount of debt roughly $150 million and the pension obligation bond would be! more debt to it which it doesn't and when I said it doesn't create new debt Juanita asked if I was a liar or stupid so I stopped communicating with her but my answer to that being no is what it does and they pointed this out rather well it refinances your old debt which there's no way we can get out of that $150 million it would be great if we could we are going to continue to pay interest on that and what the pension obligation is the taxpayer asked a fantastic question and does it make the pensions sustainable no absolutely not the pensions in the state of California are not sustainable the system is broken and if we try to fix it all we can do is continue to keep pensions as low as we can and the challenge is we have staff that is obligated to them and it's part of their employee contract so the notion of just going and saying you're all paying a fair share sounds great but it's not legal we can't do it so at the end of the day the pension obligation bond gives us more flexibility over time someday the system is going to break I don't know what's going to happen when that happens and neither does anybody else all we're doing tonight is saying let's continue to go down this road so we have the option if rates stay this low instead of paying 7% on $150 million paying somewhere between 3% and 4.5% on $150 million and the reason that's even plausible is partly because the rates are low but also the city has an excellent credit rating due largely in part to the finance staff that Mark Warren has brought in over the past eight years and it makes this possible otherwise in the next five to eight years I don't have the time exactly right Catherine knows the interest on our pension liability will eat into our normal operations it'll be like well you've got to pay your interest to CalPERS not your police department or not your fire department or not your roads which we're already not doing but all we're doing today is saying let's continue down this path the pension consultants have said they'd come in to the city of Chico and they would do a public Q&A I think that's fantastic and for anybody that has any questions they should absolutely come in and listen and get their questions answered I had very skeptical financial minds asked exactly that and they walked away going okay I'm not sure how we don't do this given the situation we're in so I'm just trying to give perspective to make sure the council and anybody in the public feels absolutely comfortable with us moving ahead it's not a matter of does this fix the pensions no there isn't a fix for the pensions it's a matter of does this give the city more flexibility moving forward yes do I like the pension problem no I didn't create it neither did anybody love with that I make a motion to approve I'll second that I have a couple questions the attorney is on correct the city attorney okay I was doing a bunch of research into bonds in the last month because I hear all this like it's really crazy and it's big liability and I also hear it's restructuring your debt that's confusing because it's too totally different things so I did a bunch of my own research and I did find a little bit of concerning legal information specifically I saw that in 2019 Simi Valley pursued a bond and they actually got sued over it and had to rescind their bond process in 2020 because of it and also currently Yuba County is also being sued by Howard Jarvis and the whole basis for these lawsuits is that the council pursuing the bonds is a violation of the super majority vote requirement in the 1849 state constitution which requires a two-thirds vote of the legislature to place a measure on the ballot to borrow money so I guess I'd like the city attorney to address that if he has knowledge of the Simi Valley suit and the current Yuba County suit over pension bonds this is the one area that I don't practice and that's why the council from Jones Hall who's considered an expert in this area is often hired by municipalities and private entities to do this specific type of work so with respect I will refer that question to the speaker in this area thank you very much Mr. City Attorney and Councilwoman for the question James Brzeziniak here again at Jones Hall and we are the specialist bond council on the transaction so with respect to the two particular litigations that you mentioned I'm not particularly I don't have any particular facts other than what's in the public record as you indicate but yes I mean that is the exact approach that we're pursuing here and with the approval tonight will undertake so that any interested party Howard Jarvis type of entity or other interested citizen we will actually be the plaintiff in that action the city of Chico will be the plaintiff and anyone that is interested in the matter can file a response indicating if they believe that it's not valid that the city is not able to issue these pension bonds without a vote of the electorate I will say we have validated over a dozen of these for other cities and counties just in the last 12 months we have not received any complaints in response to our actions so yes there are some out there some folks that are again we are validating but again that's why we are validating it yeah I have one question for whoever the bond experts are on this zoom for getting names and organizations I apologize but whoever you are I have heard a lot referring to the restructuring of the debt and how that kind of stabilizes us and rids us of the CalPERS liability and redirects us to the bond in my research I just want to verify if it's correct or not because the internet can be a dangerous place I'm seeing that it doesn't actually instead of having the one monkey on our back of CalPERS we kind of end up with both CalPERS still as well as the bond because if you fail to achieve the targeted rate of return it would burden us the issuer with both the debt service requirements of the taxable bonds and still the unfunded pension liabilities that remain unmet if the investment portfolio doesn't perform as anticipated so is it still a possibility that we're not simply restructuring our debt we're actually kind of having both on the hook at the same time running concurrently is that an accurate perception this is Eric at NHA advisors um I! conversation presentation really the information that is presented by our firm to city council and stakeholders in the past and going forward we talk about this whether the city of Chico does a pension bond and removes we would never advise! I'm not going to talk about that but I think that it's a very important topic and I think that it's a very important topic and I think that it's a very important topic and I don't know if we don't have enough time to be involved in this and perhaps perhaps be involved in this in the future with education and healthcare healthcare Do you have anything? With that, we have a motion and a second. And that's a, just let me read this resolution. The City Council of the City of Chico authorizing the issuance of one or more of a series of pension obligation bonds to refinance outstanding obligations of the City of the City to the California Public Employees Retirement System authorizing a judicial validation action and approving and directing related matters. And I believe it was Mr. Morgan and Mr. Huber with the second. So, Madam Clerk. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. No. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Cooley. Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. So, Item 5.4, Lot Clearing Redebatement Program for 2021. And if you wish to speak on this item, again, please raise your hand and zoom and you'll be called at the conclusion of the staff presentation. And do we have Charlotte? Okay. Great. Go ahead, Charlotte, when you can. Yep. Go ahead. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council Members. This is the first of three meetings for the City's Annual Weed Abatement and Lot Clearing Program. Tonight, we are asking the Council to adopt the resolution which declares weeds and rubbish to be a public nuisance, which must be abated. And to set a hearing date to allow any objections to be heard. The resolution will be amended to reflect the new date of May 18th. All right. All right. There we go. All right. Any questions at this time? No? Public comment? I did see a hand up, but it isn't up any longer. So I do not have any wing. All right. Will the Council? I'll do a purr. I'll second. And that's a resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico declaring public nuisance and setting time for a hearing on objections to be heard. to abatement and assessment of costs related to the abatement of weeds, rubbish, refuse, and or debris. Item 3. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Dinley. Aye. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Item 5.5, and I believe Council Member Dinley, you need to be recused from this. Discussion? Correct? Yeah, I have to recuse myself due to a disqualifying conflict of interest. All right. So this is the federal program funding letters of support. If you wish to speak on this item, please raise your hand and zoom. You'll be called at the conclusion of this presentation as well. And we are good to go. Mr. Mark Orm. Yep. I'll make this one really quick for the council. This was on for last Tuesday, as we all know. And the deadlines have come and gone, but I would still love to have the city council's affirmation of support for this program. Federal programs funding requests have come back in style. Oftentimes, when I used to work back in Congress, they were called earmarks or pork. Now they're called community benefit funds. Doesn't matter what they're called. If they can help benefit the citizens of Chico and allow the city council to get their objectives achieved, I'm all for them. So I want to thank. Our congressman, Doug LaMalfa, and also Brett Sanders, his district representative, for being proactive in readily sharing with the city, here's an opportunity to get some of your shovel-ready projects in front of us. And so we're really excited about that. There's two categories, member-designated projects, or NDPs, and then community project funding, CPFs. And really, they're focused on those things that are ready to rock and roll. And so city staff immediately kicked into gear. We put together. A number of projects under the member-designated projects. Those really had to be pre-designated transportation type of projects. And so those were limited in scope as to us finding those projects and getting them in front of the congressman. Those we've already heard from what Congressman LaMalfa will proceed with moving forward to the committee. Those are between the State Route 32 widening phase three and then the Southgate Interchange Environmental Impact Report phase. We were. Informed that the congressman is supportive of pressing forward to committee the Southgate Interchange EIR report, which is fantastic. It's a $2 million ask. And so there's no confirmation that we will receive it. However, it's going to proceed into committee, which we really appreciate. On the other side of the coin, you have the community project funding projects. You have a broadband infrastructure deployment for a low-income census tract. You have an intelligent transportation system. The council's heard about ITS in the past. You've got P18 sewer trunk line project that's pressing some sewer line up along Skyway to enhance for economic development and potentially new homes. And then you also have a new fire station and then an airport runway reconstruction project. Those five projects we submitted, we will hear from the congressman when, if any of those, he will press into the committee as well. Just so you see the scope and the depth of those projects in total, that's $70 million worth of projects. That we're throwing into congress to see if we can get a few million out to help towards those projects. I recommend that the city council voice their support of letters of support for these projects. And with that, I respectfully ask for approval to proceed with that affirmation. Thank you. All right. Any questions? All right. Any speakers? Oh, sorry, Alex. Go ahead. Go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh, Mr. Trump, could you perhaps beack on this for me? It is my understanding this letter has already been sent about council member, uh, official approval of that. Yeah, it's my understanding that, uh, this, the, the mayor has the ability to write a letter of support on items, uh, but we would still request that the city council affirm that support as a council of the whole. So that's what we're doing tonight. Uh, just so that we're in public. Uh, just so that we're in public. Uh, just so that we're in public. Uh, just so that we're in public. Uh, just so that we're in public. Uh, just so that we're in public. Uh, just so that we're in public. for many of these projects? Can you speak to that a little bit more? For any matching aspect, it's things that the city staff has already had funding for as it relates to some of the matching funds. Some of them, the State Route 32 widening, those are funds that the city is already anticipating pressing ahead with. We needed the extra funding to move forward. That one is not being recommended, so I'll take that off the shelf. Southgate Interchange is one that staff anticipated moving forward with. We've been attempting annually to put funding in place to move forward with that. It's going to have a large component of Caltrans support in order for us to proceed, but we need to get the EIR completed. What this would do is it would really result in a regionalized project to help ensure that when folks are coming out of Paradise, if there's another emergency, there would be two spans of exit coming down the skyway. It would have been really handy to have in place. So staff has been, over the years, leaving that one on the shelf, but we really needed to bring it back. And so we do have funding over the years that we've set aside for that. The broadband infrastructure deployment to low-income census tracts, this is really a revelation that we've seen throughout many agencies across the United States of really trying to take control of reducing the cost of fiber, not only for anybody's residents, but also for businesses. And one of the things that we hear echoing throughout the community time and again is how can the city allow for more fiber, more reliable fiber, so that they can conduct their business, particularly in a city like Paradise, in a time of COVID when a lot of folks are working from home. So city staff had not set aside any funding at this point, but we were recommending, and you will see a recommendation, in a lot of the American Recovery Act funds towards a program of this nature. So we were going to be requesting funds on that end. The intelligent transportation system, city council has heard about this in the past, and city staff has previously had a lot of work behind the scenes done on that. And so we were going to be requesting additional funding moving into this next fiscal year. We're hopeful that we can receive these funds to help supplement that. The P18 sewer trunk line project, we have funding in the budget annually for sewer expansion. It's in conjunction with our sewer master plan. And so annually there are funds for that. This would help secure this one branch of the sewer trunk line as it relates to a number of things. One of the primary areas that we see as a huge benefit to the region, not only just the sewer, but also the sewer, is the potential medical use that would be in that area if we were to create that expansion of the sewer trunk line. And so we will continue to look for opportunities to help fund that in the budget. The new fire station up in the north part of Chico, as you know, we've gone through annexations. In that area, there is a vital need to ensure that we have the facilities to respond in a timely fashion. This is going to be coming down the road for funding requests. But one of the things that we do, and we're going to be doing, and I'm sure you'll see this in the budget, is we have funds from the development impact fees that continue to be built up for varying aspects of city work. Facilities are one component of that, particularly public safety facilities. So yes, there are matching funds for that. The airport runway reconstruction project, we are wholly reliant upon the federal government to give FAA funds on an annual basis to help support that. What we have to do is typically supplement with general fund dollars. These types of projects, that's why when grant funds of this nature, should come about, we would rather supplement the FAA funds with grant funds, which this opportunity allows us to do. I hope that helps clarify all those projects. You bet. All right, and Madam Clerk said no public comment, correct? Okay. So I'd just like to thank obviously the Congressman and I know Mr. Sanders was really involved, but also Mr. Orem and Otto Bonny for, you guys did an excellent job. I know you contacted his district rep out of, in DC as well, or his DC rep I should say, and went the extra mile to prepare this in a very short timeframe. So thank you so much for doing that and putting that forward. I had some additional questions. Sure. City Manager Orem. Regarding the P18 sewer trunk line project, I know that we're waiting for a series of public question and answer sessions regarding the Paradise sewer, potential Paradise sewer project. Would this P18 sewer trunk line project be necessary if it was determined that the city didn't want to participate in the Paradise project? Yes, it would. This is, there's very few areas within the city that we can expand. Obviously to the west, you have the green line. And so one of the few areas that the city authorized, hey, look, if there is some expansion that's possible, mitigating the, any environmental impacts, it is to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And so with that limited ability to grow and expand our economy and our housing stock, this is one of the few growth areas that we have. Just going up the skyway a little bit there, there's already a major project that they've been, discussed, discussed for years. This could potentially help support those new homes, which we keep hearing, we need more homes, we need more homes. And then secondarily also, and I really am excited about the potential medical facility that could be right there that would need this line. And so yes, without paradise sewer trunk line discussion, this would still be necessary. Has there been a medical facility proposed? Not at this time. I've had multiple meetings with a potential interested partner, and really what their goal is is to help serve Paradise because right now they don't have a ready medical facility. And so those conversations will continue and it's our hope that we will get that support. I believe there was a letter of support from a medical entity that went with this request to Congressman LaMalfa. And so I think that it's looking like they are very interested and I'm very encouraged by the most recent conversations I've had, but there's nothing in writing yet that they are willing to go move forward. But it's my understanding that there has been some property that's been purchased. Thank you. Absolutely. Go ahead. How are these projects identified? Yeah, simply put, what did we have ready? That was unfortunately because the timeline was so restricted. Because this readily came about Congress said, hey, we're going to go ahead and do this. And so within a week's time, city staff had to immediately go in and say, okay, what can we do as an immediate issue? What can we get shovel ready and move forward quickly? And so that's how these came to the top. The ITS was one that staff has been talking about internally and we were going to roll out with the American Recovery Act funds because of the COVID relation to that where a lot of people working from home. We had to get out of the neighborhood. We didn't know that this would come before then. And so that kind of got thrown in there, but the rest were items that had been anticipated for some time. All right, I'll entertain a motion. Motion from Council Member Morgan. I'll second. Sorry, am I sorry? Okay, happy to second that. Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll. Yeah, so I'd like to make a comment before we vote. You know, it sounds like this is already a done deal to some extent. So really, I think what we're doing tonight is just sort of weighing in on our support of one or more of these projects. I see a lot of good projects here, but the fact that they're lumped together doesn't really give us an opportunity to make a comment individually on them. I'm not convinced that running a sewer trunk line up to Honey Run Road is a necessity. You know, as of right now, Bruce Road seems like a logical place, but it's not like we're taking on effluent from Butte Creek Canyon. So based on the fact that I don't necessarily support the P18 sewer trunk line project, I'll be voting no on this. I'm in support of this proposal. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Dinley is recused. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 4-2 with one recusal or disqualification. All right, if we could get Council Member Dinley back in here, we will move on to our next item. And while she's coming in, I will reiterate from the beginning of this that item 5.6 was pulled by Vice Mayor Reynolds. All right, welcome back. Item 5.7 is actually my request. So if you wish to speak on this item, please do so. Please raise your hand and zoom, and you'll be called on the conclusion of my quick review here. Obviously I said that forth in the agenda, you've seen it attached, but basically the goal here is to do exactly what we did with behavioral health. I don't think anyone could argue either on the council or in public that the value that we got from that presentation, I think it was immense. I think it helped clarify a lot of items. I think it helped clarify a lot of things both in the public and on the council. So the goal here is basically to do the same thing with the Butte County continuum of care as we further explore homeless issue and deal with the varying aspects of it is to also generally educate the public as well. So that's what I'm asking for. And I think they'd be more than happy to comply. Questions? So I would agree that, the presentation by behavioral health was really helpful to all of us. And originally I think that I indicated that I did not support a review of the COC, but I think that it's a good idea. And so I would support it. Yeah, I mean, personally, I think we changed a lot of minds and just general information with that behavioral health presentation. So anything further? No. No. All right. Entertain the motion. Move to approve. All right, I have a motion. Do we have a second? Second from Council Member Denley. Madam Clerk, can, oh, did we have any public comments? Sorry. No, I would have been. Passed. I would have let you know. All right. This is Council Member Brown. I have a vote. Go ahead. Yes, go ahead. Can I just ask, can I just ask a little bit about the presentation with the leaders of the continuum of care? I have a question. I have not as of yet because we didn't have approval on it. I didn't feel it was right to. I believe Council approved the agenda for review of the continuum of care. I think you guys all made that announcement. No, we only approved to agendize it. For the discussion. For the discussion. Oh. Yeah. All right. Madam Clerk. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Aye. Council Member Hubert. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. No items added after the posting of the agenda. Reports and communication. The following reports and communication items are provided for Council's information. No action can be taken on the items under this section unless the Council agrees to include in the subsequent agenda. City Manager's report. Mr. Orme. Yes. Honorable members of the Council. This item was on last time. I know that there were some interesting occurrences that happened. And so I think that our intent from a staff perspective is to have the 50% attendance starting in May. And I just want to make sure that Council still desires us to proceed on that front. After looking at the scope and the range of agencies in Butte County and also other larger cities in the surrounding region, there is a trend up in this, in this area of allowing folks into their Council chambers. They're usually at a reduced percentage. And one of the things that was duly noticed is that we have a very engaged community. And so all the entities that we spoke to said, but we're not as interesting as Chico. And so realizing that we have such a highly engaged community, we believe from a staff perspective, that, that we can try the 50%. That would allow us to fill every other seat. Or if there's a family, they can obviously sit next to each other and then they would just bump out a seat. But I would ask for Council's direction to proceed on that. We would request that masks be worn in the Council chambers. I believe that's one of the Council objectives on that front. And for those who wish not to wear a mask, that they would have another location to be able to speak from. And they would be able to speak from. They would be able to speak to Council if they wanted to, just not in the chambers. With that, if that direction is what I see in a bunch of heads nodding, I think that you will see that occur at our first meeting in May. And then finally, the last thing I wanted to do is just congratulate the City Council for their first Spring Clean Day. I know that the City Council asked for that to occur. I want to commend City staff for stepping up, particularly Public Works, Mr. Gustafson and his team. It was fantastic to see the over 400 volunteers. I think it was closer to 500. But we had signed up over 400. And it was quite an engaging day of interesting things. My son got to bear witness to me falling into the creek so I could get a baller out of the middle of the creek. So it was, I knew I should have worn my water shoes. But needless to say, we saw the Council participate. We saw the community participate. And I just want to thank the Council and the community. Those kind of things really bring about a collegial environment. That I know this community desires and this Council desires. And it was fantastic. So with that, it was a success. And if the Council's desire is to continue that, we're happy to do it on an annual basis. With that, thank you very much. All right. So item 6.2, sun shining of negotiation proposals, IAFF, Director Cannon, she on? Just a receiving file. Just receiving, okay. So at this point in time, item 6.3, Council, the request pursuant to AP and P.10.10, Council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority vote at the Council is needed in order for staff to agendize. Council members may also submit requests in writing. And I believe we did have a request in writing from Mr. Hueber. Yeah, thank you very much. I think that I didn't make it in time for it to make the agenda. So I will read it here. Given that we all agree that our parks and greenways are not the appropriate place for people to live or camp, and that many people experiencing homelessness who for a variety of reasons can't or won't live in congregate indoor shelters will continue to camp in public places, and given that based on an accepted definition of no barrier shelter, it's been acknowledged that Chico has none fitting that definition, and given that under the temporary restraining order, we have little control over where people choose to camp, including places where taxpayer dollars have already been spent to clear, clean, and restore, and given that there's currently no actionable plan in place to assure an alternative location for people to go that would allow the enforcement of the ordinance that this Council approved, and given that a federal judge has stated that our ordinances on their face are invalid, and that we're criminalizing people, which is a direct violation of the law, we have no right to impose a law that is not in compliance with the law. I'm asking, therefore, that the City of Martin v. Boise, because they don't have a place to live, and given that the court has provided a three-week window for the City to negotiate a satisfactory solution to the absence of camping locations, I'm asking, therefore, that my fellow councillors agree to agendize at our next meeting, at our next scheduled meeting, or sooner, if possible, discussion and action leading to the expedited identification of a sanctioned campground location, and direction to City staff to make the needed arrangements to implement a plan making such a campground operational, including whatever combination of funding is required to make and keep such a location operational, and work with service providers to integrate services, case management, and management of the site or facility. As part of this request, I'm asking that previously considered and or rejected locations be reevaluated, and that staff provide an assessment of the whole site. I'm also asking that the City of Martin v. Boise and other councillors agree to the following additional locations for discussion and consideration of action by the Council to include any and all City-owned parcels, including parcels at Bruce Road and Humboldt Road, the City-owned parcel that is currently leased to the BMX, the Ed McLaughlin property off of Cohasset Road, the Seidenglantz-owned property off of Hagen, which is currently still being used by FEMA, but apparently the lease is up in May, the Steve Laudy-owned property on Eaton Road, which I had the City Clerk distribute an email from Mr. Laudy to the Council earlier today, the former LifeTouch property on Morrow Lane, the McGowan-owned property on Morrow Lane, and any and all other properties that may be suitable. I additionally request that as part of this discussion that I'm asking that we have, the Council consider providing adequate waste disposal facilities, garbage and toilets, at current encampments until a sanctioned location is approved for shelter, and I offer this as a motion, and I'm seeking a second to have this discussion agendized for a future meeting. So... Is there a motion to second the meeting? Okay, I just, I have a question, maybe for our City Attorney, and because I'm not clear, clear on this specific issue, so, because Mr., and I actually didn't watch the full meeting, I watched parts of that meeting, and I know it was voted on in terms of a campsite location in October, so, but I believe Mr. Huber voted no, is that correct? Not sure what we're talking about. Are we talking about when the City Manager brought forward to ask about the airport? Yeah. Yeah. I'm happy to do, is that something that we want to discuss right now? Well, the question is, is because you voted no on that particular project, you wouldn't necessarily be able to bring it back. Well, this isn't the same conversation. Is that, that was on one specific location. That was on that conversation. Pardon? I mean, I'm just, for technicality purposes. Mr. Morgan, I have a plausible solution, in that I don't, hear me out, I don't think your motion is necessary, because we're going to be discussing pending litigation in closed session, and I believe it will cover all of those things, and we'll be doing it in 20 minutes. Thank you for that, and that's also my belief that we will be. However, I think that the community would like to be a part of that, part of the conversation. They'd like a chance to weigh in, both sides, would like a chance to weigh in with their opinions on whether or not we should, you know, give in to what potentially is a legal judgment, and would like to have input on, where those locations are, which are acceptable, how they would prioritize them, what services should be offered there, et cetera, et cetera. So, yes, I agree with you, and I think that we may end up going that direction, but for the sake of the community that would like to be involved in the conversation, I am asking that we agendize it to a public meeting. All right. So, I'm going to go back to my original question, to the city attorney. Mr. Morgan? Mr. Ewing? Realizing that this is, you know, a multifaceted discussion versus a specific discussion, and it sounds like you voted on a specific, yes? So, what would be your... It actually wasn't a vote. It was a recommendation by the city manager that I think, I guess it would have to be looked at, but I think it was consensus. You want me to bring a little clarity? It was a request for funding to proceed with, so I could proceed with the project. So, it was a request for funding. Okay, it was denied. But if he voted no on a request for funding, then he wouldn't be able to bring it back forward unless he was a yes vote, I think, but I'm just waiting for the city attorney or maybe our clerk could offer some support. Yeah. If I may, sir? Sure. Go ahead. So, if the requests were the same, then that policy would apply, but if the request is different, it does not apply. Okay. Now, I'll give this moment to comment also. To Councilmember Hubers and Councilmember Morgan's brief conversation. We are about to go into closed session. The public has an opportunity to comment on the subject of the closed session so the council can receive their input and consider it in their deliberations, including the public. So, just before closed session begins, there's an opportunity for the public to participate by providing their comments or thoughts on the subject of the closed session. All right. Mr. Smalls, I appreciate everything that's been said this evening, but I think I'm going to agree with Councilmember Hubers that this has been a topic of discussion for a long time, and it's important that we have a discussion about the public's interest in this. And I think that his request that he brings forward some opportunities and locations that the public can weigh in on. In fact, I understand there's at least one property that has some local developers and builders that are interested in participating in, and I think it's worth engaging the public on. So, I'm going to stick with my second. All right. I have a comment. Before we go to vote, just on the concept of agendizing the discussion. Since this request, I appreciate how well prepared this was. It was very detailed, and I actually like that. It did go to the public. I saw the media picked it up. And I just have a slight issue that it's a little bit misleading. It's alluding a lot to the case and the restraining order and the concept of a no-barrier shelter. Possibly being required of that. I did sit in on the entire hearing from start to finish. And the transcript of the hearing is actually now available to the public. And I have a copy of it in front of me. And not only did Judge England never insinuate that Chico needs a no or low-barrier shelter, he even went as far as to chastise the petitioner in the current case for insinuating that Martin v. Boise would require a no or low-barrier shelter. In fact, direct quotes from the transcript, when the judge was speaking to the petitioners, he, on the topic of the current shelter beds open, maybe not counting as open beds, the judge said that if a person makes a, this is a direct quote, if a person makes a voluntary election not to go because I have a dog or a pet or some other type of situation, it would seem that that's distinguishable from Martin. Another quote later on, on the same topic. It appears to the court at this point that there are available spaces, that people have made decisions, whether you call it voluntary or choices or whatever, to not stay there, which would not seem to implicate the very strict ruling of Martin. And again, he says later, quote, that's my point, there's nothing in Martin that says that. And so what you're doing is coming up with a new theory about what Martin says, and Martin is very specific. It says that, quote, the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter, period. That's the end of it. It doesn't seem to be clear to the court. It doesn't say the shelter that they prefer. It doesn't say the shelter that they would like. It says that they are unable to obtain shelter. So based on all of that, which were all direct quotes from the judge, which is available on the Chico ER right now, they have the whole transcript posted, I do not feel that a discussion needs to be had regarding no or low barrier shelter concepts. Our focus should remain on meaningful treatment-based and accountability-based shelter options, such as the Jesus Center, Torres shelter, or other shelter concepts. So I would not like to have this discussion. All right. One more question. Madam Clerk, could you take the roll? Councilmember Brown? We didn't quite get that, Alex. Could you do that again? Aye. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Denley? No. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? No. Only because we're about to do that. Councilmember Tandon? No. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. Mayor Coolidge? And this poor judge is being interpreted more than I think the law is in some respects. So I'm going to say no, because I'd like to go into closed session and discuss this immediately rather than have any time left. So that's the only reason why. But I think we'll be discussing it plenty in the future. So aye. All right. It fails 2-5. All right. Any further councilmember requests? I have a couple. Go ahead. So earlier this month, when I brought forward the request to consider the BMX site as a location for a sanctioned campground or outdoor sheltering environment, Council supported a motion not only to direct staff not to further pursue that site, but to rescind the shelter crisis declaration. In my opinion, the public really didn't have adequate opportunity to weigh in on that major decision. And whatever your position on the declaration, I'd like to afford them the opportunity to do so. So I'd like to bring this item forward for a formal discussion, including a more robust discussion of the impacts of rescinding the shelter crisis declaration. So I'm asking council agenda as a formal discussion and request information from the Butte County continuum of care to be shared or presented during that discussion about some of the impacts we might face. It's critical that both council and the public be aware of what it means. And so while I hope that we might reconsider that decision, really, it's a matter of what we're doing and what we're doing to make sure that this is an opportunity for public transparency. And so that's my request and my motion. All right. So I would actually say that Madam Clerk, if you could actually review what happened in that meeting in terms of that being Can we acknowledge there was a second? Yeah, sorry. Yeah, so we have a motion and a second. I did have it in there. My mic was buzzing. Yes. So I'm not sure why we're getting feedback, but I'll turn it down. So there was a motion and a second to do a variety of things and one of them was, and I quote, rescind the shelter crisis declaration. However, that declaration was adopted by a resolution. It wasn't brought up at the meeting. However, it wasn't rescinded because it couldn't be. You would need to adopt a resolution to actually rescind that original resolution. So it is in place. It has not been rescinded. I totally understand that. The request is simply that the vote was taken, that the public was not able to participate in that vote, and that we were advised of some consequences of it, and I would like for the public to be able to weigh in and for us to have a conversation about it with an actually agendized opportunity. Okay. So Madam Clerk, if you could take the... So there's a motion by Councilmember Brown, seconded by Councilmember Denley, to bring back that discussion. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Denley? Aye. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? Aye. And perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps! Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? I'm going to be a yes on that just because I know it's got to come back in the next two months anyways because it's expiring. So, I might as well get it done and out of the way. Okay. Mayor Coolidge? I would actually agree with Mr. Morgan. I do not think we need to discuss something that was actually not done. Okay. It carries 5-2. All right. And then, yeah, I was going to say go ahead, Alex. So, I would have made this request back in April if I'd known it would have been pushed from the agenda planning calendar. But I also understand there were some items taking priority for the city attorney's office at that time. So, while I'm aware that the cannabis item was to come back in May as it is listed on our calendar, I'd like to formally request that council direct staff to return at the first or second meeting in May with the information that the council requested. So, it's time to move forward with the item and make the public aware of the options available. And I would simply appreciate using this opportunity to solidify the item for May so that the prospective business owners and the public can be well informed about when it's coming. It is scheduled for May 4th. I understand, but it was scheduled previously. And I want to make sure that council solidifies that time. Good. But your item wouldn't come back until May 4th? Well, the reason it was delayed was because of the TRO. The city. That was given to the city attorney's office when Andrew Jarrett made his exit the night, March 2nd. And so, Vince, the city attorney, took that over. And he actually had it slated for the last meeting and asked to have that moved along with Tigert Ponds, which is another item that's been held up, just in order to allow him time to address the legal issues that the city was facing. He's asked. He's asked the city manager and myself to make sure that it's on for the first meeting in May. Yeah. So if we were to agendize this issue, it would also come on to May 4th, coinciding with the actual item itself. I'm not asking to agendize. I'm asking to direct staff to bring it back on May 4th. But you can't do that during this time. You can only agendize, ask for an item to be agendized. Yes. If I may, Council Member Brown, it sounds like you're just asking for confirmation that it is on the agenda for May 4th. That's correct. Can we do that? Staff, I think that the city attorney can speak to it. It's his item, and so we'll let him confirm that it'll come back at the next meeting. Vince, if you have that. Yes. The item will be on the May 4th agenda. Thank you for confirming. Thank you. All right. We're going to move into closed session, but first, do we have any public comments or council disqualifications? So any council disqualifications? All right. Public comments? We have one, and it looks like it's Jeff. So let me clear that. All right. All right. Jeff, go ahead and unmute yourself, please. Okay. Hey, good evening. So I just wanted to hit this TRO thing again. I think the public has had how many years to comment on this issue? I think everybody that's had a dog in this fight has been there more than enough times to speak their piece, including me. I think it's time for action, and I think if you decide something definitive tonight and I'm upset tomorrow, I'll live with it. I think that should go for everybody. I think, you know, what's happening. It's just back and forth with the same rhetoric, and, you know, I'll eat any humble pie you put out, and I think anybody else should, too. So I appreciate it, and have a good night. Thank you. And we did get one extra hand up, and because of the short notice of going into closed session, that's Nicole Nava. All right. Go ahead, Nicole. Thank you. Good evening again, council. Thank you, council. Thank you. Thank you. I know I missed part of my point earlier, but I just really hope that people are taking in the exact words that the judge said and don't act hastily out of assuming what you think he means. And I would ask again that when you are evaluating properties, if you decide to pursue that, that you look to do the least damage to the entire community. No, not everyone that is homeless has the severe issue. But there are enough, and I would call it a majority, that have very far-reaching issues with drug and alcohol use and mental health issues that it would behoove you to pick somewhere, since apparently these are some service-resistant individuals where less harm could be in the footprint of wherever such a place would go. And that it, of course, be equipped with appropriate porta-potties and enough dumpsters to serve somebody of that size. Maybe you guys would check with Waste Management and see how much was being produced and how much was set aside at Comanche and plan more appropriately, because I think that is a lot of the blowback you get is because of the visible blight. I also just want you to not be reactive in other manners. I also want you to not be reactive in other manners. I also want you to not be reactive in other manners. I also want you to not be reactive in other manners. I also want you to not be reactive in other manners.
