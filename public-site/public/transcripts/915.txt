 All right.  Calling to order the Planning Commission meeting of Thursday, August 6, 2020.  Our first item, 1.1, is Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.  Please stand.  Salute.  Pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right.  You may have a seat.  Item 1.2 is Roll Call.  Roll Call.  Chair Goldstein.  Present.  Vice Chair Aram Law.  Here.  Commissioner Deremeti.  Here.  Commissioner Howlett.  Here.  Commissioner Ober.  Here.  Commissioner Rensink.  Present.  And Commissioner Scott.  Present.  Thank you.  I assume our normal speaker card announcement is not in place here.  Is there anything that I should bring up for people who might be on the line and want to make a comment at some point?  All right.  All right.  Well, we can get to that when we open the public hearing.  So, item, well, I don't think we have an election of officers that's on this guided agenda.  So, item 2 is Consent Agenda.  All matters listed under the Consent Agenda are considered routine and will be enacted by one motion unless we wish to pull any item from the Consent Agenda and consider it separately.  It looks like the only motion is to approve the consent agenda.  The only item on the Consent Agenda is 3.1 approval of minutes from June 18, 2020.  Hopefully, we've all had a chance to review the minutes.  And I move it be approved.  Great.  I'll second.  I'll second.  All right.  All in favor of approving the minutes?  Aye.  Aye.  Are there any opposed?  Any abstentions?  All right.  Motion passes.  The minutes are approved.  Our next item is Business from the Floor, where public, members of the public may address  the Commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes.  The Commission cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda.  Do we have any business from the floor?  Looking like there is none.  Okay.  If I could just take a moment just to let people who are attending virtually know that there is a hand in the bottom right-hand corner.  There's a hand in the bottom.  Right-hand corner of your WebEx window that if you click on it, then you will be recognized as having raised your hand.  That's how you communicate to us that you'd like to be taken off of mute and participate in the current item.  So if there's any business from the floor, please click your hand to raise it on the WebEx and we'll know.  Same for the future items.  I did get a request in the chat to please speak into your microphones the best you can.  Okay.  All right.  Great update.  Thank you.  So our next item, if we have no business from the floor, is public hearings.  And so our first public hearing here is item, let's see, this must be 4.1.  It's use permit 19-20 Tandon Apartments, 123 West 14th Street with two parcel numbers.  Chair Goldstein, can I ask for our communications?  Mm-hmm.  Is now the time?  I didn't mean to jump in.  Yes, now is the time for ex parte.  Okay.  Thanks very much.  So I actually did reach out to our city attorney just to double check something that I wanted to make sure was, you know, totally on the up and up and everybody was comfortable with.  The applicant in item 4.1 has indicated intent to run for city council, as have I.  And so I wanted to make sure that there wasn't any sense of, you know, conflict there.  Which I was assured by the city attorney that there was not and that I certainly don't feel myself.  I feel very, very confident of my ability to be impartial in this matter and to listen to the hearing and to make a decision based on the information that's presented tonight.  So I just wanted to make sure that there wasn't any, you know, confusion or concern about that potential conflict of which I believe there is none.  Great.  Thank you.  What is the applicant's name?  Deepika Tandon, I believe.  I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that last name correctly.  But, yeah.  And I'm serving as a Commissioner Ober's campaign manager and I went through the same thing.  I contacted Mr. Jarrett, had a discussion with him and talked about if there was any potential conflict.  I assured him that, you know, I would be impartial as I always am in my, any of the deliberations and decisions that I make.  And so I feel like I can help make the decisions that were put on this commission to do.  Just a clarification.  Just a clarification that she is running in the same district that Rich is running in.  Yes.  That's my understanding.  At least the intent to run has been filed.  Yeah.  Great.  Thank you.  I also live in that district for anybody who's wondering.  And I think several of us do.  And I think it's really important that we're all clear about this.  And I'm sure we can be impartial people.  I have one as well.  So I do serve on the Jesus.  Center Board, which is at 1297 Park Avenue.  I don't have a financial interest in this.  And I don't believe this would impact anything with that property at 1297 Park Avenue.  But just to disclose that.  Okay.  I guess if you're disclosing that, I live in the 1100 block of Broadway Street, which is about two blocks from this project area.  I rent.  Won't affect my non-existent property value.  But that is true that I live near there.  Well, I'm boring.  I don't live anywhere close to there.  And I'll join Lupe.  I'm in District 3 and don't have anything to do with it.  Wonderful.  All right.  Seeing no more ex parte communication and sharing, I think we can move on to our staff report.  Thank you very much, Chair Goldstein, members of the commission.  It is, as always, an honor.  And a pleasure to be in front of you.  This application is a request to authorize ground-level residential occupancy for a proposed two-story eight-plex in the Community Commercial Zone District,  as well as address an issue related to a request for reduction in the off-street parking requirement.  The 0.48 gross acre site consists of two parcels at the southwest corner of 14th Street and Oakdale Street.  It is designated commercial.  The parking area is a commercial mixed use on the city's general plan land use diagram,  and is zoned community commercial, with the corridor opportunity site and the special design consideration Southwest Chico neighborhood overlays.  The building would be located toward the south of the site, with the main entrance courtyard oriented towards Oakdale Street,  and the provided parking would be to the north.  Detailed site improvements and architecture associated with the apartment project are proposed by the City Council.  The project is proposed for review by the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board at a later date,  and a proposed condition of approval is included to that effect.  Briefly, the proposed building is two stories in a traditional style of courtyard apartment buildings,  with a thoughtful sidewalk activating design and an inviting olive green color.  The landscape plans, which differ slightly from what you saw originally,  call for a variety of species with moderate to low water demands.  No ordinance trees exist on the site, and all but one of the street trees would be preserved,  even as the sidewalk on the Oakdale Street side is proposed for significant renovation.  The project is consistent with general plan goals and policies.  However, this is not, as it usually would be, the thrilling conclusion to the staff report.  No, this application turns on the issue of the requirements, and the project is not a project that is intended to be a part of the plan.  The applicant has requested a reduction in off-street parking.  Because of this project's location in the COS overlay, the Corridor Opportunity Site overlay,  the applicant has requested a reduction in off-street parking required for the project from 12 spaces to 3.  There are two findings required of the Commission in making their determination on this issue.  The applicant has proposed an increase in quantity of on-street parking and provided an analysis to demonstrate their contention  that they will not substantially burden the public with the need to have a space for parking.  This is just one argument which has just picked up on the fact that the Commission has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on the fact that the project has just picked up on  Commission approve Resolution 20-10 if it finds that the parking  reduction is permissible pursuant to Chico Municipal Code Section  19.70.050. And as always,  it would be a pleasure to answer whatever questions you might have.  Thank you.  Alright, Commission discussions, questions for staff? I actually have a question.  So, let's say that we  approve the resolution and we agree to the  parking reduction. I'm always concerned about precedent.  And would there be, is there anything that we should know  as far as, how would it affect other  developments in the area and the parking?  Yeah, that's a question that the engineers and I discussed  and also planning staff discussed as  part of the resolution.  Part of the recommendation for this project  is whether or not this would create a precedent.  We consider each project individually.  And a project that may be likely to burden the public parking supply in the project vicinity  at one location may be unlikely to burden the public parking supply  in the project vicinity in a different location.  So, I don't think that there's any precedent that would be set  by this project if you were to approve it, except  that at the corner of 14th and Oakdale on August 6, 2020,  it would not substantially burden the public parking supply in the project  vicinity to construct this particular project.  We, yeah, I think we consider them individually.  And I will also say that as part of our review to create objective design  and development standards, this is one of the standards which is proposed  for some degree of adjustment.  And so, that is something that we're considering.  Which we will also cover at that point to ensure that this particular decision is,  or this type of decision is based on a standard which is definitively not precedential.  Thank you.  Now, the other question that I have.  Yes.  The roads in that area, they're not completed.  And there was some discussion about the parking.  There seems to be like a, is it the shoulder?  The roads are not completed.  Not done.  Or is it the sidewalk?  There was some, is it the sidewalk?  Yes.  So, the developer is going to be putting the sidewalks in, correct?  Yes.  So, this project actually has sidewalk on both sides.  Or this location has sidewalk on both sides existing.  The project proponents proposal is to improve the sidewalk and the corner with a bulb out.  So, the construction is to produce diagonal parking on the Oakdale Street side of the property.  But this, yeah, this project does already have existing sidewalk on both sides.  There would be some renovation of that on the 14th Street side to accommodate the new  driveway.  There would be adjustment of the location of that and renovation of the sidewalk as  part of that.  Thank you.  I think what Commissioner Armlaw might be talking about, there is the existing sidewalk, and  then there's quite a bit of...  There's probably, you know, 8 to 10 feet of just dirt gravel between the roadway.  Oh, yes.  So, that is going to be...  I'm sorry.  That's going to be where the diagonal parking will...  Correct.  And that would be fully improved to the City of Chico's standards for that if you were  to approve that.  Okay.  And just to be clear, Dexter, there's, they'll be creating 16 new parking spaces that are  on-street spaces.  Plus three...  Okay.  ...on-site.  So, they'll have a total of 19 spaces for eight units.  I thought it was 14 on-street.  It's 14.  Is it 14 on-street?  Uh-huh.  According to this.  14...  I'm reading the parking analysis.  It proposes 16 on-street parking spaces for a total of 19.  Yeah, that includes the parking spaces which are on the 14th Street.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Great.  And those are not all new parking spaces.  As the parking analysis indicates, there are some new parking spaces.  There are some existing spaces on that side already.  Right.  And it seems like they're using those for parallel parking rather than diagonal parking.  Correct.  Yes.  So, there will be an increase on that side.  Yeah.  Yes.  By using it in a different way.  Okay.  Correct.  So, for the eight units, then, they'll be creating 19 spaces.  Total spaces.  Yeah.  There will be 19 total spaces.  Total spaces.  Okay.  The creation of spaces is somewhat less than that.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me see if I had any other questions since I've got you up here.  Okay.  I think that was it.  Okay.  Okay.  I had a question.  In our report, it says that the current Chico Municipal Code does not really have objective  standards.  They're rather subjective at this point.  Sorry.  On which page are we, Ken?  I'm on page five of seven of the blue report.  Yes.  Second paragraph, halfway down.  Staff is undertaking an overhaul of all subjective standards.  And the Chico Municipal Code.  And will propose a replacement for this existing subjective standard with an objective formula  that takes into consideration a variety of factors involved in the parking issue.  Question, when will that objective formula be determined and brought forth?  Because I'm a little uncomfortable just remaining in a subjective mode and would like to see  us get to that objective mode as soon as possible.  So that builders have a more accurate.  And consistent interpretation of what's allowed and what's not allowed.  Yeah.  Pursuant to state law, we've received a grant to convert our standards, the subjective standards  found in the code to objective standards.  This particular standard applies because the applicant is not meeting the city's objective  design and development standards related to parking, but has instead requested the use  of this subjective standard because they believe that it favors them in this case.  And so we do expect to have a work plan put together to create those objective standards  very shortly.  It's in fact a top priority that is on my desk right now.  So I am literally working on it as we speak.  Dexter, I have some questions.  Sure.  Can you hear me all right?  Yes, sir.  Okay.  On page three of the first paragraph, in terms of the project between 17th and 18th on Oak  Street, what are the requirements for the project?  You talked about parking in Oakdale where they did diagonal parking and some onsite  parking.  What was the percentage there and did they have to go through the same process?  They, yeah, the applicant could speak to this also because he was part of that project,  but they did seek a reduction in the total parking there as well.  Okay.  The, um, I guess a question and you may not know this, but just in terms of the units,  they are being moved by us.  Are they two-bedroom, two-bath also?  I believe that there are some three-bedroom in that building as well.  The only reason I know that, though, is because I have been looking to move over the past couple of months.  They are primarily two-bedroom.  There is a sign for rent out there, by the way.  Yes. It's a little bit outside my price range, unfortunately.  And that was my next question.  What are the rents for those units between 17th and 18th?  Do you know?  Yeah, they are ranging between about $1,300 and $1,600 for the two-bedrooms,  which is what I was looking at.  So no low income or any kind of designation?  Not in that building, no.  And this building is proposed as a market rate building.  Let's see. Oh, parking.  Yes, sir.  So I was out of town this weekend, but I did go by like at 9.30, 2.30,  and again at like 7.00.  I got here at 6.00 in the evening just to see what my feeling was.  And just I felt like there was lots of parking there.  You know, after trying to muddle through the parking study and doing all that.  So just my own personal opinion, I think if they do what they're talking about,  I think there's going to be plenty of parking around there.  I thought it was of interest, too, and I don't think whether it matters or not,  but the applicant lives about a block and a half away from the project.  Yeah, the applicant's business is, in fact, next door to the project as well.  Okay, thank you.  Dexter, I think to only one, people have covered some of the things that I had questions about as well.  I just wanted to note that Attachment H, which is the parking analysis related to the project,  I really appreciated this, and it feels like it actually goes to Commissioner Aram Law's question about precedent.  So that with this kind of an analysis, which pretty clearly indicates what Commissioner Aram Eady just spoke to,  his observation, I think maybe we've all made that kind of observation about that neighborhood  and the quantity of on-street parking that's typically available over there.  And this study would clearly support that.  It would indicate that there actually is, on average, a fair amount of parking available.  And so I appreciate the fact that this is included.  Did I?  Did I?  My only question about it is, did you indicate who did this study?  I thought in your report, perhaps it was the applicant who did the study?  Yes, so the applicant conducted most of the observations,  and then I had to go out there to count the total number of parking spaces because the applicant didn't do that.  So it was a team effort, but primarily the applicants work in terms of counting the cars and determining how many spaces were open.  Fair enough.  And so, no, again, I think that the numbers,  here, and again, what we've all observed,  would support what the request is really kind of based on.  And I do also, as I often do at this point in this analysis,  acknowledge that a lower percentage of parking as part of a project like this  has the potential, at least, of the down-the-road impact of encouraging other modes of transportation,  and people may be able, and particularly from this neighborhood,  able to, you know, walk, bike, to shopping, and to other kinds of things.  And so I think for this kind of project, in this location, with this kind of analysis,  it fits right into what many of us have actually been urging we do,  which is reduce that number of required parking spaces so that we start to move away from single-ride vehicles.  So anyway, I applaud that.  I applaud that as part of this project.  Side note, a compliment to the applicant, or the contractor, was that the letter that was sent  did explain a lot of things about what...  The letter of what?  I can't...  What Rich talked about, in terms of Park Avenue, and, you know, access to the bike path on Salem,  bike corridor, and things like that.  I thought it was one of the better letters that I've read from an applicant.  I agree. In the reports that normally of projects like this we have either a report of a neighborhood meeting and was there anything of that nature that occurred in this project? No based on the timing of the  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. and then was not required when it was brought back up so because of because of the timing of and then was not required when it was brought back up so because of because of the timing of the application for architectural review the neighborhood meeting was waived. Were there any  review, the neighborhood meeting was waived. Were there any input from any neighbors within like the  500 or 1,000 foot radius? I know it's not quite as dense with housing as normal projects are,  but there are several in the area that would normally be within the required neighborhood  meeting requirement distance. Yeah, I received no comments from any members of the public  after the mailing. Commissioner Rensink, I was actually assigned to a different project  by this applicant that early version of this project was introduced to the neighborhood  at a neighborhood meeting several months ago now, and there was some early input on the  project design. Was there any significant negative input or opposition? Fairly neutral,  like glad that something's happening there. There was some expression that the coffee  shop that I guess was failing at the time, people were lamenting that.  But the applicant, Chuck, who will be speaking in a few minutes, was explaining how he will  be providing that angled parking all the way down in front of that coffee shop as well  that could perhaps help its success in the future, maybe under different ownership.  Thank you. I have two quick questions. Sure.  So with the on-street parking, I don't notice any lighting. I'm on attachment C in front  of those parking spots. Sure. But that's just a general question. I'm not sure if you're  aware of that. Would that be something that we have discretion to weigh in on?  Yes, that would be something that you would have discretion to weigh in on. And I think  that I have also included in that. Yeah, I was kind of considering that that sort of  thing would be included in condition number three, which requires the parking improvements  on the street to be approved by the director of public works prior to the parking. So I  think that's part of the issue, and so the certificate of occupancy. But if you'd like  to be more explicit about that, that's certainly something that you are empowered to do.  Okay. And then my second question, and maybe, Mike, were you around for, what's across from  1297? 1200 Park Avenue.  1200. I'm guessing there were parking reductions done with that application as well.  Yes, it was a senior project, though, so they already started with low parking requirements.  Okay. So I'm just going to ask you, what was the first thing you did?  I did a lot of the parking.  And they do have some parking that's well hidden away.  Okay. That's it.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yeah, no problem.  All right, thanks.  One final question.  Sure.  So if we approve the parking issue, which is in front of us tonight, and then it goes  to architectural review, does it come back to us again?  No, the idea per, let's see, which condition did I have it in there? The idea per condition  number five is that, you know, the parking is not going to be approved.  So the ARHPB will review this for architectural compliance within 60 days of your approval  of the use permit, and then it will not come back to you. In part, that's because this  is a housing project, which is subject to Housing Accountability Act, or Housing Crisis  Act. I'm sorry.  All right. Good questions. Any further, or should we open up the public hearing? All  right.  We're going to open up the public hearing. I assume we should start with the applicant.  All right. Chuck Tatro is on the line.  And you can just go all the way to the end, Mike, and he's got his slides there.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Is it my turn?  It is.  Hi. This is Chuck Tatro. I don't know if you can see me. I have a couple slides. A  little bit of a delay.  Okay.  So, first of all, to answer a couple questions that came up in your discussion, I did, I  kind of combined the two neighborhood meetings. So Mike already did. I appreciate that. Thank  you, Mike. One suggestion for the apartment complex, which we were already considering  for that area, is having pack lights on the outside of the buildings, which will illuminate  the sidewalks and the parking area really good without projecting light to the neighbors  across the street that perhaps might not want those lights.  So that was an option I was already looking at to illuminate the sidewalk and the parking  areas in front of the buildings there.  And then I'm just going to go into my little list of notes. As Dexter was saying, there  are two criteria. You know, being a COS overlay, that's obviously met. The parking burdens,  I have my exhibit A here. I built this apartment complex between 17th and Oakdale, I think,  four years ago now. And if you can see, the diagonal parking works really well there.  The street on Oakdale is underutilized, which is kind of a good thing to have residential  off of there. You have the main throwaway Park Avenue just to the north. So it's kind  of a nice little off street. The next slide, Dexter, or whoever is running the machine,  that is also what you mentioned, the senior complex. The trees kind of hide the view,  but that also has diagonal parking, I believe, where it says Oakdale Street. You can kind  of see them there.  And then, of course, the parking area. So, you know, I think, you know, I think, you're,  you're going to have to be careful with that.  And my next slide, to be succinct, is the proposed area. And one thing I'd like to bring  to the Commission's attention is I'm not proposing just to improve to my property line. I want  to improve the whole street from 14th to 15th. Both corners, make it, make it have some symmetry  so it doesn't look like it was an afterthought. By doing this, it'll help the drainage in  the area, as well as traffic speed. Those bulbs slow people down.  As while we're putting them in.  And I think you can see that on page one of the site plan. It wasn't numbered in the packet,  so I don't know, but that kind of best shows that it will go all the way down past the  commercial there. And also, like, I think it was mentioned, there's 19 total spots were  required to have 12. And the idea is a multi-use concept where when the coffee shop is open,  in the morning hours, that those spots are open. And then, you know, you can see the  spots could be available to the patrons while the occupants of the apartments are at work  or at school or wherever they tend to be. I don't know if anybody else is eating at  Nobby's, but I know that place gets pretty packed during the day.  I think that, you know, Dexter and Mike and everybody does a great job down there. I appreciate  them. I think that they, in our parking analysis that we took, I think Dexter would be about  200 pictures with timestamps and everything for you to put that analysis.  Thank you.  Thank you for that. I am available and open for any questions that you have. I can answer  for you.  Great. Thank you, Chuck.  You're welcome.  Do we have questions for the applicant? I think you already answered a lot of our questions.  Lots of planning.  Great. Okay. I don't think we have other questions for you at the moment. Do we have any questions  Do we have other members of the public or applicant people on the line?  There are three attendees. There's a call to answer.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. [inaudible]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give them like 10 seconds and then we can close it out.  Well, thank you, members of the public, for listening in.  I think it's important to pay attention to what's going on in our neighborhood.  But if you don't need to comment, that's all right, too.  Okay.  Well, I think unless there's any further public comment or comments by the applicant,  we can close the public hearing.  All right.  So let's close that and we can have further commission discussion.  Oh, there is.  Heidi just said something.  Do you have it?  The comment said we live across the street and approve of the parking.  Okay.  Thank you, Heidi.  Great.  Well, I would just like to thank Chuck for being willing to put together  an infill development project like this.  I think this really fits in strongly with the goals and policies of the general plan  and providing more housing in as dense but yet workable way as possible.  And with that, I would move that the Planning Commission adopt the findings in Resolution 20-10  and approve the project subject to the recommended conditions.  I would like to add my own discussion first.  I'm sure we can second it for further discussion.  Sir?  I'll start.  I'll second.  All right.  Great.  My own discussion, these aren't questions.  Just I wanted to thank the applicant as well as Dexter for doing such a thorough analysis of the parking in this.  As I mentioned, I live fairly close by and I care a lot about the planning projects in my neighborhood  and I know other people in the neighborhood do too.  So I'm actually pretty surprised that we haven't had a lot of people tuning in to make sure that this isn't going to like  uproot the neighborhood or something.  But that really speaks to the quality of this application.  And the analysis in it that we can go in and actually find that info.  Also, I'd like to point out from my own analysis, meaning just I guess experiences around there,  is that I can confirm the numbers in this parking study are pretty accurate.  We don't at the moment have a super heavy utilization of parking right over there.  And I walked by today and once again saw that it's pretty empty, even though.  I'm sorry.  A business just opened up in the old 15th Street Cafe.  Literally today I walked there and my neighbor walked by and told me he was headed there.  It was packed with people in the business and not a lot of cars around.  So that was a really good sign.  Drunken dumplings?  Yeah.  So yeah, that's great.  And also I think that right now in the Barber neighborhood, a lot of people don't even use their off street parking  and are using the on street parking and could potentially move their cars to their driveways.  Or garages or start walking and biking more.  And I think it's great that we're fulfilling the goals of the general plan that involve moving towards less parking  and more other options for transportation.  So I think that's all my discussion.  Again, yeah, great analysis here.  Well, I would like to jump on Commissioner Rensink's comments regarding the infill.  That's really exciting.  And I drove by there today.  I saw the open field.  Well, it was actually yesterday.  And it's going to really be nice.  I agree.  Oh, I also like the design and color of the buildings in the plan.  I have just a question.  I'll throw it out.  Maybe I missed it somewhere.  I've been frantically looking through here.  According to what Chuck said, it's going to go all the way down to 15th.  In terms of the parking and the other bulb at that end.  Is that in the report somewhere?  Is that something that we need to address?  No, that's covered by the conditions.  Yeah, that's covered by the condition related to the construction and striping of the parking areas.  Condition number three.  Because that does reflect that he's going all the way down across the driveway there.  Correct.  From the shopping center that leads out onto Oakdale Street.  Okay.  Thank you.  That driveway needs a little fixing.  So, glad to see that.  I just have one additional question on the lighting.  I appreciate the applicant mentioning that path lighting was an option.  Dexter, I don't feel like condition three really hits on that.  So, we have parking and we have curb and gutter improvements.  I showed you that.  So, we have a light zone on the plot map, but we don't have lighting on the plot map.  Is that something we can add?  Yeah, there's a motion on the floor so you could make a friendly amendment to add an additional condition.  If that would be accepted by Commissioner Rensink.  Would you prefer that to be an additional condition or to modify number three?  Probably easier if it's an additional condition.  Okay.  If that's all right with you.  Okay.  Yeah, I'll just have to think of wording.  Would that be something you would be amenable to?  Yes, I would.  Okay.  Do you want to go with the applicant shall install adequate street lighting as approved by the City of Chico Director of Public Works?  Yeah, second.  That's what I want.  Yeah.  I assume Chuck would be okay with that.  I'm seeing some nodding heads.  Hopefully.  All right.  Good catch.  Okay.  So, we have a motion and a second.  Do we need to do anything to confirm adding that condition to our motion?  Commissioner Rensink made the motion so he would have to say that he accepts the friendly amendment.  Commissioner Scott.  Yes.  And our Vice Chair seconded.  Does she have to accept it?  No.  Rich seconded it.  Oh.  I might have it backwards.  That's fine.  That's fine.  And I certainly concur with Ken.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, is there any further discussion?  Otherwise, all right.  We have the motion and the second.  All in favor signify by saying aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  Any abstentions?  All right.  The motion is approved.  The second motion passes.  Okay.  Moving on to item 4.2, accessory dwelling units.  Title 19 municipal code amendments for consistency with state housing law.  Yes, Madam Chair.  You may recall you just recommended approval of the accessory dwelling unit ordinance and  the council adopted it.  And part of the accessory dwelling unit regulations required that the accessory dwelling unit  be approved by the city.  And the city is required to submit within 60 days a copy of the adopted ordinance,  which we did.  Submitted that.  They reviewed it.  And we had discussed their comments with the reviewer a couple of few weeks ago.  We made minor changes to the ordinance that are reflected in the copy that's on your  attached to your dais right now.  I apologize.  The copy that went out earlier didn't include as much detail and strike out and underline.  This copy does show that.  This copy does show the changes.  They're minor changes.  There are only about four or five different areas.  They had us remove references to alley fees, access requirements that we weren't able to  require.  It's just pretty clean up.  But it was, they're pretty minor.  So if the Planning Commission is comfortable with it, we're recommending that you approve  these, open up the public hearing, and forward a positive recommendation to approve these  minor amendments to council.  Okay.  Thank you. certifying these amendments. Great. If you have any questions we'd be happy to answer them. I have a question Bruce. On 13a about the alley access and so if an ADU goes in there's no in I have a question Bruce. On 13a about the alley access and so if an ADU goes in there's no in I have a question Bruce. On 13a about the alley access and so if an ADU goes in there's no in lieu fees there's no improvements needed so that increases the traffic on the alley and which over  over a long period of time will possibly cause it to decay or whatever.  Whose problem are we taking on here?  I know they're trying to get more ADUs,  but it's also a quality of living issue too for all the people on the alley.  I understand.  And actually the infrastructure is going to decrease  and the quality of the infrastructure will begin to degrade faster,  but state law prohibits us from requiring that fee.  And so what the state is saying is housing is more important than the condition of the alley.  Because this is one of the few things they made us change.  This is one of them.  And coincidentally, before when we did charge the fee,  before this series of laws that came into effect in prior years,  it was a lot of money.  Even if the money that we put into the fees didn't go directly to that alley,  it went into a fund that addressed alleys citywide on a worst case basis.  I had the same exact same concern, Dennis.  It's funny.  And I have concerns just about the condition of alleys all over the city, really.  I mean, they're very inconsistent.  Some are terrific, nice and wide and level and other ones,  you know, potholes four feet deep in them.  So as we move forward with,  you know, the city's plan to promote these ADUs,  which I'm definitely in support of,  it does concern me about, you know, the access to it.  And then I think Dennis's point about having some,  the financial capabilities to take care of those accesses,  have a fund, a way to, a mechanism to fund that.  Do you know what the city,  do they have, have they talked about a long term plan for it, Bruce?  We, you know,  the last time we did the amendments to this,  we did have feedback from Public Works Operations.  Their budget for alley maintenance is really small.  I don't know if Matt remembers it,  but it's a functionally an inconsequential amount.  Right. I think I remember you guys telling us that last time.  That's one of the things that caught my attention.  I mean, there's got to be some kind of a provision in here to,  you know, to do that.  Not through, not with these accessory dwelling unit regulations.  Okay. So that's a discussion for another day,  but something that I think, I mean, as a commissioner,  I'm definitely, definitely concerned with that.  That could, my, Commissioner,  I would recommend that could be a budget,  a capital project item or a budget item.  And that's what, that's what the message was  the last time we discussed it.  Okay.  And we tried to draw your attention to it,  but, you know, they're competing demands.  Right. And we don't get to dole out the money, so.  Well, I think that the other concern,  which I understand we have nothing to do,  but we don't usually get to talk about these type of issues here.  But it, we also unfairly burden developers.  You know, if they're building a brand new project,  they pay development impact fees.  And so we're saying you are going to bear the brunt  of having to pay these fees.  But in order to get ADUs,  we're not going to require the rest of the public to do that.  And that's just something that we're not, I understand.  But I think it's a little bit of a challenge.  that we need these.  One of the things that made it very easy  to support this was having that  in lieu fee for the alley.  I understand that the  state's saying that we have to do this  and it's essentially an unfunded mandate  but I  think as a city we need to be talking  about what that really means  and what we need to be doing  to proactively be discussing this  on a state level.  I agree.  I know we can't do anything about this  but just a quick explanation  Bruce, maybe on number 14  if you would.  Oh, yeah.  That was  this  provision was kind of  a holdover from our previous  ordinance and we didn't  omit it.  We included it in this draft  and it's outside  the parameters of what's allowable  within  the state law.  And so  we just deleted all  references to alley access  because it was problematic  from their standpoint.  So they have to have an independent  exterior access that it could be  coming off the existing driveway  it could be coming  off the alley.  It could be anywhere  and it doesn't say what it has to be.  It could be a gravel walkway  or a sidewalk.  The, and maybe Ryan could jump in here  but the state law was,  we went around and around with this  but the state law is pretty explicit.  State law basically just says  that we cannot require a pathway  to the rear act, the  rear ADU and the pathway is  in this is broadly defined to be any,  basically any pathway,  including this,  this sort of access where it's,  I think the language they use is it's  open from the, you know,  to from the ground to the sky.  And so it's really any type of  delineated path from the front entrance  to the property to the rear ADU.  Kind of cool.  You could do a Tarzan,  you could do a swing and you could swing on a rope.  Okay, cool.  I got it.  I think that's what the legislature was concerned about.  Ryan, are you seeing any,  are any cities pushing back on this?  Is there any like litigation going forward  on these type of provisions?  I haven't seen anything on the pathway provision  in particular.  The alleys more.  The alleys.  I also have not seen any on any litigation on that.  And frankly, these, these, these, these, these,  these laws are all relatively new.  They, you know,  they went into effect on January 1st of this year.  Coronavirus began in March,  basically laid up the courts entirely  to have the sort of litigation  where we'd be getting useful guidance.  It would be months out.  And I think a lot of the cities are just kind of  acquiescing and hoping that there's legislative fixes  coming to these, some of the issues addressed.  And the way that I kind of read this is that this  really only applies if you were  creating an ADU within an existing structure  and weren't adding on or creating a separate ADU  in the back.  Is that correct?  It applies in both cases.  It applies to both.  Any ADU located on the back alley with, yeah.  With primary vehicle access from the alley.  Okay.  Cause I was just looking in 14 where it says  created within an existing single family residence.  So I assume that's like if there was a back garage,  you turned the garage.  You know, you could have a garage in two or something  versus building a separate six or 700 square foot structure.  So that provision 14, what was 14B is,  that is specifically saying that if you add  an accessory dwelling unit to an,  attached to an existing structure,  you have to have an independent access point,  not necessarily a pathway, but some sort of access,  you know, a door that you can directly enter  into that accessory dwelling unit. Otherwise, you can't.  So it's just another part of the home  and not an accessory dwelling unit.  Thank you for that clarification.  Just one final note.  I think it was a letter to the editor,  just very recently,  that somebody wrote in saying they just paved the alley  because of an improvement thing.  And I think the letter writer was the one that did it.  And it's increased the kind of traffic  they don't like to see over there and had a lot more crime.  Anybody else see that?  But anyway, so maybe in lieu fees are better, but anyway.  Okay, good.  It's almost happy hour in Hawaii.  So let's...  All right. Thank you.  Do we have further commission questions of staff  or should we open the public hearing?  All right.  Do we have, well, also, I guess, ex parte communication.  Do we have any of that?  Not sure how we would, but might as well ask.  All right, cool.  Nobody is building an ADU right now.  Okay.  So public hearing,  do we have members of the public on the line  and do we have any comments or raised hands?  We raised hands and encourage them to do so.  They would like to speak.  Why don't we just bring them off on mute?  We can see what happens.  Ms. Witzel, Ms. Metnick.  Doesn't sound like we have any comments.  Thanks to everybody who's tuned in to listen.  All right.  So seeing no public comments and we don't have an applicant,  I think we can close the public hearing.  All right.  And move on to further commission discussion.  I think this is pretty straightforward.  Seems like it.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just, if you have one question, it's kind of related.  I saw the article in the paper, I believe it was,  Bruce, last week about the plans being available.  And did you see any uptick in people wanting to come in and,  and, or did you get calls and stuff saying, you know,  hey, I want to come get some of those or?  Yes, we did.  We got a good amount of interest.  The plans are available.  They're on our website.  Right.  I don't know if that's a sustained floor,  if that's just a slug of people that have been waiting  for the plans because we've had some interest,  they've been waiting for them.  Right.  So we'll see if it's, if it's a sustained demand or if that was  just a first slug of interest.  Do you know how many approximately people have shown  interest?  We've gotten quite a few calls.  Yeah.  And they're all, they're happy and we just tell them,  I don't, we've got, I don't know,  five or ten that have been waiting.  Okay.  In various stages.  They have to prepare a site plan first.  Right.  That gets reviewed and approved.  And then, then they can pay their fees for inspections and  take out the permit.  We give them the plans and.  They're ready to go.  Yeah.  Okay.  Great.  I'd like to make a motion if we're ready for it.  I move that we adopt resolution number 20-11 recommending city  council adoption of an ordinance to amend Title 19 of the Chico  Municipal Code as set forth therein in attachment A.  I'll second it.  Okay.  It's been moved and seconded.  Any further discussion?  All right.  Seeing none, we'll move to item C.  All in favor, signify by saying aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  Any abstentions?  Motion passes.  All right.  Moving on.  Regular agenda.  I don't think we have anything on that, wherever my agenda went.  Okay.  None.  Item 6, reports and communications.  Do we have?  Madam Chair, we'll need to cancel our next meeting.  That's the only thing I wanted to report out.  Okay.  Just note that we're going to cancel our next meeting.  Do we have any other items or?  Right.  Okay.  When do you expect we'll meet again?  I think we'll have something the following meeting after that, but it's tough to say  at this point.  Sounds good.  All righty.  Then we can move on to adjournment, and we'll adjourn to our next regular meeting of, I  think it's September 3rd approximately.  Great.  All right.  Meeting adjourned.  Thank you.  Thank you.
