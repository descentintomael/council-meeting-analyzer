Do we have any public comments? members of the public may address the bidwell park and playgrounds commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda and with commission is determined by the chair based on the number of speakers. The bidwell park and playgrounds commission cannot take any action at this meeting on any request made under this section of the agenda. Do we have any public comments on matters not on the agenda? we do. We have one speaker david simmon. thank you commissioners for allowing me to Weren't you here a couple of months ago and gave us a hand out? I was. I was. I'm the same guy. Now I'm here on the to kind of bring you up to speed on the pipeline swallowtail. As you guys know we're so lucky in our park to have this amazing creature and it's really a valuable asset to our park. I think it's a little bit I think we're kind of missing a couple items that we're missing. I think we're missing a couple items that maybe we should think about. Right now the swallow tails are there in the caterpillar form in the stage and I don't know how many of you people have been to the park recently but there's a lot of them that cross the pavement especially on the north side. The south side not quite so much. But I've been out there the last couple days and you know it's kind of unfortunate that we don't highlight some kind of more protection for them. A lot of them get squashed and a lot of people maybe walk on them or bicycles. Cars in particular are really you know they have no ability to watch out for the swallow tails and I don't know what we could do about it but to me it would be nice to at least alert the public maybe with some signage maybe this year is a little late but something for the commission to think about a little bit maybe we can next year to just try to protect a really valuable asset that we have because they're really a beautiful species. It's really nice to have them and it's really a great addition to Bidwell Park. The cars are a different issue but really the caterpillar stage is only about a week at the most. It really isn't that long. Maybe there's something we could do about you know just saying hey we're not going to have traffic we're not going to have cars for a week or so just to allow this really wonderful species to occur and happen and we're so lucky to have it at our park. So I just wanted to kind of bring you up to speed on that and maybe hope that you would consider maybe taking some action on something like that for the future. So again thank you very much. thank you. just so you're aware I was contacted by the enterprise record today and I'll be talking with them tomorrow about the pipeline swallowtail so you should be seeing an article in the local paper about that creature here soon. in a sense we're blessed that at least this year the vehicle traffic on north park drive is really a great thing to see and effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively the meeting of the matter. I will call item 5.1 consideration of conceptual design options for south park drive. Staff before we get started how many speaker cards do we have on this? we have seven. everybody gets their three minutes. I will call it a day. I will call it a day. I will call it a day. it' s all yours. thank you good evening commissioners. director of public works engineering for the city of chico. I have the privilege to speak about improvements in lower bidwell park the gem of our community. what a privilege to be able to do that and we have exciting projects coming up. information coming out of the commission. we have added two options, options 3 and 4. we will go into more detail on that but start by going through a quick brush over on options 1 and 2. what that entails and some clarity. the goal for this evening and the goal for the project is rehab south park drive. through that process we had a was shown in option 1. subsequent to that option 2 is added based on direction from the city council and then we will go into more detail on those later. ultimately I want to keep in mind the objective of this project first and foremost with the funding is to rehabilitate south park drive and through that opportunity evaluate if we want to do improvements or not. we value and are going to balance the improvements to the park for both visitors and also recognize the importance of the residents along woodland drive especially fronting south park drive there is woodland avenue. we understand it is that balance between finding improvements that park goers can use with the potential impacts to the residents and neighbors over in that area. the goal for this evening is to get a recommendation from the commissioners from the commission to city council. what that might look like is one of the options with if you have additional comments that you want to add those can all be forwarded to the city council. I do want to communicate that if we have to come back again to the city council we will be and we will be back again to we will lose time here so the hope is we can get through a recommendation to the city council this evening so we can stay on track with the design and ultimately bidding for construction in 2026. with that long introduction. to remember where we were this is a recap of what was included in the headway report. we will be back in a few minutes for clarity there seem like there is a lot of discussion and concern with the parking on the south side of south park drive there. from our perspective what we were doing there is trying to memorialize something that is already being used there and trying to do it in a more controlled and thoughtful manner as you see cars sometimes will more thoughtful effort also offsetting the impact of the loss of the parking on the north side of south park drive. again in option one it is a multiuse path separated from the vehicular lane so in order to achieve that we have to widen the existing pavement width and as you can see on this first sheet there are some trees we would want to avoid so we don't have to do that. wedge the needle through some trees and then comes back and is contiguous with the drive lane. the second sheet again just kind of showing the continuation of that path with the parking. and then option two again based on city council direction of consideration of closing to vehicles completely we are just providing a detail of what that might look like. and then option three is! and so I think again the biggest impact we look at there is the impacts of creating additional access then with no vehicular traffic on south park drive having to add in a access point at sycamore fields parking lot in order to offset that access constraint with no vehicles. so that's kind of option two. there is some discussion on collision data so we provided a table here pretty minor impacts not much in the way of really concerning or significant traffic impacts essentially for reported incidents over an eight year span. okay so option three is based on the input from the commission and essentially could you back up to that previous slide? yes. okay so option three is based on the input from the commission and essentially could you back up to that previous slide? okay so option three is based on the input from the commission and essentially it's a option one with some modifications most notably looking at reducing the impacts eliminate some of the parking and putting in some parallel parking so that it wasn't heading in and facing woodland avenue but still providing some parallel parking spaces. okay so option three is based on the input from the commission and essentially could you back up to that previous slide? similar to that option four is essentially no new improvement option where we simply rehabilitate the pavement surface keep it as is and just improve the roadway and keep it as is. one thing i wanted to also address is there is some discussion on improvements of adding parking to the horseshoe pit area. we have not included that at this time due to kind of unknowns there. i think if that's something the commission would like to see that might be a recommendation to the city council to consider kind of in parallel but again the focus of this project is rehabilitation of south park drive and if we added that there's a lot of unknowns in terms of the environmental impacts and the cost implications of that so adding that would kind of add some lack of clarity in terms of the scope and the availability to still deliver the rehab of south park drive. so that's why we didn't include that but again i know that was a point of concern brought up by the commission and we agree i think that's a great idea and the future to consider didn't necessarily include it in these as we didn't want to commit to something that was unknown that could potentially delay this project or make it not buildable due to increase in cost so based on that that sorry the rest of the no build option lastly we had just a rough planning level cost estimate of the four different options and what that might entail and so just trying to do a high level estimate of what the cost of improvements would be that concludes my report i'm available for any questions can you just go back to that last yeah alright thank you thank you yeah ladies first thank you i just wanted to say thank you to your team and to you for bringing us different options yes a couple of questions on option two one why is it the most expensive and are you improving the road in option two even though you're not going to allow traffic through there so first part cost wise looking at comparing that to option one the biggest cost appears to be the additional of permeable parking service so that's a $300,000 increase compared to option number one and then the mobilization cost so yeah you know these are planning level estimates doing our best to factor in all the different pieces yeah option one would be an increase likely in the pavement width so there would be some additional cost there so on option two you will repave the road correct okay under option one or i'm sorry under option three the parking on the south side of park avenue will not be improved but parking will still be allowed there you're not going to put no parking signs up so it will just be unimproved in option three so say that again sorry it looks like in option three you've eliminated the improved or or base parking on the south side of park avenue south park and woodland but are you going to still allow people to park there even though it will not be improved are you talking on the north side of south park drive south side of south park drive between it and woodland like this area right here yeah we're showing those would still be allowed to have parking just no change to what it is right now it's allowed to park there it will just be not improved i think the intent would be to put some barriers around the existing trees so that we prevent folks from parking vehicles on the root zones of those trees last question did your consultant study develop any data on how often an event at the park results in over low parking on woodland avenue in the neighborhood no thank you thanks for your report and your work i have three questions number one do we know what the budget is for this project yet is it dependent on the option that we choose we have some constraints we don't have an exact dollar figure but we have enough to cover essentially what we originally planned on was option one so that's currently what we have available there's always those are construction costs and we always have construction inspection and then staff time associated with it so there's always and then we always have budgeted contingencies have a budget for every project inevitably hits change orders so we factor all that into our budget okay and then for the new option three how many trees would have to be removed if any for that option if you know we don't intend on removing any healthy trees i know we walked the site months and months ago and there are some trees that are already dead that we talked about removing that need to be kind of removed anyways but the intent is with the path we're going to avoid removing any trees as much as possible i think there are a couple small ones that we might have to do at caper acres but overall pretty minor and then obviously if we remove anything we're going to offset that by planting additional trees in their place okay and my last question and i'm sorry if this was covered at the last meeting i know there are a lot of interested parties here if you'll commit to this what in your opinion is the best option or the least impactual option on the woodland residents yeah we tend to sequentially prioritize our recommendations so i think option one based on the traffic study performed and recommendations is the best alternative that kind of balances those needs of the neighbors as well as the park users in a safe and functional manner it's going to cost a little bit more money in terms of widening the pavement having to navigate around some of those trees but i think it achieves the objective of maintaining vehicular access so you're not pushing those vehicles over to woodland avenue that would increase the traffic counts there by also providing parking on the south side so that again you're not getting that spillover parking use onto woodland avenue and so i think that in my opinion becomes the best alternative but obviously again there's there's a lot of no right perfect way to do it that's just based on our staff analysis and professional recommendation thank you last question do you have a count on how many new improved parking places are under each option i don't it's a variable you can adjust up and down yeah but the most new improved parking places is option one it would seem just by looking at the yeah you're putting in more than you're removing on the north side but again that can vary we can not put in as many obviously the needs of the park have changed over the decades and providing that type of parking i think again just would further provide access and parking on site versus on woodland avenue and so that was kind of the concept behind showing the full length as much as possible and i'll just kind of go back and forth a little bit more about that that we can think of i think we have a lot of especially down that south side nearest cypress you see you know a lot of formalized added spots so you pick up the most parking there and then again in the future to consider potentially use of the horseshoe pit areas as increased capacity for that one mile use okay let's see if i can get that on well first off i want to start by saying thank you for taking in some of the feedback and presenting some alternatives to what we were originally presented with i think we heard a lot of feedback from the neighbors at the last meeting who were not fans at all of one or two really a lot of it and we had a lot of talk as you recall at the beginning of the meeting about what we were really trying to solve what we were really trying to solve i think still even seeing some of the data it doesn't necessarily support a lot of the shift that is being proposed one thing i was curious about so my husband and i walk there every day and we go at different times depending and i don't know if you all have noticed but around the sycamore field the there is a propensity of course to use the parking that is on the south side of south park drive but the reason for that is because people won't park where there's already parking in the sycamore parking lot because the fence doesn't extend and it's not high so no one wants to get their car bashed by softballs and i think that's a very i'm i want to hand us a potential win here to say option four is actually good to just repave not add additional parking and but what i was curious about is i didn't see an option where we could effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively So perhaps a good win-win kind of a scenario would be a hybrid of three four where you do four with the repaving but allow for the pedestrian slash bicycle adjacent. Do not add parking but instead budget which you have a healthy budget here for a chain link fence to go along the west side of Sycamore Field to almost where the other path tees off almost near the end of it right. You could gradually come down of course. I don't know how many big major league hitters we have out here but you know figure it out where it'd go. You'd pick up a ton of parking along that side because we consistently looked. I took photos no one's parking there literally like maybe one to two park at the very end where they know they won't get hit. So that's just to me. Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively effectively Earnings effectively Earnings effectively that the neighbors can still be in the park which is why I say four but maybe with a little hybrid to have some compromise with the neighbors saying we like this but doesn' t seem like the data supports saying no to cars but we could allow for this we have additional parking I don' t know what my fellow commissioners think and I don' t know if they took that into account it' s actually a little more dangerous when you have people adjacent to where the cars and creates because the different size vehicles create a challenge we walk our dog and everything there and sometimes you end up having to dart around because of people not looking so just throwing that all out there. By the way I appreciated your explanation about the horseshoe pits because that' s one of my questions what happened to that. appreciate those comments and for clarity the funding source for the project currently is measure h funds the source of the funds are. thank you. I am looking at comparing number one and number three essentially and I want a clarification here because I' m not quite seeing it on these sketches and that is I feel like on number one people will access that parking from woodland avenue because I' m not seeing a barrier essentially between the parking spots but on number three it looks very clearly that they' ll access it from south park avenue. I' m just wondering and then I have a follow-up question with that or follow-up concern with that maybe I' m just wondering which how will cars access the parking in one compared to three are they both from south park avenue is one from woodland and one from south park and then I have a follow-up comment on that. Yes. I' m just option one would remain as it is in terms of access currently so right now your access points from woodland are at the one mile parking area as well as caper acres but caper acres is really only an egress point. Obviously you have access the main access off of cypress. In option three you essentially have the same situation. if you did not include a sycamore field access so essentially one and three in terms of number of access points would be the same? would be the same so they' d be coming in off south park avenue driving on south park avenue and pulling in for diagonal parking or trying their hand at parallel parking. This is where my follow-up question is and that is I am I really really diagonal parking because it' s a safety concern honestly compared to the diagonal parking. I' wondering if we need the additional diagonal parking because I' concerned about people backing out onto south park drive from those diagonal parking spots. I could see that could be just a potential for people backing out and then lots of traffic or bikers or walkers coming along that. So I think that' s a possibility. s a possibility. s my only hesitation with that access off of south park is that diagonal parking backing out and I' m wondering if parallel parking. parallel parking tends to be a safer option because you have more visibility. Given the low speed of south park drive and pretty much every car has backup cameras nowadays I think those are kind of things that maybe lessen the concern. It' s more it' s more of a s s s s s s s s s s ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss ss crossing and the reality is whether it's parallel or diagonal people are going to get out and want to cross right there and again with the low speeds and kind of that use currently it's it's not as much of a concern and so if usually you want to use crosswalks when you're kind of funneling pedestrians or bicyclists to cross at certain locations and so the reality is i don't think anyone would get out and then kind of walk down the travel lane to an area to cross over they're just going to cross over okay i think governor newsom told us we could jaywalk anyway we don't but my second comment is um what while i appreciate commissioner nava's suggestions i think it's important that we send something to council tonight as you pointed out if we delay then there'll be a delay and in my mind you were telling us if we delay this is going to be bumped out to 2027 or further so i think that if we do have some major suggestions we could all of us as individuals go to a council meeting and present them at that time when they review this issue but i think it's imperative for us to while this is in the forefront and we have money for it and we have momentum to try and stick to a timeline that that you've provided for us thank you i just want to add a little clarification for the process we have to go through so for those that don't know because we're a public agency we have to develop plans and specifications we advertise for construction and then contractors private sector contractors bid on our projects and by law we have to accept the low bid and so we target the winter season typically to advertise our construction contracts because that's typically when contractors are looking to develop their backlog of work and they're a little hungrier so they sharpen their pencils i've been a contractor before i've seen it whereas later in the coming season maybe february march april if you're advertising for construction effectively contractors that maybe already have their backlog to keep their crews busy and so rather than a six percent profit margin margin they throw twelve percent and so we tend to see our bid prices go higher effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively re getting that winter season for advertising so we can make sure we' re getting the best price possible. I have a budget question here. Option four is quite a bit less than the other three options and my question is if we went with four does that money that you have budgeted for option two I believe you said would that get rolled in the general fund or would that come back to the parks for upgrades in the park? yes, again the funding source for this is measure h designated towards the city council adopted a ten-year roadway project list and so these roads were on that list so the intention is we have cost savings we usually pull it back into our roadway fund and then what that does is allows us to start design on the project projects that are three four or five years out so we can start our design and make sure they' complete prior to the construction years. It doesn' necessarily stay directly with the park but they become funds that are available for other roadway uses. I ask that question because I spent some time on the weekends in this general area and in my opinion it' s utter chaos and it' s not chaos because of the roadway. you have people on cell phones that are walking blocking the main road and I' m wondering if we do put option three a separate path will the people even use that because I find bicycles ride tandem walkers walk tandem I don' t know how much of the cyclists and pedestrians will use option three those pathways. that' s a good question. first off I want to add on the budget question one thing we talked about is if we do come in below budget is looking to pay the parking lot areas that are currently gravel. Again that' s something we would evaluate at the time when we receive bids and see where the bids come in at. To answer your follow-up question what I' ve seen typically is people tend to want to be in the areas you allow them they' re also going to do whatever they want sometimes. From an engineering standpoint it' s best to designate which is why we provide option one and that' s why you saw the licensed traffic engineer recommend the separation of those uses so that people tend to know where they' re supposed to be. Inevitably if they don' t I think it' s no different than it is in today' s environment where it' s bidirectional traffic in terms of bikes and pedestrians. pedestrians with vehicles going one way. From an engineering standpoint it' s typically a best practice to separate those. we separate just looking at the cost it costs quite a bit to separate versus non-separate that. That' s what I' m looking at. you start to go down the plus and minus of cause and effect and removing vehicles then creates a lot of different needs and uses in the park. thank you. I' ve got a question in the diagram on option four it looks like there' s going to be accommodating have room to accommodate motor vehicles and other uses would those be separated by striping or something? it would be the same exact way it is right now. but a little wider? no it would stay within the existing footprint of the pavement. okay. commission private. sorry my brain starts working and I just go. back to the parking and that issue again it' s a safety thing for me and I' m wondering would it be possible to do back in diagonal parking instead of pulling forward in diagonal parking in that option three? that could be an option for sure. That definitely is something that could be considered and as a recommendation to the council. I think the only place we have back in is around the plaza. Pretty underutilized probably because of the speed and volume of vehicles that are traveling through broadway and main and then the parking lot is a little bit! but park again slower speeds it tends to be a safety improvement when you have back in as a result of being able to see oncoming traffic as you' re pulling out. thank you. so what are the major differences between one and three? basically the parking providing parking versus diagonal parking. and the additional ingress he has? on two of them? is it in one and not in three? is my understanding? we do not have the additional ingress at sycamore field. okay. on both one and three there is no connection because vehicles would be allowed on south park so there' s no need to create that additional access point. and i think clarification where the parking starts in one is much sooner much closer to the entrance of the park compared to where it starts in option three. and which provides more parking one or three? one. okay. thank you. i did just want to harken back to what some of the neighbors had pointed out a lot of the neighbors parking system which was that they don' t mind the overflow for the special events they' re used to that and it' s more the continual drip that would be a concern with what some of the options were that seemed to create where that might occur. and then again i do want to point out that originally there was no parking along the south side of south park drive that became a thing there were a lot of us that parking system and the signs didn' t go up and of course they did that. i think people need to understand there' re some people where it directly is impacting them some of us use the area on a daily basis and others don' t so i would ask my peers to hear what people have been saying the last meeting listen to whatever feedback we get tonight from the various people here and take into consideration the intended usage and i think one of the things we got some stuff late and it didn' t come back to us when we were all told it would it got delayed quite a bit now we' re jammed up a bit where people feel like we have to make a decision and that' s not necessarily something to me that would prod a decision that maybe a lot of people don' the city and the city is going to be a great place to help us out ongoing. That' s just another consideration throughout there. I guess it' s for the parks I noticed when I did my walk through there are signs that say no motor vehicles no motorized bicycles. I know under the vehicle code that a golf cart which is an electric vehicle is a motorized vehicle. Is that sign going to be changed or does that mean these e-bikes are not going to be allowed? Those signs are posted along the park. the policy on e-bikes is developing we haven' t reached a decision on what we' re going to do with them. s a lot of different ways to look at it as e-bikes are evolving. At this point I can' t say what' s going to happen with signage there. thank you. thank you very much. does that conclude the staff presentation? then we will take comments from we have in your packets we have a letter from kelly cummings. one from rose marie burke it looks like. rose mary burke. one from sue ellen rollison. one from susan. parks or what? park. park okay. we have one from. we have one from. dana and louise ward. one from tom carter and one we got this afternoon from susan park. does everybody have those? okay they will be incorporated in the record by reference. so. kathleen could we have speaker number one? speaker number one is whitney with chico velo followed by jill serco. okay. good evening commissioners my name is whitney garcia and I' m one of the managers for chico velo. our mission is to promote bicycling for transportation and health through public education advocacy and community stewardship. we strongly support option 3 that is being presented here tonight. we value this redesign for reasons related to safety traffic flow and visibility. bikers pedestrians and equestrians will be able to safely use one side of the road and cars will not lose their accessibility to the parking spaces. we hope visibility of our community will continue to be a high priority for the future of our community. any questions for the meeting? our next speaker? our next speaker is jill serco followed by donna carter. I' m having trouble hearing through this hearing speakers what they' re saying so I' m just going to talk to you without it if that' s fine. good evening. thanks for having the meeting for us. I' ve lived on my name is jill serco and I' ve lived on woodland avenue for 45 years. I look out my kitchen window at caper acres and I also see the softball baseball area directly from my kitchen window. I am in great favor of option 4. my husband and I have been there as I' ve said we have never been in a car or versus a pedestrian accident or a car versus a bicycle accident. the safety we' re constantly watching what goes on at the caper acres, the heavily populated areas along woodland avenue and they seem to be doing fine. there' s no evidence really that shows a big safety factor there as we' ve been there for the past 45 years anyway. I' ve participated in lots of events in the park. we' re used to the overflow especially events the fourth of july that residents there know that that' s going to happen and we are ready for that. we make our adjustments. there' s also adequate parking at the card center. they use that. they use the parking at the chico unified school district office and the city streets behind the caper acres. we are woodland avenue. everybody in the neighborhood loves the neighborhood and is willing to work with that and make adjustments for that. there was a neighborhood meeting in april. about 30 residents in our area attended that. and since really safety and parking aren' e a problem why are we trying to fix something or a problem that doesn' t exist? that' s the most common comment that we' re hearing from the neighbors. the intersection where seventh and woodland come together is a large intersection which allows the cars area to maneuver. my husband and I sit out we have a little patio area and we sit out often in the evenings or in the early mornings having coffee or whatever. and there are big fire trucks and many school buses and the garbage waste disposal trucks that go in and out. many of them that big area is a safe area for larger vehicles too. and the idea of more entrances onto woodland avenue in front of residents homes would cause more congestion and traffic on woodland avenue. and it seems to be oh darn well i' m pushing for option four. thank you. our next speaker is donna carter followed by georgie bell. i' m donna carter and my husband was going to be here tonight and talk he got sick so he wrote a letter which i' m going to read. he says i have reviewed proposed options one two three and four in detail. i believe that option four represents the best option for both park users and residents of woodland avenue. this option allows for easy access to the one mile pool sycamore field and caper acres. option four allows for a smooth one way flow of traffic on south park drive and also provides for adequate parking. option four does not propose new entrance and exit points which would create traffic congestion on woodland avenue. south park drive is slated to be repaved in the near future. my personal suggestion would be to widen south park drive by just a couple of feet. this would give cars, bicycles and pedestrians slightly more room when passing each other. i believe option four would best serve the city of chico for years to come and would maintain the beauty of the park. sincerely tom carter and i just have one more we walk in the park every day and cars usually go slow they're not the problem it's the e-bikes that fly by going the wrong direction 35-40 miles an hour i mean it's very dangerous. so anyway. thank you. we will have an opportunity to discuss it after the public session. if we could hold our applause i appreciate your support of the speakers and their positions but it' s disruptive please. our next speaker. our next speaker is georgie bellen followed by ann bellen. thank you. i' m glad to be here and i thank staff for the time they have given me to answer questions i had. i too live on woodland across from the sycamore baseball fields and i also favor four item four but also three if you can' t go with four. four is the best choice here. the thing i wanted to talk about is one of the biggest concerns we had is speed. they' re talking about the e-bikes but it' s also cars coming down there hurrying to caper acres. i think if you widen the roadway just even a few feet like they were talking about in item four if you just made it a little bit wider but one of the things that i think because we see so many events people do their runs last weekend with the american cancer society so their run starts right there at the sycamore baseball fields you' ve seen the starting line that' s right there backs up for hundreds and hundreds of yards for people. it' s so congested there when they do the events they don' t start the events up at five mile they don' t start them on the other side of one mile they start them right there that' s why i think one would just not be a good plan or two i think three maybe but with four i think you can accomplish what we need to do there for woodland avenue and for the park users and the first thing i would say is you' ve got to slow down the speed and i don' t know how you do that whether you do speed bumps you do color pavement you do whatever you do with signage the e-bikes the scooters those are the things not the people with strollers not the people with little kids i think widening it a little bit would be good but i also think from one of the items i think it' s on two the sycamore baseball field parking area that' s now gravel and dust parking lots effectively effectively effectively fence, put up that fence to keep the baseballs from going there, and we created a better parking lot down there past the baseball fields, that's just been neglected. I mean, that's the one thing you should be doing, because there might be 10 food trucks and 30 tents right down there in Sycamore Field in the dust. So not putting a surface down on it, I think you're making a mistake. But I hope you make a wise choice, because we're going to be living there for a while, and we want to be a good neighbor, just like we hope you want to be a good neighbor to us. Okay, thank you. Mr. Chairman, Ms. Bedland. Oh, yeah, thank you. Yes. Sure. Never mind. I was overruled. Pardon? That's what they taught us in training. But can I, I'll answer something. You can ask questions. Counsel usually let people ask questions. Sure, well, let's see. The commissioner. I can answer a public speaker question, if you allow it, if they wish. We were told not to, because then that gives the speaker extra time. Oh, I get three more minutes? No. I'm only kidding. I'll answer something. It's true, but it's up to you. Go ahead, Marty. Since you sat up here for a few years, I'm trying to understand why you and maybe your neighbors don't want more parking in the park, which I think, I think it's a concern for the neighborhood to alleviate some of the pressure in the neighborhood. Apparently, that' s not a concern for the neighbors? Overflow parking is something you don' t want solved. No, the parking thing is not a problem. Honestly, not a problem. Cars pulling into that grassy area with the trees, now you took down all the green and then you put the little rail fence up. So now we look at cars if they park there. Not many do. But I' m more concerned about the cars parking facing us with their lights. At night when they' re doing the baseball games, those cars will all be facing our living rooms and our kitchens and our windows. So, no, we' re not concerned about the parking. We' re not concerned about the parking. Just a wider road and a great parking lot down by Sycamore Field. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah, I did put in eight years on the planning commission, eight years on the city council, architectural review board, airport commission. Yes, I have sat up there many times. Thank you. Next, Baker. Our next speaker is Dr. Our next speaker is Ann Bykirk-Kaufman followed by Bruce Burke. Hello. So I' m an avid bicycle commuter and I go down that stretch of south park drive every single day. So I have suggestions that are hybrids of three of the options. So first of all, I do like the idea of back-end diagonal parking. As in option one, that makes the headlights not face the houses on Woodland Avenue and it' s safer for the pedestrians and the bicyclists. And as Brendan Autoboni said, almost all vehicles have the backup cameras now. So backing into a spot isn' t hard. And then from option two, I like the idea of parking in the parking lot. I like the part about not allowing vehicles between Cypress and the entrance to the one-mile parking lot. Because you really don' t need to drive there. You can get into the park at the one-mile driveway. You don' t have to get into the park from the main entrance. And there' s hardly anybody ever parks along there and they aren' t supposed to anyway. But then I also like option four. In Europe, in a lot of places, they have the concept of shared space. So bicyclists and pedestrians and cars all share the space. And they have the concept that the cars are guests. And so there' s traffic calming like bicycle-friendly speed bumps. There' s signs that continually say, okay, vehicles must yield to bicycles and pedestrians. And then there' s a lot of traffic calming. People generally go really slow on that piece of road anyway. And so it would be a lot cheaper to just put in some traffic calming rather than building a whole separate trail for bicycles and pedestrians. And I think it could be true that people would tend to not use that anyway. And it could start getting neglected and become like the path that' s further away. So it' s a little bit more of a So I' m suggesting a hybrid of three of the options. And then that would save a lot of money. And that money could then be used to fix some of the seriously deteriorating pathways that we have for bicycles and pedestrians. Like the connection between East and West. podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem podem podem! podem podem Avenue for 33 years. I'm a cyclist, I'm a dog walker, and I enjoy the park on a regular basis. My wife and I strongly oppose, well, strongly support, you know, the preposition for. We feel that the parking between, let's say, Linden Avenue and Cypress, that diagonal parking, parallel parking, or whatever you wanted to do, back-end parking, is unnecessary. Except during those events, such as the Easter egg hunt in the spring and the swimming on New Year's Day. And those big events. People are not going to park that far away from Sycamore Pool, out there on Woodland Avenue and down towards Cypress. They're not going to park there to play baseball. They're going to be parking further on down. And so I think the parking spots in Proposition 3 are not valid. I think the money saved as a Proposition 4 would help buy speed limit signs. There's only one 15-mile-per-hour speed limit sign between Cypress Avenue and the highway overpass. I went out counting today. Even that pole was tilted over 30 degrees, having been hit or something. I think that we need to be careful. I think that we need to be careful.

I live on woodland and oddly the parking doesn' t really affect my house it stops before that. It could be the elder berries I planted 12 years ago that are on woodland in front of my house. I' m keeping my beetle friends alive. I noticed it stopped before the elder berries that' s great. I wasn' t here for the first meeting I' super curious about the traffic study. Normally with a study there' s a reason for the study it' s safety it' s circulation it' s capacity parking capacity in this case or it' s beautification maybe. I' not sure if I' m going to be able to I hate to think we had extra money in the budget so we decided to throw in parking which it sounds like this is it unless there' s a parking study done that says there' s a capacity issue there with the vents which I don' t know you need a study to say there' s a capacity issue there because there' s cars all over the place and there' s cars in front of woodland avenue. Regardless of what parking you put there people will park where it' s the most accessible and they' re going to park on woodland. It' s not going to change when we add this parking. We all know that and we don' t mind it. We' re used to it. That' s not an issue parking on woodland it' s going to continue. Then you look at the different ways of where to put the parking and I look at safety. Is safety an issue I wouldn' t have information on that so the city has information on safety. It can be somewhat unsafe as you' re walking on south park you' re looking behind you you have to be careful that could be an issue. We don' s going to be an issue maybe they' re going to improve safety with this. I don' t think so because we all know that type of parking creates like Nicole said it creates a safety issue when people walk. People and kids walk between cars and now they' re going to walk into a wider lane so we have that issue potentially. Capacity we don' t know about the capacity part so maybe there were some studies done by the traffic engineer. Beautification we know that capacity it will increase capacity so we know that' s a win. We' re going to get more parking there. We' there. We' there for the park. Why? Nobody understands why but maybe somebody has that answer. And beautification we know this is a negative on beautification. You' re going to destroy the park residential interface. Urban and parking the urban and park interface by putting parking there. As opposed to increasing beautification on south park which will prohibit cars from parking there. So I think we' If you' re going to vote for three you should not allow that access onto woodland. You should leave it where it is. You' re going to funnel more traffic down woodland. You' re not improving circulation in order to get to 9th street. You' re just moving it for whatever reason. It' s probably about $100,000 to move that thing. I don' t know. thank you Mr. Gonzales. you' re welcome. our next speaker is peter washington followed by denise hardy. good evening peter. good evening. thank you. first of all thank you all for your service and for allowing me to speak tonight. I think I' m in the minority. I also live on woodland avenue. I' m across the street from sycamore field. I' ve been there for 13 years with my wife and kids. We consider ourselves very lucky to live there. People talk about bidwell park being the jewel of the city. I totally agree. I think that' s why a lot of us choose to live there. I think it' s very lucky to live there. I went to the special meeting a couple of years ago in the neighborhood. And we heard I think we were effectively presenting with what' s option one right now. And a lot of concern was exps podem podem exps podem exps podem exps exps exps exps exps exps exps exps exps exps exps exps exps exps uses the park is we walk and we ride our bikes. And that's how a lot of people in this town use the park. It sounds like that's not the consensus, is to keep cars out of the park, or out of at least that portion of the park. But I hope you'll continue to consider it, and I hope you will keep in mind that the park is for the whole city. The concerns of the neighborhood are important, but we chose to live across the street from the park, and we're extremely lucky to be there. And so, you know, we're here because it's right across the street from us. And so, we're interested in voicing our opinions, you know, my neighbors and I. And I don't discount that their concerns, I don't think any of these options are perfect. And if you and the council decide that, you know, keeping things as is is the right way to go, you'll have your reasons, and part of that will have been hearing from the neighborhood. But I want you to know the neighborhood doesn't speak entirely with one voice. And I also, one thing I've heard tonight is that option one was the result of a study of professionals who understand park design, traffic design, urban design, with the exception of the previous speaker, who I think has more expertise than I do in those areas. I'm not sure that the rest of my neighbors I could be wrong. But I don't know that we all have a lot of expertise in those areas, so I hope you'll also consider the input you've gotten from experts. Anyway, thank you very much for your time. Thank you, Mr. Washington. Our final speaker is Denise Hardy. Hello. Thanks for another opportunity to speak to you. From the last meeting to this meeting, I appreciate the two additional options. I may have misunderstood option one when it was last presented. I thought there was an additional exit entrance up Linden into the park, but it sounds like maybe I was wrong. There was also had been discussion of changing the exit from Caper Acres. Previously, that wasn't really discussed tonight in option one, so that's confusing to me. However, I don't like it either way. Number four is really what I appreciate most. I like the idea of repaving and saving money that I think could be used for streets around the park as a bike rider, as a walker, as a runner. I have real difficulty with a lot of the streets on 6th, 7th Street. All of those streets have massive potholes. Use some of the money. Those are streets going to the park. I would think that that could be used that way. There are safety issues that I see as a homeowner for 26 years from the park. A lot of people go the wrong way in their vehicles, not just on bikes. It's a one-way down South Park. Oh no. Lots of people go the wrong way. I have stopped people, reprimanded people. I've gotten flipped off. It's really an issue. The other thing is the speed down the street pretty darn fast and not just the EV bikes. Speed bumps, I think, would be a really good addition if we're concerned about safety. Option number four has my vote. I do want to say that with the parking addition idea, option one and three, I think it would look ugly. I think beautification is an important thing in this world today. You removed a lot of the green was already removed, replaced by wood fences. Now there's talk about, okay, let's put bushes back in. I don't know. Fire mitigation, is that such a good idea to hide the cars from the people on Woodland Avenue? That seems strange to put it back when it was taken away. I just kind of think don't do too much. Just do what's needed, which is repaving and maybe some additional space on the sides. The speed bumps, the encouragement of people to drive correctly one way, and then fix some of the roads around the park if you can use that money for that. Thank you. that' s all our speakers? okay. I need to close the that being our speakers, thank you all for coming. I will hereby declare the hearing closed. . . Is there a motion to make a decision on any of the options by the commission? We probably should have a motion and then we can start a discussion on a motion or we can maybe discuss things a little bit first. If we need some clarification. . Okay. Let' s clarify. I just had a couple of things. I was a little confused about headlight concern into the Woodland residents. The park is closed at dusk or dark. I don' t think headlights shine regardless of the parking structure. I think it' structure in options one and three. I don' t understand how headlights could be a concern for the woodland residents. The second thing, if we choose the cheapest option, as brendan told us, that money is not necessarily going to money saved is not necessarily going to go to the park or go anywhere we want it to go. It' s going to go where it' s needed and that is definitely not anything that is within our purview or our decision making process. The third thing, I think the extra access onto woodland was removed from options one and three. Is that correct? . . . I would like to say that this decision is being made for the benefit of the most, a majority of chicoans, not just the people who live on woodland. I understand your concerns and I appreciate you coming. We have to consider what most benefits a majority of people who live in chico and use the park. That being said, woodland residents may feel that extra parking isn' t needed because of what you observe. But maybe a majority of people who live in chico and use the park would like to come in and have a little bit of a break. the The majority of people who live in woodland and the majority of chicoans do not like parking on 7th Street behind woodland. They do not like parking on the surrounding streets. And given an option, would prefer to park in the park. Those are just a few things that I thought of when the speakers were giving their most wonderful and helpful presentations. Thank you for being here again. I know Mr. Washington referenced the special meeting we had in the park a couple of years ago. That was really useful. I know most of you were there also. Thank you for paying attention for a few years now. And being patient with the process. I will wait and see when you are ready for a motion. I had one question. I think it may have been Mr. Gonzales raised. Is this a project we' re doing because we have money to spend? this was identified as a priority by the city council to repair the roadways. That was the core focus of this project and this funding was to rehabilitate the roads that are in poor condition. Thank you. Just if I could follow that up. The traffic study didn' t just study this area right here. The traffic study encompassed all of lower park. And the traffic flow of all of lower park. South Park Drive and Memorial Drive Peterson, Memorial Drive too. And the ingress and egress of the traffic flow of all of lower park. And we had to do it throughout the entirety of lower park. So the traffic study was not just for this area. Okay. One other question. There was some talk about an access at second moore field. There' s always the one that goes into one mile. Will that remain? Yes. Okay. With the egress on to seventh. Yes. The one change for ingress, egress and options one and three would really be at caper acres. We had a change in the The one change is that it would be a direct access. And it' The one change is that it would be a direct access. Right at the exit point of the parking lot. Right now you have to go on to South Park Drive. And it' s one way. The recommendation in options one and three would essentially relocate that access to make it bidirectional. So people can get in and out of caper acres. Reducing the need for visitors to have to go down South Park Drive just to get to caper acres. That makes sense. Okay. The next question. thank you. I appreciate all the community members who have come out. You make me think and that' s a really good thing. I really appreciate your perspectives and the questions and concerns you have. One of the things I was picking up on I think I was picking up on was the fact that the I think that was a good point. There' s actually an option five out there that you all kind of a few of you mentioned which was widening the existing road, repaving it but without adding a paved portion of parking on the south side of south park drive. That was a theme I kind of picked up. Widen the road a little bit. parking and bicycles or skateboards and then also have a separate lane for one-way traffic. My question about that is there seems to be parking that' s just happening on the south side of the road right now. Whether that is paved or not it sounds like it' s happening at this point. Is there a benefit or is there a drawback to letting the road be paved or having it still as a dirt area? I seem to remember Brendan that you said that some of the vegetation around there might be getting a bit damaged. I just want to clarify that with you. What is the benefit if we what are the differences basically because the big difference I see between three and four is that there' s paved parking designated parking on the south side. It doesn' t necessarily have to be paved parking. We didn' t show it as paved I think we showed it as pavers so it' s not asphalt it' s more of a porous I think surface. That was intended to push vehicles away from the trees. I' ve personally seen it cars when it' s really busy especially during events trying to squeeze in there and they get up right up on tree root zones and that' s how you damage trees and you can kill trees by putting that type of weight and damage to the tree roots. If nothing else it was more so really in protection of the trees than it was to the trees. I think that' s the benefit of I think it' s a great way to create new parking because again it' s an unmanaged area if there' s a desire to remove the parking you can always put logs or barriers or something to prevent that too. That was really the intent was just to it' s used in today' s environment is just try and make it more controlled and prevent that type of damage to the trees and shrubbery that might be damaged by vehicles uncontrolled. On your idea on the idea of option one or three, I think that' s option one or three. Any widening would really have to be we went with the minimum lane width and then the minimum width for like a designation as a class four or class one. Essentially you end up with option one or three without parking would maybe be the recommendation if that' s the desire. thank you so much for the clarification. again I just struggle with the rush to decision if we can' t just say okay I would throw out let' s make a motion for number four but with it wider and the no parking because to me again I want to emphasize you probably have I think we counted 30 spots if you just had a cheap chain link fence that would I would say that people aren' t parking there you guys so I went to explore for this reason to make sure that that parking would be available to people because I understand that concern. As far as the city wide thing I came to when they were discussing this type of thing and the broader park plan there and there were tons of public comment and people were a fan of the note like two was not good because they said we want to have a lot of people in the park and s a lot of people in the park and there' I was counting all the speakers and the like to try to get a feel because I knew this would come before us. I think we should consider that there' s a lot of assuming what the majority of chico wants but I would say maybe look back to see what some of those comments were and that might be helpful for folks but tonight I would say try for a blend I don' t know what' s possible is it possible to throw in the widening and say no you have to stick exactly to what is here? I don' t know what the widening does if you widen you should probably designate those areas again similar to options one and three if you' re going to widen anything. Because again it' s just a larger space for it to meander and use. But for the like people said with the green paint for hey bikes you' re over here I like the point that I think it' I think it was and made about Europe and how people there is there' s visual cues there' s things where they' re used to using space but there' s visual cues you can use to have people be where you' d like them to be. So anyway going for the greater good. I think it helps accommodate the concern we' ve heard about having the space to maneuver there. I guess when you say widen just a little bit what do you mean by a little bit? Like a couple feet. Two feet. Couple feet. Is that it looks like it' s a potential here and then you guys threw in extra parking and I' m saying without the parking just do the widening part like you have in some of the other ones. With widening two feet you' re not going to be able to have painted striped designated lanes again that' s concepts one and three where we widen it enough to provide the minimum safe width of bike lanes pedestrian lanes plus a travel So you would widen it to options one and three to provide those designated areas you can' t just say we' re going to widen it two feet and now you' ve only got a three foot wide green stripe. It' s either one or the other. It' s going to be a class three which is a shared type of situation versus a class one or class four where it' s a separated facility. Obviously on south park drive two when you come out of the one mile parking lot there' s that stretch from that area down to s the one location where you can go west bound. Everywhere else you' re not supposed to be doing that but it' s used in a free for all manner so that' s why options one and three are presented to make it more controlled designate the bidirection and reduce those conflict points. I get we don' t have necessarily existing issues out there it' s just a best practice to designate those based on design guidelines. just one more thing. I don' t think we can do that. I think we can make a recommendation and then arbitrarily say we need to widen this a little bit or by two feet. These recommendations were made by engineers and experts and just throw in an arbitrary capricious sort of number I think is not responsible. That' s why we have all this data in front of us that' s why we' ve heard from the experts for two years now and just changing it arbitrarily. I think it' s not responsible in my opinion. at this point does anybody have a motion? Mr. Chairman I would like to move that we recommend to the city council adoption of option one. I think as one of our colleagues has said and Mr. Washington said that provides the greatest benefit to the largest number of people in chico. It provides for the needed safety improvements have been studied for people that are not in vehicles regardless of the parking on the south side of south park. The only difference between one, three, four and five is not going to be improved. People are still going to park there and we won' t be protecting the trees. It seems the best thought out alternative is option one and my recommendation is that we recommend that to city council. My motion is that we recommend that to city council. I second. It' s been moved and seconded that we recommend to the city council option one. We need a vote. Any further discussion? We talked to the there. We have a motion and a second. Commissioner Nava? No. Commissioner Nichols? No. Commissioner Piva? No. Vice chair Blashley? Yes. I believe it failed. A tie vote fails. Anybody got a second? Another motion? I move that we recommend option three. I will second that. Okay. It' s been moved and seconded that we recommend option three to the city council. Can we have a vote please? Yes. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively I just want to validate one thing before I do. Yeah, I'm going to go with no. Commissioner Nichols? No. Commissioner Paiva? Yes. Commissioner Thomas Petty? Yes. Vice Chair Blashley? Yes. And Chair Willis? Yes. Motion passes 4-2. Okay. So we will move on to staff reports. If any. Richie indicated he wasn't going to be here tonight. Yes. No staff report from Mr. Bamlett this evening. I will keep mine fairly short. I'm going to start with Upper Park Road and the conversation about, and this was inspired by some of the delineation of bike lane and traffic that appears in Europe quite often. We removed the boulders from Upper Park Road that were at the speed bumps. And we replaced those with bike delineating bumpers there. So it's quite a bit more friendly for both vehicles and bicyclists and pedestrians. And quite a bit more aesthetically pleasing. We have, speaking of Upper Park, the California Conservation Corps is going to start tomorrow doing some elevations on Upper Park Road beyond the diversion dam. The vegetation there has encroached onto the road quite a bit. So we're fortunate to have the seas available to us at this time to get that work done. Also in Upper Park, tomorrow I'll be meeting with Chico Fire and walking a potential fire control line. We're going through environmental review for installing a bulldozer line between the residences. Canyon Oaks and Whispering Winds Lane and South Rim Trail as a maintainable fire break. Sycamore Pool. Our cleaning has been a little delayed. Good news, we have about 20 spring run salmon holding in Salmon Hole. California Department of Fish and Wildlife is saying that there's potentially more salmon. They're trying to work their way. And they would like us to hold off on our cleaning of the Sycamore Pool until about June 15th. We're monitoring that situation. We'll still look for having our lifeguards in place. But there may be a few rocks in a little bit. Send them in at the bottom of the pool for a couple more weeks before we can get in there and get that initial cleaning done. The goats that were in the Lindo Channel from Manzanita to 99. They've finished their spawning. Spring grazing. They'll be back again in the fall as part of the Lindo Channel Defensible Space Grant. In the meantime, we have to renew the grazing contract. So we'll be putting that out here shortly, early June. The contract currently expires in July. Finally, your master management plans are being printed as we speak. So as those become available, I will let you know. So you can come by the office. And pick up some very entertaining reading. A little bit of a study guide for some future discussions. And finally, I placed a flyer for the 120th Bidwell Bash celebration with your packets. There's a group of citizens and volunteers that decided that they wanted to celebrate the park's 120th birthday this year on June 7th. Leading up to that Saturday, there's quite a few events that are going to be offered. Some informative field trips. Some birding trips. Some folks that are going to be leading Iron Canyon trips to talk about the Cal Trout Project. There's the erosion line project that's happening by Powell's Volunteers in Upper Park that will be highlighted. And a variety of activities. So. Stay tuned for that. And be sure to check the City of Chico volunteer calendar because all of these different tours will be posted on there as well. And that concludes my report for this month. Mr. Chairman, questions? Thank you for reminding me. I did speak about that last meeting. Second in command. Or.

I' m not sure the timeline of removing those parking stalls at the end of that cul-de-sac or in that cul-de-sac if you will at the end of montecito but the barriers are put in and we looked at we made some lighting improvements too we have the wattage of the street light that was there to try to assist the neighborhood with those efforts. no timeline at the moment but I can report back to you at the next meeting. thank you.
