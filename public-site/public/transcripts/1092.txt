Recognition of Councilmember Brown's four years of outstanding leadership, significant contributions, and exemplary commitment to our community.  our community, serving on council December 2018 to December 22, serving as vice mayor December  2018 to December 2020. That you can hang on somewhere. Thank you.  Good stuff's for me. Alice Brown, Chico's youngest ever vice mayor, had quite a term.  As a city council member, she helped see Chico through two unprecedented crises,  the Camp Fire and COVID-19. A born collaborative  collaborator, she provided resources, knowledge, and support to some of those with the greatest need  in our city and beyond. Ms. Brown's service included time on the Internal Affairs Committee  as chair, the Butte County Continuum of Care, the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force, the Butte County  Air Quality Management District, and the Butte Choice Energy Authority Board. In those roles and  others, she accomplished in her four years more than some do in two or three terms.  Alex has been a hands-on leader and learner  and a leader in the community of Chico. She has been a leader in the community of Chico.  Her presence throughout the community in support of civic engagement with the goal of involving an  ever-increasing amount of community members, particularly young ones. A fierce supporter  of the things she believes in, Alex has never been afraid to use her expertise and passion to move  people, resources, and government. An advocate for the homeless, Alex proposed and supported  a variety of initiatives directed at shelter and housing solutions. She promoted and proposed  safe parking sites, managed campgrounds, and pilot shelters. And while it might not be  everything she hoped, Alex was deeply and passionately involved in Chico's pallet shelter  and the settlement agreement that led to it. Alex has been a passionate advocate for climate  and environmental justice, helping implement the Climate Action Commission, passing the Climate  Emergency Resolution, and educating the public about the community's role in addressing climate  change. Alex led a mostly bipartisan Cannabis Citizens Advisory Board, and despite my best  efforts, proposed and saw through the  policy of the City of Chico. Alex has always prioritized educating the public, asking thoughtful  questions of staff and colleagues, and leading respectful debate on issues affecting our entire  community. On a personal note, Alex and I agree on almost nothing, but that didn't keep her from  being a respectful vice mayor, colleague, and seatmate. A worthy and studied adversary and  political opponent. She has been a great advocate for the community, and has been a great advocate  for the community. For the most part, we didn't let our ideology come between us, and I will miss  serving with her. Although I expect she will go on to serve and make a difference in the City of Chico  without the burden of the sluggish hand of government to slow her down. Alex, thank you for  your service to the community we both love.  Mike Sherman, [inaudible]  Mike Sherman,  Mike Sherman,  Mike Sherman,  Mike Sherman,  Mike Sherman,  Mike Sherman, Councilmember O'Brien, will you join me out in front? Alex, actually, would you like to say some words? We'd love to... Oh, great. Please, please. Out here.  here or or up here if you like no you can address us at the podium if you have anything you'd like  oh i would like to say we'd love that i've spent the last four years talking i mean  i've spent the last four years talking so i'm going to keep this very very brief  thank you uh council member morgan for those uh parting thoughts it has been a delightful surprise  to become friends with you and to have such a collegial and respectful relationship with you  throughout this term and i really appreciate it and it's it demonstrates to me that you can move  beyond ideology and respect the people that you work with if you have a level of consistency  between you and i really appreciate it  so yeah i'll be very brief uh and that is to say that the best thing about sitting in that seat  and being in this role is the vantage point that you get um for your community and it's not just  to see um the things that are going wrong the things that you might need to fix it's to see  all the good being done in your community the community that you live in community that you  work in and there is so much good being done  you  the city of Chico. From the city staff who keep the engine running, which is no easy feat,  especially through some major crises, to the service providers and organizations that are  serving those with the least among us, that are prioritizing well-being and inclusivity,  making sure that everybody has what they need, doing so with very small budgets. To the business  owners who are leading innovation and sustaining our community, all the way down to the individuals  who are fighting the good fight and doing whatever good they can in their little area or their big  area in the city of Chico. It's pretty amazing to watch and it has actually been the privilege  of my life to get to see the amazing work being done in the city of Chico. I will never look  at Chico the same because of the privilege of being a Nazi.  And I have grown to love Chico even more because of that opportunity. I'm so, so grateful.  I just want to really quickly address one of our newer council members, Addison.  Congratulations. I'm so excited to watch you lead. You are about to be in a position that  I've been in for the past few years and as much as it is a growing and stretching experience,  and a resilience-building one, I don't envy it.  I'm so excited to see you in the city of Chico.  Thank you.  Fair enough.  But all that is to say, I think if anybody knows anything about you, it's that you're  smart. You have a very unique approach in understanding a municipal policy and I hope  that your council colleagues will create space and consideration for your ideas to make Chico  a better place because I guarantee, given the opportunity, you absolutely will do that.  Good luck to all my fellow council members, to the new council members, and to the new  council members. And this chapter has been the honor of my life so far.  Thank you.  To serve alongside you, to grow alongside you, and to be a part of this little slice  of history. Thank you.  Councilman O'Brien, you want to come join me down here?  I think we've all gotten used to you being in this chamber. You've probably gotten used  to it a little bit yourself.  A little bit, yes.  So we'll start the same way Sean did here. So City of Chico Achievement Award, again,  certainly more than an achievement, but Michael O'Brien, City Councilmember, in recognition  of Councilmember O'Brien's one and a half years about standing leadership, significant  contributions, and exemplary commitment to our community. Thank you so much.  So Michael O'Brien came to serve the City of Chico as a Councilmember during an unprecedented  time, like if we had to tell anybody that, when the Council was surprisingly faced with  two vacancies literally at the same time, despite having just retired after being Chief  of Police, and for some crazy reason wanted to come back. I'm going to add a little bit  of a little here.  After 28 years of service to the Chico Police Department, Mike stepped up and graciously  volunteered to help the City when the strong leadership was critically needed to complete  the work necessary to restore our community. Knowing already the serious and dynamic issues  facing the City at the time, Mike continued his commitment to the City of Chico as an elected  official, bringing with him a vast knowledge and experience in public safety, homelessness,  strategy, and laws.  Councilmember O'Brien's leadership proved pivotal in open and closed session regarding  the settlement agreement, new City management, operations, and staff bargaining agreements.  And that's really just scratching the surface on how much you helped, both in the backroom  and out here.  Councilmember O'Brien served on the Internal Affairs Committee, as the Chamber of Commerce  liaison, and as the Butte County Hall's Continuum of Care representative. The impact Mike O'Brien  had on the City of Chico through the three years of service to the City of Chico, and  the three decades of service is immeasurable. Let me just say that again, three decades  of service to your community. As a Councilmember, he was a constant voice of reason, logic,  and integrity, and I hope he will definitely continue to be. When we need it, you can reach  out to us. I think we'd certainly appreciate that. His legacy on this Council and in this  City will last indefinitely.  Mike, I can't tell you how appreciative I am of you stepping forward with this. I'm  so grateful to have gotten you where you are when we needed you. And I think that's kind  of the hallmark of your life, is stepping forward when people need you, both because  of your chosen profession, but also because you came here and did this as well. Your City  needed you, we turned to you, we asked for your help, and you came to the call. And I  think that just shows exactly what kind of person you are, and I'm so grateful to have  gotten you where you are these years. Thank you so much.  Thank you, Mayor, for those kind of marks. And really, this is a culmination of 30 years  of a love affair with this City that came here. With my young family, in 1992 we started  working on this. We started working on this. We started working on this. We started working  for the Chico Police Department. And yes, those pictures of me on a downtown bicycle  with very tight bike shorts, yes, those are actual, undaunted photos, but it was a different  time, I remember. But really, this is a night of gratitude for me, and I'm going to thank  people. I really did get a chance to thank people as thoroughly as I wanted when I left  as Chief. If you remember, there were a few things going on. I remember the first thing  I said was I wanted to thank you for your efforts back in June of 2020. So I'm going  to take just a moment just to thank some people. And I'm going to start with the directors  that I worked closely with during my time at the police department and then as counsel.  I want each of you to know that our City would not operate as smoothly as it does with all  your hard work and your staff's hard work. And I appreciate each of you. I worked with  many of you for several years. And I hope you continue to work with me and continue  And that association makes me very proud.  I want you to know that I'm grateful for the service that each of you provided,  not only in this community, but the friendship to me as well.  So thank you.  And to Chief Aldridge, the interim chief of my favorite police department,  I hope that interim tag will leave you soon.  I would like nothing more than to see you become our next chief of police.  You've earned it.  And to all the staff at the Chico Police Department,  you know how much I love and respect you.  And our fire department, a group that we kind of have a sibling rivalry, don't we?  But I want you to know that everyone in the police department has great respect  and love for you guys.  Thank you for what you do for this community.  To my fellow council members, it's been great.  With this short period of time to get to know you, to work with you, to collaborate,  it's not like nothing.  We had the easiest plate, so to speak, as to things that we needed to get done for this community.  But we hung in there, all of us, and got things done and put the city back on the right trajectory.  And that was not easy.  It was not simple.  It never is.  But I'm proud of what we accomplished, and I thank each one of you for your friendship  and what you provided to me.  I mean that for everyone of you, including you, Alex.  Thank you.  And you, Sean Morgan, I owe you a special gratitude.  As chief, you were my vice mayor and then my mayor.  You have made a huge difference in my life, and I'm grateful for you and everything you did for my family, for me.  And I'll never forget that.  And I owe you a debt that I can never repay.  Thank you.  To the side over to the right here.  Vince, you were my city attorney when I was chief.  And as a council member.  Mark, you were my mayor and now my city manager, our city manager.  And Debbie, you were my city clerk and our city clerk moving forward.  And each of you, I have great, great respect and admiration for each of you.  I want you to know that.  And you made my job in both those capacities very, very easy.  So thank you.  To our business community, I had so much support over the years.  The DCBA, the Chico Chamber of Commerce.  Wow.  They really, really brought safety to the forefront.  And I could not have done what I did as chief without that.  Our education community, Chico State, U College, Chico Unified.  What great people.  We have in our school systems, right?  Really fantastic people.  And we have partnered in many ways trying to keep our kids and our communities safer.  Our faith community.  Wow.  You guys have supported me through some very difficult times.  We have one representative back here who's a dear friend.  Chaplain Buddy is my lead chaplain for years. For years, I think of you. I think of Peter. I think of Sam. I think of Will. I think of Tom. All those individuals, and I've certainly neglected to name everyone, but they have made a huge difference in my life and the life of my family.  And I've certainly neglected to name everyone.  But they have made a huge difference in my life and the life of my family.  And I can't, again, repay that debt out of it.  And all the friends that are here.  Or not here.  I think of Jim and Donna.  I think of my wife.  I think of many people that have supported us over the years.  In ways that you'll never know.  But we know very, very intimately.  A dear friend back there.  By the name of Joe Pratt.  Walked through some very, very difficult times.  A more faithful friend.  A man could not have had.  Thank you, Joe.  Thank you, Joe.  And last, surely but not least.  My family.  I've said many times.  I do a lot of public speaking.  A little bit around the country.  Talk about leadership issues with policing.  And when I talk to a group.  Whether they're police chiefs, sheriffs, whatever.  I always talk about the significance of your spouse.  See, the spouse serves right alongside the leader.  We get all the attention.  We get the accolades.  Sometimes criticism.  But I will tell you.  The spouse, the partner.  In many ways.  Has a more difficult job than we do.  As leaders.  And I have the best.  And that's Kirsten.  My wife.  I'm 32 years.  And she has seen me through a few.  Very.  Difficult times.  I could not again ask for a better wife.  Better partner.  Better spouse.  And the same goes for my children as well.  So I said when I became chief.  That I was humbled, honored, and blessed to serve.  If you remember that seven years ago.  I was humbled.  And I'm humbled today to have served with so many wonderful people that I named today.  To include those in the county.  That I worked with.  Sheriff Honey.  DA Ramsey.  And all of you that I named earlier.  Blessed to have gone through some very difficult times in those 30 years.  They were not easy.  But I will not trade any of them for what they gave me.  And then blessed.  Blessed to serve a community that is so passionate.  So passionate.  That sometimes we disagree.  That's okay.  As long as we do that respectfully.  Let's maintain that passion.  But I am blessed to serve this community for 30 years.  Three decades.  Some of you in this room may not have been around for 30 years.  How old are you, Avison?  27.  27.  There we go.  But I am so grateful.  To have had that opportunity for 30 years.  To serve you.  To serve this community.  Both as police chief.  As a police officer.  And finally as a council member.  I am just truly, truly grateful tonight.  And please extend and accept my appreciation.  And may God bless each and every one of you.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  All right.  At this point, I will turn over the meeting to City Clerk Debbie Pressel.  Thank you, Mayor, Collegiate Council.  What we would like to do is I will call each incoming new council member up to the podium,  and I'm going to do it alphabetically.

Go ahead and let Council Member Winslow join us.  So Mayor Coolidge, are you ready for the selection of the Mayor and Vice Mayor?  So I will explain to the selection process real quick to the Council so you understand.  We have the positions of Mayor and Vice Mayor and they serve for two years  and with the majority vote of four or more votes in order for the Council confirmation to occur.  Motions and seconds are not necessary. You do not have to make a motion to nominate someone. You  just, once I open up or officially open up the nomination process, Council Members,  may begin to nominate individuals for the position being considered and I'm going to do the Mayor first.  If there are no additional nominations coming in, I will then officially close the nomination  period and then the nominations are then voted on in the order received.  With, I believe we'll do roll call votes and I'm going to do them alphabetically,  not with, normally for roll call votes we do the Mayor and the Vice Mayor last,  but we're going to just do alphabetically.  For the whole group.  And then do you have any questions regarding the process or so nominations do not require the motion  or a second and I'm just going to, I'm officially opening up the nominations for the position of  Mayor to serve for the next two years. I would like to nominate Vice Mayor for that. Pardon me?  I would like to nominate Vice Mayor Reynolds for the position of Mayor. Okay. I will nominate the  current Mayor Andrew Coolidge.  To continue his service for two more years.  Okay. Are there any other nominations?  Seeing none, I will close nominations and I will do a roll call vote. Council Member Bennett?

And we'll move on to business from the floor. Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes based on the number of speakers. The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers?  Three.  Okay.  We have seven speakers.  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  Laura and Jerry Douglas.  And then if James Hutchinson can go ahead and line up in the back area.  And I didn't know if you wanted individual, but you put one card in.  So is that okay?  Yes.  We're married.  Well, I didn't know.  You only have three minutes.  I didn't want to.  If you want more time.  All right.  So Laura and Jerry, go ahead.  So Jerry and I are the property owners at 1370.  We have a triplex there.  And the City of Chico just built a bridge, the big capital project right next to it.  There was a lot of issues that came up during it.  I know you guys are all new.  Mayors keep changing.  Council members keep changing.  City managers keep changing.  It's been confusing.  But with that, there was just a lot of problems.  We kind of came to an agreement that a fence needed to be put up.  And we started building the fence.  And we've tried to reach out to, we've sent emails to the entire council, to the mayor,  to Mark Sorensen.  And we have been getting no response.  Leanne Sutton was in charge of the project.  So we haven't gotten returned phone calls.  We haven't gotten returned emails.  I've gone to the third floor of the City Hall where the virtual assistant is.  It's not there anymore.  And now we're here.  So we're here.  We want to find out, do you need more information from us?  Or do you need more time?  Just to give you an update on what we've done so far, Mark, is we have started building  this fence.  And we've had them sink the poles and that kind of thing with the faith that the council  would come through and pay their share of the fence.  And our repeated talking to Mark, Leanne, whoever, their staff has been saying, if they  want to call you, if they want to call you, they can call you.  If they want to talk to you, they will be in touch.  Yes, sir.  So if you could not address individual members of the...  Oh, I'm sorry.  So basically, you'll be able to address the council, but we probably will not be able  to provide you an answer necessarily.  Staff will have to reach out to you.  I agree.  Yeah.  I see that.  But we just want to put that out there.  It's just how the meetings run.  So...  But please feel free to finish.  We just want...  We just want some communication.  It's...  You know, we...  We just want to...  We...  A week ago, the fence people came out and the city of Chico sent their people out and  we all agreed.  The alliance...  We put the post exactly where the city had agreed to have the fence.  They sent us a 41-page document for this.  But then we have gotten no response since.  And we just want to know, do they need more time?  Do they need more information?  Just some kind of communication back to us.  And this is like our last resort because we are getting zero communication.  Thank you.  Yeah, like I said, we won't be able to provide you any answer.  I can tell you that I did receive your email and I forwarded it to Leanne and Leanne said  that she has been in touch with you.  So I did do that much so hopefully she can pick up the ball and run with it from here.  Thank you for coming.  That'd be terrific.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  James Hutchinson followed by Charles Huithun.  And if you could go ahead and give us a little bit of a brief description of what you're  doing here this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon,  this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon,  this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon, this afternoon, First time I came in front of this council it was because of lack of communication I held up blank sheets of paper to show the email response. I got two emails I sent to each member of the council about an appointment situation Hearing this again sums up what's been happening. No communication at least no timely communication  and sums up what's been happening.  No communication, at least no timely communication.  But I'm not here to talk about that.  On July 27th, a body was found on Humboldt Road.  It was described as a body, no cause of death.  The police department rightfully said,  hey, look, until we contact the next of kin,  there's nothing more we can say.  And that body sat out there waiting.  The mother showed up in town.  The man's name was Shane Lennon.  He died on 2100 Humboldt Road,  a familiar place just above Dead Horse Slough,  where there was a camp.  There's no name, no talking about him.  The news just mentioned there was a body.  There's no follow-up story.  If you go to Facebook today and look up the name Shane Lennon  on Facebook, it's in Pennsylvania,  you'll find a young man  that wanted to be a musician.  He was producing his own record when COVID hit.  And suddenly the production chances  of getting out there and promoting his music was gone.  For some reason, he left that Pennsylvania.  He came out to Chico.  There's no communication, no talk with him.  He had two warrants out for him.  Both of them were drug paraphernalia,  not particularly for drugs,  but likely in real life.  He had been involved.  His mother came out here  and desperately tried to find out what happened.  Why did he die?  What happened?  She said, you know, you don't wake up Sunday one morning  and say, I want to do drugs and be homeless.  This wasn't that kind of guy.  He left two brothers behind and a loving mother.  The mother put a notice out on Facebook.  People around this area,  because I happen to live over in the area  not far from where his body was found,  came to me and said,  hey, you talked to the city council.  Can you send this on to him?  I said, who do you want me to give it to?  To a person, four different people,  two of them very low income,  two of them very high income,  said Alex Brown,  because she will listen.  She will respond.  You know, it's what you're doing here.  It's not just going to be people from Chico.  It's going to be people from all over.  Yeah, people wander.  People go places.  They look for opportunity.  And that's what you're here for.  I have no doubt that Mr. Winslow  has a concern about that.  He's expressed it.  I have doubts that the argument  of misplaced compassion  has any meaning.  That's fine.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Charles Withoon, followed by Joya Kenner.  Thank you for this opportunity.  Congratulations, new council.  This is terrific.  I think it's wonderful.  You're all able to serve Chico so capably.  Thank you for this opportunity.  I'm speaking to you also as a featured hero.  I got a new title in the My Hero Project  International Film Festival 2022.  Check it out.  You can see the film on YouTube.  Very amazing.  About our little project here in Chico  is now on the international stage.  How about that?  Today, the city of Chico,  the website says we have 68 openings  of the pallet shelters and the tourist shelter.  North State Shelter Team  tracks 8 to 11 homeless encampments in Chico  where we have counted 175 to 187 homeless people.  And so I'm asked the other day,  do we really want to do more for the homeless in Chico?  Only if you want to save money.  Sheltered people are 70% less likely  to get involved in emergencies,  services than unsheltered people.  One use of the Chico Fire Department,  the Enloe Emergency Room,  or the police that we pay for,  would pay for a month  of the cost of a managed campground  that the participants pay for.  This is a huge cost savings.  And only if you believe in  liberty and justice for all.  Really?  The first justice is a right to life.  The first survival requirement is to be able to survive.  If you can't find shelter on a winter's night,  get wet, below 40 degrees, three hours,  you can be looking at fatal hypothermia.  And let's not forget our superior jurisdictions,  state statute 86981.1 B.  And I quote,  the provisions of any state or local regulatory statute,  regulation or ordinance prescribing standards  of housing, health or safety shall be suspended  to the extent that you can get a life sentence  that strict compliance would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay the mitigation of the effects  of the shelter crisis, unquote.  We'll have our legal team contributing to our fourth revision of our managed campground  proposal that you should have in your hands before too long.  The most efficient deployment of shelter is a low-barrier campground with all the amenities.  Chico has over 700 acres for intermittent cattle grazing, a temporary conditional administrative  use permit for five acres for survival to be a stepping stone for our poorest neighbors,  I suggest, is a better situation than stepping over dead bodies on the streets of Chico like  we did last winter.  The North State Shelter Team managed campground proposal has the support and backing in writing  of Chico Housing Action Team, the True North Housing Alliance, Faith Lutheran Church, and  Safe Space Wintershade.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So, Julia Kenner, followed by an individual who lives on Hilda Way but didn't put a name in.  Hello, Council.  My name is Julia Kenner, and I am here to speak for Upper Park, Bidwell Park.  It is, as you can tell since I've been here several times, this is a passion of mine.  I have been up there several times this week.  The destruction is mind-blowing, really.  But my point is I still want you to request the Parks Department to keep the road permanently  closed at Diversion Dam for motorized vehicles.  Anyone is allowed to go up to the park and go in past Diversion Dam, but you have to  do it in a non-motorized vehicle unless you are an emergency staff.  So, we are lovingly...  I am sure you all shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this  shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared  this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared  this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared  this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared  this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared  this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared  this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this shared this  in the city, if it's garbage, if it's people, destruction, if you open that road, it is  going to be to the very end of the park.  It's the only park we have.  So please take care of it.  Thanks.  Okay, and then the individual who lives on Hilda Way?  There's no, you didn't indicate a name on the tag.  The card?  Where's the mic?  Is it just the mic?  Yes.  Okay, go ahead.  My name is Anna.  Good afternoon, everyone.  And my partner, Alison Winslow, I want to say congratulations and welcome to be a member  of the City Council of Chico.  Thank you.  On behalf of...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Dexter O'Connell, followed by...  Thank you.  ...Patrick Newman.  Hello, members of council and city staff.  My name is Dexter O'Connell, and I am a former City of Chico city planner.  And this is the first time that I've been able to be back up to Chico on a council night  since I had to leave the city service.  And I wanted to come and speak to two things, and the first is to appreciate the compassion  shown to me by planning for the city.  And I wanted to thank the planning director, Vig, and the other members of the planning  staff when I had to leave the city during the pandemic to attend to family issues.  They were the exact kind of person that you want in a coworker, in a colleague, in a friend.  And their support is still deeply appreciated.  I am honored by the way that they treated me.  And...  It's a credit to the city service, planning director, Vig, and the other members of planning staff.  And so I want to commend them in front of the council on this, the first opportunity I have to return to the city on a council day  since I had to leave the city service in December of 2020.  So thank you, Brendan, and the whole team, particularly Bruce and Molly.  And I also want to congratulate Council Member Winslow and wish him the best on the opportunity to come back to the city.  And I also want to congratulate Council Member Winslow and wish him the best on the opportunity to come back to the city.  I think you'll make the most of it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Patrick Newman.  So what I've tried to do for over the years is pay attention to human rights issues as they affect people who are unsheltered,  unsheltered homeless, meaning the people out there with the carts and all that.  And there's a whole list of those human rights issues that tend to be ignored.  So just a quick...  history.  I was escorted out of here in the summer of 2017.  Some of you will remember that.  I stood right here and refused to leave because we had no 24-hour toilet access anywhere in Chico.  So that means people living on the streets are denied a fundamental human right.  I was handcuffed by Chief Madden, and I was taken out in the summer of 2018, and that was about sit-lie.  But I later had a conversation with Chief Madden, and we sat in his office for an hour.  And that was...  at about the time of the sweeps that began to happen in winter of 2021.  The conversation was about civil disobedience.  And one of the things...  one of the themes that came through in that conversation was that,  yeah, you can make a statement that way, and I believe in making statements that way,  and there's a whole history of making statements that way,  but from his point of view, better to work through the system,  and we as police follow the law.  Okay, so here we are.  Today, there was a lawsuit.  There was a settlement.  It was your signatories to it, the Warren v. Chico settlement.  Section 12, public sanitary facilities.  It's one paragraph.  I'll probably run out of time if I read it, so I'm not going to do that.  It basically says the city cannot close toilets  and cannot deny people access to drinking water without providing a replacement in a timely manner.  Look it up.  It's on page 20 of the agreement.  Okay.  Once again, after years of fighting for toilets in this town and toilet access for people on the streets,  the fourth time in a year and a half, the plaza was fenced and closed.  You've got an ice rink over there.  So now for one month, the clock's been running, and I've been watching every single day,  you've closed down the restrooms, and you've shut people's access to drinking water off.  So...  So...  So...  You're in violation of Warren v. Chico,  and I've done all kinds of other steps, including writing to the judge about this.  Now I'm here because it's council night.  For the record, to say that you're in violation and that that matters to me.  I think it matters to me, and I think it's kind of emotional,  because I meet with these people once a week,  and I know their names, and I know their stories,  and I know how little they have.  I am responsible for this entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire  to do with that? We can go ahead.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor and Council  members. I live along  the Lindo Channel, and I  walk or bike along it almost  every day, and in doing so, I have a  pretty intimate acquaintance with what's  going on in the channel.  Since the large  camping area along  Humboldt Road, the Windchime Park, was  closed down, there's been an  explosion of the  number of people camping in the  channel.  I think the city,  I would hope that the city can come to  recognize that  there are, first off,  as Mr. Rathune pointed out,  there are a good deal more people living  outdoors in the city than we have  shelter space for.  Some of them, for a whole  variety of real reasons, are  never going to be able  to avail themselves of the  shelter spaces that do exist.  Chasing people from  place to place merely disperses  the problem. It doesn't solve it.  And I really want to appeal  to the city to give real serious  consideration to this idea that the  North State Shelter Team offers of  a managed campground  that really isn't going to cost  the city anything. The only contribution  that the city needs to make is to get out of  the way and allow it to happen.  Thank you.  Okay, that was it.  Thank you very much.  Alright, move on to item 7.1  of the Regular General Approval  of Letter Agreement with the  Chico Police Officers Association,  CPOA, and I believe we have  Chelsea, Director  of Human Resources and Risk Management.  Welcome.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor,  and members of the Council. Before you  tonight, for approval is a letter agreement  between the city and  CPOA as a result of the meet and confer  process. The letter agreement,  uh, renews a previously approved  referral bonus of $1,500  for employees to  successfully refer individuals for  employment at the city.  It also increases the signing  bonus for lateral candidates from  $10,000 to $40,000.  The city manager  recommends adoption of the  letter agreement. And I'm  happy to answer any questions you might have.  Alright, any questions?  Go ahead,  Council Member Winslow.  Um,  just for clarity for everybody, can you explain what a  lateral police officer is? Absolutely.  A lateral transfer is somebody  that comes from another policing agency  that already has experience. So it's somebody  that is not a fresh recruit.  Um, we would be obtaining an experienced  police officer as part of this  program. Right. Um,  where do most  laterals that are hired by the Chico Police  Department come from?  That's a great question that I don't have an answer  to. Um, Chief, do you happen  to know?  I'd love to know where to find them right now.  Um, actually, we haven't  had a lateral in a couple years.  Um, you know, typically  we would see them come from  surrounding agencies. We have seen  them come from, um, you know,  the Bay Area, um,  you know, the western, southwestern  area of  California.  Um, but like I said, it's been  a couple years, and we're struggling  to get those laterals.  So I see that there's an  assigning bonus of $40,000  is what's being offered for new  lateral police hires. It says that it's  offered in, um,  installments. The first installment is $16,000,  and the second  is $12,000, and then when  they complete their probationary period,  they receive the third installment.  Um, so if  somebody were to be hired by  the Chico Police Department and not  finish their probationary period, they could still  be leaving with a $20,000.  $28,000 bonus.  Yes. And someone else could  have collected a $1,500  $1,500, um, bonus  for recommending them.  It's  possible, yes. Okay.  Um, that's, um,  I think that's very generous.  All right. Further questions? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.  All right.  Have any speakers on this? No.  All right. Entertain a motion.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Morgan, second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Bennett? Yes.  Council Member Morgan? Yes.  Council Member Tandon? Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes. Council Member Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right. Moving on to item  7.61.  6-1.  Oh, did you?  I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.  I apologize. Well, I'll fix that in the...  All right.  So, item 7.2,  approval of letter agreement  with Chico Public Safety  Association, CPSA.  Once again, Chelsea.  So, also before you tonight,  we have a letter agreement  for approval between the city and  CPSA, again, as a result  of the meet and confer process.  This letter agreement  provides another lateral,  signing bonus of $20,000  for all newly hired public safety dispatchers.  It also provides current employees  with a referral bonus of $1,500  for every successful candidate referred.  Also included with the letter agreement  is the freezing of two positions  to fund an increase of 15%  for all dispatch positions,  and it increases the uniform allowance  from $550 to $900.  The city manager recognized that the !  I just want to say that I'm really interested  in looking into and addressing the reasons  why we're having vacancies for these positions,  given that they pay better than a lot of positions  in the city.  I just don't know that putting more money into it  is the best solution.  I wasn't there for the negotiations of this,  but just a little bit back there.  Thanks.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Entertain a motion?  Move to approve.  Second. Motion.  Seconded by Council Member Tandon,  and seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  .  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Aye.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Item 8, reports and communications.  Following reports and communication items  are provided for Council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section  on the agenda unless Council agrees to include it  on a subsequent agenda.  Item 8.1, City Manager's Report.  No report, sir.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Item 8.2, Council Member Requests.  I believe we received a few of these through,  more than a few, through email.  So if anyone has one, feel free to.  Item 2, so the Council received an email from the  Board and I'm only going to send it to you because I want to be sensitive to the burden  on the staff.  Okay.  And if I may, just so we can explain for the folks new, generally at this point, the  public doesn't comment on it.  We're bringing up an item to be agendized, so not to be discussed now.  So it's, hey, I want to talk about this.  And then you can either make the motion yourself, you'll need a second, and a fourth item, and  then we'll have a full vote of the Council to approve it, and then it moves forward.  If you don't.  Mr. Mayor, we do each one individually, correct?  So the first thing I would like to discuss is the  Yeah, and make sure your mic's on green.  Did you want me to repeat that?  Please.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  The first thing I would like to discuss, I'd like to have on the agenda, is the establishment  of pedestrian zones downtown.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Make that a motion, if you want, as well, and then you'd need a second to move forward.  Okay, I'd like to make a motion.  All right.  Second.  We have a motion and a second.  Okay.  When you're ready.  All right.  And that was to agendize pedestrian zones in the downtown.  Correct.  Council Member Bennett?  No.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Do you want to go back and forth, or do you guys want to do one at a time?  I've got one more.  All right.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I have one more, and that is in 2009, the city of Wichita, the city of Wichita  in 2007, the city started to convert some major streets to diagonal parking, and it  was stopped, and we had the financial meltdown.  And I would like to reopen the conversation about diagonal parking downtown in Maine,  Salem, I'm sorry, in Maine, Salem, and Broadway.  All right.  Second.  I'll second.  Did you say again?  Yep.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike  Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike  Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike  Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike  Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yeah. Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Carries 6-1. All right. Ms. Winslow? Yeah, I sent an email with a few. Given that  these are just topics to be discussed at a later date, I hope it wouldn't burden  staff at all. You wouldn't feel obligated. I did promise in the email to do my  homework before and if any of these reach a meeting agenda in the future, but  I'll go through to start with the first one is on community input and major  streetcape projects. So we have a list on the city website of upcoming road  projects. These are repavings. It represents an opportunity with that  street to redesign the street for different priorities. A lot of these  roads we have, especially in the outer parts of Chico, were designed under  county standards before we had our circulation element in our general plan,  which has goals for enhancing mobility for bicyclists, but  public transit, public transit, public transit, public transit, public transit,  public transit, public transit, public transit, public transit, public transit,  public transit, public transit, public transit, public transit, public transit,  people who use the roads have the opportunity to express their desires  with regards to priorities in street design like safety, cost, traffic speed,  and traffic capacity. I have the motion written out simply, it's just the  italicized. I'd like to motion to agenda this discussion on community input and  major streetscape projects. All right. Do we have a second? All right. Motion fails for lack of a second.  Before we move forward on going through these, Mr. Winslow, can I just make a quick point of  clarification? Just because you're new and I'm not trying to, please don't take this the wrong way,  but if we go through an agenda and vote on all of these right now, you are aware that if they all  get voted down, no, they can't be brought back up for a year. So I'm just concerned that like we all  got this this afternoon at three o'clock and haven't really had time to digest it. And some of  this could be really good stuff that we need to do, but I don't know that we're all ready to tackle  that yet. So just  a recommendation that you may not want to throw everything out there in the very first meeting.  It's just a recommendation. If you feel like before considering seconding a motion to have the  discussions here, you'd like to discuss them outside or have an opportunity to look into it,  I would be happy to postpone the rest of the other five things. If not, I would prefer to just go  for it. I feel like these are sort of election promises.  These are the things that I said I would focus on. I selected things that I hoped I would find some  agreement on the council with. And so I'd shoot my shot and maybe try again in a year, or I would  happily put it off to the next meeting. If you feel like that may, without promising anything,  if you would discuss them sooner. It's totally up to you. It's your item. I was just bringing it up  as a suggestion, because I think that's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great  idea. I think there's some things in here that some of us could probably agree that are good to  talk about, but I don't know that. She'd have to limit her promise in some ways.  I'm not promising anything. I'm just saying that. So, Mr. Mayor, if I may, just a point of  clarification for the audience and my own indulgence. I think part of the challenge is  normally the way this happens is a council member brings up an item they'd like to have agendized,  and they bring it up to the dais, and we have no idea what's coming. And then if we  agree to do that, we can do it. And then if we agree to do that, we can do it. And then if we  talk about it, then we talk about it. So what happened in both instances this time is we got  the information ahead of time, had time to think about it. And so now these motions are coming  forward almost as agenda items. And that's because people are new. That's something we got to fix to  keep that from happening. And I think that Vice Mayor Reynolds' point is excellent. But  you also have an obligation to do what you were elected to do. So the mayor's okay to carry on?  I think that's a good answer.  As you see fit. Councilman?  I'll continue. The second thing I'd asked is a discussion on expanding eviction protections  and strategies to reduce barriers to accessing rental housing in Chico. Since the Camp Fire,  barriers have expanded, and all renters in Chico are very aware that it's become extraordinarily  difficult to access a rental, especially if you're low income, especially if you don't have a  cosigner, if you don't have a rental. And I think that's a good answer. And I think that's a good answer.  I think that this is important to consider, this is important to consider, this is important to consider,  this is important to consider, this is important to consider, this is important to consider,  this is important to consider, this is important to consider, this is important to consider,  this is important to consider, this is important to consider, this is important to consider,  discrimination against Section 8 voucher holders.  They are prohibited by state law.  We simply just don't have the enforcement  locally to  prevent that.  So I'd like to  motion to agendize a discussion on  expanding eviction protections and strategies  to reduce barriers to accessing rental housing  in Chico.  All right. Do we have a second?  Okay. Motion dies for  like a second.  I'll continue.  The majority of residential  land in the city is owned low density.  It is...  And just when we do these, if you could just  mention what you actually  want agendized. Like I'd like a discussion on  ABC.  So you're not supposed to give  background or history or anything like that. That's  for when it actually gets agendized. Then you  get that. You bring it to council.  Right. I was trying to keep it to a paragraph  you can see.  Some of the paragraphs are a lot  easier than others. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to  motion to agendize a discussion on amendments to the  zoning code to allow small multi-family projects  more broadly in Chico.  All right. Motion. Do we have a second?  That is for like a second.  Go ahead.  Due to some state law changes,  transportation impacts  are analyzed a particular  way. The city has taken a  route of  looking at the county as a metric for  vehicle miles traveled, the way we measure  transportation impacts. We no longer in  California Environmental Quality Act look at level of  service. There's an issue there that we end up with  the worst of both worlds, getting developments that  are worse off in terms of vehicle miles traveled  than the rest of the city. And we also do not  mitigate level of service issues. So we end up with  traffic congestion that goes unanalyzed in the  environmental impact review process. So I'd like to  motion to discuss.  Transportation impact assessment standards for the city.  All right.  Have a second.  Okay. Motion dies for lack of a second.  During the recession, we had a lot of city departments that  were scrapped and the city's financial situation has turned  around a little bit. One of these was the Housing and  Neighborhood Services Department. It was consolidated under  community development, but some aspects of that,  neighborhood services, neighborhood planning in  particular, have not, don't really exist much in the  city. And I would like to motion to discuss the work of  the late Housing and Neighborhood Services  Department to consider if any efforts ought to be  revived in some form.  All right. Have a second. Motion dies for lack of a second.  This is the one I was most hopeful on. This is also the  one that had the opportunity to talk with the city's  staff about. So Mr. Aldrich and I had a conversation with Ed  Nelson, the city's crime prevention officer.  Interim chief.  Interim chief. Okay. Thank you. We, a lot of us, I think,  especially Vice Mayor Reynolds, are aware of issues with safety  on the bike path. And in our general plan, our safety  element, we do have policies that say we should take a  collaborative approach with community design elements and  policing in order to promote them. So I'm going to turn it  over to Mike дальше to introduce our next public  sponsor, Mike дальше.  Mike дальше, Mike дальше, Mike дальше, Mike дальше, Mike  дальше, Mike дальше, Mike дальше, Mike  дальше, Mike !  Mike дальше, Mike !  Can you repeat the motion?  To agenda a discussion of improving safety and comfort on bike paths through crime prevention through environmental design strategies.  All right.  SEPTED.  That's how you say the acronym.  Okay.  All right.  Council Member Bennett?  No.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  No.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.
