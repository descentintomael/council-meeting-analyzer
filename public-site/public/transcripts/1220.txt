 Okay, it's six o'clock folks. Let's come to order. Madam Clerk, could you do the roll or somebody do the roll call? I will do the roll call. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Commissioner Nava. Commissioner Nichols. Here. Commissioner Paiva. Here. Commissioner Shearer. Here. Commissioner Thomas Petty. Absent. Vice Chair Blashley. Here. And Chair Willis. Here. Thank you. Okay, before we get started, I have an announcement. Anyone wishing to address the commission on any matters listed on the agenda should first complete a speaker card found at the back of the chamber. E podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem the chair will be called to order by the chair. If such conduct continues the chair may call a recess requesting the removal of such persons from the council chambers adjourn the meeting or take other such appropriate action. People must have already noticed it because there' s no stampede at the item two consent agenda. first the approval of the meetings from the minutes from our last meeting. the entire consent agenda could be approved with just one vote. thank you Mr. Chair. item 2.2 is a permit to hold a shakespeare performance in cedar grove meadow from may 24, 2025 to June 15, 2025. Mr. Chair would you like to remove that I have a question? okay. then we will entertain a motion to approve the minutes. so moved. second. okay. roll call please. we will have a hearing on commissioner shayer. yes. vice chair blashley. yes. and commissioner willis. yes. thank you. motion passes 6-0. we will have a hearing on the request for a permit to hold a shakespeare performance in cedar grove. you wish to address this commissioner nickman? yes. somewhere in the staff report it looks like we' re approving this forever. it never has to come back again. I didn' t quite understand what that meant. what the request is that this event doesn' t have to come back to the commission year after year that the commission finds that the park manager can just approve it as it' s submitted each year. this is a long-standing event. there isn' t anything unusual about it from year to year. and if it continues to go as smoothly as it was it just doesn' t seem to be something that needs to come to the commission every year. however because it' s a multi-day lengthy event our 12r code requires that it comes to commission four times but if you say park manager can approve it then year after year whoever is the park manager myself currently can approve it without going back to the commission. how many years of this event occurred? as it currently stands this is their fifth year. they' re on high ease for a while and before that it' s been. mr. chair you know. but my children were in it when it was run by court theater in 1998 and it had been going on for a number of years successfully then. so without ever any problems. so 35 years basically but i know of. really? okay. yes commissioner pott. thank you. thank you. i had the same question. that will approve this indefinitely it looks like or for the next five years. i have concerns about that just actually for one of the reasons that you just said that i imagine that who will operate this and who will sponsor this will change over time. it won' t always be the same person or group who operates it. how do we ensure that the commission is able to come back i think this year the people might they will do very well i know that right but in the next couple of years if operations change if attendance grows and we have a different manager for the project or funding doesn' t come through any of those things what kind of review would this commission have to be able to come back around and review the application? that could be in a condition of your approval is that if the event changes by management or significantly then it needs to come back to commission. But if it doesn' t and it stays status quo then we could just approve it at the staff level. any other commissioners have any questions about this? is there anyone in the audience that wishes to speak to this issue? Mr. Chairman I will make a motion that we approve the staff recommendation with the condition if management or scope of the change it has to come back to commission for action. do we have a second? I will second that. thank you. moved and seconded. we can have a vote. commissioner narva. thank you. we have a motion to approve the thank you. commissioner nichols. aye. commissioner pieva. aye. commissioner scherer. aye. vice chair blashly. yes. and chair willis. yes. thank you. this is the point where we open it up for public comments. if any members of the public wish to address the commission and this is limited to items which are not on the agenda. is there any public comment on issues not on the agenda? no cards? okay. we will move on. the regular agenda. consideration of a heritage tree application for a valley oak at little chico creek elementary school located at 2090 amanda way. where is richie? richie is already up there. he is the chair of the chair wallace. good evening. this evening I bring to you a is your microphone on? can you hear me? that is better. can you hear me now? great. this evening I bring before you an application for a heritage tree location at little chico creek elementary school. address 2090 amanda way. so just a little recap on the heritage tree program. I know we have some new commissioners here and this will be your first heritage tree consideration. I will read out the code. voluntary heritage tree program. the purpose and intent of the voluntary heritage tree program is to identify, promote public awareness of, maintain and protect designated trees within the city of chico. this program acknowledges the heritage trees, whether located on public or private property, are distinct and unique living resources of the city of chico. so this is the tree for consideration this evening. this is a 67 inch valley oak. latin name quote unquote. it sits proudly in the grounds of little chico creek elementary school. here is another view. as you can see the tree in that picture. this is a screen shot of google street view. as you can see it from amanda way. just outside the school. you can see the tree there in the mid ground on the ball field in the recreation area. this is the tree that was planted in the school. just to give you a little recap of the current status of heritage trees, we don't have a lot of heritage trees. this is just a quick overview map to show the current locations of the heritage trees that we do have. the two that are listed in red are no longer present because they did fall over. if you look just to the left of the right, just below the center to the right you can see amanda way, the proposed 67 inch valley oak. you can see its location there. when you spend a few moments looking around this map you will see that this will be a contender for the equal with annie's glen valley oak which is currently also 67 inches. that's an amazing specimen. that's been a heritage tree for a number of years now. so this tree will be of equal status to the one at annie's glen. that's exciting. as you look around that map you will see that we don't have a lot. i think currently this would be the ninth heritage tree to be designated within the city. so i won't read all this slide but this is the general, the four pointers that heritage tree has to meet at least three points. so we have just one of these four conditions. so just to highlight in yellow the particular conditions relevant to this tree. so any native oak of 36 inches or greater just automatically qualifies to be a heritage tree. but we don't feel that by itself is really enough. because we have a lot of oak trees that are 36 inches or bigger. what really distinguishes this tree is its unique uniqueness. and what i mean by that i can probably we do have some guests with us this evening. we have kristen schrock the principal of little chico creek elementary school. we have tom mclean who helps out for many years at the school bringing science and stem alive to the school. and then we have two special very vip guests. and i believe they will probably do a better job than me speaking for the tree. so once i finish with my spiel i will invite the four of you to get up and if you want to speak at this podium i'm sure everyone would love to hear what you have to say for the tree. so my recommendation i do recommend that the bidwell park and playground commission approve this application for heritage tree status and recommend it to city council for approval. with that i will pass the podium and invite juliana connor tom and kristen i have one question for you one of the elements is is it a healthy tree? right it certainly shows its age so it certainly is healthy for the age that it's in it does have cavities it's very obvious that it is an old tree not just by its size some of the things that we've discussed doing with chico unified school district is to improve the landscape around the tree so one of the things we will be doing is adding a very wide buffer of mulch around the tree and another item that we need to effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively So hi, I'm Juliana. And I'm Connor. And we're from Little Chico Creek. Yes, students. I'm from fifth grade. He's from fourth grade. So yay. There's a really big and old valley oak tree at Little Chico Creek Elementary School. And it's super special for the younger kids. This giant tree is home to a family of cool barn owls and is like an outdoor classroom for the TK, kindergarten, and first grade students. When the kids go outside to visit the tree, they find all sorts of neat things in the nature. They love picking up the acorns and looking at the smooth tops and hard shells, learning how the tree grows new ones. They even... They even find strange little balls made of fur and bones, owl pellets. These show them what owls eat. The kids touch the rough bark and think about how old and strong the tree must be. Sometimes they even find tiny bones from animals and they learn about the food chain that happens right up in the tree branches. This outdoor space is full of fun and exciting ways to learn about science and nature. And it helps the kids feel connected to the world outside their classroom. Good job. Thank you for considering us. Thank you for considering us. Okay. Do you want to ask any questions? Do we have any questions for the young scholars? I don't have a question. I just want to thank both of you for speaking. And you did a lovely job. And thank you very much. Thank you. podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem that it provides in real life which is such great learning so thank you so much for being here today and please in the future consider serving in this capacity or another capacity. Mr. Rambach how old do you think this tree is? With it being 67 inches sometimes it' s hard to determine based on diameter because what I found is that trees grow really fast in this city and they' re much younger than what you might think so based on just simply counting tree rings of trees that have blown over that are slightly smaller than this I would put it about 120 years old but it looks older than that but I think it' s younger. Mr. designation as a heritage tree does it obligate the school district to take action to keep it healthy? There' s no obligation to enhance the maintenance of it necessarily. As I mentioned earlier I have had discussions with chico unified landscape department and we' ve already come to the decision that we will add a thick layer of mulch around the tree because that does seem to drastically improve the health of old veteran trees. It' s far superior to turf which it currently has now. Mr. the turf and the sprinkler system under the tree. Mr. We would certainly remove the turf if they would cap off some of the sprinklers I think they probably would some of them if not all of them and the city would provide the mulch we literally have mountains of mulch so we' re happy to donate that. Also as I mentioned we have had a lot of people who have loved doing work on the heritage trees it' s just a good feel good story and it' s good publicity for them. Thank you. Thank you. There is thank you for this. I do have some questions. So I understand your expertise in the area of urban forest management I believe. And I' m going to say in the context of the future I' m wondering if or maybe this was already done but it hasn' t been mentioned if there' s some way to run a more scientific analysis of the health of the tree then you know was it I guess how was the health assessed because I' ve had trees in my backyard fall that I thought were healthy I' m not a forest manager by any means but it looked healthy. And so I' m wondering if it' s possible to do any sort of more analysis of the health of the tree. And I' m also but my biggest concern is actually this line here in the background that says all designated trees are accessible or visible to the public and underscore the city' s commitment to urban forestry. And my concern is the pictures of that tree show that it' s in the playground that is surrounded by a fence that enhances the safety for students who attend the school. And I think that' s a And I' m wondering if the access of this tree will change to the public if we now designate it as a heritage tree. Will that gate be opened to the public anything like that that would potentially threaten the safety of children? for sure the safety of the children is number one priority there. There is no obligation to allow it open to the greater public. I mean really by describing it you know visible to the public we' re really just talking about the school children. There is no expectation that people would be able to come and approach the tree or gain access to the ground so they can look at the tree. Really the public part of it if you like is just that it' s on a school property which is a public school. But yeah no expectation on that. m looking to the principal if she has anything. schools are by definition open to the public. At our site we don' t open it to the public to talk to the students that left. But there are scores of people on the weekends. But while the school is not in session on the weekends right. Okay great thank you for the clarification. The students may have questions. You mentioned owls do you know the species? you're testing me now. I don' t know. I don' t know. Is it barn owl? I will find out thank you. any other questions? Okay is there anybody else that wishes to speak on this issue? No cards. Okay then we will close the hearing. I move we recommend the city council What? I move we recommend the city council approval of the harry street application at the chico creek elementary school. I will second. Okay. Very good. It' s been moved and seconded that we approve the application forward it to the city council for action. Okay we will put it to a vote. Commissioner nichols? yes. Commissioner pieva? yes. Commissioner scherer? yes. Vice chair blashley? yes. chair willis? yes. motion passes 6-0. moving on to information item presentation on the vegetation response to the fire in upper bedwell park. Thank you. All right. Thank you so much for having us. I' m kristin kaczynski. I' m a professor of applied ecology at chico state. And I the thing that I love most about teaching is getting students out in the field collecting data on issues that matter. And so I' m going to turn it over to melissa covington, sam jacobs, jessica lawbender and edda stewart to present data and findings on some research that we did this past spring in class. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So to start, we' ll go over a little background information on the park fire. It was ignited in july 2024 by a burning car in the bedwell municipal park. The fire reached full containment in september of 2024. And it burned over a total of 400,000 acres in butte and tahama county. And it was a very So we are part of dr. Kristin kaczynski's recovery of altered ecosystems class at chico state. So this semester we' ve really been looking at the natural recovery of ecosystems after disturbances. And also humans' role in the recovery process in the form of restoration. So we' ve really been working on two projects this whole semester. And those are how fire affects invasive species and how fire affects native species in upper bedwell park. So for our first project we were talking about an invasive species, yellow star thistle. Some of you may be familiar with it if you' re up in upper park and you were wearing shorts. But it' s an invasive plant. It' s mediterranean so it loves our climate. It loves the type of precipitation we have. And you see these long, slender branches. And they have spikes. Those are not soft. Those are something that can actually harm and puncture visitors and other types of animals that interact with it. This species, as you can see on this map, has really invaded the United States, especially the west coast. There' e 15 million acres of the United States that have been invaded. And a lot of times these will be in grasslands with high disturbance and high sun exposure. When they are in the space they will start to grow in the fall when the fall starts to rain and they have a peak growing season in late spring. So starting right around now. When they are here, like they are in upper park, they have a low nutrient density in terms of feeding native grazers and also livestock for ranchers and people who are putting cows and horses and sheep on the grasslands. The sharp spines can puncture livestock mouths and that can cause a fatal disorder called chewing disorder. They also grow very densely and crowd out other native diversity of bunch grasses and shrubs and things that can be more useful as a feed or as a type of food for grazers. So in terms of managing it, a lot of the times people will go into hand pulling, but that is really hard, very labor intensive. Mowing is also fairly labor intensive. Going through and trying to get the best of it and hand pulling out all of these places. You can't really cover a very large range, you can't really cover those 15 million acres. So there has been a pivot to using prescribed burns as a method of reducing this species. Early summer burning is when it is most critical to do it. When the plants have grown to their maximum capacity, you can actually have the most of them visible above the surface, but they haven't started to flower and seed and start the next generation yet. So we collected our data on the yellow star thistle on March 3rd and March 10th. We did this by setting up 25 meter transect lines in three different sites. So we looked at the park fire burned areas, the unburned areas, and areas where prescribed burns take place once a year. And we had 12 transects in each of these three sites, so we had a total of 36. And then we used the line per year We used the point intercept method at every half meter interval, and we were able to calculate percent cover by looking at what types of vegetation are present at each point. So as for just a few limitations that we noticed with this method, we did collect data in the early season, so it could possibly under represent the actual yellow star thistle coverage. Also the transect lines were laid on fairly rough terrain which could have added some kind of unexpected variability. So this is a map showing the three sites that we collected data at. So the prescribed fire sampling happened over by Horseshoe Lake, and then our unburned sampling took place right under Monkey Face. And our park fire sampling was right at the very start near Alligator Hole, the park fire perimeter. All right, and if you'll turn your attention to the graph on the upper right hand screen, we'll see that on the x-axis we have our three degrees of fire treatment, and on the y-axis we have our percent coverage. The dead yellow star thistle, which is last year's growth, is filled in dark blue, and next to it in orange is this year's yellow star thistle growth. The lowest percent coverage of yellow star thistle was found in the area which received the most prescribed burn treatment, measuring in at a mere 0.17%. Unsurprisingly, the area with the least amount of dead yellow star thistle was found within the park fire burn scar, compared to the unburned treatment area which had the most coverage of dead yellow star thistle. It is important to note that our sampling occurred in early March, and not during the peak growing season of yellow star thistle. So it is likely, it is expected that the percent coverage of yellow star thistle will have increased since our sampling period. So this is our, so that was our invasive species project, and this is our project that was focusing on native species. This project was focused on fire followers, which are plant species that have documented relationship with fire that's a positive relationship. When fire comes through and disturbs the land, it can offer thriving for these plants. A lot of times these are the ones that really quickly colonize after a fire when there's, for a variety of reasons, if there's less vegetation on the ground there's less to compete with, because they have some other cool evolutionary response to it. So the way that this study occurred was that the students would go out into Upper Park, go into the area that had been burned, and take pictures of everything, of all the plants they could see. So then they would take those pictures, upload it to this crowdsource species identification site called iNaturalist, and we did all of that in April, earlier this month. Then, in class, we would take all of the data that has been uploaded to iNaturalist in that region, in that park fire burn scar within Upper Park, all of that data that has been uploaded since August, so anytime somebody went out there, took a picture of something, and uploaded it with some sort of ID, we downloaded it and sorted them as things, pictures of those things that have been represented as fire followers in the past, or those that are species that are found there, but might not already have a relationship with fire. In total, we found 58 fire followers, and we're going to focus specifically on the top three that we noticed out there. One thing to consider about this type of project in our sampling study is that iNaturalist identifications come from the public. They're what people take pictures of, and that's what's going to be in the sample. The most common ones that we found most commonly spotted, identified, and uploaded. The most common ones were the ones that were most commonly spotted, This is a map of the space that we were doing the sampling in. This is Upper Park. a severity map. So you can see most of this is yellow. That's our moderately burned area. But also there are these hints of red and light green. Those are spaces that have been high burn or high severity burn and low severity burning. And then you can also see these dots in purple, blue, and red. And those are our most commonly identified plant species. So our most observed fire follower that our class saw in the Park Fire burn area is the bird's eye gillia. As you can see, it's this cute little purple flower. As for some characteristics about it, it is a pioneer species and endemic to California, although it has now spread to both Maine and Texas. It is an annual herbaceous flower and it germinates in destroyed areas. So effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively that they are mainly found in the low to moderate burn severity areas. All right, up next for our second most observed fire follower species, we have the wavy leaf soap plant. The wavy leaf soap plant is a characteristic fire follower indigenous to California and parts of southern Oregon. It is primarily found in grassland and chaperone habitats similar in composition to what is commonly seen in upper Bidwell Park. The wavy leaf soap plant is a drought tolerant species that has adapted to the California landscape providing habitat for pollinator species and whose flowers provide nectar for familiar upper park fauna like the iconic pipevine swallowtail. The deeply rooted bulbs of the plant are culturally significant to indigenous peoples utilized for its medicinal, edible, and practical purposes. Those same bulbs are known to stimulate regrowth by re-sprouting after fire events similar to what we have observed after the park fire. And in that map on the lower right hand side, the wavy leaf soap plant is those blue dots. It is naturally the observations of the wavy leaf soap plant occur primarily in areas of low burn severity and were also found in areas of moderate burn severity. The wavy leaf soap plant is a plant that is known to be a great source of! The third plant we looked at was the red larkspur. It is native to California and Oregon and grows below 6500 feet. It is commonly found in low elevation canyons, slopes, and mountain ranges and has fire responsive seeds. It thrives in the presence of reduced competition and low humidity. The red larkspur is a plant that is known to be a great source of!

Wheat abatement of yellow star thistle is also recommended in early spring, ideally before its seed production begins in order to prevent its reinfestation across the landscape. In terms of recovery, we would like to track upper park's landscape, its recovery path, and how it has been so inspiring. We would like to continue documenting the changing composition of fire followers and other herbaceous species present within the burn scar. The utilization of reference sites would greatly aid in tracking the progress of succession post-disturbance, vegetation composition, and overall ecosystem recovery. Any questions? Does a fire make it likely that we'll have star thistle back in the future? More star thistle or less star thistle over the next several years? Was it a good thing for star thistle eradication or not? So what we were finding was that in the areas that received the prescribed burn over consecutive years, we saw less amounts of star thistle, but after the park fire, it was, the composition resembled that of the unburned areas. But if we were to continue these fire treatments, we would have to do a lot more work to make sure that we're getting the right effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively through, clears out all sorts of litter that's sitting on the, like leaf litter, like organic leaves that are sitting on the surface, all sorts of grasses to compete with. And then once the rains start, it's able to start growing. So we don't have a ton of statistical robustness to say exactly how it ended up, but in, I don't know if I can go back to our graph a little bit, but you can see that there is just a little bit more cover in the park fire than there was in the unburned, because likely could have had something to do with reduced competition during that growing season throughout the fall and then into the spring. I'm still trying to understand whether or not, obviously the park fire was a disaster, but does it give us an advantage in terms of controlling star thistle going forward, because it's already burnt out of there? Yes. I could answer this if you want. So I would say if you had consecutive burns, then you would have a lot of risk. It would reduce the seed bank, but having just one large wildfire kind of gives it a big boost. So we may see more star thistle up there this summer. Thank you. Well, I guess this is a question for staff. I know you do controlled burns, I think every year west of Horseshoe Lake. Is there any plan for doing controlled burns further up in the park? We have been in discussion with chico fire about that exact thing. It' s just staff resources, weather, there' s a lot of factors that go into that. However, chico fire is very interested in doing some prescribed burning east of Horseshoe Lake in the park fire scar. So if the conditions are right, we can do that. For control of the star thistle, we' re in our third fire in the park. We' first consecutive year of prescribed burns west of Horseshoe Lake and it is proving effective there. So hopefully we can continue these prescribed burns in other parts of the park not only for star thistle control but just to reduce the fuel load over time. I think it was three years ago when you started that there was another fire that started in much the same place that they got at the ridge because there wasn' t any. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively and full disclosure I'm an employee of the university as well and But I also I just want to commend you for doing this research because this is student hours professor hours That the city we just don't have the time to do right so I want to thank you for that because this is critical information and so So that's my first thing number two It feels like there are a couple things that are important here and that is these prescribed burns are incredibly important Number one to have them more strategically timed so that that way the star thistle seed can be abated before it goes underground But number two with prescribed burns you can control pretty much the severity of the burn which it sounds like the other the other native plants Thrive and again, this is just looking at this a little bit of data It sounds like they thrive more in the lower intensity burns than they did in the higher intensity burns So I didn't see many spots where plants were collected out of the really high intensity burns maybe it just wasn't tracked there, but it sounds like that that's one of the things that That this the findings of this yeah So I think it's a little inconclusive because there wasn't a lot of high severity burn down in upper park if you go up Canyon to The ecological reserve there's a lot more high severity burning up there, but then again anecdotally I've been around there and there's lots of native plants coming back in this in the high. Yeah Yeah, perfect. Thank you We should In your presentation you mentioned that the bird's-eye gila that that is a pioneer species To me that means that's a nitrogen fixator is all the other two Plants that you found are they also pioneer species? Are they a nitrogen fixator? after a burn They none of those are necessarily nitrogen fixers and the soap plant and the And the red larkspur their perennials they can come back after a fire as well But the gilia is an annual and so those seeds are just waiting for some sort of disturbance and the fire is perfect and it Kind of explodes. Okay and have any city or talk to Butte county fire safe council to help out with Future prescribed burns in the area looking for grants with them We work pretty closely with Butte County fire safe council is as long as with Chico fire The big Chico Creek ecological reserve there's quite a collaborative right now that is working together on several fire related type issues so and All of us were all looking for grants were all effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively thank you very much it was very enlightening and keep up the good work. thank you. thank you. item 5.3 how many speaker cards do we have? we have 13 but I think we have one more coming. okay. at what point do we limit the amount of the speakers? so mr. chair typically we allot three minutes but when there' s this many speaker cards we can reduce it to two. at your discretion. so ordered. we will limit it to two. otherwise we will be here forever. okay. chair willis I would like to take the opportunity to introduce my colleague on the engineering side of public works who will give the presentation and give the options to south park drive the commission will recall this item is coming back from discussions we had in 2023 and on-site meeting in 2023. this is preemptive for the roadway we are excited to see the roadway full reconstruction on peterson memorial drive starting this summer during the construction schedule. then south park drive will be in the construction schedule next year pending the design. there has been a few changes I' m sure that brennan will discuss at the council level as far as vehicular access and what that relates to design that' s before you tonight. again thanks to my colleague on the engineering side. good evening commissioners brennan on the director of public works engineering as eric mentioned it' s a pleasure to be here tonight to talk about improvements in beautiful bidwell park. just to kind of put in context our role in engineering we do the capital projects and so we do the design go through the whole process of the design typically takes a couple of years and then ultimately construct the construction. appropriately first off just want to talk about peterson memorial drive. on the north side of the creek we opened bids on april 8. brown engineering was our low bid contractor and a total bid price just under 1.3 million dollars which was well below our engineer estimate so that' s good when bid prices come in below our estimates. for those that don' t know we take low bid and it' s a public contract code requirement. we are getting into contract with brown engineering anticipate starting construction on that portion in june or maybe july depends on when we get everything in order and they are able to mobilize and get going. there' s 30 working days so it' s going to be a relatively short duration project but while the construction is going on it will be closed to vehicles pedestrians and all alike because it' s a project there' s going to be heavy equipment operating through there. we want to keep the public safe and then open it up and let everyone use it as much as possible. it' s a repaving we' re going to stabilize the subgrade so the hope is with that type of treatment this asphalt should last hopefully another hundred years plus years. so moving into the consideration again south park drive we did the headway port a couple years ago as eric mentioned 2023 we held a meeting in lower park and discussed the different options. on this portion of south park drive from the 4th street entrance to caper acres we looked at different options and ultimately the commission directed staff to do some further analysis and layout design to have a separated bidirectional multiuse path plus the vehicular traffic in that eastbound direction there. so these were the different alternatives provided for south park drive at that time. since then city council has taken some action and communicated directed staff to do some closures in lower park including peterson memorial drive for certain segments as well as essentially everything east of caper acres. so while in that consideration you' ll see this evening there' e two different options the second option was really provided as a result of the commission meeting with the council direction to explore full closure considerations and what that might look like. originally when we were at the commission meeting several years ago we only had the one option we were going to consider and show what those impacts might be. so just jumping right into it this is our option one which includes the vehicular traffic shared with the multiuse path. so you can see kind of a little bit of the so you can kind of see in this area there would be some widening of the existing road by several feet in order to maintain and not maintain as many trees as possible. you can see right here as you get near the one mile parking lot entrance we diverge from the vehicular traffic. so again there' e a bunch of good trees in that area that we want to preserve so we went and threaded the needle through some of those trees to come back and so again moving north we enhance some of the areas here. one thing you'll note is the addition and formalizing of a lot of these parking spaces. a lot of that is just vegetation right now that gets used during heavy use times by vehicles anyway. so the intent is to kind of formalize that so it's more orderly and concise and we can maximize the amount of parking for the visitors in the park. and then kind of one of the biggest features is getting rid of the existing exit from caper acres parking lot onto woodland and realigning that so that you can use bi-directional access directly to the parking lot at caper acres and not have to drive down south park drive for the whole stretch. so option two considers fully closing south park drive to vehicle traffic and that's a little bit different than can get the traffic completely. that was again based on council direction to consider. one of the aspects of this project we look to do is pave the remaining parking areas as well as look at enhancing and adding some additional parking. director gustafson and I have talked about the horseshoe pit areas maybe being a potential option for paving woodland avenue area. in order to do that we would need to add a new access point as well from woodland at the sycamore field parking lot area. there is not currently one there so in order if you close off vehicles to south park drive obviously we will need to create access to that parking lot and still make it usable. so we would be adding that in this alternative. and then essentially the caper acres area but the parking lot area would remain the same in option one and option two removing the existing driveway access relocating it so it' s more direct bidirectional directly from woodland into the parking lot area. obviously in this scenario we would not be widening the pavement we would just be repaving it within its existing footprint and using that space for bicycles and pedestrians. with vehicles using woodland to access the parking lots. that should conclude my report and I' m available for any questions. we also have our consultant designer so you' re aware from ghd here as well as our project manager mike cook. chair I do have a list of questions. commissioner naba. thank you. you will have to bear with me I have a few. first off I wanted to beg the obvious question because in the summary report and in the report that was submitted I didn' t note any financials attached to how much each of the existing options would be as is. obviously the option two would be cheaper because you' re doing less asphalt you' re not widening when we widen the pavement and we have to diverge and go through some of the wooded area there' s going to be additional grading and stuff like that so the cheaper option is option two from a financial standpoint and then the other option we are budgeted with money and funds from city council to accommodate the cost associated with alternative one. do those estimates exist that could be provided to this commission as well? brian would you happen to know that? we haven' t put together cost estimates together as of yet. okay. another point and this was a good one that was raised by the board was raised from someone from my neighborhood actually was a concern about what about schools like to go to the playground go to the park is there accommodation somewhere for if buses go across to go into one of the three lots with how that would work given the length and in one of the plans at least for sure I remember the cape breakers there was only like they would basically be closing off one of the two ones and effectively effectively effectively accessible to effectively accessible to effectively accessible to effectively accessible to effectively accessible to effectively accessible to effectively accessible accessible to effectively accessible accessible accessible accessible accessible accessible accessible accessible accessible don' t see it being a huge concern. that was similar to the next one was a neighbor had brought up a concern about rvs and campers tend to be in the park quite often as you know in the bump I will call it the bump out space but it' s the north side of south park drive where the plan is to remove about it said 40 plus I counted it looks like more like 30 average size cars to me but there are a couple that are quite deep that they tend to pull up in as you probably are aware. Do you perceive that being a problem with them kind of obstructing the flow into the parking lots and out? that' s a good point one thing and even in option one we did remove the parking from the north side of south park to the south side to prevent the interaction of vehicles into the multi-use bike lane for bikes and pedestrians that' s the intention that is going to be coming to that side and utilizing that space. I didn' t understand that about the conflict about for north side and south side? you can see when I get to. if you' re parking on the south side and you' re playing at sycamore field you' re going across the road right? you walk yes. I' m talking about the multi-use path we' re removing parking really in this area so that cars aren' t pulling across the multi-use path we have bicyclists and pedestrians they' d be pulling in here and then when they back out they' re still in the travel lane they' re not going into the multi-use path lane. it' s removing that vehicular on pedestrian conflict. you' re going to park and then walk across. thanks. the parking lot is going to be also a question that had come up was in option number two how many parking spots would either be gained or lost because it didn' t really seem clear it said something about I want to say it used the word enhancing the parking lots and it talked a lot about the permeable surface but it wasn' t like saying expand so people wanted to know are we getting effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively parking space and that' s why we would look for input or direction to try and enhance and add some parking spaces because one of the concerns with option two would be the likelihood of now increased parking on woodland. I will say there was good feelings about the plans for the intersection at cypress east forest and woodland that people like that and we' re hoping it would of course be a d a compliant nice strong borders for bikers walkers to see maybe even considering colored type crosswalks things like that they want that thrown in the mix and definitely enhance lighting it' s very difficult and challenging and scary at night sometimes people are not the best at adhering to the rules and so being able to see the! the intersection of fourth and cypress. at the entry to the park. that' s not part of the scope of this project. they did allude to it in the plan so that would be totally separate out then? depending on the outcome but we' re not doing the full scope isn' t to do intersection improvements there are considerations for upgrades potentially signalized or roundabout at the intersection but those are just thoughts right now it' s not included as part of the scope. there was concern about wheelchairs that it is extremely difficult because they do not have an a d a over there. there are for higher level consideration in that is part of the downtown revitalization project some of the direction we have received from city council is to put in a road diet on fourth street that would add a multi-use path on fourth street connecting this main entrance to downtown so that' s some of the thought to is ensuring that we have continuity in those types of modes of transportation and connecting bidwell park with downtown. just in general I' d say for me I know that some of the maps didn' t have some clarity that I would be seeking I think in the future going forward if these get rendered again that it would be good on where the parking strip is. I will call it the new one on the south side of south park drive. To be clear that the cars would be pulling in from the park side to make that a little more obvious. Hopefully enhance that woodland avenue exists it' s really difficult to actually see woodland avenue on the maps. Also alignment with some of the egress wasn' t really what was talked about before so it did catch a lot of us by surprise. I' m sure there will be comment from the community about that thank you. just for me an off the cuff comment to my peers and the group would be that parking strip just concerns me because the problem as it was described to me and others that people are trying to appear to solve with this whole thing is a desire to lessen vehicle traffic or slow it down and separate ped bike from cars in another vision. And by putting that parking strip there and as you even described backing out yes they would be backing out in the vehicle one but as we all know people are people and there' s a lot of big vehicles more on the road these days and also there will be people walking across with strollers etc. And so it seems like we' re actually potentially introducing more risk by having 106 parking spaces and people backing in and pulling into them. And so I just am concerned because my understanding is we' ve had zero accidents involving vehicles and people or bicycles and I think that' s a good thing. vehicles inside our park boundaries. And so I' m concerned that we could actually make that unfortunately go the other way. I' ll let my peers take a spin. in option one are there any improvements made to the parking lots at one mile in sycamore fields it looks like they' re improved in option two but it appears they' re not improved in option one. we would in option one currently the plan would be to pave with asphalt for some stretch off of south park drive. we' ve had some ongoing discussions director gustafson and myself of looking on how to pave those parking lots and just formalize that so it' s not gravel and gets a lot of tracking of dirt and rock and all that kind of stuff. it' s not necessarily intended at this point but that' s something depending on the direction we go and how much budget we have at the time we award the contract including that or not including that. that' s one of those things if we have funding to do it we' d probably just do it while we have a contractor out there placing all the asphalt and hopefully have a good asphalt price. it' s not something we can fully commit to from a budgetary standpoint yet but that' s something definitely if the opportunity presents itself we' ll take advantage of that. they' re fully improved in option two because it' s a less expensive project and you' re not sure if it' re not sure you can fit them into option one? correct. okay. option two is based on concerns on safety concerns about vehicles pedestrians and bikes. as commissioner nava said what' s been the incidents? how many people have gotten hurt in recent years in this facility between pedestrians and cars and bikes? i don' t have that number. this was a council direction so it wasn' t a staff initiated item but i will just say that exact situation exists right now where you have the parking spaces here on the north side and they back up into where bikes and pedestrians are going anyway so it' s just on the other side of the street. okay but it seems to me like option two is based on safety concerns which there don' t appear to be any. i guess that' s what i' m trying to understand. yeah i guess that' s one way of looking at safety is wait until it happens and then we' ll try to address it. but i think there' s the perception of just any time you have vehicles and pedestrians or bicyclists with conflict points those are the likely areas where those occur. and so i think option one kind of addresses that by separating them and formalizing that' s why that came out of the headway engineer report. and so again option two was a council directive to close it off completely. it wasn' t based off any staff analysis or anything like that. it was just a council directive. and so as staff when we received that direction from the council we added an option two to just show what that looked like for visual purposes and consideration by the council. thank you. as the commission. i' ve got a question. has the city attorneys what is the city attorney' s opinion on the americans with disabilities act implications of option two? i think it' s effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively and thank you for this presentation and for the clear description of what's happening here. So I have a question about proposal number two and that is I'm looking at the Cypress Street, 4th Street mark here where it says that there's an entry gate monument. Is that monument monument So here's my concern. My concern is that I'm looking at this very long stretch of road and I'm wondering about emergency vehicle access to this area and how long it would take to get that gate open in the event that there was an emergency happening in the first part of the park where we needed the big ladder truck where we needed police and ambulances to respond to. How do they get there and does this delay their response time? I can't speak for the fire department but the entry monument is the existing one that is there that gets closed when the park is closed. In the event of an emergency response by either police department or fire department or operations and maintenance staff for that matter you could use the gate obviously there's some time associated with that otherwise it would be using woodland avenue and then using the access points to the parking lots and they would be able to get there. and see if they can drive back contra flo so in terms of increased time and worst case may is a few seconds. I worked on an emergency ambulance for three and a half years and I have done cpr on children and I have done cpr on people who have drowned and who have been hit by cars and I watched his children die in the middle of the street. It' s more than a year and a half ago now shunting all of the traffic from the hospital because that' s going to be your closest station and from probably fifth street where the fire department is they' re going to come down mangrove and they' re going to now have to go down woodland avenue which is a very narrow residential street. They' re going to have to be watching out more than if they could just come off of fourth and go straight into the park. I would say that the emergency personnel I' m incredibly concerned that this will reduce access for emergency personnel because there are a lot of incidences and I know we love our park but it' s very true we love it so much that we use it and that means there are accidents that happen. So I' m very concerned about completely closing it off and putting a gate there that will take several minutes to get through because every minute when someone has drowned or is in the middle of drowning is critical. So I' So that' s my biggest concern about shutting this off is access for emergency personnel. I just don' t see how they can get down that road fast enough down woodland avenue fast enough to save someone' s life. I appreciate those sentiments. I grew up in a household with my father as a firefighter and my little brother as a paramedic firefighter. So I understand the importance of that and heard many a story and all of the stories that I heard. I would like to thank the park for that and the park for that and all of the other things that we did and all of that. Again option 2 was not a staff initiated option that is why it is shown as option 2 and not option 1. It' s for those very reasons the headway report identified maintaining vehicular access to that. But similar to the rest I would add that you have that same scenario the rest of the park. We have bollards closing off to vehicular access where emergency personnel have to stop remove the bollards and then drive to the location of the incident. can I ask a follow up on that? do they not have access they don' t just automatically have a key in every fire engine and police car? they should have a key. I also have universal master keys. thank you. aren' t those gates secured with a chain and padlock? they are. okay. universal master key would they do have those also known as bolt cutters? yes exactly. worst case scenario. we do replace a lot of locks. I bet you do. commission I could also add real quickly to both fire and pd we work with them on the operations and maintenance side and really on the engineering side of public works quite often. there' s always changes with improvements to certain areas or access issues with certain areas and both departments pd and fire evolve and generate emergency response plans to certain scenarios that change. so I think they would look at this and definitely adapt and create a different emergency response plan that would utilize existing access points especially to sycamore pool for a drowning type situation. I think that would be a great solution. effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively the re sensitive to that and what it requires in minutes and seconds count but both our public safety departments are very capable in adapting and creating different plans to make sure the response times remain consistent. thank you. I will tell you that both as a resident in the area but I' m outside the impacted area for the most part other than living on woodland I' m way at the end. Having a parking strip for folks to look at when they move there primarily for aesthetics and closeness to the parks of course just seems like to me when the statistics don' t bear out a need to make a radical change like that and there' s alternatives we can consider such as the horseshoe pit area for the parking strip or the parking strip for overflow parking type of thing or just consistent ongoing parking. It' s relatively flat there' s an area up until the culvert that would maybe serve that purpose potentially even having striping be in the sycamore field lot too so people tighten up. People tend to park how they want because it' s not delineated so we could make more efficient use of the lots that we do have. Also the plan for number two just is a is the impact to woodland with closing the park entirely to traffic from beginning all the way through. You' re having everyone come on that way by the relocation of the caper acres one further down and then the new ingress egress planned between one mile and the caper acres which would be at the sycamore lot. That is a lot of burden on the street that doesn' t currently have that burden it is a lot of work to do. I sat and watched when this started being floating a while back most people do tend to enter on the east fourth where it goes right into the park and then you get some that come in on the side and then go out on east seventh or all the way back down woodland and through town. It just seems again like there' s a lot of things in play that have a more negative impact both inside the park and outside to solve something that hasn' t really been a problem. I also and I get looking forward that what could be but it seems like there' s absolutely other mitigation that we could and should in my opinion consider other than how these two stand today I think you could do a variant of either one maybe and make it work like not the most strip and then enhance parking expanded in option one and in option two it' s just a lot of people are struggling with the idea of a third ingress egress off of woodland. It is quite impactful to folks. That' s my two cents. commissioner scherer. yes two years ago when this came up one thing I didn' t understand and still don' t understand is why bikes and people go together because on the streets bikes and cars go together and sidewalks are grade separated clearly separate for pedestrians especially with more e-bikes to me in option one if there' s a delineation between the two I think it would feel a lot safer as a pedestrian to just have pedestrians by themselves and bikes with cars. typically in the designation of types of classifications of bike paths so like a class one would be a separated facility this is like a separate facility and basically a class four bi-directional cycle track or forget the term right now off the top of my head but by law it can be used by both pedestrians and bicyclists. So that' s going to be allowed there kind of regardless you don' t necessarily designate what like bikes and pedestrians not being able to use that space I would hope that electric bikes and sidewalks would be pedestrians and stuff like that are more apt to using the travel lane then that way pedestrians can have the space of the multi-use path portion but delineating that becomes a little more challenging in terms of its classification and trying to enforce that if that makes sense. it' s not possible it looks like there' s split rail fence so there' s not opportunities for switching back and forth but at the beginning of it to have a sign like bikes and cars this way pedestrians this way. we could do that. you said something about by law. it' s unenforceable but we can put up a sign to encourage. great thanks. I think that comes into play in the widths as well so you would potentially have a narrower path that you' re adding if it was just for pedestrians. any more questions from the commission? is it permissible to take a brief break before we take public comments to accommodate questions about podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem!

So the first speaker we have listed is Sue Ellen Rawlison. Okay. She did submit some e-mail comments for commission. Next. I will. Okay. This is from Sue Ellen Rawlison on Woodland Avenue. As a resident near the site, I have read the staff report and options one and two to improve use and access to South Park Drive. I also attended the park and playground conference. I signed up for the podem effectively E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E parking areas with striping would help. I am opposed to the offset entrance exits. They should line up with perpendicular streets and not be aimed at a woodland residence.

Hello. Brenda Krotz on Woodland Avenue. I like the comments of the letter that you just read, Larry. I agree with some of that. I'm concerned for one thing about the way in the plan that has the park changed to where it would be paved parking right next to the fence along Woodland. I would like to know if there is a reason why the existing parking that's on the north side of Woodland, the little parking places that are already there, what is wrong with those? I guess nobody can comment. If you're looking at option one, the parking along, it's inside the park off of South Park Drive. It's not pavement. The yellow signifies compacted AB aggregate base. It would be base, not asphalt that's delineated there. Is that doing away with the parking that's already in the park on the other side of the street, South Park? It would just be delineated more as depicted in that. The other parking would still exist? On which side? I don't know. On the north side of the road? Oh, yeah. The north side of South Park? The parks? Yeah, that would be Yeah, that parking would not be there to minimize the vehicle-pedestrian park conflicts as proposed. I think that's a big mistake. To have parking right up against the fence there, it seems to me, would be a big distraction. Any questions for Ms. Krautz? Okay. Next speaker. Next we have Laura Barry. Laura Barry, the president of the Good evening. My name is Laura Barry and I live directly across the street from Sycamore Field, which is the location proposed in option two as the new entrance to the park. First I'd like to thank the commission for your efforts to improve access to a Bidwell Park and for your thoughtful planning. But I do have serious concerns about the potential impact of closing South Park Drive to traffic and placing a new entrance at Sycamore Field. With that, I'll now give a quick overview of what's going on in the South Park Park. the street layout. The street layout is a quiet residential street and the proposed entrance would significantly increase traffic volume bringing noise and congestion and raising safety concerns for everyone who uses the street. Especially since the proposed new entrance is not aligned with the current street layout it' s about 100 feet offset from linden avenue which means the cars would need to make several confusing turns in a busy intersection to enter the park and that busy intersection would be right outside my front door. In addition to these safety and livability concerns there is also important historic preservation issue to consider in this neighborhood. My home is known as the Compton house built in 1930 by prominent chico family and it' s one of several historic properties along with linden The recent loss of the bidwell mansion I believe it' s more important than ever to protect and preserve chico's remaining historic homes and neighborhoods and the increased traffic and disruption would put the historic character and value of these homes at risk. I respectfully urge the commission to reconsider option 2 and explore alternative solutions that would meet the parks access goals without negatively impacting the environment. Thank you. . . . . . . . . . . . . all day walking up and down the street with their animals, their babies and strollers. And I think they enjoy the street because it's one of Chico's gems. It's historic. And I think it would be a travesty to turn it into a parking lot. And next we have Robert Diltz. Good evening and thank you for letting me give my opinion here to the commission. I appreciate all your work on this issue on South Park. I feel that both plans, plan one and two, are not going to be the same. I think it's not a good idea in my opinion. It's been said that option two to close the road is a cheaper option. I would disagree. When you put all the traffic going into the park at a couple new entrances and the existing one, the ingress, you're putting all the traffic going into the park at a couple new entrances. I think it's a good idea to put all the traffic on Woodland Avenue. I live on Woodland, like the previous speaker said. It's a wonderful street. A lot of people walk by. To put all that traffic on that road would increase the damage to the road and the wear and tear. Now who's going to fix that? Where does the money come for that? Has there been a study done on the traffic issue on project two? Those are real important things. The road will have to be repaved. I'm speaking of Woodland. To put all that traffic on Woodland is not a good idea. It's not an economically wise idea. And it's inappropriate to put all that change of the neighborhood on the people who live on Woodland. I think that what would be good is to leave the road open and widen the road a little so we can have cars, trucks, and these new 20, 30 mile an hour scooters that are a real danger. And there should be signs to speed limits on that road. Okay. Thank you, sir. But I believe your time's up. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. And next to speak, we will have Rick Satava, followed by Tom Carter. All right. Well, hello, everybody. I agree with all my neighbors. I think they've hit all the points we're talking about. My main concern, of course, is the new access. I think it's important to note that the new access points, Woodland is a narrow street, as you guys mentioned. And I measured it today. It's 29 feet. And that doesn't count. Cars parked in. You reduce that number, 8 feet, you're down to 21 feet. It's not enough room, really, for the large buses that I see coming in and out of Caper Acres, which is where I live. So my concern is where the access points will be. And what I've been told is no matter what you go with, one or two, both of them have the access points being changed. And I believe they should be changed. I don't believe they should be changed, but if they are, they should come in where a confluence of another street comes in, such as 7th Street or Sycamore or Linden, and not directly in the neighborhood. Thank you. So then we'll have Tom Carter, followed by Joni German. Good evening. My name is Tom Carter. I've lived on Woodland Avenue for 49 years. During that time, I've biked, jogged, and walked in Bidwell Park. I have never seen nor heard of a car versus pedestrian accident or of a car versus bicycle accident. Over the years, I've participated in and observed many events in the park. City streets, Chico Unified District Office, and the CART Center are utilized for parking. I've never heard of any participant not being able to secure adequate parking. Woodland Avenue residents convened for a neighborhood meeting yesterday, April 27th. Since safety and parking don't appear to be an issue, most residents are wondering what problems are being addressed by conceptual designs option one and option two. An informal vote was taken at this meeting. Out of 30 members present, zero expressed. We're going to discuss the! The South Park Drive is slated to be repaved in the near future. My personal suggestion would be to widen South Park Drive by three or four feet. This would give cars, bikes, and pedestrians more space and will not detract from the natural beauty of the park. If at some time in the future more parking is needed in the one-mile area, possibly the old horseshoe pits can be converted to parking. The parking area is a good place to be. If more parking in the future were to be needed for the Cape Breakers area, possibly the area just east of Cape Breakers could be used for additional parking. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Carter. Next to speak is Joanie German, followed by Melissa. Thank you, guys. I will be brief. Before we move around traffic and pave the roads, I'm hoping we can just pave the roads. I think the reason why the pedestrian traffic is so important is because we're not going to be able to go down this road. And the bikers are having so many issues is no one wants to be swallowed by the sinkholes. So if every part of the road was safe, you know, people would stay in their own lanes, preferably. Then maybe perhaps we could spend the extra money on the park rangers we were promised, and maybe more biking police too, because it's needed in that area. People seem to be worried about accidents that have not happened, but we are not addressing the numerous stabbing and smuggings and attacks that have happened in the park. I think that's very important. Anyone wanting to change parking on Woodland needs to visit the park on Saturday morning when there's an event. As I understood it, they went to see it on Monday when Cape Breakers was closed. I live right on Woodland. And when there's an event like that, you are watching harried, frantic parents grabbing strollers, bags, yelling for kids, grabbing by their arm, trying to keep them out of traffic. And Woodland is just not the street to have that happen to, please. Oops, sorry. My knees just hit a home run. Sorry. All right. Secondly, people move to Woodland Avenue for parking, for park views, not parking lot views. And I know that sounds very elitist, but there are so few neighborhoods that are protected. And I know that sounds very elitist, but there are so few neighborhoods that are protected. And urban blight is a real thing. People leave these beautiful, charming areas in Woodland and, sorry, in Chico and go behind gated communities. And let me see. There was one more thing. But I guess that's it. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next to speak, we have Melissa, followed by Ken Hardy. Hi. First, I want to thank you for your time and for the opportunity to speak today. I can't say anything. I have to agree with what everyone has said so far, but I believe Laura Berry did an amazing job of summing up how I feel about these proposals. I do want to say that I am concerned about the impact to Woodland Avenue, especially for parking and for traffic. I also agree with what Rick Satapa said about the street being very narrow, and looking at how we can best accommodate the traffic. We can't mitigate the needs of the park, but limiting the impact to the neighborhood. Thank you. Next to speak, we have Ken Hardy, followed by Denise Hardy. Good evening. I disagree that the plan is clear. It is not clear. As Commissioner Nava said, we can't even see the street, so I think the plan needs clarity. I believe the staff let the council down by only coming up with one option. Only one option closes the road. The other option, option one, keeps the road open, and not only keeps the road open, but adds parking spaces, so you're adding cars to a road that's going to remain open. I've seen the ladder truck run down both Woodland and South Park at various times of the night and day. But if you come up with a solution that puts more parking on Woodland, then you're going to make that street even more narrow for that ladder truck to come down. In 26 years of living on Woodland, I've seen one car accident. It was actually a hit and run on South Park, and I actually helped the police because I filmed it. I saw the guy driving away, so I used that for the police. And then if we're going to use money, city money, to improve that park area, why don't we fix the huge puddle that forms right outside of the park? I think it's the entrance by Sycamore Street. If you haven't seen it after the rain, it floods. It's a very big mini lake that I think we should put some money into that. Thank you. Next to speak, we have Denise Hardy, followed by Georgie Bellen. Hi there. Thanks for the opportunity to speak up regarding the impact on the street where I also live and have been with my husband. I've been with my husband for 26 years. We see a lot of stuff happening in the park, and I think the neighborhood has a high tolerance. However, speaking for myself personally, there's very little green anymore since the removal from the green area between South Park and Woodland that took place several years ago, and instead we got some nice wooden fences in its place. And now we're talking about putting parking lots around the park. So we're talking about putting parking lots around the park. So we won't have any green between Woodland and South Park. I don't really understand why that would be appealing to anyone. If you're talking about doing that because of the pedestrian or bicycle issue, and instead it would seem to me you would use the parking that exists already and just switch around your lanes that you're going to establish, as opposed to closing parking and then opening up a new parking lot from which my dining room will look right out on. And, you know, as another neighbor said, not to sound elitist, not at all, but we did move there because the park is right there, and we have put up with a lot of other things willingly. But it does seem that there's not a lot of consideration there. You know, we really need a lot of consideration for this street and the neighbors who are long-term residents. So I would like to say, brendan's comment that the, that people already park on that grass area, I disagree. They park on the grass area by sycamore field. That's where they park when the games are happening. They don't park across the street in the grass from the houses that are all along woodland. They park in the designated parking area, so I don't understand why there seems to be a need for that. Thank you, Ms. Hardy. Sorry, your time's up. Okay. I could go on, but thank you for the time. I'm sure you could. Next to speak, we have Georgie Bellen, followed by Bruce Burke. I don't see Georgie. Georgie. So, Bruce, Bruce Burke. And he'll be followed by Matthew Tennis. I'm Bruce Burke. I've lived on Woodland Avenue for about 34 years. Over those years, we've seen a lot of... sites. I'm concerned about the parking slots in proposal number one. I don't believe those parking slots that begin near the front gate and go all the way up to Cape Breakers are necessary. I believe that a parking area in perhaps the Horseshoe area can consolidate all of the parking. I found the behavior of the undesirable people, the day campers that come in in the morning and spend all day until sundown, they want to be away from people. And I think if we were to consolidate the parking in areas where there's high traffic and all that, we might be able to alleviate that problem. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Burke. Matthew Tennis, and then our final speaker, Brian Keough. Hi. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to be heard on this matter. So, I think that, personally, I think that these two options are kind of like a solution in search of a problem today. Someday, that might not be the case. I think of big city parks like Golden Gate Park. I think of Central Park in New York. You know, you've got a lot of parking facilities because in Golden Gate Park, for example, you've got museums down there. And, I mean, there's just zillions of people all around who are just really impacting it and want to use it all the time. I don't think that the nucleus of the, you know, the Cape Breakers, Sycamore Field, and One Mile Complex demands that level of infrastructure, personally. And I think there's... I think there's a folksy feel to what we've got right now that we're going to lose if we go with option one. You know, that said, if it had to be one of the two options, I would personally opt for option one, although I would be incensed if a new exit was built across the street from my house for all the reasons that were stated. Which is a good segue to me talking about option two. I think that this is a horrible, horrible idea, option two. Okay. Number one reason is that, hey, Sycamore Field, this is a massively used piece of our city. Okay. I mean, it's the idea that people don't need to come down there and park, you know, and kind of use that street and all that area. I mean, when those guys come to play softball on summer evenings, I mean, sometimes they run two shifts in and out of there. I mean, all that... You don't need lines in order for people to park diagonally. They figure it out and they jam-pack that whole area in there. If you go with this option two... If you go with this option two thing, all that parking is going to be in our neighborhood, on our side streets, everywhere. That driveway, okay, to leading into the Sycamore parking lot is going to be the biggest nightmare on busy park days. I mean, it is going to be a disaster. Thank you, Mr. Tennis. Your time's up. Our final speaker, Brian Kehoe. Thank you. So I was going to... I'm sorry. No? No? I guess we're done. So I will close the hearing. I do have a question. Commissioner Nichols addressed it to Mr. Gustafson, and I don't think we got a straight answer. podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem the city of california and we' re having automobile accidents or are we fixing a problem that doesn' t exist? I can speak to that I know commissioner nichols addressed it to Mr. Alderboni during his presentation and brennan had to leave he had some child care obligations he had to get to but as he mentioned the closing of south park drive was a council driven item wasn' the problem and I appreciate some of the comments this may be a solution looking for a problem in some of these options I think though what council was trying to look at is we' re going to make these improvements and now is the time to consider expansion or improvements while we' re going through the environmental review process while we' re scoping and designing a project and ultimately funding and constructing a project if we time of design and construction. You know I want to say that this is the opportunity to talk and give comments on this design proposal this won' t be the last opportunity. We would like a recommendation from the commission to take to council at this time but there' s and of course council will hear it and there could be additional council meetings not just one to hear this item as well. suggestions and comments and hopefully make changes and the commission could recommend a combination or hybrid function or recommendation if you will to maybe it' s option one with reduced amount of parking delineated on the south side of south park drive or maybe it' s a certain iteration of option two. I think the council with closing vehicular access to both south park and peterson drive was an attempt to look at what would it look like. I think we could all agree that the city has changed and evolved since decades ago when there was 40,000 people here and now there' s approaching 110,000 people and there are instances where there' s some close calls and impacts and conflicts between bicyclists, pedestrians and vehicles and I think the council would like to see that that and folks on horseback too as you get into middle and upper park that we' re trying to look at and make changes to now or design features now to not only accommodate the population increase that we' re dealing with but also decades into the future as well. Great comments from the stakeholders that are here tonight and I think the commission has the authority to either recommend one of the consider a hybrid or a hybrid or anything of that matter and I think for the public to understand too that there will be other opportunities to make comments to the city council as this design process moves forward. an idea that occurred to me and that is rehabbing the existing south park drive and putting a dedicated bike lane in the south park drive. There should be enough room what do you need three feet for three or four feet for a bike path rather than this seems unnecessarily complicated for a problem that I' m not even like some of the people said I' m still not convinced there' s a problem that needs to be fixed. there' s not it' s not just that easy and I say this respectfully that separates and delineating a bike path and pedestrian path from vehicular path is very troublesome in that area it gets into the root system and the drip line of many trees and impacts many trees and it was a difficult task for the colleagues on the engineering side of public works to design that and so that' s part of the features you see in option one it' s difficult to delineate a path goes down the path the entire stretch from the cypress entrance all the way to caper acres is without impacting live oaks. it doesn' t have to be a straight line does it? even with that it was impacting a lot of trees from what I understand. thank you and I' m going to ask the question to the committee members. thank you and I' m going to ask the thank you for all of the people who came to speak. I' m going to try to summarize a bit and maybe I won' t try to summarize but I will try to look at option number one and again I' m going to go back to my really I' m going to say intense opposition to closing off a gate that is for emergency access. I' m going to go back to my really I' m going to go back to my very very very very very very very very very!!! and I also heard that there was I didn' t hear a theme that there was not currently inadequate parking in the neighborhood especially I' m sure there are some days that parking is really congested there but I didn' t hear that as a really big theme from the residents and maybe I' m wrong about that I see a hand up and I will recognize you can I recognize you I will answer you quickly and clarification. the only time there is an issue with parking is when the gates are closed. thank you. I' m wondering those 106 and we' re going to lose what I' m looking at 40 we' re going to lose 40 plus or minus 40 perpendicular parking spaces on the north side of the road and that is a problem that re seeing. I' m not hearing a really strong theme that we have a significant parking problem in that area. Would it be possible as a hybrid here instead of doing the perpendicular we do a bunch of goodness we do fewer new parking spaces on the south side of the road where people have to parallel park and for my daughter that' s really scary but parallel park effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively You know and again, I just didn't hear where where there's a lack of parking at this point and so possibly Still keeping the road open repaving it so that we don't have as many potholes that are dangerous and Identifying some Bike lane and pedestrian lane a little bit more concretely and then Reducing just the scope of the parking on the south side of the road And again, just my thoughts on this as I was listening Thank you The no project option been analyzed I mean I assume that road needs work so doing nothing is not really an option here, right? Correct. Yeah, we need to we need to improve needs full rehabilitation Okay You know You can put it All those all those diagonal parking places and move the city's parking meters down there that nobody parked there. It's all Sorry facetious comments but but really the there there is not a no option option here because they're the Road needs rehab. So correct. So option one with fewer parking places would be the minimalist project then Okay. Thank you Yeah, the will of the Commission whatever you feel necessary to you know recommendation recommendation to make to to counsel Okay, one thing I noticed this it's angled parking and option one Was any consideration there's a lot of places in downtown Chico particularly that have back-end parking Because if you had back-end parking for eastbound traffic Which is what you would have there? You were not going to be lighting up the neighborhood with headlights Is that any consideration been given to you know, that's a thought I don't know if the Mr. Cook or I think it was John from the could comment on that to you may want to come to the podium So the record hears you if you don't mind Thanks Mike question Mike cook project manager Yeah, we did consider back in parking But I we've heard mixed feelings about the back-end parking downtown and how it functions. So it is policy a consideration Okay. Well downtown if you have nose in angled parking you're not lighting up a neighborhood Right. No, there's there is Improvements that could be done in turn me there are there's a current currently a berm there that could be enhanced with you know with additional landscaping to prevent headlights But you know again like Eric says it's up to you guys Thank you Commissioner Bradshaw What I'm kind of getting from the testimony tonight is that option one would work except for the exits the new exits that go right on to the Avenue across from Holmes and the parking issue back two years ago I think the three of us when we were on the Commission we met with several of you and at that time Everybody was agreement on this shared Street alternative There was no way we talked to the folks and that's what everybody agreed to at that time there was no plans for parking and I think the South Park was going to be opened all the way and I Believe is at 7th Street. It was not going to be closed. And so the residents seemed to support that option at that time. I don't know if any of you were there but that's what we agreed to on that meeting Chair Chair Chair Chair Chair Chair than what we heard from parents with kids and strollers and we heard from people commuting through on bikes I think in my mind this is an improvement option one would be an improvement sometimes we don' even realize there' s a problem and somebody comes in and fixes it and we say this is so much nicer and when I talked with people about this they really think it would be great to separate pedestrian traffic there from all the cars. I problems with downtown where downtown the cars are moving at faster speeds but on the park road they' re going much more slowly and can see you' re backing in and can stop and wait. The only opposition I heard to option one was the unsightlyness of the parking I was wondering shane if you could talk about that my understanding is that the vegetation had been cleared there I remember commissioner alexander talking about some kind of public safety concerns and that the fire fighters were there and then I also only saw removal of like four shrubs on there so if you could just talk about what those parking spaces would look like and how that would impact vegetation in that strip there between the parking and woodland avenue. on the vegetation project throughout that whole corridor the vegetation was there was non-native invasive vegetation that was tangled up in old hog wire fencing that had turned up into a nightmare that was not maintainable. What was replaced after that vegetation was several how many valley oaks did we plant there Richie? At the time there was 55 valley oaks planted on 30 feet center all the way from fourth street down to the exit. So as a result those valley oaks have been growing very fast they're very healthy and over time and even today they're creating quite a buffer for the view shed between the road and into the park and we can additionally add some additional native vegetation if that's desired if the view shed is a concern here. thank you. thank you. thank you. the second part of your question. the firefighters was that part of it? I don' t recall firefighters being any part of that. thanks. one other thing I honestly feel like I' m not understanding this issue on the traffic issue my understanding from driving at a number of times is the only way in once you' re on south park avenue is to go all the way down past cape breakers and then come back out on woodland avenue is there some exit that I didn' t know about? if I' m going to cape breakers I' m coming down woodland avenue anyway if I' m going to sycamore field I' m coming out on woodland avenue. there is an entrance exit on the woodland side right there by the horseshoe pits so if you came in fourth you could exit there but once you' re past that point it' s one way all the way to cape breakers. it sounds like the traffic would if there were just these three in option two if there was like the three in and outs you would reduce some of that full length of woodland avenue from when people are going further in and then are coming all the way back down woodland avenue and you would just have little shorter stretches in some instances so there may be a net increase or a net decrease but in my mind it doesn' t sound like a huge traffic increase for option two. it does seem to me that option one separating the two is a good option. addition of the two would provide a lot of safety for pedestrians bicycles and car traffic. I would have some things to add to a motion including a staff report to the city council including some of the information that' s been requested about safety and number of conflicts between cars and vehicles and bikes. And then just making some modifications to the parking options there one of which could be as commissioner the number of parking spaces so instead of continuing them much further to the west all the way down to cypress just switch if you need to move 40 spots around to reduce conflict then move them to the south side of south park but not extend them down as far. And then personally I think it makes a lot of sense to align the caper acres exit with where you leave the parking lot for caper acres that does put it on the street directly but I think that that happens quite often. where the current exit is now if I' m not mistaken it doesn' t go out to a cross street it goes directly on to woodland avenue is that right? it' s just moving it is that not right? that' s why I' m asking. If we could get one response here it seems like shane is familiar. it goes on to woodland and seven. I' m never taken that. okay. okay. so that could be a modification then I guess to accommodate the neighborhood to not change that. thank you. okay. any other? yes. commission nabba. thank you. I' m going to swerve a different direction from some that I' ve heard here and say that because I' m not a fan of either in the current iteration of the I' a variant of one or two. if we had to do anything I' d like to see it remain open to vehicle traffic. so a variant of option one that I would propose we maybe push back on deciding on a recommendation tonight and say instead how about you go back and let us know if it is feasible to do a parking lot at the horseshoe pit area and how many net parking spaces that would gain us to make it the parking space that is being used to offset the anywhere from 30 to 40 plus parking spaces that would be lost if we remove those along north side of south park drive. I don' t think I heard huge opposition to widening the street to accommodate as commissioner scherer said for were to do that for bike ped traffic and car traffic I think that could still be doable. I share your concern about emergency services every second counts when it' s your loved one. I too would worry about here we go with another need to unlock something we don' t currently have locked. I would say I would like to see effectively effectively!! effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively the neighborhood and also for other people you know you get people for years who are used to a certain way yes change can be good but again when it' s meaningful change based on actual need versus extrapolating something or deferring to only one type of traffic like bikes and we don' t want cars and so we don' t want to coexist and then having everyone else acquiesce to that I just think one a blended version of one without that parking strip any of it I think just trying to grab as many parking spaces as we can in those new spaces would be a good compromise. okay any more comments? yes Mr. Chairman do we have time do we need to make a decision tonight or do we have time to consider this in the future meeting? preferably a recommendation to council would be to have a would be staff' s preference just because we are getting into the construction season for 2025 so engineering needs to start finalizing the design process and start the environmental process for this to construct in 2026. I think if we did come back at next month' s meeting that would be doable but preferably we have a recommendation to go to council and as noted the commission can recommend a reiteration of either of these with changes to effectively effectively! podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem podem! podem podem the parking existing parking areas reference option 2 along with the data I think that was requested as far as any sort of vehicular pedestrian accidents and then what the cost would be and hopefully with a recommendation to improve parking or add parking in the horseshoe pits as part of the proposal. thank you Mr. Chair. the question becomes do we have enough data to make a decision? I think we do. I don' t think we can re-engineer this we would pay those people to do that. I make a motion we recommend option 1 with the additional recommendation that they minimize the visual impact of the parking along the south side of south park avenue by utilizing other places to accommodate the parking. add as a comment I think this recommendation makes the greatest benefit the largest number of people of all abilities to get into the park it' s also the traditional use of the park I' m afraid if we don' t take advantage of this project and get the improvements including the parking we will rue that day at some point in the future. I would like to approve recommendation 1 and recommend option 1 with minimizing the parking on the south side of it has been moved and seconded that we recommend option 1 with minimization of the parking on the south side of south park drive. does that correctly state the motion? that' s the motion but again I' m not suggesting we reduce the number of parking we just try to accommodate some of the neighborhood concerns. thank you. I would actually oppose that and I apologize I' m not familiar fully with the procedures here because I' d like to give our constituents a chance to actually see what we would recommend and if we have time to bring it back next month I would love to see a draft of that and then of what you described and then bring it back so that way our constituents can see what we' re going to vote on and we' re fully aware of what that would look like. if we have time to bring it back next month I would support that. those visual impacts would probably be in the staff report to council so they would get a chance to see it then. we do have a motion on the floor. do I get to respond with this I believe after some of you saying I want to ask a clarifying question or just make a statement that this swerved a lot from what was outlined in the outlined that the plans would be so literally friday is the first like any of the city residents knew about it. I just don' t feel like this is rushed and that we' ve heard a lot of people and their diverse crowd who have different experiences in the area and different modes that they use bike, walk, ride and I get they' re not representative of the entire city and what they might think but pausing for that month to come back and have them give the other option of the horseshoe area as well. I get what you' re saying about mitigation but I' m wondering about the resistance to that when they were noting that they' ve even discussed the potential for using the horseshoe pit area. I' m just curious is there a reason why that' s a problem like a concern the horseshoe pit area being the additional parking versus the parking area? I don' t see a problem I was suggesting that is a way to minimize the parking on the south side of park avenue. I was suggesting they thoroughly have that option to minimize the impacts on south park avenue. it sounded like you meant keep the parking strip that' s there but minimize the visual to it. I meant both I think they should do some things to try if they have to stay with the existing plan they ought to look at a vegetation that' s not going to be! thank you for clarifying that' s what I was trying to get at. thank you so much I appreciate that. any more comments before we vote? just to clarify the motion can you restate the motion? you' re going to be kidding me. I' m not. I got it. I got it. I' m going to say it' s a recommendation option one minimize the parking on the south side of south park drive and recommend maximizing the parking elsewhere such as the horseshoe pits. and adding vegetation to reduce the visual impact of the parking on the south side. that was implicit in it to minimize the impact. you got it. can I do a friendly recommendation on that? that I just know from attending council that words matter and saying minimize could mean we could do 70 parking spots there instead of 106. I' m just saying if we could say come back with we would like to recommend that city staff come back with option one as is as one alternative for consideration with minimizing the visual of the existing parking there and then a separate would be a variant of option one where that strip is altogether gone and just get as many parking spaces as we can out of the horseshoe pit area added to what already exists there today. That would be what I' d like to see us look at. I' m not in favor of that. I think we need to keep the parking generally as is along south of the county. I' m not in favor of that. I' m not in favor of that. I' d like to see if we can create some sort of parking places in the horseshoe pits or other places. I want to keep the same number of parking units in the plan. looks like we have a question in the audience since we' ve been entertaining that are we allowed to entertain it there? the hearing is closed. we' re just hashing it out. I guess we need to vote on the motion and then we' ll see where we go from here. we have a motion and a second. there wasn' t a friendly amendment. it wasn' t accepted. we vote? call the roll. commissioner nava? no. commissioner nichols? yes. commissioner piva? no. commissioner scherer? yes. vice chair blashly? yes. m going to abstain because I want to we' ve heard some evidence today and I want to get on site personally and look at what I heard. I guess I' m going to go with no. the only way to do that is to repeat the motion and take it from there. I say no because I' ve got to see what we were presented with tonight. commissioner willis? as presented right now I don' t have enough information so I' m going to vote no. bring it back next month. can you? motion fails 42. can we bring this back next month? Mr. Cooke is it detrimental for one more month? okay. I' d like to make a motion to postpone this item definitely until the may 2025 bidwell parks and playground commission meeting. If we postpone it definitely it has to come back next meeting. is that feasible? we would be looking for staff direction on what to come back with but I think we have it as far as the third option. option one eliminating the parking on the south side of south park drive. we would be looking at improving parking at existing features such as horseshoe pits and coming back with that option to review and provide parking stall counts on what the elimination would be and what the addition would be. would that include the additional parking there at sycamore field that was included in option two? yes. is that the information the commission needs to make a decision? yes. thank you. I will make a motion that we bring this to a second. I' m sorry I thought you said is there a motion. I will second that to bring it back. as noted yes. okay. any further discussion? jane? okay. commissioner nava? yes. commissioner nichols? yes. commissioner paiva? yes. commissioner scherer? yes. vice chair blashly? yes. and chair willis? yes. motion passes 6-0. okay. next item of business is the park division report. mr. chair we have a speaker card not related to the parking issue from earlier. brian kehoe. thank you. now is the time. okay. this should have been brought up in the public comments section. it should have been. okay. you have your. it' s not what you' ve been talking about. okay. anyway thank you for taking a minute of your time. you might as well. my name is brian kehoe. i run a program at five mile recreation area on the north side. and i'm out there 175 days a year. i'm there at 730 in the morning and i usually leave around 1 o' clock. so i have a really good picture of what happens in that space. and i've been doing this for now 10 years or so. i guess what i'm getting at is a recommendation to the park commission to mitigate what i have perceived as a pretty significant problem with the cul-de-sac that is and if i can familiarize you with that area. you come in wildwood and you turn down what i think they call five mile road. there's a large dirt parking lot and then you can continue down and there's a cul-de-sac. so every morning i'm there at 730 and i get to see what happened the night before. and i'm out there and i'm whether it's people still sleeping in their cars or whether it's trash or whether it's drug paraphernalia or other nefarious remnants. my recommendation is that the commission look into the possibility of putting a gate there and mitigating the use of that cul-de-sac. there's really nothing positive that comes from that cul-de-sac. i walk down the steep hill there onto the grass area to the trees and the root systems there which i do every day. but there really is nothing good that comes of having that cul-de-sac accessible. plenty of parking in that large dirt lot and there's really no reason to have vehicles come down there. they do donuts in there and the high school kids come down there and hang out there and drink alcohol and it's just really an interesting thing. the reason this has come to a head for me and i've been thinking about having this come before you and speaking on this is last week's recreational vehicle dumped their black water in the cul-de-sac and it flooded the cul-de-sac and it ran down the hill onto the grass. thank you mr. kate homan. i didn't realize that had a timer going. anyway thanks for taking my time or your time. thank you. thank you. fortunately i believe warren applies. i have a question actually. clarification for anyone who can answer it. is that part of the park? is that cul-de-sac part of the park or is it a public road that is adjacent to the park? it's within the park. it's called five mile road. i'm not exactly sure the jurisdictions. no. i'd say it's part of the park. i don't know the answer. thank you. it is. any other questions about that? okay. that's right. okay. we can't take any action on that. so the floor is yours. thank you mr. chair. good news. well here we are at park division report. verbal report only. and the latest update is on the assistant park manager we have selected a candidate. she is currently in the background check and hr process and we're hoping that she will be on board sometime between the middle of may and the beginning of june. so we're very excited about that. in lower park we have the alliance for workforce development crew has been very busy removing downed and dead material from various areas. so far they have removed over approximately 100 cubic yards of downed and dead material throughout lower park. making a huge impact on the fuel load there. in middle park we have had new cement pads poured in the west side picnic area. during the storms and over the winter there was a huge amount of sediment that was deposited that buried the cement pads that the picnic benches and the walls were on. it would have been thousands of yards of material to remove that sediment it would have created quite a bit of damage. huge impact. so the choice was we just poured additional cement on top of the existing pads to raise up the benches and the trash cans because it's going to be an ongoing problem throughout the years anyway. park crew did a very good job on that. so the west side of five mile will be open for reservations again here shortly. repaired shortly. Upper park we' ve started the rod and gun club parking lot grading in preparation for paving that' s going to happen there between the week of June 16 and the 25th. That was a request of the rod and gun club for their lease to minimize things like doing donuts and other damage that was happening there. The lindo channel the goats have completed about 50% of the grazing that they were scheduled for the spring between manzanita and highway 99 as part of the fema defensible space grant. They should be wrapping up there within the next couple weeks and then they' ll be back for final grazing in that area in the fall. As far as the goats grazing in the park We have been working on it in the late spring and early summer. We need to go back out to bid on that contract in july before july before the contract expires. Throughout the park we' ve been doing some bathroom paintings and sprucing things up. On the volunteer front, the caves adoptive park program will be concluding for the semester this Friday. Every Friday they have been out in the park with about 10 students doing various vegetation management projects and we' re looking forward to having them back in the fall. On earth day we partnered with chico velo trail works and we did a causeway project in middle park in an area that typically floods every year. That trail has gotten wider and wider due to the flooding and people avoiding the area. There was a raised causeway with some rock armoring. It came out incredible. That was also part of a donation for that project came from pg&e and for project and materials. We also had donations from the god squad in the amount of $480 for the maintenance of the council campfire ring and a donation from the park division. We also had a donation of $250 monthly from peter Washington. That concludes the park division report. I will hand it over to richie for the tree division report. thank you chair Willis. Again, this is just a verbal report. I will be able to take any questions you might have afterwards. The city received notification from the arbor day foundation that we have received tree city USA status for the 41st year in a row. We are very proud of that achievement. It was arbor day on Friday last week. For the last five years or so we have been hosting that celebration at parkview elementary. But because of measure C and the pending rebuild of that school it was decided to not plant any more trees there for now. So card for the park division report. We have stepped in and we put together an arbor day celebration somewhat on the fly at the park. But with collaboration with chico state, they currently had an exchange student program with 40 students from various countries from Asia. And we had a great arbor day celebration with those students. And we planted nine trees throughout different locations throughout the park. organizations in the garmo. And a great time was had by all. So the city donated those trees and some of our crew helped supervise the planting of that. So it was a really great collaboration between the city, card and chico state. We look forward to repeating that again next year. Just to segue from some of the items that have happened in the park this year. I want to add that we concluded the tree pruning along Peterson drive. Which includes the one mile parking lot as well. So over 500 large valley oaks were pruned. And I don't have the tonnage right now from the weight tickets. But a tremendous amount of weight has come off all of those trees. So I think we have a lot of work to do. And most of the cuts were only four, five, six inches cuts. If you drive down Peterson drive you will barely notice anything has happened. So they have done a really tremendous job. They rented two 90 foot aerial lifts. And those lifts were fully extended most of the time. So a lot of most of the work was aloft. And we had to do a lot of And they did a great job. So there were some removals scheduled as well. But we decided to defer the removals upon the recommendation from the qualified biologist that did the bird nest survey for us. Although I mentioned bird nesting survey. But what he recommended was we need an enhanced survey for actually bat roost. And the biologist that we had wasn't qualified for that. So we are going to hold off. And we will make sure that we get things done right and check that things are clear for bat roosting. So it looks like we will probably hold off that work until later in the year. So we know that we are clear for those concerns. Third item to report. We are happy to report that we have now concluded the Cal Fire Seed to Shade grant. We had a $600,000 grant that has been running for the last three years. And that was to plant 1,000 trees at various locations across the city. And I think I might look to Kathleen you might know the actual final number. I think it's about 1,050. It's over 1,000. 1,047. Thank you. So yes we have planted 1,047 trees. We have planted some of them on the driveway and some of them on people's private property because the Cal Fire grant did allow for that. So 300 of those trees were fruit trees. And we targeted that in some of the older parts of town. But yeah, we had a tremendous response with that. And also part of that is the NLOW tree for baby program that even though the grant has expired we certainly want to keep that going. So far we've had over 100 new parents that have received a celebration tree to celebrate the birth of their new baby. And we're I think we might be the only city in the United States that has a program like this that we've partnered up with our local maternity ward or NLOW. We're not aware of anywhere else that does this. And I know we have a few cities that are a little bit jealous. And I know we have a few cities that are a little bit jealous. And we've had a few inquiries how did you put that program together. So quite happy to talk to any other urban foresters out there that want to replicate the program. So we always try and learn from each other. But yeah, great program. I'm very proud of that one. That concludes my report. I'll be happy to answer any questions. I also have another item as a preview of future agendas. The direction of council, they've asked that the park and playground commission starts taking a look at a 20 year plan that incorporates the bidwell park master management plan. And perhaps during meetings that we could start chunking apart the master management plan and come up with an initiative list that we can propose to council kind of a plan of the priority projects that we would like to see happen over the next 20 years. It's my intent to see about community engagement and So I'm not getting a master management plan to you each printed. So you'll have something to read late at night. I think director Gustafson has more comment on that. will we eventually get to the card transfer item? That right now, eventually yes. Eventually yes. I'm not quite sure where we'll go. We'll see where that is. We are gathering information, we're providing card with cost information and next steps to come. shane, are we going to on the lindow channel bike path or is that grass going to get mowed down for fire? Where the valley oaks are, the grass that's popped up again? I think we'll see. I know exactly where you're talking about and I'll look into if that was ever put on a mowed contract or not. If it wasn't it should be because to maintain that area now that we've picked up all that down and dead would be fantastic. I'll follow up on that. Looks really good. The trees, richie and I are going to take a look at them but they' re very healthy now. Anything else? Any other questions? for staff? That's direction from council level and once that moves further along we can definitely bring staff presentation to the commission to hear that. I was going to comment further on shane's item. I will recognize Mr. Kehoe real quickly and what he talked about staff have heard that, understand that and I do appreciate the school, forest school that you put on in I think it's just a fantastic job of open natural classroom at five mile and Mr. Kehoe has done wonderful work not only with students but in maintaining and having a presence in the park so I do just want to acknowledge him for that and appreciate what you do. But what shane mentioned also the council directive that was at the last, excuse me, the April 1st meeting, the first meeting in April was council member Van Overbeck brought it to, I don't know if you likely heard or watched the meeting, for he wanted to create really it was kind of wavering into a project list but then does that mean a master plan update which is a significant lift to update the Bidwell Park master management plan that was about a four or five year process back in the late 90s early 2000s when it first started and ultimately the latest addition to the Bidwell Park master management plan was passed in 2008 and included a big Paragon Point section of course that gobbled up a lot of time and resources but it was hundreds of thousands of dollars in consultants and staff time so we had a good robust discussion about that and what council is looking for is really just a strategic projects initiative list if you will that we will be bringing to you so it will be a list of capital projects that we want to update and we want to accomplish in the next five, 10, 15, 20. Of course we have a big infrastructure push right now with Peterson and South Park tribe being fully rehabilitated. We have a separate master plan in design for caper acres to be redesigned and ultimately constructed. Due to the cost and constrained resources we have chipped away at that with certain features here and there but there is some larger upcoming items we would and of course vegetation management is a huge objective of ours right now. I think it' s a healthy exercise to go through so we will be bringing those lists to you in the coming meetings and the coming months of projects that we want to accomplish. We hope to get park commission approval direction and also council approval direction so we will have a strategic projects initiatives list if you will to work off of. Also real quickly council looking at that section in a little more detail. The master management plan the current one maybe a section per meeting or every other meeting for the next year, year and a half maybe up to two years. The idea is to analyze a section and at each meeting or every other meeting and determine if that section needs changes or needs to be updated or any changes or updates that are recommended by the commission. The objective is year and a half maybe two looking at that section and recommendations to council of what sections if any or at least it will be a honed look of what we recommend be updated of the bidwell park master management plan because a lot of it is very relative. It was again updated last in 2008 so there are maybe some parts that are a little stale but we want to find those and then have a really a honed approach a more surgical approach to an update which will be a lot more cost effective. Just know that' s coming and it will be a significant looking at that for the next year and a half or so. that' s something we can do without going out and having a very expensive consultant. What did the last one cost us half a million bucks? about $456,467. is there any thought given to similar to what some of the other commissions do maybe just considering having a strategic planning slash maintenance and ops kind of viewpoint or maybe those that are willing to serve on some kind of subcommittee so it can be more dedicated time frame on it? I just worry about giving it short shrift even with breaking it into sections with trying to fit it in with other agenda items I just want to make sure it gets the attention it deserves is that something that can happen or is the preference that truly happened during the meeting with all commissioners? I think that was the original preference from council. I think we could take a look at the budget and I think it would be a pretty robust look at it but consolidated by sections so it' s not a terrible three-hour meeting or something like that just on that item. I think maybe let' s try a few sections and see how it goes and if the commission feels that it warrants an ad hoc committee or subcommittee to support those efforts and you could certainly move to do that. thank you. the last Monday in May just happens to be Memorial Day so we' re going to meet on the 19th at 6 o'clock here. I think we stand adjourned until then. Thank you.
