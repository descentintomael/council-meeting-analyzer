I'm on your zoom call.  all right.  podium?  no.  video.  we can hear you we're pulling  you up on the screen so  everybody can see your bright  smiley face and share your  slides.  I think do we have slides?  yes.  if I'm hosting I just need  someone to allow me to host.  so sharing is not turned on.  okay.  we're working on that.  They're checking it out right  now.  give us just a second.  you should be able to do so.  okay.  I'm still not giving me that  permission.  here we go.  okay.  here we go.  hopefully now you can see the  screen.  now we can see it and we can  hear you.  great.  well, mayor and city council  thank you for having me this  evening.  your city manager asked that I  would come and do a short  presentation, kind of give an  overview on sales taxes and I'm  with HDL companies.  we've been serving the city of  Chico for a number of years  providing analytics, sales tax  reports and budgeting.  so I'll even touch on a little  bit of that in the course of my  presentation.  so and I'm certainly going to  leave time for anyone at the  dais or in the audience that may  have questions when I'm  finished.  thank you.  thank you.  so just to get right to it, the  first part of the slide deck is  really just some basic education  and like many parts of government  law and government code, there's a  lot of language and jargon.  so I just want to put a few terms  out there in case you hear me use  these over the course of my  presentation tonight.  s.u.t.  here up at the top is sales and  use tax.  it's just an acronym that we  often see when we're doing  reporting and data.  I wanted to acknowledge that the  California department of  tax and fee administration is  the agency that's responsible  statewide for the collection and  allocation of all your sales tax  revenues.  we have a part of the sales tax  rate that's often referred to as  the bradley burns and that is  actually goes back to the two  authors in 1955 that established  the 1% part of the sales tax  rate that is the key part of your  general fund revenues, your sales  tax revenues.  and then in sales and use tax parts  of the code, we focus a lot on what's  called place or point of sale.  so a lot of the revenue that's  derived for the city comes from your  merchants and that language in the  laws referred to as place of sale.  so just briefly, I want to talk  about what is taxed.  so sales tax, when you look at the  totality of the law and sales tax  law is now 90 plus years old.  it's a tax that's been in place for  months for all of the months of We're taxing tangible personal property. So that could be consumers on the retail side entering into transactions or even business to business transactions. It requires every business that's subject to collecting this tax to grab a permit, hold a  months of all of the  months of all of the It requires every business that's subject to collecting this tax to grab a permit, hold a permit with the CDTFA. And it's important to note that when we talk about sales tax, in particular, we're making sure that the goods are on site or on hand, a stock of goods held somewhere inside of California at a  on site or on hand, a stock of goods  held somewhere inside of California  at a warehouse, a retail store, a fulfillment center,  and work under a series of laws  where this is kind of an end consumer taxation.  We don't go through a staging process,  do wholesaling or anything.  It's the end user of that taxable personal property  that is subject to paying the sales tax.  There's a whole menu of things that are not taxed,  and again, really goes back over decades.  I would summarize most of this by saying it's utilities,  and particularly in the modern world that we live in,  a lot of things that are digitally transmitted  or shared economies are not subject to sales tax,  in addition to things like food and medicine.  So while there's a number of things that are taxed,  there have been a long list of things  that's listed here at the bottom that have been put together  and are in a record of the CDTFA  of things that are not subject to sales tax.  There's a little bit of a nuance in the jargon  around sales tax, but it is actually called  sales and use tax, and the differentiation here  between the two is use tax is focused on goods  that are held out of state, and so the things that are  subject to tax are identically the same items.  What is required under the use tax law,  again, that's been around for a long period of time,  is that out of state retailers would levy the tax rate  that's appropriate, acknowledging that goods  are getting shipped into California,  and I'll show you a bit how the tax revenues  from that flow here.  This is not a place of sale, per se,  but this is more of a destination at the county level.  It's how these use taxes are collected  and allocated across California.  I want to tell you, in terms of revenues coming back  to the local level, the city of Chico,  there's really two big buckets.  The first and most significant at the top here  are direct allocations, money at the local jurisdiction level.  These are sales taxes, it's place of sale activity,  and you're getting a full 1% value of, you know,  the Bradley Burns portion of the tax rate,  and as examples, these are your local drug stores,  grocery stores, gas stations, auto dealers,  retailers of general merchandise of all kinds, restaurants,  these are all generating direct allocation revenues for you.  They have a portion of the revenues that we deem  as indirect allocations, and they go into pools,  and I'll explain this a little more in a minute,  but these are the use taxes, and there's really kind of  a two-step process about how that money gets divided up.  There are formulas, and I will illustrate this in a moment,  but rather than getting the full 1% value  of that Bradley Burns, because it goes into a pool  and it's shared formulaically, this last year,  Chico received 69% of the revenues that went into the pool  or the indirect allocation as really  the major commercial center, if you will,  in Butte County.  So this is an illustration at the top right here of one  of our reports that is trying to illustrate for you  how these dollars get distributed.  So in the example here, in the most recent quarter of data  that we have, I would note that right here at this point,  there's about $1.88 million of use taxes that went  into the Butte pool, and that's the amount of revenue  that was allocated to the pool for the quarter,  and the formula distribution has to do with what were Chico's  point of sale revenues or place of sale revenues  for the quarter compared to the countywide total.  So I mentioned last year the allocation for the year of 2024  was 69%, and this particular quarter, it turned out to be 73.8%.  So the simple math here is to take the money that's available  in the pool,  apply that 73.8% ratio, and the city's getting almost $1.4 million  of indirect allocation for the quarter out of the pool.  And I point this out largely because pools,  when we weren't shopping on the internet 20 and 30 years ago,  really didn't have a lot of revenue to share,  and that has certainly changed today in some pretty dramatic ways.  So these pool revenues are a very important part of your overall  sales and use tax elections and budget that you have in place.  I often get asked, hey, I ordered something online,  where did the taxes go?  And while I wish I could give you a simple answer,  it doesn't exist.  So what we tend to do, this is a snapshot on one of our sales tax booklets,  just trying to do some instruction.  And what we have to determine before we can figure out who gets what,  who gets the money, we have to understand where did the order take place,  where did this online order happen?  We have to know where the goods are at the time of that,  and then we have to understand how the goods are delivered to the customer.  So there are a couple examples at the top here where if things are getting  shipped from fulfillment centers directly to customers,  those become revenues to the local jurisdiction that's the host of that  fulfillment center.  If, in fact, these are out-of-state fulfillment centers,  as I mentioned earlier, then those dollars get put into the pool  and allocated across the formula.  And we even have variations about buying online and picking up in store  and other things.  That would actually be local revenue.  For example, if you bought online and picked up something at a Target,  that would actually be local revenue to the city of Chico.  So there's a lot of permutations about ordering online,  and it kind of speaks to the complexity of the laws that we have to work with.  And I want to point out, because we get asked this a lot,  there's often a lot of interest in developing fulfillment centers  and trying to expand or grow a local agency's tax base.  But all of these fulfillment centers that are actually on the ground  with inventory and shipping to customers can generate revenue at the local level.  But there are a number of these facilities that we would,  I don't know if I should label intentionally as warehouses or distribution centers,  they might look the same from the outside,  but they're sorting facilities or last mile facilities.  They do not generate sales taxes for a local jurisdiction.  So I'm going to turn the page, talk about another section in the code,  and you have a local measure, H, that fits this transaction and use tax definition.  And so,  this sometimes is referred to as transaction and use tax,  as you can see here at the top.  Sometimes the language that the state uses is referred to as district tax.  These are synonymous.  And remember in sales and use tax,  we were talking and focused on revenues that come by place of sale.  In transaction and use tax law,  we're focused much more on allocation of revenues based on delivery or destination.  So I'm going to illustrate how that differs from sales tax here.  We're talking about goods,  regardless of where they come from,  are required and subject to your local transaction and use tax.  So they could be coming from somewhere in the county.  They could be coming somewhere from other parts of California,  the rest of the country,  or frankly,  even internationally.  And so there are obligations in law.  These are just a couple of paragraphs.  Here listed from the CDTFA website explaining who's subject to collecting these taxes.  And that's to ensure that you're getting,  of course,  all the money that you're entitled to.  This is just a visual illustration comparing sales tax to measure H.  So when something gets ordered and shipped into the city,  it generates measure H revenue.  You're going to find that most of your restaurants,  anything that's a walk-in is already generating measure H if you're kind of on the ground and using stores and eateries and the like within the city.  But you've also got some businesses,  and this particularly applies to things like building and construction sales,  big lumber sellers or business to business equipment sellers.  They ship a lot of their products out of city.  They're not delivering just to local residents or businesses.  Those do not generate measure H revenue.  They're just revenues,  those deliveries that occur outside of Chico.  I wanted to make sure as I put this together,  just talk a little bit about some of the administrative components of how all of this works.  Starting with,  you know,  who's paying?  So all those folks that are selling tangible personal property,  they're subject to pay in Chico.  You've got most folks filing returns quarterly.  It's very rare to see annual,  because the threshold for the tax liability is so low.  Many of the larger taxpayers actually make advanced payments twice a quarter and then file their final return at the end of the quarter.  And believe it or not,  in the age we live in,  there's still some taxpayers that are doing all this by hand,  by pen or pencil,  not electronically.  And I tried to just show you here,  we talk about quarters on a calendar year basis.  So at the bottom,  I'm just trying to show you,  you know,  an idea of an October to December fourth quarter in a calendar year would have taxpayers returns due at the end of January.  The state would be reconciling those returns and distributing final payments to local agencies,  including Chico in February.  We don't actually get the data that you work with us to get from the state.  We don't get that until about a month later in March.  And then as we go through that and prepare our analysis and reporting and forecasting,  we're typically not having meetings till April or May.  So it feels like a long lag between the actual quarter that is under review and when you may actually be seeing results of your sales taxes.  And this is just a table that kind of reinforces that.  This is what the state publishes to give you an idea of this fourth quarter again.  And the advances for that would have been paid in December and January.  And your final payment for that quarter would have been received in February.  And this just rolls through quarter after quarter,  year after year.  We work under,  we are company HDL and you,  a city who also has access to confidential information.  There's a government code section here called 7056.  And it's a,  it's been around for a long time.  The intention of that was to provide some protection about disclosing information from individual taxpayers.  So we have limited ability,  very limited ability about how we do that.  And frankly,  we can't talk about dollars or performance from a financial perspective at all.  We can talk generally about some things and I'll show you that in a second.  But I just want to point out,  sometimes people are interested in the details.  And we are limited and the staff that work for the city are limited in what they're able to share.  So,  you know,  working with this confidential data,  we're able to,  first of all,  get authorization to work on your behalf and get the data from CDTFA.  That's done by resolution.  Typically that would identify a number of positions and give the city managers some authority to designate other people that he or she would want to have involved in that.  We can at the bottom here actually do a couple of things appropriately without compromising confidentiality.  One is we can list the top 25 taxpayers in any particular quarter alphabetically or randomly.  We choose to do it alphabetically.  If you've seen our newsletters at all.  And then we are able to group together certain types of categories referred to as business types.  And so long as there are four or more separate permits or regulations,  within a type,  we're able to share out the financial performance of that grouping publicly.  If it's less than four,  it is deemed confidential.  And we have to also be careful within a business type or even a larger business group.  If you've got a very large taxpayer that's generating 80% or more of the revenue within that category,  that is also restricted.  And so then we're limited to what we can share.  Thank you.  I want to move to just talking about some statewide and local trends as it relates to overall sales taxes.  First of all, I want to just identify for you when you look at some of the data that I'm going to show you.  We get statewide data from about 98% of the coverage of cities and counties in California.  And we break that into eight major groups.  They're listed here at the top of this particular slide.  But what we like to do, aside from those broad categories,  is break down in a little more detail.  These are the business types I just referred to.  So example, in autos, we can segregate out new car sellers from used car dealers or leasing agents  or other types of transportation that may be sold.  In restaurants, we will pull out hotels separately from leisure venues  and different types of restaurants like quick service or casual dining.  This is a statewide perspective of what's been happening with revenues across these groups over the last 13 quarters.  You can see at the top here, the overall revenues for the state have been down 2.4% over that period of time.  It's a bit of a mixed result.  And here you would find in like in the purplish color line, there's been some better performance out of restaurants.  But it's definitely been.  In the orange line, for example, a difficult time for both autos and then even up in general consumer goods,  which is the light green line.  So some of that has been effects of interest rates, consumer behavior.  And we've seen certainly a better performance in both the pools and the business and industry group  as it relates to online sales, which have been growing.  Restaurants have had to deal with their own operating cost challenges.  Including new minimum wages requirements that hit a lot of the national change this last year.  This is we put out a webinar recorder and this is one of the slides that we put in there.  Try to get the gray bars are giving you a look back on actual performance.  And you'll recall back in early 2020, we went through the COVID crisis,  which did cause a short term kind of sudden short term decline.  And in sales tax revenues, but it was very brief.  And the bounce back was very significant.  So in the subsequent two years of fiscal years, 21 and 22, we saw double digit increases.  People that wanted to get out.  They wanted to spend money and they were doing it.  So even if they weren't traveling overseas, they were spending money on a statewide level inside of California in a big way.  And now we've seen with the effect of inflation.  And the ongoing.  The onset of tariffs and other things that are going on.  We've now seen a decline in the most recent full year of data.  And this year, that's just closing out this month.  We're expecting we'll be down.  I put a little post it down here just to note that the statewide revenue that we're estimating for fiscal year 26 will actually be less than the statewide revenue that was collected or received of sales taxes back in fiscal year 23.  So the unfortunate news here.  Statewide and at the local level for many agencies is sales taxes are not keeping up with your cost of operations and your infrastructure needs and those kind of things.  Not in the short term.  I want to do some very Chico specific stuff.  So first, want to break down your tax rate, which is currently at nine and a quarter percent as of April 1st this year.  You, like every agency in California, have a base rate of seven and a quarter percent.  And that is split up between the state.  The county gets pieces of that for mental health and realignment and prop 172.  And then there's this Bradley Burns piece, which is your local 1% revenue in your general fund.  Beyond the seven and a quarter percent rate, there is 2% authority allowed to add on additional local taxes.  And that has now been used up for the last four years.  The city approved its measure H back in November of 2022 at a 1% rate.  And then recently the county also approved a measure H.  Just put some notes here so we could all be clear on which age I'm talking about.  And that just got approved and brought the rate as of April 1st up to nine and a quarter percent.  So there is no more capacity under law to increase the local rate.  There have been legislative exemptions to do that.  I'm just saying.  I'm just making note of that.  And if you have questions about that, I can talk about that some more.  But absent that, there's no capacity within, frankly, within Butte County or the city of Chico.  So looking at your data, just running the last four quarters of data and trying to break that into those eight groups for you to give you a macro sense of where your revenue comes from.  The largest component here is your general consumer goods group.  So these are sellers of shoes.  And clothing.  And department stores.  Discount department stores.  Specialty items.  Electronics.  That's all in that green pie wedge.  Note here that the pools are, and this is common for many jurisdictions, are your second highest pie wedge, 18%.  And so I like to say that those, that's a group of taxpayers that are not in Chico.  This is all that out of state inventory that's getting divided up.  And then your third largest category here is the  The  Looking back has been building and construction.  So you've got three pretty big pie wedges there making up more than half of your total sales taxes.  These are some numbers that we're able to share publicly.  So I take those groupings and now I give you some data and try to show you what's been happening over the last four quarters.  We're always doing comparative things.  So I'm comparing the four quarters that just ended in March, 1Q25.  They're the same four quarters.  So we're looking at the four quarters of the prior year.  And you can see there's mixed results across the groups.  There's been the loss of a regional serving warehouse, which I'm sure you're familiar with, over the last year.  So that has caused general consumer goods comparisons to decline.  There's been weakened demand for building and construction related supplies.  And that's really not just local.  That's a state trend.  And then the dealerships  have struggled overall as interest rates have gone up and the price of vehicles generally has risen about 50% since 2019.  It's put some challenges on turnover at the local dealerships.  So those are just some highlights that come out of the analysis of the major industry groups here.  I just wanted to point out also the number I circled there is the number of sales tax permittees within the city broken down by category.  This is how the trends of those look for you.  Looking back, the same way I showed you the state data, but this is your sales tax data.  And again, you can see general consumer goods with the loss of some businesses has really struggled.  And the building construction numbers have also been down fairly dramatically.  You can see the other groupings in here as well.  So you're not alone.  If I were to put up other agencies here, they're not alone.  There would be a lot of revenues in the last six, seven, eight quarters have generally been flat or down.  And it's been trending that way for a period of time.  Let me show you what measure H looks like.  So we're still using the same groupings.  Now we have a number of taxpayers that are shipping goods into the city.  So the number of permittees is like quadruple what it is on your sales tax.  And the groupings here get a little different.  There have been some good news here that overall revenues in the last four quarter period were up 1%, about $258,000.  And that's been better deliveries and importing of business and industry.  And also because the way autos work in a transaction tax like measure H, we don't focus on your local dealerships.  We're focused on car buying and truck buying by your local residents regardless of where that occurs.  And so the effort there has been good.  And those revenues have increased 5% over the last year.  One of the things we like to do in our analytics is just compare in the left-hand column here what your sales tax numbers are doing compared to your measure H transaction taxes.  And we get these ratios.  Just to help us understand that 1% rate.  And when I look at like the business and industry group and I see a 202% ratio, it tells me that you have a fairly small base of those businesses in your city generating sales tax.  And there's a high demand for electrical equipment, industrial products, medical equipment, office, IT stuff.  It's all getting shipped in and generating revenues for you on measure H.  You've had some, the reverse of that is you have had a fair number of these larger building material suppliers, as I said, doing a lot of out of city shipment.  And so that ratio, it was just 62% over the last year.  We are able, because we have so much data to do some analytics, one of them is to put some per capita numbers in here.  And so the table or chart on the left is looking at change.  And so we're looking at Chico and the dark green line and trying to give you a sense of what's happening around you, cities either in the county or somewhat regionally nearby.  And to try to help you understand what a sales per capita is.  And we look at sales dollars over population of these jurisdictions.  You can see by and large, as it was in the state data, the trending is downward.  And over here on the right, I've just pulled that out to show you that Chico, when measured against the county, it's a little bit lower.  Because of all of the information that we've got in the chart for all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state of California, all of the regions of the state  country who's got inventory we see some pull forward spending meaning people are concerned  about cars and other things being more expensive with higher pricing i think we're going to see  some short-term surges in categorical buying nobody really knows if inflation is tame the feds  are trying to figure that out and will they cut rates and if so how much and frankly if they do  that's not going to change the spending in any significant way on sales taxable items it's just  not going to move the needle we've got two refineries that have announced closure in  california over this next year they generate 16 percent of the fuel that's consumed in california  so i don't know where that is all headed or how that get made gets made up it's going to create  a lot of pricing volatility for sure over these next few months and then there's um  you  there have been some new uh laws put into place um um and some um impacts coming out of a new  national tax bill that got signed into law in july and so to what extent does that  shape either how businesses respond or how customers respond i put at the bottom here just  some annual numbers to show what your estimated numbers for this year that's just closing fy24  25 and what the projections look like in this current year that you're operating in fy25 26 both  for sales tax and measure h and uh largely you know sales tax unchanged measure h going to be up  just slightly this coming year so with that i want to thank you very much for giving me some  time this evening and as i said happy to answer any questions of the council or anyone else  council member questions  no no  all right it looks like everybody's good thank you so much for the uh  very extensive and exhaustive all the wonderful information and we will look forward to seeing it  again next year exhaustive exhausting  you have a copy of the slides we do  great thank you so much  play on words sorry  all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all of the motions for all  Okay, I'm pulling 2.1 and 2.2.

Go ahead with our speakers. Thank you. Thank you  I'll call the first two names and if you can line up in the middle aisle marks belts followed by William Warren  And we have a very special guest in the middle aisle and make sure we don't step on any toes or tails  Well-behaved dog I must admit I've never had a dog do hand signals and it behaved  Well, good evening mayor council. My name is Mark Spouts and here we are again  The facts are not in dispute. We all came to agree on them  Resolution was drafted by your city attorney honoring the word of your staff generally and the airport manager specifically  I've done from the beginning  All I have been asked to do I've never vacated the building. I've made improvements  I've paid to rent you cashed the checks. I've received invoices for a lease  After our last meeting I reached out to aeroflight via the airport manager to inquire about shared space something you asked me to do  Somehow that fact was turned around and you were told  incorrectly  That I hadn't kept up with my part of the agreement  Then suddenly at a meeting not attended by all of us the resolution honoring my lease was voted down  After being pulled from the consent agenda  First time that's happened. I recall in quite a bit of time. I  Must say there's a skunk in the bush and I don't know where it is. I  Like many before me it relied on the word of city management  In this case the airport manager  What was and is really going on behind the scenes is unknown by everyone but a proper time?  Line has been established the lease was promised and accepted to and by me before anyone else  I've made substantial investments in my property as a result of the word. I was given I  Can't trust the word of the airport manager  What about the city attorney?  police chief fire chief  finance director  And if I can't what about other airport stakeholders  businesses aircraft owners  Airlines or even the FAA should they decide to come visit with stakeholders like me before they let Chico get an airline in here again  I don't think it'd be very pretty I  Have acted in good faith. I  respectfully request again  The jewish trusted stewards of this airport  Do what is right?  Uphold the commitment made by your appointed airport manager and allow me to continue my lease as promised  preserving the integrity and trust vital to Chico's regional airports future  Thank you  Thank you William Warren followed by Robin McCollum  Good evening members of the City Council. My name is bill Warren. I'm a partner at the law firm of Downey brand in Sacramento  I will be representing mark and Vicki spelt's if in fact this goes to litigation  That litigation will be filed under a legal principle known as promissory estoppel  I've looked at all the facts  We don't want to pull that trigger  I know this City Council had the right intent in June when it reaffirmed the commitments that were made to mr  Spells in November and December it accepted his rent payments in January  Accepted his rep his rent payments in February March and April  That's not the only thing here that the phrase that mark used was good faith  I think this really is a case about good faith and I know the I know that that particular  phrase is something that's important to the City Council and  I think that's really important to the City Council and  I've sent you a letter  If if I have to I'll put up I'll send it again with a notice  I'll send it again with a notice under the government claims Act and I don't want to do that. The facts here are so clear  there was a  November 6th  email between mr. Barr and as the Airport administrator and mr. Spells  mr. Barr sent a  Copy of the prior lease along with some outlines with respect to what the insurance  requirements were going to be. Mr. Speltz relied on that, accepted that lease, accepted and followed  through on the insurance requirements, paid his rent for January and December of 2024,  sought new assurances in January of 2025 about the status of the lease. Mr. Barr replied with  an email that will probably be exhibit A to the case that says it's yours. And then things change  for reasons we don't presently understand. My letter says that we're going to find out why  those things changed if we have to, but we don't want to do that. I think good faith dictates what  needs to happen here. When a person in California relies upon promises by a city or any entity  and changes his position and comes out of pocket significantly, in this case,  $322,000 to replace two Ram engines, refurbish the propellers and fix the turbos on a 340A  Cessna, which is a large plane. It's six people, needs large space.  My client would not have done that but for the promises of the city. And the case law that I  cited in the letter I sent to the city council is very clear on that. The city's got an obligation  to follow through on its promises in situations where somebody reasonably relies on the city's  promises, and that is exactly what's happened here. It's backed up by verbal discussions.  It's backed up by emails and written correspondence. Difficult to imagine a case that's more clear than  this case. I would really urge the city to go back to where it was in June to follow through  on its commitment and its promises.  I think that was the good faith of that particular decision. And for some reason in July it changed on a 4-2 vote when somebody here was absent.  So I don't think the legal issues here are in dispute and we don't want to file litigation, but we certainly will if we're forced to.  So I'm hoping the city council rethinks this and does the right thing and acts in good faith.  Thank you.  Madam Mayor, I have a question for Mr. Warren.  Okay.  Mr. Warren, do you have the dates when the city gave a verbal commitment to Mr. Seymour?  Are any of the lease belts either verbal or written?  Do you have those dates?  Yeah, November 6th.  And then again, there was a letter that was sent on November 5, which includes the prior lease.  And that particular email and attachment said, here's the lease that we're proposing.  And it also outlined what the insurance requirements would be.  And my client agreed to them.  And not only did my client agree to them, but my client sent a rent check in the amount of $3,000 for the month of January.  And the city accepted that rent check.  and cashed it. So on January 20th, didn't Mr. Speltz send an email to Mr. Barr  asking for confirmation? And didn't Mr. Barr reply in reference to the lease? Yes, it's yours.  If they are interested in using the space, I agree they can sublease from you, referring to  Aeroflite. That's exactly right. January 20th, the email was sent. My client had already sent  his airplane to Skyways. He saw what the charges were going to be. He wanted to make sure. And the  response was, yes, it's yours. So my client came out of pocket a lot of money. And he's entitled  to recompense with that if it's forced. But I don't think that's going to be necessary here.  Any other questions? No, that's good. Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much.  I just want to remind counsel, we had a public hearing. That public hearing is closed. So right  now, I recommend just taking comment. And if I may as well, just to respond to some of the  questions that were asked, I'm going to take a moment to ask a question. I'm going to take a  moment to ask a question. I'm going to take a moment to ask a question. I stand by my office  letter. We submitted a letter that was sent in April of 2025, outlining clear case law that  rejects pretty much the premise of their letter that was submitted. Again, the case law that they  even cited to in their letter for August 18th to the city council was called Air Quality Products  being the state of California. The court in that case held that no contractual liability may be  assessed against the public agency on account of the contract.  The court in that case held that no contractual liability may be assessed against the public agency on account of the contract.  Alleged because no such contract was statutorily or constitutionally authorized. And I quote this  language here because it's very relevant. One dealing with a public officer is charged with  the knowledge of and is bound at his peril to ascertain the extent of their powers to bind  the state for which they seek to act. And if they exceed that authority, the state is not bound  thereby to any extent. And so what we've indicated during the public hearing was that  the city council, I'm sorry, Mr. Barr, had no authority to contract, whether equitably as the speaker indicates  or contractually in writing because first of all the city's municipal code requires all  airport leases must be in writing and must be signed by an authorized officer of the city and approved by the airport commission.  None of that occurred. We stand by that position. Again, the case law that Mr. Warren even cites too undercuts this very argument.  department. Again I want to  respond to that but remind  council the public hearing is  closed and really we should be  accepting additional public  testimony unless that'  s the desire of the  council.  Mr. Lamb isn'  t this a new resolution?  This is a new resolution?  This resolution?  This resolution is  substantially the same as the  first resolution.  This is a new resolution this  is why it was brought back.  Correct it was directed at the  last meeting to be brought back  correct?  It was not the one that was  brought back.  And reworded so it'  s a new resolution?  I' m sorry I' m missing I'  m not understanding.  This isn'  t a rehash we'  re rehashing the same subject  matter but this is stands alone  on its own as a new resolution  as opposed to a rehearing of  appropriate.  compared to the previous  resolution?  No if you'  ll recall the reason why  there'  s any resolution being brought  before you is because that was  to codify and memorialize the  council'  s decision as to the  appeal of the lease agreement  with aero flight.  So that'  s why we have a  resolution being brought back  to you is that there needs to  be a conclusion to that  appeal that was filed by Mr.  Speltz.  Thank you.  Just a moment.  So Robin McCollum followed by  Bo Powell.  Good evening council members.  About two years ago I went out  to Five Mile and I was shocked  what I saw.  The channel that was originally  built 180 feet wide was  the  narrowed down to 50 feet.  And as the previous superintendent  of flood control and drainage  districts for Butte County I had  been responsible for maintaining  that following people before me.  It didn'  t look like that.  We experienced in 97 though we  got an atmospheric river and it  almost overtopped the levee.  So the conditions were much better  after that than they are now.  So if we had an event like that  again, the Corps of Engineers by  the way described that event as  approximately a 160 year event.  Most flood control systems are  built for a 100 year event.  When I wondered what was going  on I reached out first to Eric  Gustafson because I heard just in  the rumor mill that the city had  taken over maintenance.  But I found instead that there was  a stalemate between the city and  county that prevented anybody from  doing anything about it.  And with the help of Tom Van  Overbeek, David Keene, Eric, and  Mark Sorensen we got things changed.  The city took us to the city.  We had a strong stand and the  county had to recognize the fact  that they were the lead maintaining  agency and they went to work on it.  And this last January then we had  some success.  The Board of Supervisors approved  the expenditures for the work that  needs to be done there.  So okay good I'm reading the clock wrong.  I have two minutes practically left.  45 seconds.  Well too bad about that.  I had a lot to tell you.  I would like to cooperate going  forward.  I see some good things in the  proposed plan.  The director pack is going to speak  tonight?  Is that correct?  Director pack from the county?  No.  Well at any rate perhaps it is  David Keene who is going to present.  Okay.  So I'm glad to see that we are  moving forward on that.  There is a lot of work to be done  and I think it is very critical that  we protect the city.  The potential for catastrophic  effects if we don't get to work on  it soon and here we are will be  regrettable.  All right.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Bo Powell is our last speaker on  the consent agenda.  Hello council.  I was here when they had the  original thing about the airport.  And I'm in.  I'm in.  After all of the ! And the man had a lawyer with them and two more lawyers and a doctor. And they'd all been here 50 years. Well, in 2015, they legalized spraying the families of every lawyer, every doctor. Well, in 2015, they legalized spraying the families of every lawyer, every doctor.  After all of the  After all of the  After all of the  After all of the  After all of the  After all of the  Chico State has influenced our media so poorly, or bad, whatever you want to call it.  All three of the local papers, Counting to Chico State Orion, the News and Review, and  the Enterprise Record, and the Action News, all had Chico State alumni editors.  The Enterprise Record had a Chico State ex-journalism professor.  When they were able to legalize spraying all these lawyers' families, took away their parental  integrity, the Chico Enterprise Record had, with the editor, a Chico State ex-journalist.  Chico State's journalist professor had a guy on the East Coast writing about what happens  in this council meeting.  After they legalized spraying the public on the public right-of-ways, he goes, oh, I hope  everything's working good out there.  It's hard to tell from the East Coast, and quit.  He's a good guy.  He's a good guy.  He's a good guy.  Action News, right now, the Haiti Watch, you were on there, Mr. Winslow.  Cog Kimmelschuh told me I need to sue for my damages.  Well, everybody who's been on that show is like a witness list.  Your families, your wives, your husbands, they can all have to testify.  Ask your lawyer here.  They've seen.  They can testify, oh, I don't pay any attention when I'm driving down the road.  I didn't see the white orchards.  No.  With the trail cam and a can of white paint mixed in with their chemicals, they blackmailed  the law enforcement, the county.  Kamala Harris was the attorney general.  When they legalized spraying the California Highway Patrol and sheriff's deputies.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay, so the motion to approve the consent agenda with items 2.1 and 2.2 removed for  further discussion.  Is there a motion?  So moved.  Second.  Okay.  So moved. !  Because of all of the  Because of all of the motions for the present.  Because of all of the motions for the present.  Because of all of the motions for the present.  Because of all of the motions for the present.  Because of all of the motions for the present.  So I ask the poll this item not to play political games, but to have a final discussion on this matter.  I do respect the position that we want the best use of this property for the city's benefit.  I like Aeroflite and want them as a tenant at the airport.  They are a valued member of our community.  I like Mr. Speltz.  He is a wonderful and valued member of our community as well.  However, it is not about the like or dislike of one side or the other.  It is about the integrity and ethics of our council and ultimately the city.  I cannot get past the fact that we, the city, agreed to lease a hangar to Mr. Speltz in writing.  After that fact, we found another tenant that offered a more lucrative package, so it would seem.  That is not how ethical business is conducted.  So we have several business people on the dais, and I think you would agree with me.  If one entity agrees to something, then goes back on their agreement, back on their word,  their business would not last long.  I will again contend that this is not about the parties involved.  Both are highly valued in my opinion.  This is about equity.  This is about our integrity and our character as a city and as a council.  The question for me is a simple one.  Are we a city and a government you can trust to keep our word, or does that depend on the circumstances?  I hope it is the former.  Council Member Van Overbeek, then Howley, then Goldstein.  So, if you read the...  Turn this on.  If you read the beginning of the...  Staff report, which is highly misleading, it says,  Mark Speltz appealed the lease approval at the June 17, 2025 council meeting,  claiming he has a commitment to lease the property based on verbal communications between him and airport manager Barr.  What it doesn't say is that there was an email that was sent on January 21st from Mr. Barr to Mr. Speltz,  saying, yes, it's yours.  Now,  in my 45-year business career,  you people already probably know I'm pretty old, but now you know.  I have never had...  I can't recall a single situation where somebody's given me a verbal commitment on something like this and reneged on it.  Not one time.  And I was talking to my colleague, Mr. Bennett, who had a similar experience, I think, in your career,  that you haven't had people give you verbal commitments like this and not follow through.  I don't want to put words in your mouth.  I'll let you address that.  So, okay, on the 20th, Mr. Barr sends an email to Speltz and says, it's yours.  On the 29th, Aeroflite takes a tour of the hangar, and that's the first time where they agreed they wanted to lease the building.  So eight days after we'd given a commitment to Mr. Speltz, they bring Aeroflite through and pitch them on taking the building.  And I agree.  I can't add to what Mr. O'Brien said, but that's not the way business is done in Chico.  Thank you.  Council Member Hawley.  Thank you, Ms. Mayor.  I am completely puzzled by the mental gymnastics going on with this case.  The fact of the matter is that Mr. Speltz did not have a lease.  He willingly exited the lease.  There was nothing on paper stating that, and we know that the airport manager did not have authorization.  to promise the lease to Mr. Speltz again.  And I'm sorry, as a renter, I've rented multiple times from multiple different property managers and independent property managers.  I never assume housing if there is not a physical lease signed by the both of us.  It's as simple as that.  This is not the best decision for our airport facility.  It opens a whole lot of doors if we are agreeing that every single city staff member is able to promise things to the community.  Without any formal lease or authorization to do so.  I completely reject the decision that an email with one sentence ties the city to anything.  Thank you.  Council Member Goldstein.  Yeah, to me the city attorney's statement was pretty clear.  I value our word as a city a lot, and I'm sorry that this has happened.  But the fact is that an agreement like this has to go to the airport commission.  It has to be signed and agreed to by a city official.  And the procedure that we had to follow was only begun with the Aeroflite lease.  And so that's the lease that I see as actually moving forward.  Council Member Winslow.  Anything I'll add, because I did vote in favor of the appeal the last time I was present for the discussion.  On the understanding that there was a workable scenario for all the parties involved.  That the hangar could be subdued.  Let to this business.  And they would be able to be successful there.  I understand that's not really the case.  But I do think that the city has made an effort to accommodate all parties.  And that involves Mr. Speltz accepting another space that's available.  So the plane that was approved can still fit on the property is my understanding.  And with the other reason that was said.  As much as I share the principles that my council members on the ends spoke.  I do think that we have a responsibility to do what's best for the city in this circumstance.  And anybody doing business with the airport.  Should know that the airport commission has to approve the lease for it to be valid.  Council Member Bennett.  You don't have to.  I was just giving you the opportunity before somebody else did.  All right.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Well, so we have some renters here.  Including the 23-year-old colleague of mine on the left.  24?  25.  25.  Okay.  Sorry.  When was your birthday, Katie?  I wish I were 25.  But I'm not.  Anyway, I'm not going to tell you how old I am.  So if you're a renter and the apartment manager says the space is yours.  And somebody comes along a week later and offers them more money and says, yeah, sorry, I changed my mind.  You know, you wouldn't be very.  You would think that that was wrong.  Because you know what?  It is wrong.  You would not believe the same thing.  And wait a minute.  And I.  I own apartments.  And if my property manager did that, I would fire them immediately.  Well, I understand that corrective action has been taken by our public works director.  And yeah, as a renter, just through an email, that's not a lease.  All right.  Shall we move to.  Council Member Bennett, do we have a motion?  Council Member Bennett.  I feel compelled.  I feel compelled to make an apology for myself.  I'm not speaking for the city council.  I'm speaking for myself.  This is a truly unfortunate incident.  It should not have happened.  And yet it did.  I was fortunate enough that I never made a mistake over the years in the leasing efforts that I was involved in that created an awkward and very painful situation that has occurred for us.  For me.  For me.  And.  So I just want to apologize.  I feel I must apologize.  That is what I would do in a situation like this.  But I do feel I am compelled and obligated to support the organization.  So my decision will not be will not be as you wish.  But I just want to say I'm really sorry this ever happened.  So everybody understands we're facing litigation if we reject.  Mr. Speltz's appeal.  Everybody gets that right.  And we'll lose.  Well we'll see.  Our city attorney has given us advice.  We're past the appeal process.  I agree it's a very unfortunate situation all the way around.  And yeah.  Do we have a motion?  I make a motion we uphold the Speltz appeal for the airport lease.  I second.  I'll second that.  So I'd like to ask the city attorney that isn't what's before us.  That's not what's we need to make a motion.  So how do we award that?  I'll just make a substitute motion.  Yeah you can make a substitute motion.  That we approve the resolution.  I'll second the substitute motion.  Okay.  Sorry.  Would you just restate that?  It's just a substitute motion to approve the resolution so that we vote on that first.  And approving the resolution rejects the Speltz appeal.  Correct.  Yes.  Okay.  So the substitute motion comes first.  And it's from it was made by Councilmember Winslow and seconded by Councilmember Goldstein  to adopt the resolution denying the appeal and upholding the airport commission's approval  of the lease of the airport hangar space known as 100 Lockheed to  Aeroflight Incorporated.  Councilmember Goldstein?  Yes.  Councilmember Hawley?  Yes.  Councilmember O'Brien?  No.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  No.  Councilmember Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds?  Regrettably, but yes.  Carries 5-2.  Okay.  2.2.  Councilmember Van Overbeek?  Yeah.  So this.  We have a couple of significant public safety threats.  I'm sorry.  One is the city of Chico and one of them is the situation that Mr. McCollum referred  to on the flood control structure at Five Mile.  That is degraded because of the Park fire.  The county at the last Board of Supervisors meeting made some decisions related to it.  And in order just to keep it on the front burner, I asked Mr. Keene if he would give  us a short please presentation, summary presentation on where we are.  Okay, great.  We were planning on coming forward at one of the September council meetings to do a more detailed update.  The county is currently working through details, so it's kind of a fluid, evolving process with the details of the project and permitting.  And so the letter of support this evening is to help the county try and go obtain grant funding from state and federal sources.  But we'll know more in the coming weeks.  I would ask maybe what specifically would the council like to hear?  Is it specific to the five-mile sediment project that is a county project or the larger kind of flood management responsibilities and duties?  I'm primarily interested in five-mile because I think that is the one that could have catastrophic consequences if it fails because of where it's located and the amount of water.  And so we can, yeah, in September present on that.  Again, we're playing middleman a little bit because it is a county project,  but we're working closely.  We're working closely with them and would be confident we can portray that.  Want me to make a motion to approve 2.2?  Make a motion to approve and then we'll make a note to bring it back in September.  So I'd like to approve 2.2, council supporting Butte County's efforts to implement an expedited sediment removal and flood protection project at the five-mile basin.  Second.  Second.  Council Member Goldstein.  Aye.  Council Member Holley.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett.  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  And do we need to make a note on that for September?  Yes.  I know it wasn't in the motion, but thank you so much.  All right.  Public comment.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda.  And are within the jurisdiction's authority.  The council cannot take any action on at this meeting made under this section of the agenda.  How many speakers do we have?  We have 10.  All right.  Two minutes each.  Okay.  All right.  I'll call the first two speakers.  And if you could line up in the middle aisle.  Ariel de la Cruz followed by Vic S.  Good evening, councilors.  I am here to address the concerns of ICE here in Chico.  Mayor Casey Reynolds, I really implore you that you do everything in your power to make sure that...  My apologies.  Can you just pull the speaker down just a little bit so everyone at home can hear you?  Thank you.  There you go.  I highly implore you that you use to do everything in your power to prevent any, any  ICE harassment here of like the immigrants and migrants here in Chico.  I ask that you publicly disavow any unlawful or unconstitutional actions carried out by  ICE.  Thank you for your time.  Okay.  Thank you.  Vic S. followed by Morgan S.  Hello.  My name is Vic.  And it's been several months since I...  Last attended a city council meeting.  I walked my adopted dog at least three times during the day on different routes and have  talked with many neighbors and residents on the roads and side streets.  They are frustrated how motorists are rolling through stop signs, on their phones, texting  and speeding, especially on Palmetto and Sheridan Avenue.  And recall, it was back on December 3rd where somebody was on their phone not watching,  going on the wrong side of the road and totaled money.  And I was like, what's wrong with my car?  Very frustrating.  There are at least 300 cars per day going down Sheridan Avenue towards First Avenue  and at least 500 cars going up and down Palmetto.  I have counted these cars on several occasions.  Different times also.  March 31st, 2025 in the ER, counselors resume installing traffic cameras.  I was ecstatic about it.  However, my question is, why is this only going to occur on certain streets?  And I'm not saying that it's going to happen on the streets.  I'm saying that it's going to happen on the streets, not on Palmetto and Sheridan Avenue.  May 8th, 2025, I almost got hit by a car running a stop sign on Macy, which is off of Palmetto,  while walking my dog and then fell to the ground and the car stepped moving on and rolling on.  July 15th, 2025, once again, we need to have white stripes going down the middle of the roads  as well as speed bumps and surveillance cameras which would capture license plates of motorists speeding  and would generally denigrate the car.  We need to generate some monies to help pay for these things.  Safety should be a number one consideration on our streets.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Morgan S. followed by Matt Sutter.  Hello.  I am also here to discuss ICE and specifically how it will impact the student community.  I'm a student.  I believe that along with increased ICE activity, there will be an increase in targeting students,  especially those that speak out against their behaviors.  I believe that they may target them to believe.  It's been a long time since I spoke.  Madam Mayor, point of order.  ICE is a federal agency.  The city of Chico has no jurisdiction to impact what it does.  I agree.  But he's talking about students and Chico, so that has to do with Chico.  But ICE, we have no control over ICE.  You are correct about that.  Continue.  Then I will say I would like for this council to consider acknowledging that whatever.  I give up.  I'm sorry.  Take your time.  It's okay.  Thanks for your time.  Thanks for coming.  Okay.  So Matt Sutter followed by Molly Copta.  All right.  I practiced for three minutes, so I'll do my best here.  We ask a lot of law enforcement in this city and in this country.  We ask them to withstand a job that comes with incredible public pressure.  It's understandable that it would, but I recognize it's a lot to ask.  We ask them to make quick decisions in challenging situations.  As an educator of 20 years, I have a lot of experience.  I can commiserate on that part of the job at least.  We sometimes ask them to put themselves in the way of physical harm.  I'd like to say that I don't understand that, but increasingly teachers have to wrestle  with that at their jobs too.  I'm afraid that we as a city must ask our local police for one more thing, to protect  us from our own federal government.  The behavior of ICE in this city and across the state is telling.  Heavy arrest by ICE is illegal because it does not conform to the standards of due process  or habeas corpus outlined in our constitution.  On that legal ground, we have to be careful.  On that legal ground, every ICE officer is a human trafficker, clearly violating the  laws of this community and this state.  Any ICE officer that sets foot in our city should be arrested, detained, and charged  as the criminal they are.  I did not come to this decision by myself.  The American Bar Association has said that Guantanamo Bay detainees in prison for terrorist  acts should have due process, and the Supreme Court affirmed their right to habeas corpus  in Beaumadine v. Bush in 2008.  If foreigners accused of actual terrorist acts are found guilty, they will be charged with  a fine of $10,000.  If I, as a citizen of the state, have these rights, then certainly my Latino neighbors,  whose only crime is showing up and being brown, have these rights.  Every police officer takes an oath to support the United States Constitution, and the Constitution  is clear.  I regret that the unconstitutional behavior of the President and his asinine administration  forces Chico PD to deal with yet one more issue they did not sign up for.  But I also believe that no office of the law can claim to serve and protect if they do  not agree they must take this up.  It's not enough to not cooperate.  We must use the law enforcement of our community to make very clear that extrajudicial deportation  and unconstitutional kidnapping will not be tolerated here.  Don't just abolish ICE.  Imprison them.  It's time for cities in California to bare their teeth at the federal government.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Molly Copter.  Okay, hold on.  Just a reminder that we do not clap and we do not boo.  We want everybody to feel welcome to share what their feelings are, and if anybody has  clapped and anybody that was booed is essentially silencing them.  So let's respect each other's opinions and let everybody speak, please.  Okay, just a moment.  The next speaker after Molly will be Sam Barber.  So you can line up in the middle aisle.  Thank you.  Go ahead.  Thank you.  Good evening.  My name is Molly Copter.  I am honored to serve as the new CEO of the Chico Chamber of Commerce.  I want to take this opportunity to put a face to my name and my title.  And introduce myself as I begin in this role.  Our organization is transitioning under new leadership, and I look forward to building  strong partnerships with this council on behalf of the Chico business community.  Together, we have an opportunity to create a city where businesses can thrive and in  turn contribute to a vibrant, resilient local community.  Our members and the business community as a whole take great pride in the contribution  and contribution to Chico, whether through investment, service, or active participation  in civic life.  I ask for your partnership as we work to address the challenges before us and to seize opportunities  for growth and improvement.  While we may not always see every issue in the same way, I am committed to working collaboratively  with each of you to find solutions that strengthen our city.  The Chico Chamber of Commerce remains steadfast in our mission to cultivate a thriving business  community, support healthy local government, and foster a strong, safe, and vibrant Chico.  As a wise business leader once told me, without business, there is no community.  I look forward to carrying that spirit into our work together.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Sam Barber, followed by Jordan Gardner.  Hello.  So, on July 15th, I witnessed something pretty horrifying.  There was a pregnant woman in her yard.  She was in tears.  She was freaking out.  And just a few minutes prior to me speaking with her, they had taken her husband from  her.  This was a pregnant woman.  They slammed him against the fence when he went out to take the garbage.  There were three men in an unmarked van.  They took him.  They didn't give him any due process.  They didn't read him his rights.  They took him for questioning to Bakersfield.  So this is already impacting our community.  This is a violation of their constitution.  This is a violation of their constitutional rights.  This is someone who had a lawyer who had told them that they were in the clear.  Their papers were being processed.  So I would like to ask the city to do something about this.  I did a little bit of research and I saw that the city can file a lawsuit against ICE for  many reasons.  Unlawful immigration enforcement, violation of constitutional rights, interference with  local authority, fear and decreased participation in community life.  I have clients who have gardeners.  Who have domestic cleaners.  Who are horrified to come do their job.  They are scared that they're going to be taken and they are being human trafficked.  They're not given any due process.  This is a clear violation of the constitution.  So it's really a matter of does the city council believe in the constitution?  Are they willing to defend the constitution?  And are our law enforcement officers willing to do that as well?  This is horrifying to see.  At least 20% of the population identifies as Hispanic and Latino.  They're at very high risk right now for being racially profiled.  And legally kidnapped.  I would like the city to make some steps to make Chico a sanctuary city.  And yeah, I mean, that's really all I've got to say.  I do want to say also there was a time where Addison had brought up some things that occurred  during a closed door meeting.  The city acted very quickly to threaten him with law.  So I would like to see that same vigor put towards our constitutional rights.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jordan Gardner.  Jordan Gardner, followed by Bo Powell.  Hello.  I'm a member of District 7.  Bryce Goldstein is my representative.  So I have a story to share.  My friend works in an orchard.  One day he was at work and he was approached by a man in a t-shirt and tactical gear pants.  And he had the...  Swagger of law enforcement or undercover cop of some type.  My friend has friends of military and anyway, that was their demeanor.  And they were asking questions about the employees at this orchard and they were specifically  asking about the employment of migrants.  And then just of Mexicans and of people of color in general.  This happened in April.  Five months ago.  And I think it's fair to say that that's probably not the one person going out and asking questions  and trying to get data on people.  So I think that...  But if you want to help protect that 20% of our population who does identify as Mexican  or Latino, that is within your jurisdiction to do as Tom was asking earlier, if that is  in our jurisdiction at all.  It is, as Sam was saying, you can sue ICE for unlawful detainment.  But you can't sue ICE for unlawful detainment.  So, not access to due process, denying habeas corpus, and you can make Chico a sanctuary  city.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Bo Powell, followed by Nicole Nava.  I guess you know by now what my issue is.  And I came here in 2014 thinking I could probably talk people into caring about their children.  And they did.  And about their public servants, their public employees.  Wrong.  Okay?  Well, I see there's three chiefs in this room.  Is it too much for you to ask the public for help?  Say, stop spraying my employees.  Mr. O'Brien, you work for the task force, right?  So you know about the drugs.  Right?  You know that the agriculture chemicals were what created the methamphetamine problem in  Butte County.  And here we are 40 years later, and still have no control over what farmers do with  the agriculture chemicals.  The farm boroughs out there are getting sprayed all the time.  It's a front.  So Butte County looks good.  They sprayed everybody.  The poor ancient, the future farmers of America, those children are being exploited.  We live in between Macy Jane's, I guess you may want to call it north and south.  She has two businesses on Dayton.  I don't know if you know what that is.  It's in the middle of the state of wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in  wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham  in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham  in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham in wyndham  t address to  the council as a full and we  don'  t call individual council  members out by name and we  don'  t talk about other  supervisors or elected  officials that aren'  t here to  defend themselves. Direct us  all in general please.  good evening all city  staff. I am here because I  actually wanted to talk about  the downtown  revitalization.  And what I would like to say  and caution for the city is  this. I get that we all get  excited about new income  streams and other things to  have a vision of chico as we  each see it. We'  re all individuals and we  may have our own ideas of what  our downtown should look like  about what our park should feel  like when we use it. And when I  went to the community feedback  session I was a little bit  dismayed that we all had to  think about that. It felt like  being in a cattle shoot if you  will where you'  re given here's the four  shoots and you could have had  like six. But people  predetermined you're going  through four and then it  narrows more maybe and maybe a  little bit more. There was a  construct already and what  happened was there was not an  option where keeping three lanes  on main street and keeping three  lanes on broadway was even  presented to the group. So if you were someone who wasn't familiar with how things go and you'  not really fond of embracing your rights as we the people you would just think well I've got to go down that shoot and not say wait a minute where did the option go to have things be the three lanes the three lanes. And then what else what can we do to enhance? What can be built up infrastructure wise? We can still attend to sewers, sidewalks, lights, have cool aesthetics and other things happening. But we're being pushed down a road because there's a vision that some people have. In the future any  And even for this, I would say, take a pause.  You need to survey your city.  There's a lot of people out here, and there were stakeholders involved,  but certain stakeholder groups maybe have a more narrow vision of what they want.  Maybe they're only people who do bicycles, so they think it's a cool idea.  It was just a little bit disappointing to walk into that.  But the renderings were great.  I'll give them that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Dan Majic.  Council members, thanks for hearing me tonight.  I'm compelled to come before you today as a father and a concerned citizen  for the safety and welfare of the neighborhood near the alternative camping site.  I am representing six households in the Eden neighborhood, including my own,  that feel unsafe and are wanting a positive change for our neighborhood.  There was a shooting last Sunday that originated from the encampment  and a murder there just a month prior.  After the shooting, a fellow neighbor,  who was in the camp for months,  an increased police presence at  the site we feel like the ball  has been dropped there by chico  pd almost every time I drive by  I see a drug deal going on  there'  s constantly trash dumped  in there including under the  bridge which is a violation of  california fishing game code  section 5652 which makes it  unlawful to deposit or place  certain items within waters of  the state or within 150 feet of  the ordinary high water mark  where they could pass into  waters something must be done  for the safety and welfare of  the taxpaying citizens of the  east eaton neighborhood and  should be an improved location  elsewhere in the city I would  like to request that I am  included in any chico pd  communications on the matter or  action committees on the matter  thank you very much for your  attention  all in all for all of the  information for the council  all in all for all of the  information for the council  all in all for all of the  information for the council  all in all for all of the  information for the council  all in all for all of the  all in all for all of the  all in all for all of the  information for the council  all in all for all of the  information for the council  all in all for all of the  information for the council  all in all for all of the  all in all for all of the  all in all for all of the  all in all for all of the  It is a hearing that's under the Tax and Equity Fiscal Responsibility Act, which is TEFRA.  And it's in connection with the proposed issuance of revenue bonds by the California Municipal Finance Authority,  a joint exercise of powers authority and public entity of the state of California,  in the amount not to exceed $30 million, the bonds to finance.  And what I really want to do, I just want to make this very, very quick and short.  This is not an obligation for the city.  This is a courtesy that we're holding this hearing.  The obligation resides solely with the entity and not with the city of Chico.  And so I would ask the council, if you have any questions specific,  there are individuals here representing that project,  but it is really just an opportunity for them to conduct the public hearing.  All right. Any questions for Ms. Presson?  All right. We're going to open the public hearing.  Do we have any?  Speakers?  We do not.  All right. We will close the public hearing.  I'll entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Second.  Council Member Goldstein?  Yes.  Council Member Hawley?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  It's 4.2, introduction of an ordinance regulating massage establishments.  And we have a report from our code enforcement supervisor, Charlene Durkin.  Welcome.  Thank you.  Got it.  Good evening, Mayor.  Council.  Council of Council Members Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council of Council  jurisdictions the authority to enact and enforce ordinances regulating massage businesses.  Administrative enforcement has proven to be the most effective in dealing with illicit  massage establishments, where the police department has the authority to arrest a subject  for a penal code violation that doesn't necessarily give them the authority to shut  down an illicit business. This ordinance addresses basic operational considerations  such as hours of operation, basic health hygiene, safety practices, but is really intended to  prohibit illicit businesses from coming into Chico and to get rid of some that we currently have.  When I was working on this ordinance, I got a call from Reading Code Enforcement,  and they said, I have good news and bad news. The good news is we were able to get an illicit  business out of Reading. The bad news is they're operating in Chico.  A courtesy notice was sent to known massage establishments summarizing requirements of  this ordinance. The good news is we were able to get an illicit business out of Reading.  We also published an ad in the Enterprise Record highlighting Council's consideration  of this ordinance tonight. I did receive several calls and made some minor changes  to the ordinance based on the feedback that I received.  This ordinance will require an initial permit and annual renewal from the Code Enforcement  Division. If Council approves this ordinance, staff will return with a proposed fee structure.  These fees are not intended to achieve full cost recovery. We're not trying to be a burden on our  legitimate businesses.  I assure you that I will work very closely with our legitimate businesses to obtain their  permits and do everything in my power to make sure that the process goes as smoothly as possible.  I'm happy to answer any questions, staff, before Council ends.  All right. Any questions for Ms. Durkin?  I hear you're a great cook.  I try.  That's not why I wanted to talk to you, though.  How big a problem do we have? Because when I asked, I've asked around, and people have said,  you know, it really doesn't have a lot of visibility, but what you're telling me is that  it's increased because of what's happened in Redding.  Well, it certainly isn't. It's not visible if you don't know what you're looking for.  Working with the Massage Therapy Council, they estimate about 33 illicit businesses in town.  Correct. Yeah. Currently in town, operating right now.  And what do they base that on?  So there's websites that these businesses advertise on,  specifically prostitution services, and they develop, they call it a heat map,  and that's what they base their information on.  Okay.  Council Member Hawley.  I'd like to thank you and your staff for working on this project.  I must have missed it in the staff report, but you said that there was some public outreach  and communication, that your team has worked with businesses in Chico to kind of get some feedback  and implement this into...  Because of all of the information that you've all of the information that all of the information  that all of the information that all of the information that all of the information that  all of the information that all of the information that all of the information that all of the  information that all of the information that all of the information that all of the information  information that all of the information that all of the information that all of the information  all of the information that all of the information that all of the information that all of the  information that all of the information that all of the information that all of the information  all of the information that all of the information that all of the information that all of the  information that all of the information that all of the information that all of the  information that all of the information that all of the information that all of the  the city of california and  we have a language that allows  for that certification along  with california massage therapy  council.  thank you.  what is that?  structural integration.  it'  s similar to massage but they  also work on body posture and  the way you'  re moving that is  potentially creating pain and  issues.  i hope they'  re not in the room.  councilmember o'brien.  thank you mayor.  thank you charlene.  code enforcement supervisor  durkin.  i think the intent of this is  to weed out the bad actors.  we want that.  the worst of the bad actors are  the human traffickers and that  does occur and we need to pay  attention to that.  that is a real thing we want to  t know if she'  s going to speak during public  comment.  melanie foon who is a massage  therapist that has concerns about  the cost of integrating her  license which was obtained.  she went to school back in 1992  and that school is gone.  different dynamics related to  that.  i don'  t know if she'  s here and maybe address that to  her for all of her friends in  wyom wyom wyom wyom wyom wyom wyom  wyom wyom wyom wyom wyom  wyom wyom wyom wyom wyom  wyom wyom wyom wyom  wyom wyom wyom wyom  wyom wyom wyom wyom  wyom wyom wyom wyom  wyom wyom wyom wyom  businesses and this is not  intended to give them any  undue burden.  I know that thank you.  council member goldstein.  seeing if my question was  covered already. I agree with  the other council members I'  concerned about the impact of  m especially  concerned about human trafficking  and hope this type of ordinance  could help us prevent that. And  also very concerned about the  potential impacts to our small  businesses. I was wondering if  we have data on if ordinances  like this in other cities have  helped to reduce crime  especially human trafficking and  or if there'  s data on negative impacts to  the businesses.  I can'  t necessarily speak to that.  I don'  t know those numbers. I can  tell you that illicit businesses  are looking for jurisdictions  that don'  t have robust ordinances and  they'  re moving to those areas that  don'  t have ordinances. We'  ve seen that already. Like  reading.  I was going to say you said  earlier reading specifically  told you one of the businesses  that was.  They got out of town and  moved down to chico. That happens  a lot. That'  s why we this ordinance is  long. But it is designed to  prevent those businesses from  coming into town.  council member van overbeck.  the gist of this. I don'  t like more regulations. On the  other hand I think this is  something we need to consider.  But the gist of this is to  require masseuses to be  certified and the effort to get  that certification will eliminate  80 or 85% of the problem.  That'  s the core of this and I think  that'  s a great idea and we should  support it.  do we know it will eliminate 80  or 85% of the problem?  I'  m just guessing. It'  s not somebody trying to pick  up grocery money. You'  ve got to go through the process  to get certified. I don'  t like more regulations.  I agree. I'  m convinced these things do help  and that'  s why they'  re being adopted by so many  places. Thanks for all the work you'  ve done.  m going to put in, it'  s been a long time since we had  this before, which is why my  memory is kind of fuzzy because I  reached out to some business  owners now it'  s been almost nine months ago  and received some feedback that  was like experienced criticism of  the California Massage Therapy  Council and in particular not  being responsive yet costing  money for the certification and  such things. Some of those I  think that is just part of doing  business and that'  s part of us trying to make the  whole thing safe. But I just want  to clarify that we do have a  grace period within this. I think  it'  s in the email I read not  today. I think it' I think it's an email I read not until 2027 that people have to be certified. But if people are experiencing issues getting that certification for some logistical issue, then we can write. I'm certainly going to work with with our legitimate businesses and like I said, do everything in my power to make sure that they are able to get their permits as easily as possible.  for all of the months of September  for all of the months of September  for all of the months of September I'm certainly going to work with with our legitimate businesses and like I said, do everything in my power to make sure that they are able to get their permits as easily as possible. Yeah. Based on numbers, we do have code enforcement really good at working with people and not just issuing citations when people are making good faith effort to get through things. Correct. I do see that the city of Roseville adopted recently some updates to their ordinance and they have explicitly like an exemption if for some reason getting the certification is unreasonably difficult or something.  if for some reason getting the certification is unreasonably difficult or something and  we can work that in practice but I think it' s always good to include the same in the  law just in case we have a future code enforcement supervisor who has a different philosophy  in enforcement.  There' s one more thing that I want to like raise an issue about or ask I guess what the  motivation is.  We' re limiting operating hours from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. and while like we can agree what'  s like legitimate and not in my mind just operating after 10 p.m. people have the freedom  to work late.  People get off work late and like you know massage therapy is something that people get  for a variety of reasons.  I don' t see the connection to like the crime and is it necessary?  Were you responding to council direction including the ordinance?  No, I think generally businesses that are operating after 10 are usually not doing  anything good.  Is that based on data from other cities or is that just kind of the assumption?  Massage therapy council' s guidance on that.  Okay, that' s good to know.  Yeah, the ordinances I peaked at and I didn' t do as maybe as thorough research as I could  have.  I could have used chat GPT or something but I wasn' t seeing like Roseville having those  operating hours.  And yeah, in my mind it just feels a little bit overly like parental to tell people that  you can' t operate at night.  Well, we do have these regulations so we can watch.  Yeah, I mean we' re in the morning.  We do have 24-hour law enforcement.  We pay for that.  And I don' t know that I see it as our.  Okay.  So it' s a little bit of a different position, right?  So it' s connected to the goal of rooting out human trafficking that we prevent businesses  from deciding to be open later.  Again, we operate with discretion.  I mean if a business is operating and they have a legitimate reason that they need to  be open after 10 and they' re in compliance with all of our other requirements, this is  not going to be something we' re going to go after.  And really it' s best practice from the California Massage Therapy Council is what I understand.  Correct.  And they' re not just pulling these.  These hours out of the air.  There' s some real good reasons why they picked that time and I certainly understand that and  agree with what you said.  So thank you.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett?  No.  Okay.  All right.  Can we open the public hearing?  How many speakers do we have?  We have three.  All right.  Three minutes each.  All right.  I' ll call the first two names.  It' s Melanie Funaw and followed by Amy Alward.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hi.  So you got my email today.  There' s a couple things.  I' m I' ve been in business since 1996.  My education was in 1992 before the 500 hours was required.  So I' ve been practicing for 30 years.  If this goes through, it would take me eight months.  Okay.  Because of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances of all of the circumstances  organization that I should try to get the waiver to be permanent for certain businesses.  So that I'm 60.  It doesn't make sense.  It's cost prohibitive for me to go back to school for one year to only work five years.  It doesn't make sense.  Also, besides asking for it to be a permanent waiver, it's also odd to ask me to apply to this organization for certification when I know I'm going to fail.  And they know I'm going to fail.  It takes three months for the application to go through.  So it's a waste of time for me and for them.  So I would say the waiver needs to be permanent.  And certain businesses should not have to apply for this.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Amy Allward, followed by Dan Hayes.  Hello.  Good evening, members of the city council and everyone else gathered here.  My name is Amy Allward.  I'm a Ph.D. with an M.D.A. and a service dog.  And I've been a massage therapist for over 13 years.  I entered into massage therapy as a career choice after I was an accounting professor for over 10 years at a Ph.D. granting institution.  This has been a choice for me.  My area of study is professional ethics.  I am a professional.  And I am well aware.  Of how you regulate professions.  Such as accounting.  And this document is aimed initially at the assumption that all of us who do body work and massage therapy.  And I'm sorry, council member.  It is massage therapy.  We do not call ourselves masseuses or masseurs.  Because of the implication that we might somehow be sex workers.  I'm sorry, council member.  I'm going to be clear about that.  Most of us who have talked about this and who may be gathered out here are legitimate solopreneurs.  Most of us women.  And that is the statistics about massage therapists.  Most of us come to massage therapy as a change in career later in life.  We are not offering illicit services.  And many of us resist.  We resent the fact that this ordinance is written from the standpoint that we must prove to you that we are professionals.  And I think that's unacceptable.  And I think, given what I've heard here tonight.  Is that there's a lot of question about the ethics of this body.  And since that's my area of expertise, I'm going to address it.  You're asking me.  To apply for California Massage Therapy Council licensure.  which I have had, and I let slide after I lost my home, my business, my clients,  and everything I owned in the campfire in Paradise, California.  And my licensure came up while I was homeless after that fire.  While my clients were homeless after that fire,  I had no means to support myself through my business.  And the California Massage Therapy, which is voluntary in California for massage therapists,  told me they would not extend, reduce my late fines, or work with me at all after that tragedy.  And so I walked away from them, and I do not want to go back and be licensed with them.  There are many others who haven't met the education requirements they currently require,  and they're unwilling to work with us.  Please do right by us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Dan Hayes is our last speaker.  Thank you.  My name is Dan Hayes, and I'm here to talk about this ordinance that implies and insinuates  that the massage establishments and massage therapists in Chico engage in prostitution and human trafficking.  Now, how would you folks feel if you owned a place like this?  I would feel like a business that in nowhere else in the Chico Municipal Code  does it imply those kinds of things on any other business.  And in this ordinance, it implies it and insinuates.  I don't understand that.  If you were a business owner, a hotel owner, a bakery owner, or a restaurant owner,  and somebody implied that about your business, how would you feel?  You'd be down here.  You'd be down here with a rope and a necktie party.  I'm amazed.  You know, this ordinance, I got notice of it on August 4th.  It came in the afternoon mail of August 4th.  I wrote or submitted to the clerk's office to get a copy of the proposed ordinance.  They didn't have it.  I couldn't get it.  I didn't get it.  I didn't get it until I got a courtesy notice from Code Enforcement  on the afternoon of the 4th, went to their website and found the ordinance.  And, you know, I don't understand how you can put in, you know,  counsel sends a request to Internal Affairs to review making an ordinance.  I don't understand how you can put in, you know, counsel sends a request to Internal Affairs  Not one therapist that I know of, not one establishment that I've talked to ever got a notice of that meeting  or were ever asked to provide input into the ordinance that you have before you.  Not one.  You know, your police chief, when he was asked at the Internal Affairs Committee about,  is this a problem, in part what he said is,  we do not seem to have a problem.  So where did this ordinance come from?  Why, why is it, why are you implying or why is this ordinance implying  that the massage therapists are doing something wrong?  I'm not opposed to an ordinance, but I'd sure like to, as, you know, my wife's a business owner  and other therapists would like to have input into it.  put into its formulation and nobody was ever asked.  Nobody even knew about the meeting.  I respectfully request that you send this back to the Internal Affairs Committee.  Thanks, Dan.  With the intention.  That's time, thank you.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  I'll send you the rest of it in an email.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll close the public hearing.  Thank you.  Any further comments from council?  Council Member Lanza.  Well, I'm inclined first to offer a little bit of a defense of, I think, what the point of the ordinance is.  While requiring a certification is, it costs some money, it's onerous, there are issues, which I'll get to with this organization,  and the fact that it's a private nonprofit, it's empowered as essentially a state regulatory body,  but we, as politicians, I just had to go through a renewal of my two-year political ethic course.  We are kind of assumed to be criminals in a way, too, and we have to publish disclosures of conflicts of interest.  And I think the fact of just having, like, making sure that employees are known is sort of a similar thing,  because human trafficking, while it may not be extremely prevalent in our community, it happens sometimes.  And it's just to make sure, even if that's a very small number of cases, that we do our due diligence to make sure that it's not something that can proliferate, as it does in some places in California we know.  With that being said, I do think that there are certain things that are, like, potential issues here.  Number one that was brought up is, while we can offer a waiver, it becomes this repetitive issue,  especially somebody like this case that we have, which there might not be a lot of people in Chico who have the same experience of a school that's now closed down,  would have difficulty getting the certification without, maybe there's a lot, yeah.  Seeing that other ordinances like Roseville, like, offer an exemption, I think it's worth just having a clarification that what's the process for receiving that exception.  Yeah.  I think it's worth just getting it right, and it's a small fix.  And the other one that's, I don't know how the council members feel about it, but I don't really support blanket open-close hours.  Like, we set the terms for businesses to operate.  I think there's plenty of legitimate reasons to be doing business at late hours.  It's not upon us to say that, like, the hours between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. are the moral hours, and off that are immoral hours.  I just don't think it's the case, and we should allow businesses to decide that.  If there's suspicious activity, and there's only a few businesses that are doing that,  and there's only a few businesses that are open that late, then I think it's easier for us to narrow down where we focus detective investigation.  And like I mentioned, we pay for 24-hour police.  So I think we can allow businesses to make their own decision there.  Before you go, Council Member Van Overbeek, Mr. Lamb, is there an ability to add to the ordinance a way to somehow receive a one-year permanent waiver for something like the case that we just heard about?  Yeah, I think there is.  I think what I'd recommend is Council conduct a public hearing and then provide us direction, and we can bring back revisions.  Because, again, as Council Member Winslow said, we want to make sure it's right as well.  And I think, as you can see, there is a lot of room there, right?  And so if we don't get it right, then we create these giant holes that, you know, anyone can try to apply for that exception.  And so we want to make sure that, as Ms. Durkan mentioned, is trying to address that.  And so we can kind of look at how do we address, you know, assist and work with the legitimate businesses and not be punitive.  And we can kind of look at how do we structure that and bring back that draft to you after we've done that and just do the public hearing tonight and then bring it back for Council to take a look at it.  Perfect. Thank you.  And for clarification, as currently written, that exception is only available until January 1 of 2026.  So not very long.  2026.  So.  I think we have a situation, and I'm referring to the first speaker, where we have people who are well established.  They've been doing this for a long time.  There's no ‑‑ there should be some provision to grandfather them in or have some streamlined way for them to continue in business.  I mean, there needs to be some uniformity.  But at the same time, when somebody's been doing this for 30 years and there's been no police interference with their activities because they're a legitimate massage business, I think we should somehow figure out how to allow for that.  Yeah, that's what we just asked the city attorney, and he said we could ‑‑  Yeah, well, that was ‑‑ he talked about a waiver.  And I'm talking about something else.  And it's not fully formed.  But there still should be some sort of perfunctory exam so that everybody's ‑‑ you know, everybody's ‑‑ everybody's—  I think it's important to have a rule that says, you know, if you've been in business for 30 years, you shouldn't have to go off for eight months, but maybe a week so that everybody's on the same page on what's allowed and what the rules are.  Okay.  I have Councilmember Hawley and then Councilmember O'Brien.  After Mr. Lamb's statement, I'll keep it short because I think his path forward would be the best taken by council.  But I think it's really important to create an environment in the council chambers where people from any industry feel supported, feel that they're heard.  So I just want to thank the three speakers who have extra insight.  And I think it's really important to have that insight into that industry that we don't have for coming and speaking and giving that insight.  Because I think that moving forward when this ordinance does return to council, we'll have a much more informed idea of how to move forward without creating any erroneous barriers.  Councilmember O'Brien.  Yeah.  Thank you, Mayor.  So the overarching goal, of course, is a valid and a good one, which is to weed out, like I said, the bad actors, particularly those that are engaging in human rights.  Because for all of us in the community of wyoming for all of wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for wyoming for  the city of california is  also a travesty.  So maybe this needs to go I  know the city attorney mentioned  another public hearing maybe  this does need to go to ia to  vet out some of those details  and come back to council with a  finished product I think we'  re on the  right track there'  e just some details we need to  figure out.  yes.  I think we can just give  direction to the attorney and  have him bring back and tell  him the direction.  I want to defend a couple of  things.  First of all this was brought to  me about three years ago and it  was actually by a masseuse  sorry a massage therapy person  who was female who came to  the city of california and  she was at a meeting and she  was yelling at us and saying do  you know you'  re the only city around this  whole area that is not regulated  by this school.  And so that sent myself in  hearing what was happening and I  happen to live in an area where  I would see people coming and  going at midnight and 1 o'clock  in the morning in places that are  completely covered up and very  dark and obscure and I'  m sure none of the people in this  So that'  s where this came from.  It was actually somebody in the  that area and I brought this up  or it was council member  Tandon I'  m not sure which one of us did  quite a while back.  So that was kind of where this  came from.  So I would love to give  direction and speaking of being  assumed that we'  re bad actors I have to pay  somebody to come into my business  four times a year and test the  product that I have and pay a  little bit of money to test to  make sure I have no contaminants  in my product so I'  m assumed to be a bad  actor too as well.  So I think whether you'  re a politician or whatever your  business is I think there'  s some of that we always have  to prove unfortunately.  I would like to give recommendation  to the city attorney to whatever  amendments we would like to see  and just have him bring it back  and hopefully we can quick circuit  it and not have to do a whole  other round at internal affairs  and kill a whole bunch more times.  I would like to give  direction to the city attorney  to bring back whatever a waiver  would look like a permanent  waiver that wouldn'  t have to be.  I'  m going to hold on the hours I  don'  t particularly care but if  somebody else wants to talk  about hours we can.  I think that'  s the main concern I'  ve heard is to enable legitimate  business owners that do not have  the time nor energy nor I  think that'  s all of the time for  all of their months of  months of  months of  months of  months of  months of  months of  months of  of details we haven'  t heard from  three speakers there may be a  whole litany of things we need  to look at and at least consider  I suggest we do this correctly  and that'  s to vet this properly.  I understand what the  mayor'  s point is about trying to  streamline this but I agree with  councilman o'brien we want to get  this right.  I support taking it back to  internal affairs.  my question regarding that  is it seems like the main need  I'  m seeing is for more  engagement with the massage  therapists in our community and  hopefully we could bring them  into such an internal affairs  meeting but I'  m wondering if  maybe the alternative course  would be to somehow make more of  a focus group meeting with them  and bring this back to council if  we don'  t want to just bring it to  internal affairs.  internal affairs.  however we do that I would  agree we really need to hear from  those in the industry that'  s what I'  m getting at and I  don'  t think we have fully and I  think that'  s what we need to get to.  can we send it to internal  affairs and do it in one meeting?  I'  m fine with that.  whatever works to get us better  engagement.  I think we'  re really close on this but I  think when we'  re legislating it'  s worth taking the time to make  sure we'  re all  in for all of the  information.  for all of the  information.  for all of  for all of  for all of  for all of  for all of  for all of  notified.  And the second was  Council Member O'Brien? Yes.  Okay.  Council Member Goldstein? Aye.  Council Member Hawley? Yes.  Council Member O'Brien? Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek? Yes.  Council Member Winslow? Yes.  Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes.  Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Okay, next we're going to do some amazing things  with our municipal code, but we've got to take a quick break  so we will be right back.  ...  ...amending Title 10, 14, 16, 16R,  18R of the Chico Municipal  Code. Mr. Brendan  Bonney, Public Works,  Director of Engineering.  David Keene will be doing the presentation.  All right. Take it away, Dave.  I was wondering  why you had your church clothes on there, David,  so now I know.  Ready to impress.  Good evening, Council Members,  Vice Mayor Bennett and Mayor Reynolds.  My name is David Keene with the Public Works  Engineering Department, and tonight I will be presenting  Chico Municipal Code engineering updates.  So tonight  we will go over the background, the outreach  that was conducted. We will summarize the  updates, including stakeholder input,  the environmental review, and then we will  summarize the findings and next steps.  So the  previous updates to the engineering  section of the Municipal Code was in 2018,  so it's been seven years.  These updates are wide-ranging and comprehensive.  Their updates are related to regulatory  changes, council directives,  process enhancements, and long-term  sustainability of city infrastructure.  So  when considering these amendments, for the  most detailed version, of course, you can look at the  This is the direct text that will be adopted.  If not, if you want a little higher version, you can look at  the staff report, and then tonight will be the highest  level of summary.  Included in the staff report is a stakeholder comment log and  city responses.  We received over 70 comments from the public, and we  responded to each of those.  So tonight will be an introductory reading, we will  receive direction, and then we will come back in September  2nd for a final reading and adoption.  So for our outreach, we will be presenting the  So for our outreach, we will be presenting the recommendations,  for all of the community of all the utilities Chico builders association local engineering firms and developers. We received over 70 comments as I mentioned the comment log and I mentioned the comment log and responses are included as attachment B. In March we took these amendments these proposed amendments to the Chico utility coordination meeting which is a quarterly meeting between the city and the local utilities where we discuss projects and policy updates just like this. And then in June we took these to the planning commission which included a public notice and the planning commission adopted the  california adopted the proposed  changes with the exception to  remove the standard plan for  bicycle path gates which I will  talk about later. Here is the  titles we will go through and  run through them one by one.  Title 10 is our vehicles and  traffic title this was a council  directive so at the july 16th  meeting council provided a  directive for the director of  public works to assume internal  affairs committee authority for  traffic regulations related to  street intersections and yield  traffic signs. We didn't receive  any stakeholder input on this so  that one is easy. Title 14  streets and sidewalks the most  significant stakeholder input  we received was related to the  pavement cut moratorium this is  an industry standard practice  and what this is is that the  city prohibits cutting into new  roadways after they have been  newly constructed and that is to  ensure the long-term  sustainability of the city  roadways. The prohibition is for  five years after full  reconstruction or similar  maintenance three years after  director's directive for any  pavement with a pavement  condition index rating above 80.  Of course there is exceptions or  waivers water mains break when  they want things happen so we  have to have a way for that to  happen and we can allow that  when justified but has to be  approved by the public works  engineering director. So where  would these apply? This is a map  of the city that shows this is  a draft map of the city that  would show where the moratoriums  would apply as you can see it is  about a quarter of the city some  of the private developments that  have occurred city projects that  have occurred but it is a  significant portion of the city  roadways but not all of them.  If you do need to cut into the  road what would the exception  require? Currently when you cut  into a city road you are  required to pay back a foot and  a half on each side of the  trench and what that does is that  keeps the distance between the  cut and the sidewalk and the  trench to make sure that water  doesn't get into the trench and  make it fail. However what that  does occasionally you may notice  when you drive around when it is  raining if the water gets down  the cuts and can get under the  asphalt that is when potholes  occur. So what we are doing is  way of the road. This detail will  be included as a requirement and  there is actually four scenarios  here so I will go over one  scenario in the upper left and  they are all pretty much the  same. The dark black line the  vertical line there is an  example of a cut in the road and  as I mentioned typically you  would repair a foot and a half  on each side of that but the  updated standard would require  10 feet on each side and to the  center line of the road and what  this does is that increases the  distance that water would have  to travel to get under the  existing asphalt to make it pop  up in potholes so this would  reduce potholes and ensure  longevity. The other thing that  activity of the street. Moving  on, title 16 is our building and  construction and building  standards title. This one is a  regulatory update. We had to add  new definitions for the state's  urban level of flood protection.  We added grading as an activity  in which the floodplain standards  are applicable and inclusion of  flood hazard information as a  standard for subdivision  mapping. Title 18 R, design  criteria and improvement  standards. This is where  engineering primarily lives and  this is where we receive the  most stakeholder feedback. Of  all the four standards we have  The feedback we received we  broke it down into the four  most highlighted sections that  we received those comments.  Traffic impact study requirement  for developments generating 50  or more net new peak hour trips.  A requirement for non-gravity  utilities as conduits to be  installed with a minimum depth  of three feet from surface grade  to top of pipe. That is  conduits, gas, anything that is  non-gravity, other so basically  sewer and storm drainage,  anything other than those. And  then including a roadway minimum  structural section of three inch  A.C. which is asphalted  minimum structural section of  three inch A.C. like paving  blacktop over eight inches of A.B.  aggregate base that is gravel.  And then we updated and made  additions to our standard plans.  Seven years of updates of  inspectors making comments on  those, local engineering firms  giving us comments so those are  wide ranging as well. So I will  go through these one by one so  we can provide a response. The  traffic impact study requirement  for developments generating 50  or more net new peak hour trips  this is approximately a 50 unit  subdivision. So it is not a  small subdivision this is  something large. Here is some  other information. The  infrastructure. This is  subdivision. So it is not a  something large. Here is some  other agencies you can see. So  we are within the realm of what  other agencies do. An important  thing to note about this is that  just because it is in the  municipal code doesn't mean it  is black and white and we have  to apply it every single time.  There is discretion and we  routinely apply that to these  developments. Cumulative impacts  of subdivisions, area where we  know developments can occur is  something that we would look at  for enforcing this. And in  addition, this is something that  the city receives consistent  feedback from the neighborhood  about. As I said earlier,  that is doing this. If the new  subdivision comes in, there is  too much traffic. So what this  would do is it would protect  both the city and the developer.  If the city can say the  developer conducted the traffic  impact study and we know the  analysis, that is our side and  the developer can say hey, the  city made me do this, there is  not an impact and it has been  mitigated. So it works for both  sides.  Another input that we require  is its requirement or more  feedback we received as the  non-gravity utilities to be  installed with a minimum depth  of three feet. And so I want to  go through this diagram to make  sure you understand what  explain why we do that.  Typically when you  reconstruct a road, the old  school way, you go in and dig it  out and you off-haul it and take  it somewhere and bring in  complete new asphalt and  complete new gravel. More  modern practice is what is  called full depth reclamation  with cement, FDRC. And what  that is, I have this diagram  here. You have this big machine  with a milling drum. And it  goes along and it rides up the  existing pavement and asphalt  and it mixes it with cement and  water, places it down into a  really strong base. You come  back and you just put full  a fresh asphalt on top of that  this is a recycling product it'  s  much more efficient and it  provides long-term  sustainability for the  infrastructure however it can go  18 to 24 inches deep. There are  several requirements both from  the manufacturer and from a  safety perspective that we have  a one foot clearance to those  utilities we don'  t want to be close to a gas  main when this thing is  spinning it'  s got diamond blades  and there could be cobble that  could cause those gas mains to  break and cause issues like  that. In addition the  manufacturer and the operators  of this equipment they don'  t want to damage their  equipment as well so it goes on  both sides. Next was the roadway  minimum structural section of  3 inch AC over 8 inch AB so I  included the little diagram  there so you can see the asphalt  on top the gray is the aggregate  base and then the sand or the  tan color would be the sub base  and so the intent of this  requirement is to provide a  minimum design life of 20 years  this is long-term sustainability  of our long-term sustainability  of city infrastructure so when  these subdivisions are  when these new subdivisions go  in and when new roads are built  we don'  t want to come back there for a  long time but we have limited  funding to do that and so we  want these things to last. The  city has been implementing this  requirement for over a decade  this putting it in the municipal  code just memorializes that  practice. And then lastly as I  mentioned if we do accept a  lesser design standard while  there may be short-term savings  this puts a burden on future  users and we may not be able to  replace that road in a timely  was wide ranging is the updates  to our standard plans all of our  standard plans got updates we  included new landscape plans we  have standard street light plans  and so I wanted to go through  the bicycle maze gates and  address the comments the  planning commission had. At the  planning commission we received  really good feedback from the  cycling community on their  opposition to bicycle maze gates  there is another term they use  for the bicycle path gates. After  that meeting we went out and did  site visits with cyclists we  have them in the inventory is  there is no standard every  bicycle path gates that is out  there is different. One thing to  recognize about standard plans is  we don't require them without  looking it'  s not a black and white  thing there is site  constraints some of them are  different it is a basis but it'  s not something we just require  with a blanket statement. Part of  the input we received was to get  rid of the maze gates and only  have the baller detail however  the city'  s experienced litigation and  significant injuries from  bollards as well. These devices  need to function for two primary  purposes that is slowing cyclists  down when they are on a bike path  and entering a street with cars  but also keeping cars out of the  bike path. One of the suggestions  from the planning commission was  to allow flexible bollards and we  included that in there but there  would be limited opportunity to  apply that however we did  increase the height from 29 to 36  inches to increase visibility and  that'  s for the bollards. For the  bicycle path gates based on feedback from the  community for all of the ! for longer bikes with trailers and recumbent bikes like that. We also included a requirement for strategically placed rip rap occasionally just a single boulder strategically placed       they can keep cars off the path and we added retro reflective tape on the gates themselves and one of the key components of the bicycle path gates standard plan is that it requires director approval. There'  After all of the  After all of the  After all of the  the district of 120 if they do  come across our desk it'  s not  approved on a staff level it has  to go all the way up to the  director so it won'  t be applied all around town  without somebody asking and  getting director approval. Part  of the amendments to the  municipal code require we do a  sequel environmental review  since these do not propose any  construction demolition or any  activity that could cause a  significant effect on the  environment they are exempt  which is great. Another finding  we have to make is that these  amendments are consistent with  the general plan in which they  are and that the amendments are  also consistent with the other  applicable provisions of these  regulations which they are. So  tonight this is an introductory  reading you have the red line  versions those are the  comprehensive updates we'  re looking for direction or any  guidance that you have on the  proposed amendment and then what  we'  ll do is come back on  September 2nd and we'  ll look at the  amendments and the final reading  and we'  ll look to adopt these  amendments. I'  m happy to answer any  questions.  any questions?  council member van overbeek  and council member  graham.  great presentation mr.  keene thank you for your  brevity. There'  s a lot of work that went into  this a lot of work and I went  through some of it and some of  it are just things updates  things we need to do. So my  concern Mr. Winslow and I spent  eight glorious months on the  in the ad hoc community  development committee for months  in the ad hoc community  in the ad hoc community  community of community  development committee for months  in the ad hoc community of  community of community  of community of community  of community of community  of community  of community  and going from 100 to 50 car  trips a day to require a traffic  study that adds cost and  changing the requirements for  the base on street lamps I'  never seen a street lamp falling  down in chico I'  m not sure why we  need to do that whoever buys the  house in that subdivision is  going to pay extra for that I'  d like to understand which of  these elements increase cost and  to the extent you can estimate  that so we can discuss whether or  not there'  s really value add I get  increasing the requiring three  inches of asphalt so the roads  last longer and for less  maintenance that makes complete  sense but I'  d like to be able to  discuss these things discreetly in  some form and maybe that'  s internal affairs.  thank you for your work.  thank you for your work.  quick clarification you  mentioned something would be  finally approved by the director  was that for all maze gates or  was that what in that context?  that'  s correct in the rare  situation we have a new bicycle  path gate that could potentially  be installed a designer would  propose that whether that'  s an in-house  designer or external consultant  but that wouldn'  t be approved until it got ran  inventory is very complicated  there'  s curves and  site distance and many things  that go into these sometimes a  bollard is applicable and a bike  gate is applicable but the goal  is to keep cars out and slow  cyclists down before they enter a  busy roadway.  I had one quick question I  think it was under 14 where you'  re going from a foot and a half  on each side of that to 10 feet.  Who primarily would be doing  this is this like pg&e or  calwater or somebody going  underground or is this just any  repair that happens?  the goal of this is to get  ahead of large replacements so  pg&e replacements of lines  calwater replacements of lines  that'  s the primary goal of this  there'  s always going to be independent  contractors that need to do this  for a variety of reasons but the  goal is to get ahead of that so  when we replace a sewer main we  install new laterals up to the  property line so we can avoid this  but water mains break things like  that happen so if we can get ahead  of it then this won'  t happen but if it does we want  to make sure that brand new road  still gets that full 20 year life  span.  I guess in a way I was coming  back to what council member van  overbeck said one foot and a half  to 10 feet that'  s a big difference so I can  only imagine the added cost and  the fact that all of that is  for for for for for for for  for for for for for for for for  for for for for for for for for  for for for for for for for for  for for for for for for for for  for for for for for for for for  for for for for for for for for  for for for for for for for for  for for for for for for for for  for for for for for for for for  until you get a smoother finished  product and get complete  compaction so you'  re reducing the  potential for settlement water  intrusion that leads to hydraulic  pressure leading to potholes.  now we know why you'  re the engineer  director thank you for explaining  that makes sense.  something I want to add  onto that is that we public  utilities they have a lot of  rights to operate in the city  and not have to ask us for  permission for things so  sometimes they'  re doing things we  would prefer they didn'  t do and this is a way to  give us more power or at least  incentivize them to work more  with our road replacement  schedule to save on those costs  for cutting when we have a fresh  road.  one more thing to add to  that is as david mentioned we  have quarterly utility meetings  with all the major utilities  and so we'  re regularly giving them  advance notice of upcoming  projects.  re not putting them in  position where we'  re paving a new roadway  and they didn'  t have the ability to plan  for it.  so we usually give them  multiple years of advance heads  up that we'  re going to be working  on these segments of roadway  and they'  ve been great about  prioritizing their replacement  underground utility stuff ahead  of our projects.  so this is a pet peeve of  mine we have these beautiful  roads you'  re doing a great job  repaving what have you and then  we have someone I'  m not going to name  who because I'  this is probably a number of  different people who do this  they cut these trenches and  they do a really poor job of  repairing them.  and while that may be quick and  expedient and we'  re not trying to  make things difficult for  people who do business in the  city of chico but we cannot  have our roads degraded by  these trenches and you can just  drive down west sack from 32  west and see what I'  m talking about it'  s horrible it'  s horrendous and that'  s not fair to our  community.  there should be standards to  put it back as you found it  that'  s an old adage we'  ve had growing up put it  back as you found it.  I think these particular efforts  and updates do just that so  thank you.  but I do also agree with I  think two of my council members  that this probably needs to be  vetted a little bit some areas  of this that need to be cleaned  up and from that standpoint  maybe it can go back to ia for  those details but the over again  arching efforts that we'  s a great effort I  strongly support.  vice mayor bennett.  I'  m going to have some  suggestions and comments after  the public hearing so I just  want to let you know that now.  okay.  all right.  anybody else?  good speakers?  how many speakers do we have?  we have three.  all right.  three minutes each.  okay.  and I'  ll call the first two  and by kirk kaufman followed by  keith doglio.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  we'  re taking a break.  s see.  why is that?  hold on one second let me.  hi.  so I'  ve talked to you guys about  maize gates before but I'  m going to talk a little more  about them.  so the changes to what you'  re getting now are an  improvement over what the  planning commission got but they  don'  t they still don'  t really  overcome the  align with the intentions of the  planning commission which is to  use bicycle friendly barriers  whenever possible.  so one thing that was new that  is a real problem is the  boulders.  putting boulders next to a bike  path that is frighteningly  dangerous.  there'  s one place in town where  they'  re already there.  it'  s where the bridge across  little chico creek connects with  20th street park.  there'  s these big sharp boulders on  the side of the bike path.  and there'  s a tight curve.  it'  s just really dangerous for a  bicyclist.  it'  s much more damaging to fall on  a boulder than to just fall on  asphalt.  so I don'  t think boulders should be used  at all.  they'  re also hard to see.  especially in lowland  low light conditions.  and they'  d be hard to see for cars  also.  so I don'  t see how they would help at  all.  so please don'  t have boulders on the  sides of bike paths.  the other thing is that I would  like to see in the rules that  any kind of rigid barrier whether  it be a bollard or a maze gate  that that be a last resort.  that that be put in only if  there'  s documented evidence that cars  have been encroaching on the bike  path or that bicyclists have been  shooting out and getting hit by  cars.  they should be last resorts not  a preventative measure ahead of  time.  so there'  s been studies done as to the  effect of rigid bollards on  bicyclists.  and in the last resort there'  s been a lot of evidence that  we already know in town we had  a very prominent bicycle advocate  Ed McLaughlin essentially killed  by one of those.  they should be a last resort.  and maze gates are even worse.  because in addition to that being  a rigid object that you can get  hurt hitting you also have a very  tricky maneuver that you have to  make to get around it.  so and another thing I would like  to see added is that there'  s a lot of evidence that  because if there are bollards or  maze gates that there'  d be a clearance of six feet  for bicyclists to get through.  that'  s what noctow recommends.  so any less than that is not  sufficient.  thank you very much.  thank you.  keith doglia followed by richard  roth.  thank you.  good evening.  I'  m keith doglia.  I'  m here to represent the chico  builders association tonight.  to start with we just wanted to  thank the city and staff for  letting us have input on the  updates.  it'  s been great.  everyone has been welcoming and  listening to us.  we submitted a letter with our  concerns and some suggestions.  I want to make sure everybody has  seen it.  if you haven'  t let me know.  and then I guess my message  tonight is simple really.  we'  re concerned about as people  have been talking about here  costs.  the costs of housing and housing  availability for everybody.  some of these proposed updates  will have been made available  increased costs and we'  re requesting some thoughtful  consideration of our requests.  any questions?  thank you.  richard roth is our last speaker.  hi.  thank you for your service.  I want to talk about maize gates,  bauder's, rocks and hazards.  the rocks, we need shoulders for  our bike paths.  if something is blocked in the  bike path there needs to be a  way that bicyclists can pull off  or around those hazards.  the rocks are hazardous where  they'  re located now.  they'  re already full of trash.  how do you clean it out of all  the cavities and rocks?  from a maintenance standard I  don't understand them.  there's hazard fencing along  annie's glen.  it's right next to that asphalt  held up by t posts.  metal t posts with sharp edges  right next to the path.  it's a very dangerous area.  it's a very dangerous area.  the bollards, I got to witness  a person hitting one of those.  he was following his friend  behind him.  it's right at the entrance of  fourth street into the park.  his friend turned left and he  followed, hit that bollard right  on, ended up, messed up his  bike.  his arm was all scraped up and  bloody.  he didn't know what he hit until  he hit the ground and got up.  I've got some pictures of that.  but it was a short one.  36 inches.  I think you need something  that's high enough that the  rider in front of you can see  it coming.  his, it completely took him  back.  I'm not sure if he was  those are my three main things.  and the hazard fencing along  those pathways with no shoulder  are a hazard themselves because  they're like a net ready to  catch things.  they've got holes in them like  this and they billow.  so people going by can snag  bike parts or body parts or  trailer parts and throw them  into the t posts.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  further comments from council?  council member wenzel?  i'm willing if you're free on  a monday we can look at this in  the web for all of the for like extensive analysis. We just want to review the cost of some of these things and whether we can achieve our desired goals without requiring quite as much.  web for all of the  web for all of the I think the discussion is really good. What's happened around the arrangement of these gates and the placement of the, call it riprap. I don't know that term much, but that's what they call it, riprap, the boulders. Yeah, I'm not inclined to agree. I got to say as far as like they should wait until we have a, you know, like a documented need. I think anywhere cars can go, they will go.  anywhere cars can go they will go it's just a matter of time somebody will decide to do it you  know if it's somebody's flip-flop getting stuck on the gas and their car ends up in the creek  like happened in may like it will happen the thing that really deters is physical barriers  and so i do think that's the value in that but i'm happy to continue some discussion  councilmember goldstein um i guess first i had a question so this ordinance it was modified based  on the planning commission comments right or is it what was presented to them uh we made some  modifications uh from what was presented um as david mentioned we especially on some of the bike  stuff we met with some folks that had expressed some concerns when met in the field we did some  inventory and so we tweaked some things after hearing some of that feedback before we brought  this item forward to you tonight just to reiterate too these are standard details so  um  you  i think what gets adopted like a standard is if or when we as engineers use our engineering  judgment to apply to the design of a project we'  re using that standard it'  s not necessarily are we going to use it or not it'  s if we elect to in a certain circumstance we'  re consistent in how we apply it.  of the 18 i believe we have i don'  t think there'  s any two that are the same so it kind of speaks to the need to have consistency with a standard detail.  okay.  thank you.  i really um liked the comment that we received from the chico safe streets coalition from  and biker kaufman that suggested that we have basically a prioritization of what bikeway barriers we put in um and so i would support this with standardizing using flexible bollards but with the note that where those aren'  t applicable and where we need to prevent vehicles more strongly that we move on to bollards and then potentially.  other barriers like maze gates or boulders.  councilmember holly.  yeah i think i read in the staff report that 20 of the 70 comments from um stakeholder groups were ultimately implemented into these different title amendments um and a lot of improvements are going to be made i'  m really excited about that but i do want to echo kind of the planning commission's concerns i know that they were followed up upon you guys did on foot go to school.  i think that is a really important point and i think that is something that we need to be thinking about as we move forward with our site visits and that'  s huge.  that says a lot to our commitment with public relations.  but i do have to kind of agree that we have these national standards that are provided to municipalities for a reason and i think that we should look to organizations like the national association of city transportation officials like the u.  s department of transportation.  i read straight from the office of planning environment and realties office that there is a lot of work to be done to make sure that we have a standard that is in place for the city.  national office from the u.  s department of transportation word for word physical barriers should never be a default treatment and should not be used unless there is a documented history of intrusion by unauthorized vehicles.  so there really is no way of preventing say a motorcycle going onto a bike path without preventing some forms of cyclists or mobility devices from also entering the bike path.  so i do think we need to have that formally in place.  i think for all of the months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months of months  discuss the date of the  requirements and  codification of certain issues  and I know you'  ve been working  with them they had some concerns  now that it'  s going to  internal affairs I'  m just going to wait until  it goes to internal affairs and  discuss it at that time rather  than bring it up now. Is that  okay with you?  if that'  s what the council decides  internal affairs is the place to  further discuss these obviously  that'  s the council will and we'  ll abide by that.  council member ben those issues  were addressed by staff and the  staff report directly I believe.  I'  ll just add real quick on the  two main items brought by the  chico billers association I think  the first one was the structural  section of three inches of asphalt  and eight inches of ab that'  s been a practice since I  have been here I don'  t know any road has been built  less than that as a standard so  we'  re simply memorializing  what'  s been in practice since I'  ve been here. In terms of cost  someone could argue the standard  was two inches of asphalt on  four inches of ab and you'  re going to something greater  than that that adds cost but  in practice it has been put in  practice. On the traffic impact  analysis we'  re working on developing a  streamlined way of doing it  again if you'  re at a 50 unit  subdivision that creates 50  units peak hour trips roughly  that gives us the ability to  analyze intersections. Again we'  re not going to apply it every  single situation if there'  s a development next to an  existing intersection that' s  already signalized there'  s no need to study that.  However if there'  s an intersection that'  s unsignalized but there'  possibility and it doesn'  t become a  taxpayer obligation to fund the  installation of a new traffic  signal at roughly 600 to 800  thousand dollars. We'  re trying to analyze those  things and have the ability to  do that when it'  s appropriate.  thank you.  this is what we ended up  talking about east avenue and  state of the state and because  it'  s not in our code we can'  t require that.  is this time sensitive do we  have time to send it to internal  affairs and bring it back?  we will implement the council  will.  we also love to take advice  from our staff.  I' m just making sure there'  s not something at the state or  some deadline we'  out of the list if we need to.  I have a lot of confidence in  your ability to do this in a  thoughtful way.  I think we have an obligation to  understand the cost impact that  doesn'  t mean we shouldn'  t do it.  3 inches of asphalt makes  complete sense but we need to  understand it. All I' m asking  for is we call out the things  that have cost impact and we have a conversation about whether the trade-off or worth it.  May I ask?  m just wondering if the utility issue of cutting into existing  roads is noncontroversial.  Is that one ordinance we can pass now and  discuss the other ones later?  Is that helpful?  we want to do this as a  poll.  There'  e 60 or 70 pieces to this.  if the intent is to go to internal  affairs and consider some things it  might be less confusing to take it as  a package.  I appreciate looking to find common ground  of getting some things through.  I think trying to pick and choose those  right now might be a little difficult.  If the council is going to send it to  internal affairs I think we can go have  that conversation and do our best to  get through that and bring it back.  Do I have a motion?  If there'  s no further discussion I  will make a motion to send it to internal  affairs for further vetting and discussion.  I second that.  This is the one on finance.  Just a second.  Because of all of the !  Councilmember wyll for wyll for wyll for  Consideration of the action taken on South Park Drive. I have a report from Miss Preston  Thank you. Thank you mayor in council  according to a PMP 1010  reconsideration of a former action can be considered by  One of the members of the prevailing side in this case councilmember van over back voted in favor of option 2 on South Park Drive  and at the last  At a meeting I believe it was July 8th. We've lost track of time with all of this time off  He  Has asked for it to come back and that was based on the last meeting  So anyway, that is what's before you you were provided with the original staff report  And I'll turn it over to councilmember van over back  Thank You miss Preston  So it's late and  I will make this  brief, so I advocated option 2 which was  separating bikes and pedestrians from cars I looked at  two pieces of  asphalt running parallel going to the same places and I thought that this was the thing to do and  The citizens of Chico did not agree in any way that this was a good idea  And so it's very hard to get a Dutch person  I'm half Dutch to change change their mind  And I realized I had this wrong  There's a there's a component of history and tradition about the way people use the park  I mean, it's one of the defining characteristics of the town. So we had a  community meeting  In Bidwell Park we had must have had 20 people there Mike O'Brien was there and help and helped  With that and had a number of meetings was very thoughtful people  and so  I'm a  very proud of the community and  Overwhelmingly what I heard and I think most of you have had had input on this matter  Was that option for which was leave what we've got alone and repave it  was  What people wanted and?  So  That that's my report at this point, I'd be happy to take I mean I got a lot of input  I sought out a lot of people  but I think that  That's the sentiment that I heard so people wanted option for  Does any council members have a question for mr. Van over back  Yeah, so I hear you about the like the input. I spoke a lot of people beforehand the  Concerns that I heard were more about like don't add a parking lot there  Which which we can establish wasn't really like part of the question there and and I hear these things about like tradition  And history like note when anybody will died  There's not a single car in Chico when?  She got old you'll understand that stuff better well  I think we get this sense you know that we can call anything history like what it is right now  We can say it's historical. I think the key to central experience of Chico is like going into Bidwell Park  but I don't see that like driving in your car when there's another road like in a  Small stone so even a very even you could always throw a stone just that far to it because they're not even that for real  Purpose yeah, and you already have to drive on this road and go back out Woodland like the traffic has to go in Woodland to  Get there, so I'm curious because I've heard the same comments  I think you've heard is there any actual reason you think that this is  Better for safety for enjoyment of the park or just that you've heard that there's a lot of public so I can't fault your logic  Because I had the same reasoning process when I came to that conclusion  But there's another reality which is  the subjective reality and how people feel about things and and  How they use the park in particular is the most intensively used part of the park that stretch of South Park Drive is maybe a?  Third of a mile long and then there's miles of other you know the Peterson in the rest of South Park  So and and I haven't heard that there have been problems  and so I  Think I got it wrong, and I support at this point option for  So I want to I want to hear from everybody and I just want to encourage them and you as you think before coming to  The vote like what what the real purpose of preserving cars on this stretch is and if it's just a sentimental thing you're worried about  things that will change and and also just  Understand some of the like the repercussions that could happen now could happen later  I mentioned before just back in May somebody drove their car into the creek it was an accident  But apparently there you know the flip-flop got stuck under the pedal I remember back in 2019 another car landing in one mile  I don't know if that was ever explained how that happened these kind of things happen  I was just recently traveling in some cities in East Asia  I was in Beijing when somebody had an argument their wife, and then they  Got mad and they drove into a group of schoolchildren and this sort of thing  I mean it's happened like by accident in San Francisco  A couple years back somebody drove into a bus stop killed four people  You know it was total accident just somebody that wasn't wasn't paying attention or something  We've had this happen like multiple times and just in the city of Vancouver just last couple years  And there's an inherent liability that comes with allowing vehicles access to places  And there's a reason why anywhere you go in the world you see these pedestrianized places places that people really want to enjoy these  Key to central places that make the community and people block out cars with physical barriers anywhere you go you see these metal bollards  You know we have our kind of creative bike gates  but we  people block cars out of these places because it's only a matter of time before something tragic happens because  Somebody with the vehicle that's a weapon of mass destruction in an instant and whether it's intentional or not  It happens the people who drive in our park  There are many good people who you know enjoy it and I understand that it's like they would like to preserve that experience  They have but there's also other people who may use their vehicles very differently and only takes one time for something  Sorry, don't we need to do comments before?  We do and you're on your second time talking so let can we take public calm in?  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Council member hat view.  I'll just add since we're talking about kind of questions for tom but also question for the public because we've heard at the previous hearings a public comment and from our emails a lot of heartfelt concerns and I really empathize with that and I just want to remind folks if there's time in their comments to focus on like what aspects of the different proposals that we reviewed are important to you because I was a little confused about the  I think I was a little confused  last time by some people  supporting certain items or  certain plans but then topics that were actually included in multiple of the proposals and so I really want to hear about like what'  s important is it safety is it separating people from things like e-bikes is it which items should we focus on for improving safety and access in the park?  council member o'brien.  I will hold my comments until after public comments and then I will move on to the next item.  I will hold my comments until after public comments and then I will move on to the next item.  thank you.  I will hold my comments until after public comments and then I will move on to the next item.  thank you.  how many speakers do we have?  we have 17.  we will go two minutes.  all right.  I will call up the first two and by kirk kaufman followed by kirk mumford.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  That's it.  So Kirk Mumford and...  If you could go ahead and line up,  and then it'll be Nicole Nava.  I'll be next, so if you can line up in the middle,  we could go a little bit faster.  No.  Hello.  I argued the last time we dealt with this topic,  I argued for option four  because I just didn't see much of an issue.  I mean, as bad as it gets is today.  That was because the junior high started  and all the little kids were coming down South Park Drive  and doing that little swerve under the midwell thing  and then crossing the bridge by Morning Thunder.  Anyway, it was hell.  But, I mean, I could recognize  that it was all for the junior high.  was hell and that's the way it was.  It doesn't get any  worse than that.  I just didn't see why we needed  to do anything more than  maybe fix the parking lots.  That was Katie  Holly's suggestion.  That was because there was  an argument from Brendan or Eric or  somebody that it would  save money in the long run because  if we made impermeable  that we could save money in the long run.  That seemed like a reasonable  thing. Other than that, it was just  repay South Park Drive  and  keep it the same.  You also need to keep that little  line that  goes.  It starts around one mile  and it  redirects traffic.  It lets people know that  the riders are going to be coming  head on. I think  one mile collects them.  They turn off  to go under  Annie's Glen.  That's nice.  People get off  the thing.  They do the  underpass and then they  come up that little road and then  they do a left-hand turn.  Thank you, Kurt.  They don't cross.  Next year we nominate you for traffic control on the  first day of school.  It's Nicole Nava followed by Catherine Cottle.  Good evening again.  One quick correction.  Woodland is not the only way  into the park. East 4th  goes straight into the park and that is  where most people go in.  Then some do end up  going out if they go to one mile out the other way.  To me, you asked  about information.  The data doesn't support  doing other options other than 4.  The traffic report even  provided by the City of Chiefs,  Ego, does not support the need  to have such a drastic change.  Also, it would be  prudent to use the  taxpayers' money in  a way that makes the most sense,  which is repave  existing South Park Drive.  The aesthetics  would be upset. A lot of people do go there  to get calmed down mental time.  And so, throwing  two more openings  onto Woodland Avenue  is not really conducive to  the green space and the lovely feeling  you get on both sides as you enter  the historic gates and proceed the whole way.  I also don't agree  with the maze gates. I think that would be problematic.  You know, Chicoans  and even the tourists that come,  everyone's going at appropriate speeds  in there. And again, to address another issue,  yes, e-bikes and some  of the others are an issue.  I personally know someone who was very  injured recently  by an e-scooter rider.  Bless their...  both their hearts.  And those are the kind of things that we might  need to take a look at, right? And there's some things  you can do on the pavement itself to draw  better attention, maybe, about where people can  be placed, separate  from more aggressive  type traffic, if you will. But the  cars aren't really the problem, you guys.  The cars are not the problem.  And also, you heard from the vast majority  of Chicoans. It wasn't just  the neighborhood. So we need to acknowledge  that. You got letters. You got  lots of people showing up.  You saw it on social media.  People want number four. And I really  hope you listen to all the people. And I do  thank you for your reconsideration tonight.  Thank you.  Okay, so Catherine Cottle, followed by  Logan Underwood.  Can everybody hear me?  Okay.  As a person with mobility issues,  speaking for people with  mobility issues, it's not  practical to go through the park in anything,  but a car.  It's not practical for everyone to use  a bicycle. It's not practical for everyone  to walk. That's a fact.  And the older you get, and the more  you have mobility issues, the less practical  it becomes. Now, what can  be practical is put in speed  bumps. Put in speed  bumps that are so high that  people who have low  wheelbase vehicles  will be impacted  negatively.  I've  seen people who  bicycle through the park  responsibly, but there are people who bicycle  through the park irresponsibly.  There are people who, in all good,  walk through the park, they have their  music going, and they don't hear me  in a car. And sometimes it's  dangerous.  So, with all due respect to everyone's feelings,  half of that park right now  is already closed for  20 plus years.  Two cars. And it's  only bicycles and pedestrians  who can go on them.  And that's not the park.  So please, if you're concerned about the cars,  spend more of your time on that side of the park.  With all due respect.  And respect those of us who have mobility issues  and would like to continue to use the park.  Because it's reasonable for all of us to be able to access the park.  Regardless, I don't think Andy Bidwell said anything about anyone not using the park in the future.  Thank you for keeping this in mind. I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Logan Underwood, followed by Liz Griffin.  Hello.  Hi.  I am in favor of option two.  I think the accessibility in terms of parking spaces,  there are a lot of things that are not accessible.  Unchanged, largely, to my knowledge.  So you still have accessibility in that sense.  I think with the economics of a higher upfront cost with lower long-term maintenance costs,  tends to be kind of a good idea for like a nonprofit sort of organization.  Yeah.  Like a government.  And I think just having cars not on the same path as pedestrians and cyclists would kind of make it feel a bit nicer  as you come up from Annie's Glen onto the road.  You know, you always have to, you know, be just looking back.  And like, you know, sometimes it's like you can actually just be like, oh, car speeding.  But, you know, I think it would be nice to have also no maze gates  and also maintain the right of way for pedestrians and cyclists on the existing intersections.  Maybe bollards.  I know that's not popular, but, yeah, thank you.  Thank you.  Liz Griffin.  Okay.  I don't know why there was any discussion about confusion about the last meeting, which all of us attended,  because every single person just about was in favor of a new, you know,  number four.  And the reasons were really very clear.  There has been no studies.  There have been no studies done that say we need to convert this to no automobiles in the park.  There have been no major accidents.  I've lived next to the park for 39 years, and anything you've referenced I have never heard of or experienced.  And I don't know what you're talking about.  Cars and bikes can coexist.  They always have.  We don't need to have a separate place for the bikes.  We can coexist with the cars.  There's never been any problem having the pedestrians on one side with signage seems to work.  The changes that were made on Peterson Drive have been wonderful.  That just needs to be done.  We need to be replicated.  Why are we making this such a difficult thing?  You've got most of the community that is in favor of this, and I don't know why certain people are ignoring that all these people have shown up and care about it,  have gone to meetings, have met in the park.  I'm not sure why the counselors, other counselors have not shown up and gone to the park and met with us,  especially people who are supposed to be representing us.  I'm very unclear about that.  And we don't have to stick to plan four or plan two.  You can combine different plans.  We can take the parking lots and use, get those redone and also complete totally plan number four.  So thank you.  Please consider that.  Thank you.  Richard Roth followed by Cynthia Perrine.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I just want to say I approve of having speed limits for bicyclists and e-bikes and cars if they're in that part of the park.  I think posting speed limits would be, and then enforcing them from time to time would be good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Cynthia Perrine followed by Saul Quintero.  Thank you, council and all of staff.  I just first want to recognize significant recent improvements for bike safety, especially the pavement markings on the Esplanade and other places.  Been watching the awareness build of our citizens as they saw green splotches appear and kind of wonder what was that all about.  And now those are really helping direct traffic.  So we heard from a lot of other people.  I want to amplify some of that, what Catherine said and other speakers.  I think a lot of this, the conversation is about the fact that we're not going to be able to get to the park.  We're going to be able to get to the park.  And I think the biggest thing that we're going to be able to do is just direct and organize the traffic patterns.  And so when this came up before, I mentioned in my comments that wherever you enter the park, you know, you might not be at the entrance to the park.  There's so many different entrances to the park.  And my mom was injured in the 80s riding a bike, not by a car, but she was injured by a big wheel.  And it's because that kid on a big wheel was going the wrong way.  And she came around a corner and hit it.  So a bike had nothing to do with it.  And so I just think it's so much more about education, outreach, signage, and especially the kind of signage that can't be knocked over by a car.  Those green stripes are so just well received.  So I would recommend that option four be circulated again to actually show the visual of that thermoplastic striping.  I think a lot of people just didn't really know what that meant when it was first presented.  But now that residents are a little bit more familiar with them because of the recent improvements,  I think it's really important that we get that information out there.  So they might take it a little bit better, understand how that can, without an actual barrier physically, really direct effectively traffic.  So thank you so much for your consideration.  And I'm very much in favor of not putting any object in the middle of a roadway that people are driving in.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Saul Quintero, followed by Matt Tennis.  Good evening.  So I do not support option four.  Just wanted to make that clear.  I hope that the city will have a better way of doing it.  I think that any sort of decision that is made or any options or designs that are chosen or selected, I really hope that they prioritize people.  I'm interested in seeing the park sort of transform in that sort of south park drive area in a way that will prioritize people, not vehicles.  I live in that neighborhood directly where that entrance is located.  And I also happen to work from home.  So outside of that space, I spend a lot of time in the park.  And I, yeah, again, I'm interested in seeing any option that is selected or how we move forward with designs that will prioritize the people and open up the space for the community.  Yeah.  Not parks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Matt Tennis, followed by Mike Schutte.  Thank you all so much for reconsidering this.  Council Member Wenzel, I want to address what you, the challenge, I guess, that you threw out to talk about specifics.  And I think that, too, I think that we have to be more careful.  I think that in a phrase, I would say nasty cross traffic is the thing about option two that I have a problem with.  You know, right now, people enter the park in one of a couple of places.  And the traffic flows one direction, bikes, cars, you know, pedestrians, pretty much in harmony, in my opinion.  With option two, you've got these two extra driveways put in onto Woodland Avenue.  Just all kinds of cross traffic, maze gates, and that flow is just completely interrupted.  I mean, honestly, I don't know who came up with this, guys.  But, I mean, I just, when I saw those driveways, I thought who in the world would come up with this?  I think also having the driveways so far east away from their current, the current entrances, will induce traffic to, there's a really nasty, nasty, nasty traffic.  Because of all of the traffic in the park.  Because of all of the traffic in the park.  Because of all of the traffic in the park.  Because of all of the traffic in the park. People pull heading north and it's offset by just maybe like, I don't know, 20, 30 feet. And many, many, many, many people make this illegal right turn. And I think that having those entrances up there to the baseball field in Capre Acres is gonna induce a lot of traffic coming from the east side of town to make that illegal turn.  town to make that illegal turn.  I think that's a problem.  I think  the light touch presented in option  four is really the way to go.  Thank you.  That was my...  I apologize.  I had Matt Tennis up there.  Now it's Mike Schuette.  Schuette.  Good evening.  I wanted to thank the council for  reconsidering this  decision.  My name is Mike Schuette.  My wife is  Laura Berry. We live on the  corner directly across  from Sycamore Field.  Cars coming from Linden  will come  to the left of our house.  They'll cross and go down  a part of a block and then have to  turn right fairly  quickly, but not  so quickly that it's  you know,  going to be a big deal.  The  we live in  a house  formerly known as the  Compton House.  It's built in 1930.  The  selection of options  for the  The  for the palm  for the palm  for the  for the  for the was not, you know, not really appropriate.  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  for  yeah and the the plan would be yeah the the cars coming from the from Linden  would have to turn you know facing a large tree it's beautiful it's comes it  comes across from the left and then they come to the right and they go up Linden  so I really appreciate the the willingness of the council to to  reconsider option four thank you thank you  Jeff Glatz followed by Julian Zenner and I don't see Jeff so Julian his inner  followed by Denise Hardy good evening City Council members and staff I wanted  to thank you very much for reconsidering this it's a wonderful example of  listening to the council and the city council and the city council and the  community for all of their community for all of their  for all of their community for all of their community for all of their community  for all of their community for all of their community for all of their community  for all of their community for all of their community for all of their community  for all of their community for all of their community for all of their community  for all of their community for all of their community for all of their community  for all of their community for all of their community for all of their community  for all of their community for all of their community for all of their community  for all of their community for all of their community for all of their community  for all of their community for all of their community for all of their community  it's a wonderful experience  I just want to  support  the letters  that Amber Kaufman  has sent to you  and  I'm  and very much  in regards to the maize gates  and if they were to make an appearance  hopefully  the overlap would be  minimal and the distance between them  would be large  so you wouldn't have to zig-zag  you could just make a gentle  curve  it's much safer  and as far as having space on  the sides of  a bike path in general  it's really important people  stop for a variety of reasons  checking  mechanically  and  or their phone  and  if there are  problems with not having  an area  that would be problematic  so  I  want to thank you for your  serious  consideration of  option four as  a basis and thank you  thank you  Denise Hardy followed by Portia Cerruti  and the other two  thank you for reconsidering the options  that you were considering earlier  I am in favor of option four  I am a long-term resident of Woodland Avenue  and the traffic as my neighbor Matt Tennis pointed out  with this idea of adding two new entrances  one off Linden  Linden is a bit of a mess already  and then as Matt pointed out  the traffic is a bit of a mess already  the difficulty of coming over across 8th  through Linden to the park  would be problematic  and Mr. Winslow's concern about  potential liability issues in the park  of perhaps somebody being hurt  or injured by a vehicle  I think the increased traffic  on Woodland Avenue  if the park road is closed  would cause more trouble  more problems  in that regard potentially  the Woodland Avenue is actually  a heavily traveled road  and as somebody  who's been looking out my  front window for 26 years  I see  a lot  of activity that maybe not  everybody who doesn't live right there at the park  sees particularly  at the start of the day  people take the shortcut off 8th  and at the end  of the day  there's a lot of traffic  up and down Woodland  Woodland has a bit of a problem  with some potholes  hopefully that'll be mended  with this new mending of roads  that's happening  so I would please request  that you consider the repaving  with speed bumps  with better signage  for the one way direction  cars do go the wrong way  up and down South Park  and that  um !  there's some better signage regarding speed limit  in the park  thank you  thank you  thank you  Portia Cerruti  followed by Dean Fairbanks  good evening  council members  thank you all for serving  those that I agree with  and those that I don't  I appreciate it  I'm a park watch volunteer  and I've also been a state park volunteer  so I take um  safety and public use of facilities seriously  I live by the park  and I have used it for over 20 years with my kids  and I haven't had any issues  while on bikes  we've had other issues  but traversing along South Park Drive is not one of them  the main point that I want to make tonight  I haven't actually heard in the chambers before  we did bring it up  when we had a community meeting  with the council members who attended  which I appreciate  and the thing that I want to point out  is that there is already an existing bike path  from Annie Glen  straight through to highway 99  when you enter South Park Drive  it's bifurcated  and there's um  marks on the road  to differentiate it  before you get to the first entrance parking lot  there is a separated lane  for the bikes to turn left on  the bikes can then go down  on the side of that road  and then follow a bike path  along one mile  next to caper acres  and it comes out at highway 99  that bike path is not in good repair  if we're concerned about bike safety  we need to fix and repair  the existing bike paths that we have  it's narrow  the edges are crumbling  and it could be made much more useful  to the people who do use it  when we had our meeting  there were more people that were using that bike path  on bike paths  than there were on South Park Drive  that counted for that hour and a half  so I don't know if a survey has been done  by the city council to look at this  but that is what needs to be repaired  thank you  thank you  Dean Fairbanks followed by Bruce Burke  good evening council staff  I come wearing two hats  one I am a resident in that neighborhood  actually I'm a quarterback  I'm in the corner of Linden and 7th  so I get to see the NASCAR every morning  between 8th and down to Woodland  but also my other hat is  I'm a planning professor at Chico State  so I do a lot of planning stuff  one thing I want to talk about is a story  and it's about data  and the last time I was here  nobody had any data  but they tried to make a story  with four options  with no data to back up  and I'm like okay that's fine  there was a plan done  for caper acres back in 2015  that I was involved in both directly and indirectly  through a planning class at Chico State  we were given it by the parks commission  Chico planning was involved  and what the students found  and I know that report is available  with the city I know it's with Bidwell Park Commission  is with all the survey work they did  with all the people that came into Bidwell Park  that section what we're talking about  right they had we had hundreds of surveys  we had both quantitative data  and narrative data  the one thing that the people from out of town said  they said they love going through those gates  that was the thing that drew them  so sense of place folks  we've already lost Bidwell Mansion  that's sad  we've lost Colliers  losing those gates  going through those gates  that sense of place that is part of Chico  that would be tragic  and it is one thing that the surveys showed  and the narrative showed  that people felt that that really was a sense of Chico for them  these are people coming from Redding  Yuba City you name it  with their kids to Cape Reikers  that report is available  they've been with the city since 2015  that's how Cape Reikers got to be rebuilt  why do we need to keep that piece moving with cars  you got to think about people beyond Chico as well  thank you  thank you our last speaker is Bruce Burke  I'll make this short  thank you for reappraising this issue  and moving forward hopefully  the  we  I live on Woodland Avenue  and support option 4  why  because the facts  the public likes it  number 2 statistics don't speak for changing it  number 2 statistics don't speak for changing it  number 3  the bidwell park planning and playground commission  did not recommend option 2  and I will leave it at that  thank you for your reconsideration  thank you  that's our last speaker  all right further questions by council  I'll start on this end this time  all right thank you very much  thank you mayor  so history matters sense of place matters in this community  I remember when this body took up the idea of putting a roundabout a traffic circle on the S18 staff remembers that quite well I would imagine  it did not go over very well  I can see some smiles from my fellow staff members  but look at what has happened transpired  with our creative staff  what is on the S18 now is terrific  it's fantastic  I think it should be award winning  quite frankly  if I have anything to do with it  I would nominate that for award  it's fantastic  but we figured out how to compromise  to make sure that we're keeping our students safe  but keeping our sense of place  the S18 is one of those places  so is bidwell park  so I did attend that meeting with council member van overbrink  I think he wanted me there  because they were ready to go  they were ready to toss him into the one mile pool  so I think I was his body guard  you were the body guard  and you know with the e coli situation  that would have been very very bad  so I'm glad that didn't happen  but actually I had a long standing relationship with that neighborhood  really a fantastic group  and I wanted to hear from them  because they're the ones that are impacted most  they live across the street  and we kind of forgot that in this whole process  the other thing that we wanted to do  and we need to remember  is that I think we were creating an answer  for a problem that did not exist  did not exist  the data did not show that we needed to make a change  and I'm going to say now  that I'm going to support option four  with the caveat that we look at the parking situation next year  let's look at traffic calming devices  whatever is safest for everyone  I understand the concern with bollards and some other things  I knew Ed McLaughlin  all those different dynamics  those are legitimate concerns  let's look at real traffic calming  that's going to be effective for our community  but let's take the light touch  like Matt Tennis mentioned  this does not need a bulldozer  it needs a shovel  let's take the light touch  let's pave those roads now  and then let's look at the parking lot situation  and then we can look at the parking lot situation next year  because I think there are some options  that we can look at  that will actually expand parking  not impact the quality of our park.  council member gozi.  thanks.  first I really appreciate the thoughtful comments  that we have had from all the speakers  we have heard from a lot of folks  who live by bidwell park  and transportation safety advocates  and outside of the council meeting  I have talked to a lot of community members  and safe streets coalition  and people that I bike with  about their thoughts on the park  and I really think that everyone in chico  has pretty common goals here  even if we have different ways  that we have talked about implementing them  we all want safety  we all want access to the park for everybody  and we all want to be able to showcase bidwell park  and that can look different  to different people  and although I see a future  that is prioritizing  bicyclists and pedestrians  and other users of transportation  over cars in this section of the park  I can see that there is  a building consensus  towards leaning towards option four  on this council  and I want to stress  that if that is the direction we are going  let' s make sure that we don' t lose an opportunity  to make the park roads safer  to add as some folks mentioned  speed bumps  signage  and other things that we can do  leverage a few smaller fixes  that we can use to help address  any issues that exist now  or maybe will exist  as more people move into our community  more cars, more e-bikes  more people are using the park  so I' m hoping that if we approve option four  that we can also include  traffic calming  and perhaps better signage  council member verment  noverbeck  what I' m persuaded we should do  but I also agree that  more speed limit signs  a little bit of traffic calming is appropriate  one of the speakers  I think miss griffin  pointed out  that there is an existing paved bike path  that runs behind caper acres  behind the ball fields  that already exists  but  I haven' t been on it for a year or so  but we need to look at what shape it' s in  and how we can  there' s a preexisting way for cyclists  and pedestrians to get away from cars  if they decide they want to do that  so I' m very much in support of number four  I also want to interject real quick  the maize gates issue  I meant to mention that in my comment  that when I talk about traffic calming  I' m mostly talking about the cars  and e-bikes  but I want to make sure that people on regular old bikes  or in wheelchairs or pushing strollers that they can get through easily  they are part of that  council member holly  so I initially still maintain my position  in supporting option two  I think that conversation  was steam rolled a little bit by this council  and I want to formally apologize  to the community for that  I don' t think we had a long enough discussion on it  but the reason I support it  is because  this council  collaboratively  identified long term financial viability  as a huge  priority for our budget  and I want to be consistent  and stick to that  this was identified in the staff report  as reducing long term maintenance costs  the most  and limiting vehicular access to any road  significantly reduces the cost  I mean without a doubt  across the board  and as the crown jewel park  of the city of chico  I want to make sure that the maintenance that we do  on south park drive  lasts as long as possible  for all of the community for option four, and honestly, I haven't been super convinced by those arguments. I do think that we can continue to have I do think that we can continue to have pedestrian and bicycle right of way on South Park Drive pedestrian and bicycle right of way on South Park Drive and improve accessibility for things like mobility devices along the way, but I promise I'm not trying to be difficult, honestly. The most interesting comment I heard was from Mr. Fairbanks,  the most interesting comment I  heard was from Mr. Fairbanks you  brought forth some hard data  that has altered my perception  of this project and I really  appreciate you coming forward  with that and I will be looking  into that. Again not trying to  be difficult but I'  m going  to maintain what I think is  right for the city.  thank you.  thank you Mr. Chair.  thank you Mr. Chair.  we had 16 people speak  previously all in favor of do  nothing make it simple number  four there was one person that  liked number two tonight we had  another 16 people talk all of  which supported number four  because it'  s been vetted a  the will of the people is  something we need to pay  attention to and overwhelmingly  the people want number four and  keep it simple and keep the  cost down. I think we need to  listen to the people we may have  our own ideas on how we should  make decisions but from time to  time I think we need to sit back  and take a calming device and  listen to the people and make a  good decision so I vote for number  four I will vote for number four.  council member wenzel.  I appreciate decisions where  everybody has our own unique  angle to share on it as I said  last time repeat we have a  really nice park and all the  options we get presented we still  have a really nice park and we  can disagree about what would be  nicer to me frankly I think  people love spaces where there  aren'  t cars when people think about  the idea of removing cars because  they'  re used to it I think there'  s a lot of fear that comes with  that something will be taken away  but those places where we don'  t have cars people love them they  are nicer for people to roll in  wheelchairs when there'  s not cars out there you keep it  smooth that way it'  s much better for everybody.  So there'  s a number of reasons why I  maintain what I think is the best  option and not without the  complications and Mr. Tenn  has brought up there'  make sure that we have a new  intersection it'  s removing one  intersection entrance and adding  two there'  s one additional one on  woodland and the other one is  relocated so somebody gets it  where somebody else doesn'  t have one in front of their  house but what I'  m hearing is there would be  traffic impacts on woodland as I  noted and there'  s confusion about this every  car that drives on south park  drive has to exit woodland it'  s a one way if your truck could  forward the creek you could exit  the creek and that traffic is  already there.  What I'  m hearing is that the traffic  impacts would be in front of the  houses so the solution is to put  it into the park or keep it into  the park because we'  re already used to that.  I think as much as woodland is a  beautiful street and beautiful  houses the best thing about  living there just like the best  thing about having a beautiful  park for all of us is the time and  space in the park so I think that'  s what we should focus on making  able to get around and be rigid  about that and I don'  t see this there'  s no overriding consideration  for me and the gate is really nice  you can still pass through the  gate even if you'  re not in the car.  I think people would find that  as a new and newly enriched  experience we'  re talking about downtown  revitalization and having a bike  path coming straight from downtown  into the park that way and I think  it would be a unique experience that  we could have.  There was a decision a few years  back I think you were on the council  then it was like 2019 or early 2020  when there'  s a recommendation to close down  upper park road to cars and it was  kind of like a more of a maintenance  thing as I recall the discussion that  it'  s hard to maintain that road with  cars going out there but because of  the sentimentality I remember mayor  Schwab she was a council member at  the time talking about we need to  people really have this experience of  driving out at upper park and that'  s really good.  possibility of a park fire.  This is the kind of liability that  is there when you allow cars to be  in a place.  We'  ve discussed fire as an issue in  lower park and it remains an issue  and I think allowing cars to be  there unmitigated is the biggest  vulnerability we have for the park  and that'  s what we'  d be allowing to happen with  this.  Madam mayor are you ready for a  motion?  I was letting everybody speak.  I'  m not going to speak.  m not going to speak.  Pretty much everything is going to  be said.  All I was going to add is I would  recommend if we are going to take  action tonight and if we are going to  do something towards number four maybe  we do have it brought back to us by  staff with some of the recommendations  so we aren'  t double duty and make sure the signs  and the safety and the slowing measures  and all that is all taken care of all  at once and maybe take action on the  next one.  I don'  t know.  I wrote down Liz I think it'  s Griffin I'  m sorry.  That we could combine some of these  things and we could possibly pave leave  it the way it is and take care of some  parking lots and maybe a bike path.  That was the only thing I was going to  say is can we have something brought  back to us as a company.  this is the third meeting we'  ve talked about this and two of them  are my fault.  I want to make a motion to be  moved to the board meeting.  I want to thank Mr. Fairbanks for  your comment about driving through the  gates.  Normally I park up by Sycamore no I'  m sorry.  By the deer pens there is a parking  or whatever it'  s too late.  Anyway normally I park there and walk  but I had the experience of driving  through the gates the other day and it  really is something just magical like  okay I'  m here now.  But I think it'  But at any rate I want to make a  motion that we accept option number  four that we trust the staff to come  back with the appropriate modifications  for traffic calming and that we also  pave the parking lots particularly  caper acres and the ball fields.  They'  re potholed.  I was watching a young lady with a  stroller and trying to get through the  gravel and if anybody is handicapped has  a wheelchair.  I like to do number four but I want  to pave those two parking lots.  can we confirm the cost of those  the paving of the parking lots?  they'  d have to go look at that.  what is that?  I would just caution we don'  t know what the costs are if we  have the budget to perform that aspect.  The intent would be when we put the  project out to bid we can have that as  an additive item to see if it fits  within the budget depending on the  on bid prices.  With this coming back to council we  have paused over the last month plus  moving forward with the design not  knowing what was going to move forward.  That doesn'  t mean tomorrow we'  re going to start back on the  design.  The team doing the design is now on  other projects.  Time is of the essence.  It'  s August 19.  We need to bid our projects early in  the winter season in order to get  them out to bid.  spring.  We'  re getting more expensive  pricing and potentially not doing  the project next year.  I want to caution timing wise there'  s still a lot of work to do on the  engineering design side to put the  plans and specifications and do all  the things we have to do.  do we have a ballpark figure on  the parking lots?  I believe it was a few hundred  thousand dollars when all said and  done but don'  t have specific numbers.  Would it be more helpful to just  say do a design that has these things?  I think it'  Do you need to come back to us?  keep in mind we'  re not asking for design level  details.  We'  re asking for what is the intended  use.  Every project we do we have  engineered plans that get put out  and we get into the details and all  the weeds.  What we'  re looking for council  direction on is the use of that  space and how you would like to  proceed as that'  s not necessarily an engineering  function.  It'  s a community decision on how  the park is going to be used.  The hope would be to move forward  with option four it sounds like if  that'  s the council direction and then  let our team go to work and get the  plans put together so we can get it  out to bid.  can we make a friendly amendment  that we move forward immediately with  option four to include the traffic  calming ideas and then let'  s look at the parking lot  situation when they'  ve had a time to look at that  and look at our options and carry  that as a second item.  Are you okay with that?  have those be optional?  Yes.  If the budget allows that?  Yes.  If the budget allows that.  I'  m all for that.  I want to make sure the budget  allows it.  Absolutely.  I'  m going to second that motion  that tom made with those friendly  amendments.  All right.  We'  ve got a motion and a  second.  Is it too much to add any  stipulations against having maze  gates in the path of the  bicycles?  There are no maze gates  currently so there wouldn'  t be maze gates.  Good point.  Those were based on that  situation and creating those new  conflict points.  I'  m going to second that motion.  And they'  were conceptual in nature so  we'  were going to perform that  technical analysis once we have  the direction.  Council Member Goldstein?  Yes.  Council Member  Hawley?  No.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  No.  Vice Mayor Bennett?  Yes.  Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Council Member  wymer?  Aye.  Council Member  wymer?  Aye.  Council Member  Council Member  wymer?  Council Member  wymer?  Aye.  Council Member  Council Member  Council Member  wymer?  wymer?  Council Member  wymer?  Aye.  Council Member  wymer?  Council Member  wymer?  members of the committee I know  it'  s late but I have a brief  presentation to walk us through  this update. This item was given  staff direction back in March I  believe council member o'brien  brought this forward to start to  have discussions with card staff  on the potential deed and  conveyance of several of our  and the cost of our parks to  layer in a more intensive use as  cards recreational programming  would do. Quick overview we'  re going to touch  briefly on a background and  timeline potential fiscal impacts  analyzing what city'  s current costs are to  maintain those facilities versus  what cards estimated costs would  be. Existing cooperative framework  we have a current mou with card  that gives us the framework to do  proposal to include a property  deed restrictions for consideration  that came up we found after the  staff report submittals we want  to touch on those real quick  regarding children'  s park. Further  analysis and we will land on a  conclusion to move forward.  Again background March 18 meeting  council gave staff direction to  start discussions with chico area  recreation district card on park  operations and potential  conveyance. The discussion  originally included tiker  ponds and comanche creek along  with children'  s park city  plaza depot park and ninth and  hazel greenway facility we quickly  started those discussions with  card and their general manager  and operations director are very  ambitious but also reasonable and  recognize they have a lot of  irons in the fire right now and  they understand what it means to  properly be reasonable and  properly deliver projects. The  discussion was originally  with the chico area recreation  concerns with the chico bike park  currently under construction the  aquatic center the request was  let'  s maybe narrow this  down as a phase one for initial  consideration and we will discuss  tiker and comanche creek at a  later date so we have honed it  down to children'  s park city plaza  depot park and ninth and hazel  and of course this again builds  on the existing intergovernmental  cooperative agreement or mou if you  will that was passed in 2020.  thank you.  thank you.  so timeline council initiated  the process in march we quickly  started these discussions cards  general manager took it to their  board at their june 2025 meeting  and the card board generally  supports but noted some funding  concerns and of course some  enforcement concerns. We did a  we had multiple discussions after  that meeting and then did a final  walk through joint site walk  through to assess lots of the  costs just last week and then  we'  re here tonight on the  19th for just an informational  update so we'  re kind of midpoint if  you will in this process.  so the potential fiscal impact  for children'  s park city plaza depot park  and ninth and hazel currently the  city'  s operation and maintenance  costs fully burdened for those  four parks is $11,784 per month  after several discussions and the  per month and the cost of the  The walk through is with card  their estimated onm costs for the  same parks are $17,229 per month  and the $5,000 increase is  likely due to different labor  agreements turf programs and  things like that might be a  little more expensive that card  initiates in a lot of their  existing neighborhood and  community parks. Those figures  exclude any event rental or  The city is currently in the  process of funding to take on  the operations and maintenance  of those parks has been  discussed. If the city were to  fund that operation to card we'  re midyear so we'  re likely to need a  budget supplemental. Those  reimbursement terms are still  being negotiated. Or discussed  if you will. The existing  intergovernmental cooperative  agreement enables us to do this  we have some precedents there  several parks and greenways have  already been successfully  conveyed to card examples are  barony park, humboldt neighborhood  park which is the skate park,  chico bike park which is the  property we conveyed not long  ago off of old humboldt,  nob hill and wildwood park. The  existing framework of that  cooperative agreement provides a  dispute resolution process,  governance structure and then it  really is the established  cooperative agreement that is  to do with the first conduit or  method to do this so we don'  t have to  reinvent the wheel.  Looking at bidwell park which  children'  s park was part of a bidwell  park deed we currently have a  section 614 of our charter same  sale exchange lease or purchase  of real property. Just to read  this is the sale or exchange of  real property owned by the city  shall be authorized by resolution  adopted by the affirmative vote of  at least five council members  provided that this section shall  not apply to properties deeded to  the city of chico for park  purposes by annie bidwell or guy  kennedy by deed or will and such  properties shall not be conveyed  or exchanged. Guy kennedy was  annie' s nephew and her attorney  at the time when she deeded the  park properties to the city. That  charter section does prevent  the city from being able to  provide any property deeded by  annie bidwell which is bidwell  park proper and includes children'  s park. City plaza was deeded by  or granted by john bidwell so our  code is silent to john bidwell  deeding so we have the ability to  do that but not park facilities  that were deeded by annie.  Further analysis there was some  underserved neighborhood  neighborhoods that were  We have some neighborhoods near  comanche creek we had some grant  funded improvements there bike  paths pedestrian bridge lighting  and landscaping that pointed to  some of the underserved  neighborhoods nearby so there'  s some deed restrictions layered  in that and we'  re still analyzing those  with the city attorney' s office  so they'  ll take a little further  investigation. Tiger ponds major  part of the storm drain system on  the east side of town and the  southeast part of town there'  s a precedence for  conveyances to card with storm  drain infrastructure included  humble bike park and hoosa ranch  are two examples and as long as  we have in many instances will  retain the storm drain facilities  or as long as we have maintenance  easements we'  re fine with the  conveyance. City attorney is  still reviewing the deed  restrictions for all identified  parcels further analysis we  consider cards capacity for  enforcement and maintenance of  lot is a public agency so they  can enforce trespassing  anti-camping ordinances a little  bit different than we can as a  public agency and of course they'  re not subject to  warren versus chico. And of  course the long-term sustainable  funding required for cards  acceptance still needs to be  further analyzed.  So conclusion we are again  midpoint I think there'  s a lot of  support garnered in both  organizations for this  exploration of conveying these  additional parks. Operational  funding available for the  selected parks of course is  still pending negotiations and  could be challenging midyear for  us if asked to fund some of  those own costs for card. The  legal and property constraints  are still under review and so  that kind of lands on the next  steps which is to continue the  cost evaluations resolve those  deed restrictions some of those  other areas and the intent is to  return to council soon with a  refined proposal and  recommendations. So that kind of  lands us on the recommendation  for tonight is again just to  receive this as a midpoint update  and then provide any additional  direction regarding the scope or  home focus on the parks that we  mentioned so again at this point  we'  re considering city plaza  depot park and the ninth and  hazel greenway space. That  concludes my presentation and I  can answer any questions.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you eric mark and staff  this update I think it'  s all very  promising there'  s some details that need to  be vetted and I would concur  those three parks are probably  phase one and those are the ones  that we should prioritize and I  just thank you for all the  information the vetting already  I think you brought up some very  valid points and I look forward to  hearing the details as it relates  to some of those issues that you  did raise so thank you.  thank you.  council member goldstein.  my question you mentioned this  briefly I might have misheard  but parks that would be managed  by card would those have  different rules for enforcement  of anti-camping ordinances?  correct they'  re a special district  so they could enforce  trespassing on their own parks  differently than we can as a  public agency and of course they'  re not subject to warren  versus chico.  are they not subject to warren  versus chico when they'  re publicly owned  still even if card is managing  them?  it applies to city of chico  public properties period not card  properties not butte county  properties or any other public  agency strictly city of chico.  maybe I'  m misunderstanding the  intent but if a park was city of  chico public property regardless  of whether or not card is  managing it?  we'  re not talking about  managing we'  re talking about having  title to the property so it'  s no longer a city of chico  property no longer subject to  the warren settlement agreement.  I was unclear that was the  initial direction of what we'  re talking about  here actually changing the  title to be card not just  managed.  we'  re talking about changing  title.  follow-up on that question.  council member winslow.  you said different rules for  enforcement trespassing and also  warren but when the warren  settlement expires would there  still be a meaningful difference  in the  not if it expired.  it really is tied to warren  the difference in that respect.  on that point but overall what  we'  re looking at  particularly I use depot as an  example in my opinion severely  underutilized it'  s in such a !  location in the city that'  s  begging for somebody like card  to program it and make it far  more active than it currently  is.  I agree also I'  ll just note that I  don'  t know if the director is  intended to speak but  activating little chico creek  spaces like that ninth and hazel  park sometimes called dog park  or whatever I think there'  s a lot of  promise in that.  I don'  t see much good happening out  there.  I'  d be really looking forward to  see if you have some brainstorm  ideas for eventual things that  could happen there.  council member van overbeck.  so director augustus and I  thought tiger ponds was part of  this too is that next maybe phase  two?  yeah next phase I mean it was  part of the original discussions  and part of council'  s direction from back in march  but in discussions with card staff  that was a little bit too large  of a bite at the moment due to  the existing capital projects  that they'  ve started and are  building now the aquatic center  and chico bike park so that was  kind of pushed off for a second  phase.  and I do want to add that  with the fact that we want to  be sensitive to cards capacity  you guys do have a lot on your  plane because you'  re doing great work so  thank you but we do need to be  sensitive to their capacity and  not overwhelm them so thank you.  council member holly.  just a comment I was really  really pleased to see that depot  park is being considered for  phase one of this project I  worked literally a block away  from it and every single day when  I would walk by to get food it  just broke my heart seeing the  state that it'  s in.  I think it'  especially considering that'  s an area of really condensed  poverty I think it would be  really heavily utilized to have  some programming there so I'  m just looking forward to  that and I want to thank staff  for supplying this report to us.  thank you.  the intent as always to  intensify the use and cards  recreational programming would  definitely do that.  good.  all right.  do we have any speakers?  actually I do have another  question before.  council member bennett.  I think I'  ll just want to talk  with you another time to fully  understand the difference in  changing the title to card of a  park but my quick question is how  is this different from a sale  essentially if we change the  title of one of the properties to  be owned by card?  yeah.  I mean it'  s a we would deed it  convey it so fully transfer it and  that'  I think that would be up to  council if we wanted to  determine a monetary value but I  think the there'  s this the mou  framework has us transfer  existing neighborhood and  community parks to card we have  a precedence to do that and then  they start to program the  recreational programming in  there.  but yeah I mean there could be  some value discussed for city  plaza or things like that of  course but I think the intent is  just to intensify the use for  the betterment of the community.  okay.  my gut reaction is to  consider the use of the  t feel concerned about the  idea of changing the ownership of  city plaza at the very least but  let'  s chat some time.  and we could have deed  restrictions that card could do  nothing to it that it would have  to come back to us correct?  sure yeah absolutely there'  s deed restrictions that we  could layer to that.  it has to perform if it doesn'  t perform it'  s deeded back to the city.  a good example is what'  s becoming the humble bike park  that had reversionary language in  there.  yeah.  I thought that'  s what we were  talking about.  I wanted to have that for the  public record.  council member bennett.  how long ago was wildwood park  deeded over to card?  yeah fully several years ago.  last year?  2011.  so we had an operating  agreement where with wildwood for  10 year maintenance period I  believe and then 2011 good  memory.  I was going to say five or six  years ago but obviously time  flies.  re off.  and that'  s worked out great hasn'  it?  correct.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  all of that for all of  the information for all of Nicole Nava followed by Cynthia Perrine. Madam Mayor, point of order, do we need to make a motion to extend the meeting on this issue since it's past 10 o'clock? We just can't take up anything new after 10 o'clock. We're going to have to do it without. Thank you. So thank you for checking on us though and keeping us in check. Wearing a tread in the carpet there. So I am very in favor of CARD being point on parks.  So I am very in favor of CARD being point on parks.  I love that we as a city have tried to do what we can do, but our bandwidth isn't such that, in my opinion, we've been able to have superior customer service and optimal conditions be happening.  And CARD has just been killing it with things that they've been doing.  I think we can all, I hope, agree that whatever they set their mind to lately, it's just been really beautifully laid out, has good participation.  They have a great reputation.  And so I've been very impressed.  I think Ms. Grimm has been doing a fantastic job and kind of realigning a lot of things just with the way they approach staffing and other things and have really risen for this community.  I know the water park coming out, and they've been very community friendly and staffed.  And so I think it's really great that we're stepping everybody through what to expect, and we're very inclusive in the experience.  And then the same thing with Henshaw Park and what could possibly change out there.  And so I really, kudos to the city for looking outside the box of how to use these spaces in ways that benefit everyone and have people who have the time to excel in that, excel in that.  So I just want to elevate that and say, great, I actually would like to throw out there that I know that it's not included in this one,  but maybe in the future.  So I just want to elevate that and say, great, I actually would like to throw out there that I know that it's not included in this one,  Consider Cape Breakers.  If they can get the bandwidth and get staffing that they can handle that.  They are so good with kid programs and other things, and there's really some great things that are going to be happening at Cape Breakers.  I think it would be a great fit.  So just throwing that out there.  And thank you so much for your time tonight.  Thank you also for the prior item.  I really appreciate your civility and everything coming to that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Cynthia Perrine.  All right.  So I am representing Northern California.  Regional Land Trust in this comment period.  And we don't need to be reminded, as we well know, there's unfortunately wildland urban interface special circumstances related to parks and preserves.  And the land trust originally was founded as Parks and Preserves Foundation.  And after preserving and protecting a lot of agricultural lands, the next phase, the next 34 or 35 years of the land trust, we're going back to public access and creating parks and preserves.  So.  So my comment is just that I really support this cooperative agreement.  And the city parks and everything I've seen from CARD and the city since coming back after 17 years gone from this community is all 100% positive.  And I just want to make sure as phase two proceeds that the Northern California Regional Land Trust, our organization, would appreciate being part of the state colder engagement should those cooperative agreements be drawn for what our WUI adjacent lands and especially Tichert Ponds and some of the other properties that are in the area.  And I think it's really important to be able to see that we're not just looking at our future but are adjacent to some of our conserved conservation easement properties that are in the city limits.  So just thank you as you move into phase two.  We'd like to be invited to the table.  Thanks.  All right.  I think that's it for public comment.  Ms. Grimm, do you have?  I feel like you've sat here all night long.  I feel like we should at least give you the opportunity to say something if you'd like to.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  It was entertaining, if I could just be honest.  This was a good one to be at and break the rules of 10 o'clock.  Yeah, so we're excited.  I think CARD and the city and many of our partners have had a longstanding partnership, and I think we're all in it for the right reasons.  And for us, it's about capacity building.  So if we just think about the plaza, really it started with the ice rink.  Why can't we do roller skating in the summer or in the spring?  And then tai chi in the morning.  We're out of space.  So any space that we can do in the summer, we're out of space.  So any space that we can flex into is welcomed for us.  You talked a little bit about brainstorming for Depot Park.  We know actually exactly what we want to do.  We want to do a small dog park on one half, and on the other half, we want to do basketball, futsal, pickleball maybe, cornhole, table tennis, so that it's really active for the college kids in that area.  And it's a beautiful park.  It is so beautiful.  In fact, we just went there not that long ago.  We're in the fun and parks department.  So that's what we like to do.  Any questions for me?  And invite everybody for Thursday.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, please, come to Thursday.  Aquatics Center, ceremonial groundbreaking.  We're already in full construction mode.  1130 in the morning.  It's going to be a good time.  We've got some special commemorative swag to give out.  So you'll want to be there.  Thank you.  How can you not love Annabelle?  I'm telling you.  If Card ever loses her, we're going to be in big trouble.  Okay.  On that direction, we've got the report.  Report received.  Any feedback?  My only feedback is Depot Park is my number one concern, and City Plaza would probably be number two.  But Depot Park, with the college students, we've identified the college as one of those key areas that we want to be a part of.  And we're going to be working on the key things in our community that is the most important thing and a vital asset.  And keeping our students here and in a safe and wonderful environment over there is super, super important to me.  So Depot Park, City Plaza, and the 9th and Hazel that you're working on, I mean, I think those are all a great start.  But for sure, Depot Park and City Plaza should be our priorities, one and two.  And the third one you were already working on was the 9th and Hazel.  So I say keep going that direction.  Get them activated.  Get them going.  And bring them back more.  But that's just my opinion.  Thank you.  Do we need a motion?  No?  Is this just a report?  Through report.  And feedback?  Okay.  And we are out of time.  So we will carry the next ones over to the next meeting.  Reports and communications.  The following reports and communications are provided for the council's information.  No action can be taken unless council agrees to include it on the subsequent agenda.  City manager's report?  No report.  Council members may verbally request an item be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be.  A majority vote of council is needed in order to force staff to agendize.  Do we have any council member requests?  Council member O'Brien.  I saw you pull your hand.  It's late.  I'll wait until next meeting courtesy of my colleagues and the audience, quite frankly.  Okay.  Council member Hawley.  I'm not so generous.  I'd like to agendize a discussion surrounding options for people with disabilities.  Because of all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been hearing for months, for all of the information that we've all been  and others.  Seconded.  Okay. I'm going to motion a second.  Okay.  Council Member Goldstein? Yes.  Council Member Hawley? Yes.  Council Member O'Brien? Sorry.  I jumped ahead of you. We already have state law  that precludes that, so no.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yeah. I wish we wouldn't do these  silly grandstanding motions  on items like this. No.  I heard a yeah in that.  Council Member Winslow?  Yeah.  Vice Mayor Bennett? No.  Mayor Reynolds? No.  It fails 3-4.  Any others?  No.  All right. Adjourned to  closed session meeting on Tuesday, September 2nd  at 5 or 5-30  or 4-30, depending on how much  of business we have. So we'll  leave that flexible.  Setting new precedents.  Thank you.  Because of all of the
