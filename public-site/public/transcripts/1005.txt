 I'm going to start with the same first step.  So, we're going to do this.  I'm going to start with the same first step.  So, we're going to start with the same first step.  So, we're going to start with the same first step.  So, we're going to start with the same first step. [inaudible]  I'm going to start with the same first step. Yeah.    Yeah. Yeah.  I'm going to start with the same first step.  Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't know. [inaudible]  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  We're ready whenever you are.  Vince is in here.  We're working, and we connected.  As soon as Steve .  All right.  Well, we will call the regular meeting of Thursday, September 16, 2021, of the Planning Commission to order, and we will begin with the pledge.  Salute.  Pledge.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Thank you.  And roll call, please.  Commissioner Wall.  Here.  Commissioner Poulin.  Here.  Commissioner Goldstein.  Here.  Commissioner Dermede.  Here.  Commissioner Cooper.  Here.  Vice Chair Ober.  Here.  Chair Scott.  Present.  Thank you.  We'll move on to item two, the consent agenda.  And before we do that, I just have one typo in there.  On the page one, call to order should say 6 p.m. instead of 000 p.m.  Good catch.  And what's the order?  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes.  Do we have any business from the floor?  All right. Item four,  public hearing. And we will do an  announcement of ex parte communications. Is there any to my  left? I don't have any ex parte communication, but  in the interest of complete disclosure, I do  have an airplane hangared at the airport, which  occasionally, along with others, overfly the proposed project area.  Secondly, I was in approval  of the North Chico  Pacific plan back in December 6th of 2005.  So I'm already slanted in that direction, just for information.  Thank you, Commissioner Wall. And then any ex parte communication to my  right?  Great. Thank you. So we will  go to item 4.1, vesting tentative subdivision map  20-04. And I will turn it over to  Associate Planner Tina Wilson.  Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the Planning Commission. Tonight, the project before you,  the applicant proposes to subdivide three parcels of  approximately 45.3 acres into 219 lots  per single family,  Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park  along Hicks Lane and one on Sycamore Drive.  The project site is designated both low-density residential,  which is 2.1 to 7 dwelling units per acre,  and medium-density residential, which is 6 to 14 dwelling units per acre,  on the City of Chico's General Plan Land Use Diagram,  and is located in the R1 AOC, R1 AOD, R2 AOC, and R2 AOD zoning districts and overlays.  That's the Airport Overflight Compatibility Zone, Z and D.  Surrounding land uses include residential uses on all sides.  The project site consists of three residential parcels.  There's a barn existing on the site that would be removed.  The remainder of the parcel is vacant and undeveloped.  All utilities are available nearby to serve the project,  and the new homes would be connected to Cal Water and City Sewer.  The proposed lot configuration appears to be suitable to subdivide the property.  All of the proposed R1 and R2 lots meet the minimum lot size and width requirements.  Lots 1 through 100 total approximately 24.6 acres of the R1 zone property,  and the average lot size for this portion of the subdivision is 7,652 square feet.  Lots 101 through 219 total approximately 19.7 acres of the site of R2 zone property,  and the average lot size for this part of the subdivision is 5,080 square feet.  So those are on the southern portion of the property, just north of the existing mobile home park.  A stormwater facility, Parcel A, is proposed along the western section of the property that abuts State Highway 99.  The stormwater detention facility is 0.91 acres in size.  Proposed amenities include a park and a bicycle path.  The park is 1.13 acres.  And it's located on the northeast portion of the site at the intersection of Hicks Lane and Sycamore Drive.  A 0.05 acre bicycle path, Parcel C, would be located directly north of the stormwater facility.  There are requested subdivision design modifications to allow non-radial lot lines,  non-standard road sections, non-standard cul-de-sac, non-standard horizontal alignment,  allow horizontal crossings,  allow curves less than is specified,  and to allow backup lots along the arterial Hicks Lane.  In summary, there was a neighborhood meeting conducted on June 29th of this year.  The project is consistent with general plan policies,  the Northwest Chico Specific Plan,  and subdivision development standards.  The project's also within the scope of the previous environmental impact report  that was prepared for the Northwest Chico Specific Plan.  So it is covered pursuant to CEQA section 1.2.  Staff recommends approval of the project and staff is also available for any questions.  Thank you.  Are there any questions for Tina?  To my left.  Vice chair Ober?  No?  To my right?  Commissioner Goldstein?  Sure, I have a couple of questions.  Thanks for the presentation.  My first question is, do you know why,  basically, the minimum allowable density is being utilized instead of anything above that?  My understanding is that this is the density that the applicant was interested in pursuing.  I believe there was one previous design that the applicant could speak to further.  I am not as familiar with that particular design, but this seemed to be what best met the requirement.  I am just trying to understand the intent.  Okay, thanks.  And I can ask the developer more, too.  Do you know what the timeline might be as far as once this is approved, eventually being constructed and then moving towards being sold and inhabited?  I would defer to the applicant regarding that.  The process includes, if your commission were to approve the project, recordation, and then improving the design.  I believe this is going to be a phased subdivision, as there are different parts that would be built at different times.  Okay, thanks.  I have a question.  I'm reading through here this new packet.  It seems like they're not approving the flood area yet.  That's not approved?  I'm looking at the Caltrans and the requirements.  I didn't get the map.  I'm not sure if they have any time to review the flood area.  I'm just trying to understand the timeline.  Is that all approved?  Are you referring to the detention, proposed detention facility?  Yeah, the detention water.  I thought I just read in there that they hadn't had time to review it yet, so I didn't know if that was approved or not.  My apologies.  I should have referenced the memo that I also provided to you this evening.  It includes correspondence from both the public as well as other agencies.  And there are some agencies that are not approved.  There are some agencies that although they received the packet for the subdivision and all the information regarding the project,  sometimes they decide to include comments and provide us with feedback and other times they don't.  So we can't control what comes in and what doesn't.  But you have everything in front of you from all of the agencies that have commented thus far.  And we did not receive any further comment from the state.  I think that's what you're referring to.  We didn't have time to look.  And I did not hear back.  Could that affect the project if they did provide a comment?  Do you anticipate any issues with that?  If they were to provide some comments, of course we would work with them.  I would forward those comments to our senior development engineer.  And we would see if there was some type of resolution to whatever issue it might be.  Okay. Okay. I do have another question. Okay. Another piece of the communication memo that you provided us was a communication from somebody from CARD. And I might have just not had time to see if it was in here, but I wasn't sure if that was resolved.  I might.  I might.  I might.  I might.  My understanding is it will be part of the CMD.  It's going to be maintained by the city's CMD  if PARD is not interested,  and staff has also drafted a condition to that effect  at such time that you want to consider that.  CMD, what's that an acronym for?  I'm sorry.  What's CMD again?  Chico Maintenance District.  Community.  Community Maintenance District.  Thank you.  Teamwork.  Chico Maintenance District.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Good job.  Sorry to quiz you.  I didn't know what that was.  No, no.  The original, Larry can probably tell you better than I,  but the original Northwest Pacific plan  had noted a neighborhood park,  which we ended up accepting last winter, I think it was.  We're kind of happy that people were able to use that.  And then it also defined approximately a one-acre park  on this side of the freeway.  And currently we're working with the folks from Merriam Park.  They're going to build another park,  that's kind of kitty-cornered, to the courthouse.  And CARD is interested in taking and maintaining that.  So we're working in close working relationships with them.  And we also have an MOU with CARD on maintenance of parks.  And the email from Ann suggested that a smaller park,  and this is what we were anticipating,  a smaller park, it's not as efficient for them to maintain it  as it is the larger 5A.  So we're going to have to make a park.  So if there's no interest on CARD's part,  then we would maintain it through our maintenance district.  Okay. Thank you so much for that.  So to clarify, it sounds like the requirement isn't, you know,  a mandatory thing based on the size of their subdivision or anything.  It's just that CARD doesn't feel capable of maintaining every small park.  As far as the maintenance, right.  The aspects of sizing the parks, still got it on,  are not.  We're part of the Northwest Pacific Plan area that identified,  like I said, a five acre park site on the west side of the Esplanade  and then on the east side of the freeway,  they have one that's in this area where this HICS subdivision is proposed.  Great. Thank you so much.  Tina, a couple questions regarding, and once again,  didn't read it until late this afternoon,  but the email from Tina Wilson and regarding a couple things.  You've dealt with the flood water drainage,  but also about the traffic flow and congestion.  I wasn't aware because they're in the county that there were a couple subdivisions north of the channel there,  both south and north of Caballo Lane.  How does that affect this project or does it at all?  She mentioned the bridge, but.  I think what we're talking about, Dennis,  I don't know all the ins and outs.  I haven't been too involved in the county north plan.  That's out west of the airport.  But this project is just kind of an infill project consistent with the northwest specific plan.  As you can see behind you and Tina read to you that it's exempt from further environmental review.  So we didn't do any.  There wasn't a need for additional traffic analysis.  They had done a thorough traffic analysis as part of the EIR.  And then a few years ago,  when we did our Nexus study update to determine development impact fees,  it was found that we didn't need to include Hicks Lane into the Nexus,  although we did include the roundabout.  And the roundabout currently under construction has a portion of development impact fees from the city of Chico,  county fees that were raised as part of the building out in that area.  And then we have some state funds building that.  To achieve that final capacity that we need.  But the county has had a couple of workshops on that north area development that's west of the airport.  And one of the things from a traffic standpoint it's going to need is rather than using Hicks Lane only,  there'll be a second access at some point.  So it'll be served by multiple access points.  Thank you, ma'am.  Thank you, Dr.  I think I have more map questions.  So I've been looking at the overall map.  And I really appreciate the compact design there to get all of those units.  And in relation to the, I guess,  the modification that we'd have to approve with the backup lots on Hicks Lane.  Yes.  I understand why we would be doing that.  I just wanted to get from your standpoint.  And particularly lots 85 and 86.  And then probably lot 37.  If those did connect to the arterial,  would that create any traffic issues from your standpoint of how many entrances we would have into?  Well, we'd like to minimize the impact or the number of points of access.  Because it minimizes the conflict.  And the area.  We're all familiar with Eaton Road where we're currently developing.  And I guess we're in the process now of completing the paving.  So we'd have two lanes in each direction.  But the Mountain Vista Sycamore Glen subdivision was approved with some smaller lots that did front on Eaton Road at that point in time.  Because it's a busier arterial, which would, well, it's busier than Hicks Lane would be.  But on a busy street like that, when you front lots on that, it just, there's a lot of congestion and safety issues.  So in that situation, we put in a side drive.  There's a side drive also on a subdivision.  I think it's Godman.  We put in a traffic signal Godman.  It has a frontage road there.  And it just seems like there's a lot of issues with egress and ingress out of those.  So.  It's almost better to just have backup lots like this.  Perfect.  That's what I thought you would say.  And then on the stormwater facility.  So there's a number of valley oaks there that are slated for removal.  One, two, three, four, five, six that I have here.  Is that absolutely necessary for that to function properly?  I would imagine so.  I'm not the tree guy.  But what I can tell you is the time lapse from approval of this subdivision originally as part of the Northwest Pacific plan, and now we're coming to fruition on it.  There was some changes in the requirements for storm drain runoff that it be retained on site.  And the applicant's engineer had worked on the subdivision that's currently under construction on Eaton Road.  And that's the road between, what is it, Burnap and Morseman.  So that was kind of the applicant's engineer first experience with the new stormwater regulations.  And we spent a lot of time on the design on that to ensure that we met and complied with the new regulations.  Well, the same engineer is doing this project.  So we've had a lot of discussions already on this project.  The applicant went ahead and did some PERC tests on the site, did some soils investigation.  Because it's important that we really have a good understanding of what the size of the detention facility needs to be.  Such that, hey, you look at a map, you approve something, and then you find out that it's significantly different.  So a lot of effort was put in on this design of both the subdivision and the storm drain facility to size it properly.  So although we haven't gone through the final design, we feel comfortable that enough effort is put into it that it's sized properly.  So anyway, so the stormwater goes into that and then into the Sioux Dad ditch, which is managed by the county.  So when we're finishing up review of that design, we'll also work with the county on that to make sure that they're okay with what we're doing.  Okay.  And I assume that with the way the water's flowing, it's going to be a lot of work.  So we're going to have to make sure that the water's flowing and to maximize what we need for that site for a stormwater facility.  Switching where the stormwater facility is with the park would not be feasible.  Because that would be great because we could keep those values.  Right.  Because the lay of the land falls kind of from the northeast to the southwest so that you get natural flow.  And this is very similar to the, we actually have a 10-acre facility for the northwest specific plan over on the other side of the freeway.  And this is, it's kind of the westerly end down where the orchard subdivision is.  Anyway, it's, this is almost identical design in that the water runs from the subdivision to the pond.  It's treated in the pond and then it's released into the Sioux Dad ditch, which we have here.  Okay. Thanks, Matt.  You bet.  Are there any other questions?  Yes.  Okay.  So a couple of questions.  And I'll just go through them.  I'll just pick up on the tree conversation.  I noted not only in association with the stormwater facility but also just generally for the whole project, pretty quick count.  It looks like there are a total of 80 trees that have been identified or tagged or, you know, looked at.  And 50 of those are actually, approximately 50, it was, some of them have maybe next to them.  So I'm not sure what to make of that.  But I'm assuming that there are a total of 80 trees that are slated for removal.  And many, many of those are valley oaks.  And so that gives me pause.  I understand based on the locations there may not be much to do about that.  But what I'm not seeing in the packet, and I could be, I'm just missing it, so I apologize.  But is any mitigation planned for those trees?  Is there something in the, you know, a condition that requires the developer to actually replace those as there usually would be?  So I'm assuming that there is.  I'm just not spotting it.  There is.  In exhibit 1 to attachment A, the conditions of approval.  And then also engineering's included it in the, what's ours, Tina, exhibit 2?  Yes, exhibit 2 as well.  So on exhibit 1, it's condition 10 regarding tree removal shall be subject to the in lieu fee payment requirements.  And then there's also condition 11.  So those cover the issue regarding tree removal on site.  So on the engineering condition, it's K on page 9 of 10.  The subdivider, no, let's see here.  The subdivider shall submit a completed application requesting permission to plant, remove, alter, disturb public trees from, to the public works department.  The subdivider shall comply with the requirements.  We're not going to provide them with any and all recommendations, requirements prior to commencing any construction activity on this site.  So typically before they start any grading operations, they work with the urban forest or rich and arrive upon a mitigation  on the mitigation measures and the mitigation fees that will be required.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  And then I also am curious on the park acreage question.  Um.  So I understand that the Northwest Pacific Plan calls out a park on the east and on the west.  And I wasn't totally clear.  You may have said this, and again, I missed it.  But the park, I believe, on the west is actually specifically called out to be five acres.  But I didn't hear whether the plan, and I could have looked this up, but I didn't,  whether the plan calls for a specific acreage on the other side where we're really talking about here.  And my question is really more a one-acre park tucked into that at the end of that cul-de-sac.  Or actually, there's access from Sycamore.  But it just seems small for that number, for the size of a development.  So reading from the Northwest Pacific Plan, it's actually on page 42 at the bottom.  It says a second neighborhood park is a one-acre park to be constructed east of Highway 99  near Sycamore.  Hicks Lane and Sycamore Drive with an exact location to determine the first stage of development  for the web home parcel east of 99.  And then there's actually an overall conceptual map that shows, a little bit too far for you to see it,  but I can bring it up for the Planning Commission to see,  that shows a park within this subdivision and also the detention facility.  Got it.  No, I actually...  It does specifically.  It does specifically say, let me go back to page 42, that it is to be a one-acre park.  Got it.  So that helps, and that does indicate that this meets the Northwest Plan.  I guess I would just, I'd be curious if the applicant has any, you know,  thoughts about whether that feels adequate and if there's any room for, you know, some adjustment.  Because if I were coming into this neighborhood, I'd...  That...  I might feel that that was small.  So I'd be curious, but that's a question for the applicant probably.  And my last comment is, I do think that we need to pay attention to the Caltrans concerns.  And I apologize, this was, I hadn't seen this until arriving tonight.  But I get it, the correspondence goes, you know, fast and furious right up to the last minute.  But if I'm seeing the sequence here, it looks like the Caltrans...  Concern, you know, was communicated maybe just yesterday.  Again, I might be missing something, but...  And they are specifically asking for a little bit more time to make sure that, you know, their concerns are...  They've had time.  They're not even necessarily raising concerns.  They're essentially saying that they would like to have more time to review the map.  And so that feels to me like a significant request that maybe we ought to consider.  And our deliberations honoring.  But there may be, again, the applicant may have had conversations that will help shed light on that.  So I think those were my questions for staff.  Thanks, Tina.  You're welcome.  I have one more.  Oh, yes.  Or do you have a question?  No.  Okay.  So included in the staff report is this Northwest Chico specific plan final EIR.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So one of the respondents mentioned that this environmental impact report is 15 years old, I think.  Is that true?  I've been following the Northwest and North Chico specific plans, and I get them confused, quite honestly.  So the reason why I'm asking is included in the environmental impact report mitigations,  they reference level of service for vehicle and traffic impacts and not vehicle miles traveled.  And there was recent...  I think it was the state policy, which shifts environmental impact review to address vehicle miles traveled increases rather than vehicle traffic level of service.  And wondering how old the environmental impact review is and if that's something that needs to be changed because of this project or not.  Madam Chair, I'd be happy.  Thank you.  I'd like to answer that on behalf of staff.  The short answer is no.  In our opinion, it doesn't.  We believe part of the findings in the process that we went through was to see if it was still consistent with that.  And in our opinion, it is.  And it's within the thresholds of the specific plan EIR, and that's the analysis that we conducted.  And in our opinion, it is adequate.  Okay.  Thank you.  And then, Tina, could you comment, too?  I heard.  I heard.  I heard. And then Tina, could you comment to Vice Chair Ober brought up the Caltrans notice, but we also have one here from the Central Valley Flood Protection Board from September 9th. So a week ago asking saying that it may take a few days to get comments.  I heard.  I heard.  I heard.  I heard.  I heard.  I heard.  I heard.  information in terms of the digital copy of the map,  both to the state for Caltrans and for flood control.  So we did not hear back.  And if they were to reach out to us after the hearing,  we could at a staff level,  see if there's a way to address whatever issue  might come up,  but they also might never provide us with comments.  We just don't know.  Okay.  And then, so on the noticing there,  we're seeing emails from last week and then the 15th,  when would we have provided them the initial notice  on this project?  This was back in August  that we provided the initial notice.  There may have been some type of delay  with the mail service based on pandemic protocol.  So I'm not sure why people were receiving it so late,  but we're gonna try to address that issue internally.  Make sure agencies have enough time.  Madam Chair and commissioners, if I can add to it,  it's not uncommon that we don't hear back.  We send a lot of these notices out to all.  The list of people that get notified on these subdivisions  is pretty long and exhausted.  It's rare that we hear back from most of them.  So it happens.  It's a characteristic.  It's a characteristic. It's a characteristic.  It's a characteristic of the process,  not an exception.  Mm-hmm.  And as Tina and Matt have indicated,  if there is something that comes in,  we work together as agencies to resolve those  and address those.  And they understand the process and how it works too.  So they deal with the same,  they're working from the same regulatory framework  we are too.  So they're familiar with what we need to do  and we coordinate whenever we can.  Because the city actually,  we have a separate permit from the state.  I think we have one for our sewage treatment plant.  I think we have one for our storm drain system.  I think we have a separate permit also from the airport.  So we're familiar with the regulations.  They monitor us.  If we don't get comments back, we're required by law  to meet those regulations and use those standards.  Thanks.  And I just, I wanted that addressed in the public hearing  because when you see an email that says,  Wednesday, September 15th,  and I never got a map that that's a public record  that's entered into here,  to have the city say, no, we provided this in August  in the public hearing is good information for us to have.  It is.  And I appreciate, Bruce, how frustrating it is when,  you know, ample opportunities are provided and,  you know, comments are not submitted.  But I'd also note, I think, I believe you 100% that,  you know, that there's a good working relationship  and that the process is ongoing and that the agencies  that may have concerns you'll continue to work with.  I've seen that happen many, many times.  And I understand that.  That's all the more reason that when Caltrans specifically says,  is there any chance that this could be delayed just long  enough for us to, you know, have time, then, you know,  the good faith and the relationship  of trusting each agency to be able to, you know,  go through the process and that they understand your process,  but, you know, are still requesting an extension,  gives me pause and just is worth, I think,  maybe consideration.  I haven't made any decisions about that or anything,  but it just seems like, you know,  it's a very explicit request, so.  Any other questions?  Yes.  Commissioner Wall.  Okay.  On page 9 of 10 of the subdivision report exhibit 2,  back here in the city,  the city tree requirements, it says,  the subdivider shall comply with any and all recommendations  slash requirements prior to placing any construction  activities on the site.  I would submit that recommendations are not  necessarily needed to be followed and shall  and recommendations together aren't appropriate.  Well, if the city arborist comes out and wants you to plant  a 10-foot sequoia or a 15-foot palm,  and he thinks that's a great idea and recommends you do it,  is the subdivider obligated to do that?  An extreme example, I realize,  but shall and recommend don't go together.  Do we have a city arborist?  This is a condition that has been given to engineering,  so we're implementing the requirements of the,  you know, the city arborist.  And urban forester.  So I can circle back on that because this condition,  although you haven't been here for some time,  this condition has the same wording from subdivision  to subdivision to subdivision.  So we can go back and clarify that with him to see if we want  to change some of the language to make it more clear.  Well, just striking the word recommendation would make it  very clear.  I'm sorry.  I'm not in a position to do that.  Bruce, can you make that happen?  I think what Matt is saying is that they're going to work  on revising it to clear it up from here on out,  but I'm hesitant to their public works conditions,  and that's not in the planning wheelhouse.  And it's like I won't modify fire department's  recommendations either.  This is part of his subdivision report.  So.  It's in his jurisdiction and I,  it's within their responsibility.  So, but I think he recognizes there's some vagueness,  and I think that can be clarified.  Yeah, I don't even think a palm tree is  on the approved list of street trees.  Well, I use that as a ludicrous example,  but you get my point about.  Right, right.  Shallon recommendation.  Point noted.  Thank you.  Any other questions?  Okay, thank you, Tina.  Thank you.  So, we will open the public hearing for public input.  We will begin with the applicant.  Following the applicant's presentation,  anybody who's here to speak from the public may speak  for up to three minutes.  I think we do have speaker cards in the back,  so if you could do that, that would be great.  And then.  We have the pleasure of inviting the applicant back up  after any public comment to clarify any comments  that were made from the public.  Mr. Webb, thank you.  All right, thank you.  Good evening.  I'm the applicant, Project applicant, Bill Webb.  Just here to hopefully give you some answers  or clarify any of your questions.  I apologize, I tried to write the name of who asked the question,  so I'll just kind of, just quick background that,  when we held our neighborhood meeting, we, you know,  we had general support for this design.  It is the second iteration of our design,  and I'll get to Bryce's question in a minute on why that was.  A couple of these notices or these emails from other agencies  we weren't made aware of until either later this afternoon  or I'm hearing them personally right now,  so I won't have any answers on that.  Maybe I can give an opinion, but no answers to that.  So, we'll start with Bryce.  The reason for the minimal allowable density,  as you stated, is to be consistent with the neighborhood.  Our first plan set aside about 12 acres  for some multi-family housing,  and after giving it some thought and consideration,  we just didn't feel that was right for the neighborhood,  so we chose to change that out with a,  I won't call it a small lot subdivision,  but that kind of lot size so we can provide some,  unfortunately, a lot of space for the neighborhood.  So, we went from 1400 square foot homes  to 1700 square foot homes.  We built a subdivision last summer, I believe,  or two winters ago over off Sycamore,  off Mariposa Avenue with those same lot sizes,  typically 38 to 45 foot wide, 100 foot deep.  So, that's why we made the change to all single family  on the lower end of the densities,  because that's what will fit on that parcel.  As far as timing,  we'd like to start next spring or summer, weather pending,  and it would be phased over four or five years  for full build out.  Think you had a question on the park size?  Yes, we had a communication from somebody from CARD.  Yeah, Anne Wellman, yeah.  And I think Matt answered that,  that the requirement to the Northwest Chico specific plan  was for a one acre park.  And to Rich's question on if I feel that's adequate,  I don't know.  On the West side, we put in a five acre park  for close to a thousand units.  So if you do the math, one acre for 200 units,  five acres for a thousand units or roughly.  And a little history on why that park is on our site.  When this specific plan was adopted in 06,  wanted a park on the west side and my uncle being the nice guy as larry knows he is said hey just  put it on our site we'll deal with it so that's why it's on our site there's another 45 to 46 acres  to the west on sycamore that will be developed you know sometime down the road that could easily  offer another one acre park if they chose there's no obligation for them but they could put a park  on their site if they wanted to so I'll move on to Dennis I don't know if this was a question or  just a comment I think the north subdivisions that the letter writer refers to I don't that  I'm aware of that no applications were made to the county or the city north of sycamore creek  there's the North Chico specific plan that the county and the city are collaborating on currently  and  to my knowledge nothing's been actually applied for or proposed to either jurisdictions  tony I think your questions are all for matt are you comfortable on those I think so I have a  follow-up but I'll let you hit everybody else's first okay tree removal that's a tough one because  we don't have a final grading plan if we can save them all we'll save them all the reality of that  you know isn't really  realistic, so we're gonna make every attempt  to save as many trees as possible.  The ones in the detention facility,  if they can be saved, we'll leave them.  I just, I don't think that's realistic at all,  because you have grading work,  you have earth movers in there.  But until we get a grading plan,  we're not gonna know if we have two feet of fell  over an oak's canopy, and obviously that doesn't work  for the survival of the tree.  So the ones we have identified as saved,  I think we can save those no problem,  because they're right on property,  existing property lines, and they butt up  to the existing homes in the neighborhood,  and it's kind of a, you know, I don't wanna say a charity,  but you know, something we'll do for the neighbors,  because they're nice trees.  That's a good segue for my question,  and I'll give you a little more time  if you can answer it now.  Okay.  So I'm not sure if you have the map in front of you, but.  I have it over here, but.  Okay, so we have you currently saving,  trees.  Oh, I didn't bring my glasses.  So it's on lot 151 and 149,  we have you saving trees 19, 18, 17, and 16.  Okay.  And so I'm just wondering,  and I apologize,  because we don't get like a tree health report  or anything like that,  but it seems like it would make sense  that we might be able to save tree three and tree four  that's on parcel 21.  Cause they're in a similar location.  And then 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55.  And really my interest in those is that they are Valley Oaks.  Yeah.  And it might be due to the size  and the extent of the canopy.  Those lots will have,  well, one might not have a small backyard,  but some of them will be built within 10 or 15 feet of the property line.  And the last thing you want is a 20 inch Oakland  hanging over the house.  So I can't tell the exact size of them.  But when we walked,  I walked the property with an arborist  and he developed the plan.  And then I walked in with the engineer  to get a better idea of what is real.  If they can be saved, they'll be saved.  But the ones I got an X are the ones  that I thought probably wouldn't be able to be saved.  Okay. That answers your question.  Yeah.  Caltrans, I hadn't seen that memo or email.  I'm not sure what the concern is.  The detention facility is outside of the rideway.  Isn't that correct, Matt?  Yes.  I haven't seen the Caltrans email either.  So I'm not totally sure.  I'm totally clear on it myself,  but I didn't read that the Caltrans request  for the possibility of an extension or a delay  was related to the retention pond.  What I think I saw was just they had not had time to,  or they had not-  And I wouldn't be in favor of a delay.  I would hope that there'd be some sort of consensus tonight  so we move forward one direction or the other.  Because a delay doesn't do me any good  to start planning with PG&E and Cal Water,  and the other utilities.  Yeah, I understand that.  And I think that's all the questions.  Maybe just a comment, if Larry,  you can't fly over the subdivision,  that might be helpful.  I'm sorry, what was your question?  Say that again?  I just said you can't,  we're gonna put a deed restriction on you flying over  the property.  You are, huh?  I'll get out your 20 millimeter.  I'll get out your 20 millimeter.  Are there any other questions for Mr. Webb?  I'm good.  Dennis?  Okay, yeah, Phil.  Yeah.  Couple questions.  You hit upon part of it.  I was just curious, for lots one through 100,  what square footage houses, those are the bigger lots,  what are you planning there?  1800 to 2200 is our normal range.  And based on today's prices-  What's that?  Based on today's prices,  where would they be?  Price point one.  Price point two.  Price point three.  Price point four.  Price point six.  Price point seven.  Price point eight. I mean, it's it's it's and then we live in and then the other lots, the one on one to two nineteen probably the low force. I mean, I hate to call that a starter. No, no. No, no. No, no. Not. I'm just trying to get a feel for where you're at. It has nothing to do with the decision.  It's hard to. You know, 300 bucks a square foot is what sale price.  What about, and then my other question, on the south side of Street E, that backs up to the mobile home park?  Yeah.  It's got chain link and wire fencing.  That'll be removed and replaced with either a six-foot board-on-board type fence for screening purposes.  Do we need to have that?  Is that something that we need to put in?  I figured you would, but I just...  Yeah.  It won't be stucco or masonry.  It won't be like the wall on Hicks, but it'll be...  Right.  Yeah, Hicks is going to be the side of the property.  Yeah.  We have proposed for a CMU type wall.  It doesn't look like we have that as a condition of approval.  Is that something we would need to add in making a motion?  That is something that we could add to this.  That would be fine.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bryce?  Thanks, girl.  You've already answered a couple of things I was going to ask about the size of housing and cost, so good work.  I was just hoping you could elaborate a little more on the history of the site.  You mentioned there was the previous plan.  Around what year or years was that planned?  Previous?  Previous.  And can you elaborate just a little more on the reasoning for...  From going from the R2 multifamily to the R2 single family?  Yeah.  Just compatibility with the neighborhood and didn't feel that that was the right area for apartments.  It's on the outer edge of town.  There's not a lot of services nearby.  The nearest grocery store would be, what, Raley's?  Up the Esplanade and East Avenue.  It didn't feel like...  And when we first started drafting it, the specific plan allows for multifamily, and it was just like, oh, we build multifamily.  We'll just save that for multifamily later.  And then there were some engineering issues with egress that also helped lead us out of planning for apartments there.  So that elaborates a little bit.  Thanks.  And did you have community?  Did you have community meetings for the previous version of this plan?  No, we never got that far.  Okay.  So it's more how it appeared to fit in with the surrounding land use then?  Yeah, we had comments from staff.  Okay.  And then we changed.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Is that it?  Thank you.  We might call you back up, so don't get too comfortable.  And do we have any public comment?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So any member of the public here to speak on this?  No.  Okay.  So with that, I want to make sure no more questions because I'm going to close the public hearing.  All right.  Wait.  Okay.  Deciding if this is really a question.  No, it's okay.  I think I'm good.  Okay.  So with that, we will close the public hearing and bring it back to the commission for further questions.  I heard a Park Park Park.  reviews things such as the item or the policy that I was discussing which um affects analyzing  vehicle miles traveled versus level of service and that's one of the things that um I believe  the division of planning local assistance and sustainability would cover and so I am concerned  that there could be effects of um this division reviewing this after the fact and then  this potentially might not comply with statewide transportation planning environmental review and  then they'd have hopefully all that would happen if that's the case is then they could go  and make things comply so I'm not too concerned about the Caltrans comment but I really like  I wish we had all the information there I guess is where I'm at I'm conflicted  that was a ramble but um  can I also ask I know someone already asked this but did the city send the pdf of the subdivision  map to Caltrans uh before the date when she said that she just received it was it more of a  Caltrans internal issue that she didn't get forwarded the map  Commissioner Goldstein the map was forwarded to her um  by the city of Cali and it was forwarded to her by the city of Cali and it was forwarded to her  by the city of Cali and it was forwarded to her by the city of Cali and it was forwarded to her  by the city of Cali and it was forwarded to her by the pdf was sent to her yesterday  um our standard was to mail a hard copy and we didn't know to email to the specific person  sometimes the contacts change over time for these various agencies and so I did you'll see at the  very end of this packet that I provided that I did ask um if they wanted to provide comments  prior to the planning commission's action or was there some need for some sort of a  would prior to map recordation suffice if the commission were to approve tonight? And I didn't  hear a response. So I'm not quite sure what to say except that we provided Caltrans with  the map in the standard way that we always have. And when I reached out twice in response  immediately when I received the email, I didn't get a response back. Okay. Okay. Good to know.  I think speaking as a teleworking Caltrans employee, definitely it's always good to send  things via email. But you know that, so sorry. Thank you for the information on that. That's  helpful. And I just have a comment on that too. It's not really Caltrans jurisdiction either. And  I just want to point that out that they're not in the easement. I think a lot of times these are  sent to the  agencies just as a courtesy for review and comment. But I just want to make the note that it's a city,  county area over there. I just want to point that out. Certainly, but the whole state is affected by  Caltrans and state transportation policy. So they often review plans. Like I have reviewed planning  documents to ensure that they comply with the rules. And I think that's a good point. I think it's  important to make sure that they comply with policy. And so I'm guessing that's where she's coming from as far as wanting to provide comments. But it also could have to do with perhaps they want to make sure that the retention pond isn't going to, I don't know, drown cars on the highway. It's kind of hard to say. But yes, that is true.  Are we able to make a motion with conditions on?  If I can ask.  I don't know the answer to that. Could I ask a question real quick?  Sure.  First of staff. So on this Caltrans thing, I mean, I don't want to be making a mountain out of a molehill, but it is a very specific request. Based on history of working with Caltrans, and again, I trust that there's good relationships there, if we were to, what did they request, an extension, I think was the word, of, you know, if we were to make a mountain out of a molehill, we would have to make a mountain out of a molehill.  If we gave them another week to, you know, to respond, do we have any sense, again, just based on past history of the kinds of things that they, questions they might raise or whatever, what that could look like? I mean, is there really a problem with doing that? I totally understand that any delay is, you know, not wanted and potentially cost money, et cetera. So I'm sympathetic to that totally.  But I'm just curious what...  Giving them an opportunity to respond if that really causes a problem.  Well, Madam Chair, I can take it. My answer to that is, and Tina can jump in here at any time, is I think Tina made it clear that the timing was of the essence on this. And we explained that we send these out routinely. They get maps all the time. And I just, you know, this one slipped through the cracks. And they understand the process. They understand that we have deadlines.  And that we need to respond timely. They work with CEQA the same as we do. So, and I think it was telling when Tina said, is there anything you'd like us to do? We're going to hearings soon. Or is there anything you'd like us to address before the map records or before the plans or the improvement plans are done or anything else that you want to have addressed? And said, and they knew the timeframe and we didn't hear anything. And that's not uncommon.  Mm-hmm.  And so I cannot tell you that I have a lot of confidence that we'll hear from them at all.  If you do hear from them, is it possible to make a note when it goes to council for the fact that it came to us after our disposition of the agenda item and now this Caltrans thing can go to them? That's going to go to them anyway.  Yeah, I think, you know, Matt, we have their, okay, they're going to do improvement plans.  And all of that. And there's lots of inputs for them to address their concerns in regards to the development of this project. The map will just, it'll just be a final map and they'll just approve it for recording.  The only thought I would have is there's only one interface somewhat between the city and Caltrans.  And that would be basically,  the intersection of Hicks and Eaton.  Okay.  Like I had said before,  that project had been planned for a long, long time.  The city is using development impact fees.  We have money from the county.  And obviously that's a Caltrans-sponsored project.  A lot of time and effort was put into it both by the city and Caltrans to develop that project.  So knowing that, like I said,  this subdivision,  affects Hicks. Hicks connection to Eaton Road is in the process of being  reconstructed to meet the future needs of both the city and Caltrans with  respect to traffic operations. So I just can't imagine that there would, I don't  know, just doesn't seem reasonable to think that if we have the one point of  connection or where we interface with one another, we're redoing that with the  blessing of Caltrans, that we would end up having some problem. I don't know.  Madam Chair, I could also add, this isn't kind of a new thing. This is a  master-planned area, and this development and intensity of development  has been called for for quite a while. So this isn't a new proposal.  This was originally reviewed and approved by Caltrans with their blessing  on the entire development of the master-planned area at this density that's  being proposed. Well, Bruce, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but where our  expertise and our judgment is asked for specifically as it relates to this  project is the subdivision map and the variances that are there on the design  guidelines. So that's what we're really hearing tonight is, are we,  okay with those modifications that are outside of the realm of what we deal  with? We don't deal with Caltrans. We don't deal with Cal Water. We look at  that as the overall, but the reason we're hearing this tonight is because of those  variances that they want on the design guidelines. Mr. Ewing, did you want to  weigh in at all? I see you up on my screen and you weren't before.  I had nothing to add. Thank you. Great. Thank you.  Any other discussion? I can just voice some thoughts. This isn't really a question for  anything. Can I just, now that he's on, can we just make sure to speak into the mic so he can  be heard? Thank you. Yeah, I can be kind of quiet sometimes. Sorry.  So,  one of the things I always look at in the staff reports is how the projects we're reviewing  comply with the general plan. And I wish I had time to read through the whole general  plan to see how well it complies. But I'm skeptical of some of the principles and policies  that are applicable. I do support the concept of building new housing, of course, but promoting  the construction of a range of high-quality housing choices that serve all of our communities.  I also I heard Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park Park  That is a gray area here, I would say, because this is within the city of Chico.  But for the most part, infill generally, to me, refers to areas that have already been developed within the city or have infrastructure already built there.  And there will be some new infrastructure built and got to build somewhere, I guess.  I have concerns that this is more sprawl and infill, more leapfrog, and not building the range of housing and increasing equal housing opportunities for all persons and households in Chico.  But I haven't made up my mind yet. Better do so quick. Thank you.  Thank you. Any further comments or motions?  Well, I'll propose a motion.  Sounds great. Thank you.  I move that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution 21-08, finding that the project is exempt from further environmental review and approving the Hicks Lane Vesting Tentative Subdivision Map,  parent S20-04, close parent, based on the required findings and subject to the conditions.  Indicated therein.  And to remove the word recommendations from page 9 of 10 of the subdivision report, Exhibit 2, Item K, on tree removal.  I'll second that.  Are you going to allow me to pass that?  Sure.  Okay.  Madam Chair, remember we have two new conditions to the fence and then the park.  Okay.  Can you remind me of the park condition?  It would read, if the Chico Area Recreation District is not interested in maintaining the 1.13 acre park, it will be part of the Chico Maintenance District and maintained by the CMD.  Okay. Is that okay with the motion maker and the seconder?  I accept that as a final amendment.  Okay. And then can you read some language please on the fence?  The chain link fence on the south side will be replaced with solid wall fencing.  Or solid fencing, not wall, sorry.  The chain link fence on the south side will be replaced with solid fencing.  Just as an added clarification on that fencing on the south side, it also has, from the back of the curb to that fence line, it's 12 feet.  So there'll be a nice landscape 12 foot buffer.  So there's pretty good screening and noise attenuation into this mobile home park.  Just a minor thing, but part of it is just wire fencing, not chain link.  So I think it ought to be just fencing on the south side.  Okay. We'll replace it with the fencing on the south side will be replaced with solid fencing.  Okay. And is that okay with the motion maker and the seconder?  Solid fencing, what do you mean?  In concrete, box, woods?  Thank you.  Okay.  Wood fence.  Wood fence.  I misspoke earlier when I said wall.  I meant to say solid fencing, which could be wood.  Then I accept that.  Okay.  Accept that.  That's good. Okay.  Any further discussion?  Okay.  Let me make sure I have this.  So we have a motion and a second that the Planning Commission adopt Resolution 21-08,  finding that the project is exempt from further environmental review and approving the Hicks Lane Vestings Tentative Subdivision,  map S20-04, based on the required findings and subject to the conditions indicated therein and the additional conditions that were so eloquently stated by Tina Wilson.  All in favor of the motion signify by saying aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  Aye.  So that motion carries 6-1.  Thank you.  So we'll move on to item five, regular agenda.  There is none.  Item six, reports and communications.  Bruce?  No, Madam Chair.  We do have a meeting.  We have another item at your first meeting in October.  Great.  Sounds fantastic.  So we will adjourn to the regular meeting of Thursday, October 7th.  Thank you.  Thanks, Vince.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, Madam Chair.
