Anyone wishing to address the council on any matter listed on the agenda should first fill out a speaker card found at the back of the chamber. Once completed, turn in your cards to the city clerk and the speakers are taken in the order. If the first speaker begins, no additional cards will be taken on that item. Persons demonstrating rude, boisterous speaking on matters outside the jurisdiction of the city council or engaging in otherwise disruptive behavior will be called to order. If such conduct continues, I may call a recess requesting removal of such persons from the council chambers, adjourn the meeting, or take other appropriate action if necessary. Closed session announcement. City Attorney, Mr. John Lamb. Thank you, Madam Mayor. City Council, earlier this evening, the City Council recessed in close session. The council has not taken any action on the items listed on the agenda. Just for the record, for clarification on the record, Council Member O'Brien was not present during roll call but arrived shortly thereafter and was present for all items. So for items 2.1 through 2.5, council heard those items in close session. Direction was provided. No final action was taken. That concludes my report. All right. Proclamation. We have a proclamation for Global Entrepreneurial Week proclamation. Do we have kind of an entrepreneurial... Here we are. It's my Grotech Fest friends. Yes, hi. I just got in Grotech Fest last week. It was so much fun. I highly recommend it. Anybody, if you haven't gone to it before. So in honor of Global Entrepreneurial Week, let's see how many times I can mess that word up tonight. November 17th to November 23rd, 2025. Whereas Global Entrepreneurial Week is a worldwide campaign and celebrated annually to empower entrepreneurs in every country and community around the globe, especially those who face structural barriers who may have never considered the idea of launching a startup small business. Yes. And whereas this year, Global Entrepreneurial Week... We celebrated November 17th to the 23rd, 2025 under the theme, Together We Build, highlighting the power of collaboration and collective innovation and strengthening entrepreneurial ecosystems. And whereas entrepreneurship drives innovation, fosters economic growth and creates meaningful jobs, opportunities, and contributing to a vibrant and resilient entrepreneurial community within the city of Chico. And whereas Chico Start serves as the global entrepreneur... Entrepreneurship Week community organizer for the city of Chico through Global Entrepreneurial Network. Who wrote this? I don't know. Partnering with the local business organizations, universities, colleges, business leadership to provide mentorship, training, and resources that nurture a thriving and cultural culture of entrepreneurship. And whereas inclusive entrepreneurship is essential to advancing diversity, equity, and opportunity and ensuring a sustainable and sustainable future for all. And whatever the city's growing entrepreneurial ecosystem, we're ensuring that every individual in Chico has the chance to succeed, innovate, and contribute to the city's growing entrepreneurial ecosystem. Now, therefore, let it be resolved that I, Casey Reynolds, the city mayor of the city of Chico on behalf of the entire city council do hereby proclaim November 17th to 23rd, 2025 Global Entrepreneurship Week and encourage all residents to recognize, celebrate, and support local entrepreneurs and the organizations that empower them to build a stronger community. Thank you. Awesome. There you go. Thank you. Would you like to say a little something? Is that okay? Yeah. Do you have a second? You have a second? Okay. Okay, that's it. No. I'll keep it short. So good evening, council members. Thank you so much for this opportunity. For those that you don't know me, my name is Eva Shepherd-Nichol, and I have the honor of being the executive director for Chico Start. We are a state-designated accelerating innovation hub, and we cover more than 20 counties in the North State. We're here tonight to proudly accept this proclamation for the Global Entrepreneurship Week, Chico, and to highlight the vital but yet often overlooked role of entrepreneurship and how it plays in strengthening communities. Entrepreneurship unites people across ideologies. Americans overwhelmingly agree that ensuring everyone has an opportunity to start and grow a business is essential to our country. And definitely to our city and region. At Chico Start, our mission is to build that entrepreneurial ecosystem and support founders directly, helping them start, grow, and thrive. All net new jobs in California come from businesses that are less than five years old. All net new jobs. That is why our work matters. Our outcomes speak for themselves. A new business launched, jobs created or retained, and dollars invested back into the city of Chico and this region. Now in our 12th year, we continue to see new founders, new startups, and new collaborations that move the entrepreneurial movement forward. Your recognition of Global Entrepreneurship Week, Chico, means so much to us, and we thank you for your continued support. We would also like to thank Mayor Reynolds, one more time, for providing the opening kickoff to Growtech Fest 2025, where we celebrate and elevate the entrepreneurial spirit. Thank you again. To all members of the board members, members of the board members, members of the board, members of the board members, members of the board members, members of the board members, Okay. I'll call you both up and you can line up in the middle aisle. Anika Rodriguez, followed by Leanne Powell. Good evening, Mayor Reynolds and council members. My name is Anika Rodriguez, owner of Anika Burke on Main Street and a downtown business operator for 15 years. First, thank you for supporting Free Parks on Fridays. This initiative marks a tangible difference for small locally owned shops that give downtown Chico its character. During the holiday season, our most critical time of year, removing the perceived barrier of parking helps drive much needed foot traffic and keeps people shopping local. Tonight, I'm also asking council to amend the resolution to include Friday before Thanksgiving known nationally as Pink Friday. Here in downtown Chico, we have 15 locally owned shops participating in the Free Parks on Fridays. This is a great opportunity for us to make a difference. As a city of Chico, we're very excited to be participating in our first ever downtown Chico Pink Friday initiative, a community-led effort encouraging shoppers to support small business before Black Friday. Including this date, Free Parking Friday would send a strong message that the city of Chico supports its small business community and recognizes the importance of a vibrant, thriving downtown. Thank you for your time and continued support of our locally owned shops. Let's hear it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Thank you for letting me have a few moments. My name is Leanne Powell, and I own the Peddler's Closet. I'm between 1st and 2nd Street, and I just want to ditto with what Anika just said. We would love it if you would let us have free parking Fridays during the holidays. We would love it if you would be able to amend it for Pink Friday this coming Friday. It's a small grassroots effort for all of the small businesses across the nation, and having free parking on a Friday would be fabulous from now until after Christmas. So thank you, and have a great evening. All right. Do we have any council disqualification? That's all our speakers, right? That's correct. Any council disqualifications? I forgot to ask earlier. No? Okay. I would like to pull item 2.5, but other than that, does anybody else want to pull anything else? No? Consider a motion. Madam Mayor, I probably should disqualify myself on 2.5. Oh, okay. Okay. Take a motion for the rest of... Move to approve the rest of the agenda, the rest of the consent agenda. Consent. Do I have a second? Second. A second. I make a motion and a second for the remainder, except for 2.5. All right. And that included an ordinance of the City of Chico adding Chapter 5.44 to the City of Chico Municipal Code to regulate massage therapy establishments within the City of Chico. That's the final reading and adoption. Thank you. Council Member Goldstein? Yes. Council Member Hawley? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? I'm recusing myself on this one, Debbie. This is not... This is consent. This is all... The remaining consent. Yes. I'm sorry. Okay. And it will be noted in the minutes that you disqualified yourself on 2.5. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Carrie? Aye. 7-0. Okay. And then I pulled 2.5 just because I would like to ask Director Ottomoni if there is a possibility of us taking action on having parking adjusted for this Friday. Yes. The one potential conflict might be in time getting the programming of the wording on the kiosks. But nevertheless, if the council direction is to make this coming Friday a free parking Friday, we can work with our staff and enforcement. If nothing else, not enforce that day and provide free parking. We will do our best to try and get that programming done on the kiosk so that there is a display message there. Council Member Goldstein? Yes. Glad you pulled this item because we received community feedback about this. Normally, I'm kind of a grinch about free parking, but for the holidays, I like the idea of helping our small business owners out downtown. So, yes. I... I would agree that we could make this Friday have free parking too. Vice Mayor Bennett? Anything to support downtown Chico. Thank you for bringing this up. Anybody else? Okay. I'll entertain a motion. Second. Oh, I'll make a motion. I'll make a motion that we direct staff to make this coming Friday, whatever, Pink Friday, also a free parking day. Okay. To the best extent possible. Okay. Council Member Goldstein? Yes. Council Member Holly? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeek? Oh, you are disqualified. Excuse me. Council Member Winslow? Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Carry 6-0 with one recusal. All right. Public comment. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the board. on the agenda and are within the jurisdiction's authority, the council cannot take action at this meeting on these requests made under this item on the agenda. How many speakers do we have? We have five. Okay. I'll call the first two names. And if you can line up in the middle aisle. Jason Anderson, followed by Jamie Howlington. To stop a little bit. To thank you for the opportunity to speak. To speak on behalf of SEIU and the members of the legislative committee. members of operations and maintenance and I will start by saying that we almost 110 of us definitely fully support the upcoming confirmation of eric as the assistant city manager. He has been overseeing our department for over a decade and was built from very few employees after the layoffs of 2010 up to what we believe is a very efficient group of individuals. To that point we also wanted to comment on the city council's decision to seek further contractual obligations in regards to operations and maintenance in particular. This is not new territory for us by any means we have been through this many times and the city has previously contracted out street maintenance and street trees in particular and contracted out the pickup and contracted out street sweeping at one point and every single one of those has been brought back in house due to either the increased expense in the end of each of those or the failed operations in particular. We are a specialized skill set group of people with very specialized skill set we' re not just picking up trash as some may see us we' re out there fixing traffic signals as you may have seen around town recently. We' re out there removing trees during storms and we' re fixing the roads and we are battling sort of degradation and the crumbling infrastructure of the town as it rapidly grows and is aging as well. On top of all that we also have a lot of work to do and we appreciate our jobs and do. As we appreciate our jobs we also do many things beyond our basic skills or our basic duties. We' re out there setting up the ice skating rink decorating the Christmas tree setting up for parades as well as picking up homeless encampments where it' s we do so diligently and we try to do as best a job we can while dodging dogs and needles and the waste that parking lots and parking parkways and outside the council chambers we' re doing that not downtown ambassadors that' s on top of all the other tasks we do on a daily basis. As far as contractors go when it' s storms and it' s time to do emergency call outs we' re not charging the city $800 an hour. We' re not getting rich off taxpayer dollars. That' s never our intent. Fiscal responsibility and fiscal solvency in this town is very important to us and we hope that should the results of director Lipsky' s sort of. Thank you. I hope you can accept that. Thank you. It may be better. Thank you so much. Thank you. Jamie Howington followed by Sharon Johnson. hi. So I'm a contractor and I'm working on a project called I just wanted to propose the idea of sobriety tests on public benefit recipients. That' s it. What do you guys think of that? Unfortunately we' re not allowed to go back and forth two ways but you' re welcome to tell us your information and then. I receive benefits and I live in hud housing and I see a lot of my neighbors just using all day and they' re driving me nuts. So it would be great if maybe that a law like that could be passed. So that' s okay. Thank you so much for coming and talking to us. Thank you. Sharon Johnson followed by G gold. Good evening council members. My name is Sharon Johnson. I' m here representing the California state retirees at our last meeting in October. I'm here to represent the state of California. We decided we would have a representative come to all of the council meetings so we can be your good neighbors as was said at the benediction this afternoon. So I' m just here to say hello. Nice to meet you all and look forward to meeting you every first and third Tuesdays. Thank you. Thank you. G gold followed by Lynn overholzer. Hi. My name is George gold. Wait. Remember what your mama said. Relax. Stand up straight. I spent 30 years in IT. You know, information technology. I configured, managed and supported all those devices that you all have never heard of that keep your bank accounts and your private information safe. When there was an outage which means either human or equipment failure and failover and or backup didn't work we had to perform what is called a root cause analysis to figure out what went wrong, what caused the outage so it won't happen again. The other day I watched a video of Chico cops killing a man in March 2025. What I saw was a man cornered in a parking garage gunned down by not one but at least a dozen shooters. Not the Taliban, not Hamas but the Chico police department rapid response team. What I saw in that video was not a disciplined rapid response team with a team leader directing traffic. It was a! What I saw were cops dressed up as gladiators that seemingly got their training through the evil Mickey Mouse club. Chaos that resulted in a master performance of incompetence. I heard the police negotiators say to the so-called target and I quote, that's why we don't want to shoot you and you don't want to get shot it's going to fucking hurt. This is a negotiation? Was this sort of warning covered in post training or was it just a! Was it covered in training? After the subject was already mortally wounded after a ceasefire command there were at least six more shots fired. It's hard to tell because of all the team had their weapons set to fire on automatic, fully automatic. All across this country there are extrajudicious police kidnapping police people off the streets and out of their living rooms. I always thought that the police would be the ones to blame. Chico doesn't do this. On any given day, any given parking garage, evil can happen. And what happened on that day in March right here in Chico was my Chico police being evil. What I saw in that video was a complete disregard for any sort of de-escalation or any sort of negotiating process and procedure. What I saw was gross negligence. When are we going to have a root cause analysis of why Chico police are so evil? When are we going to have a legal process and procedures? When are we going to know why Chico police department keeps killing its citizens? Thank you. Thank you. Lynn Overholzer. Well, I'm back. First of all, I just want to thank all of you for making the alternative site improvements an agenda item three times in the last couple months. I appreciate that and all the discussion. And I'm here to follow up on one item that I brought up a month ago. When you were considering ways to improve the alternative site, which is staying out at Eaton and Cohesit, I strongly recommended that you do an enforcement, a thorough and complete enforcement in the area. I know some other things were approved, including the! To provide security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security security As you know, it's in a B1 overflight zone. The residents around there are the shopping center across the street. I think if you decrease the number of people that are living around the alternative site, you're going to decrease the number of people coming and going that bring a lot of issues there and cause a lot of problems and safety issues for those of us who live around there, as you know. Four weeks ago, after I did finish speaking, Councilman Winslow did address Mr. Sorensen and ask how soon could an enforcement be done, and the answer was 20 days. And that was four weeks ago from tonight. 20 days that it could just start. I know it's a long process. I know what the process is. So I'm here to ask that I'm hoping that's in the works, and if it's not, I hope it will be soon. I did. I did say a month ago that I thought it had improved since June, and I think it had some, but it is growing. The number of people going there, I live by there. I go by there a lot. The number of people coming and going there is definitely, it is increasing in the last month. It is not the 12 people. It's not just the same 12 people I see all the time. I think that's maybe the number who's authorized to live there. I do think it was a really good idea that the Jesus Center would do some staffing there as part of the security. And I don't know. If that's the case, I don't know. I don't know if that has started, but I hope it does. I thought that was a great idea. I'm assuming that would be case management, not just security guarding. Anyway, so I don't need to bring up all the points I brought up before, but I do hope that an enforcement is done soon, and that every time people keep coming back and try to live around there, that it is done again. And I think that will go a long way to improving the safety, for everybody who lives there and around there. Thank you very much. Thank you. She was our last speaker. All right. Thank you. Item 5.1, mid-year financial update. We have a report from Barbara Martin, our administrative services director. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. thank you. thank you mayor reynolds vice mayor bennett and members of council thank you for your time this evening I' m going to go over some estimated final numbers for 24-25 fiscal year and how that plays into the 25- 26 fiscal year as you know back in may we were here talking at length about all the financial position of the city at that time there was a desire to readdress this later in the year when we have more final numbers as well as bring up a couple topics we wanted to talk about later in the year those will be brought up including the staffing of the fire engine one. The fire engine one and also there were a couple watch funds we brought up at the may financial presentation the sewer fund parking fund and private development fund I' m going to give you quick updates on those to let you know where we are with those as well. thank you. showing you what we have here focusing on the general and park funds which is our most discretionary revenues and expenditures. Everything is set up here the first column here is what you saw in may in terms of what we had estimated would be the numbers for the end of the year and then the second column is where we landed as of 24-25 I want to put a note here that the 24-25 numbers are still increasing. We are still closing the books and in the middle of audits we will know those better by the end of next month. The general funds are funds 1, 2, 5, 11 and 52 which include our general fund the parks fund and then the measure h fund that we have. Fund 11 is our fire victims trust fund and then fund 52 is all of our community outreach fund I can' t think of the name of this right now. I will go over what all of that is. First I will take a look at revenues. 24-25 revenues we had higher than anticipated revenues but in 25-26 we don' t expect that to continue for the most part. You can see we ended the year with $108 million in revenue over all of those funds with a projection of just under 1.5 million dollars. We have 1.1 million dollars which is a good thing. Some notable increases that we had for this year we had just over $750,000 worth of sales tax that was primarily due to we anticipated the closure of some significant sales tax producing entities that haven' t come to fruition yet but we do anticipate those in the next coming months so those increased revenues won' t continue as far as we know but again if things change we will let you know and we will adjust the numbers accordingly. Our measure h sales tax was about $500,000 higher than what we anticipated as well. Then our ut that' s our utility users tax this was the most significant ongoing revenue source that was higher than anticipated. We have a the utility users tax. Mostly in the electricity utility users tax so as rates increase and as consumers pay more for their utilities we received the taxes that are applied to that. So there was an increase there. Then other revenues of $4.6 million that is where the most significant change was and that is something that does not continue on a regular basis so it' s a one time thing for the most part. Other revenues that are the most significant for the year were intergovernmental revenue and then our interest revenue which is dependent on cash position for each of these funds at any given point during the year. With that we are looking into next year and you can see we' re looking to be pretty flat with the year. We are pretty flat with our revenues for next year. We haven' t made any adjustments to the ongoing revenue streams. We could most likely increase the ut the utility users tax amount but we' ve only had just over a quarter' s worth of information so far this year. We will look at that midyear and see if we can make an adjustment with that. looking on to how that affects the bottom line in comparison with expenditures. First off our operating costs are estimated to increase about 6% from last year to 25-26. That' s over all of the general fund items. Operating expenditures the most significant of course is salaries and benefits and! About a 5-6% increase year over year is generally what we see in those areas. That' s going along with trends. You can see our actuals for 24-25 landed just about where we anticipated that to be so that was a good thing in terms of operating. That means our departments are staying within their budgets when it comes to those things. Then what we have is the juxtaposition between that 6% increase and then what we have in terms of anticipated revenues we are looking at low to no increase in revenues even if we do adjust our utility users tax up by a million dollars that' s still not the same percentage increases that we' re seeing with the operating expenditures. We need to keep that in mind. You will see that the bottom line for 24-25 we' re ending with a cash balance of $66 million. That' s not to say we have $66 million to go spend with whatever we want with it. The majority of this is what we call rebudgets and at our last meeting there was a report provided to you in reports and communications about items that were scheduled to be expended in 24-25 but we moved them over to 25-26. The most significant of that ends up being in our capital improvement projects. You can see that we initially budgeted 72 just under $73 million worth of capital improvement projects in 24-25 and moved that over to $25-26. We moved about $50 million of that over to 25-26. That' s why the significant balance at the end of 24-25 and that won' t continue into 25-26. It reduces what we have available for 25-26. With that we' re looking at the end of 25-26 with a cash balance of just under $12 million and we take out of that the $25-26 balance that we We also take out the balance that and we take out what the measure h fund balance is and our fire victims trust dollars are as those are designated for specific uses and we don' t use that as the pool of money for surplus. In addition to that we also take out the amount that we want as a desired reserve which is 7.5% of our operating expenditures every year. With that we' re looking at about $4.3 million to $4.5 million surplus balance available for use per our budget policies. What we have in our budget policies is a designated use for those surplus balances. We put 50% to our section 115 pension stabilization fund and then 25% to the public infrastructure fund which is designated for capital projects for roads specifically and then the remaining 25% is equally split between the rest of our budget. facilities and then the two equipment for police and fire. Before we decide to move those surplus funds we do have some projects that need some funding. I put these in the staff report but just to go over them real quickly the alternative campsite additional security when you all approve the additional changes to the security and things over at the alternative campsite the price tag is about $250,000. With the red light camera enforcement we are remodeling a piece of the municipal center to allow for those offices and for doing the staff work that needs to be done there which is another $285,000. Then the second floor remodel that' s just about done and they need some additional funds for some extra areas that needed to change or were not in the original plan that was not considered in the original makeup that' s $68,000. The in building radio coverage that' s actually a larger project of about $133,000 but this is a $16,000 request I think it' s mainly for some extra reinforced cabling so it' s fire resistant. What that does is provides coverage in certain municipal areas that when our safety personnel go in there with their radios they' re not able to use their radios in there right now so it' s making it so they can do that. Then fire station 4 improvements there' s some need there in the older station of $190,000. With that we' re just over $800,000 requested and we' re asking you to approve that tonight so we can move forward and get those into our procurement. appropriations. If you do approve those use of those surplus funds there' s about $3.5 million that' s left and you can see the split here of how they would go per policy we' d get about $1.75 million into the section 115 pension stabilization $875 to public infrastructure and then $175 each to each of those funds. Just a note about the section 115 if we do transfer that $1,750,000 to that fund we' ll have just over $10 million in that fund and then just about $9.8 million in our cal pers unfunded liability reserve fund between those two that means we' ll have about $20 million available for future pension costs. That' s a good thing. Right now we' re looking at just under $20 million as one of our highest years of unfunded liability payments. I' Should times get tough and we need to tap into this we have that ability to do that which is good. Now moving on to more specified fund information I want to talk a little bit about our measure h fund that' s our 1% district sales tax that was approved a few years back. As I said earlier our anticipated revenue is pretty stable with just over $25.5 million anticipated going forward where we had the extra was in our interest. Our interest like I said before it is dependent on what the cash balance of a fund is at any given time. If we' re not spending the money as fast as we anticipated the fund receives more of the interest pool that we have allocated. This fund received just under $800,000. That' re looking for $500,000. You can see we haven' t budget anything for 25-26 yet. We' looking for we will probably bring something and adjust that going into budget season to modify it for what we know so far this year and then estimated for going forward. We try to be as conservative as possible with interest because you never know what the market is going to do. I want to point out we' re increasing costs that are being pushed into measure h and this is mainly for our safety personnel. As our other general fund revenues remain flat the increases for those costs get driven into this fund. We' re not increasing personnel per se but it' s the costs that aren' t being covered because the revenues aren' t increasing in fund one. s the cost that we have to pay for the other sales tax, other property tax, that sort of thing is not increasing at the pace it needs to so some of those dollars get pushed into measure h to pay for those services. Then with that, that means there' s fewer dollars for capital projects, roads, most specifically going forward and other measure h preferred items. But if we do end up with higher utility users tax, regular sales tax, higher, then we will be able to push some of these sales salaries and benefits dollars back into the other side which will free up dollars. With that I do want to talk a little bit about you can see on this I split out the police and fire because we did add some dollars for fire in measure h for 2526 and that leads us into the fire engine one staffing. This was a topic that came up during the budget sessions. We have a budget session that we will be weeks. At that time you all approved to add three new firefighters to our staffing and then also promote three captains and three engineers to be able to staff the fire engine one. It' s all effective as of January 2026 so those firefighters will go into the academy at that time. The total cost is $516,000. That' s salaries and benefits plus equipment costs and that sort of is it removes what we call the floater personnel from our abilities at this point. Currently we have floater personnel that cover leaves so them being a 24 hour operation whenever they' re sick or vacation or time off they either have to cover it with overtime or they have to cover it with this personnel. With what you approved in July we have enough bodies to put the people on the engine and we However there' s going to be an additional need for overtime because we don' t have those floaters to cover and then also or it may be a little bit more volatile with coverage of that engine because if they don' t have the people to cover the overtime they' re not going to be able to staff up to the levels they want to for any given time. The other option you were provided back in July was to add another three floater personnel. For the six months January to June it' s about a $285,000 additional cost because we' re reestablishing those floaters and then ongoing it will reduce the need for additional overtime because these firefighters are new they can' t be the coverage at the outset but ongoing they will be able to. With 26-27 with what you have currently approved so the three firefighters and the promotions The estimate is about a $1.3 million price tag for those new personnel and that includes the estimated new overtime cost for these folks. If you decided to add those three floater personnel it would be another $465,000 to the salaries and benefits line but it will offset the overtime dollars so it may be a wash but that' s kind of a nebulous calculation at this point so it needs some refining. question on that clarifying question do we have a range what that might be what we might save as far as overtime? it could be even or it could be a little bit less it really depends on overtime use and as of right now overtime is cheaper than an fte because you' re paying a one and a half rate but you' re not paying insurance you' re not paying calpers you' a chance if you are taxing your personnel so over time there may be a potential those people aren' going to want to do overtime for those periods of time it' s a choice cost savings versus being able to have more flexibility with staffing and able to guarantee those staffing numbers with the floaters. thank you. with that I will leave that to you all to decide how you want to go forward with that as I said we' re prepared with the three new firefighters staffing and getting those on board and the promotions would come later after the three firefighters went through the fire academy. Next I want to talk about just real briefly talk about the funds we' re talking about that we' re on the watch list. The first one is our sewer funds sewer enterprise fund and our capital reserve fund fund 850 I want to go over we implemented some rate increases a few years ago and want to go over where we thought we' d be as compared to where we are and what that means going forward. Our sewer operating fund this is just what we anticipate for revenues as you can see our revenues are revenue our rate increases were active as of the 23-24 fiscal year and then applied that year which did increase revenue by about 18% overall and then the out years increased a little bit going forward. It' s a little bit of a misnomer because the other fees and interest affect that overall increase. I want to focus on with the rate increases and the rate changes are that first line there which is the sewer service fees. You can see that the actuals for 24-25 and the projected for 25-26 with the rate increases there are automatic increases for cpi so in 24-25 it was just over 3% and then just under 3% for 25-26 so that' s how that flows out. However what we had originally anticipated was that those numbers would be a bit higher. You can see we had originally estimated the first year was going to be just under $18 million and then the cpi increases that go with that would have increased it that much more so that our revenue would have come out higher going into this year. What that means for us is one of the big pieces of the revenue increase is that we have to anticipate what the rate increases would be and the reason for that was to pay for capital needs going into the future. This is just a section from the rate study describing what the anticipation was for these needs and how it was going to play out with the rates. What we were focusing on is that first section of time which is $23 million through $27 million and what that will allow us to save and to pay for in terms of capital projects. As you can see it was looking for about $14 million in maintenance and capital projects at the plant and then paying for 50% of the collection system costs which is something that should theoretically be in our reserves to pay for at a future date. With that just kind of a split looking at putting into our reserves about just over $8 million a year and with cpi that would have been looked like that going into these first three years. Theoretically just for the collection system if we had actually used those dollars on the top line for projects going through the years and save those dollars for the collection system we would have just under $17 million in our reserve for the collection system at this point. This is kind of a busy slide but just to show you this shows you the two yellow lines the ending cash balance and the two ending cash balance and the ending fund balance kind of show you where we are right now with the funds. We have the capital reserve fund on the bottom and then the operating fund on the top. You can see that the capital reserve You can see that what we have been able to transfer into the capital reserve is lower than expected. The one year though 23-24 that was low because we did use some of the reserve for the sst pg and e solar projects so we knew that that was part of this. But we also received part of those funds back and we will be paying that back over time so there was that piece of it. What it means is we are anticipating at the end of 25-26 we will have just under $4.5 million available as a reserve. Harkening back to that $16 million target. If we had used what we had for the original projections if that had come to pass we would be looking at a bigger balance in our reserve and we would be looking at a looking at in the future although not quite exactly what we need. You can see that our transfers here would have been more out to the reserve fund and then our balance would be just over 11 just under $11.5 million in the sewer fund. I do want to point out here that we as part of the project we did not address all projections that I showed you earlier. One of that we did was to make it so the rates were not such a big spike was we did not address all the capital needs immediately. Pushed out some of those maintenance projects out to future years and in anticipation that would come later. We continue to see increasing costs and you can see projects line which is just above the total expenditures line. We have a $26 million capital project cost for 2526 $10 million of that is for our secondary clarifier or primary clarifier project which is a $10 million project and what we' re coming into now is that these capital projects that we' re pushing off because the revenue isn' t there we' re trying to balance what is The other thing that we see is that we are needing to do these capital projects now and as time goes on they become more expensive. We need to consider that going into the future. Again if you have any questions about any of this please let me know. Then real quick our other two watch funds first is the parking funds. The main thing with the parking fund is that our revenue is continuing to The actuals for 2324 were just under $1 million. Our actual revenue for 2425 is $870,000. Kind of a reduction overall but the biggest reduction is in our lots meters for whatever reason that is you can see it went from just under $400,000 to $300,000 in 2425. Some of the streets We are seeing some increase with ev charging charges so that is a positive. Then again as our cash balance goes down our interest earnings in that fund go down as well. Just about a 12% reduction. What this means for the parking fund in general is our fund balance is continuing to decline and we' re not able to put money aside in our parking fund. We have a rehab in our parking fund in our parking lots because we don' t have the cash for it. Our budget policies say we' re supposed to put $150,000 a year at least or 15% of our revenues into that reserve balance and we' re just not able to pencil that out right now. We' ve got increases in our operating expenditures of about 7% and that our revenue is going down. We' re continuing to watch it and continue to see how we can overcome some of those things and reduce costs and that sort of thing. It' s just something that is on our radar. Finally our private development funds. Part of the sales tax reduction is significant due to lower purchase of building materials and other materials and other materials that are being used in our parking lot. We' re just keeping aware of what that industry is doing going forward. Good news, the private development funds did better than what we had anticipated in 24-25. We anticipated the revenues would be just under $4.2 million. They came in at 4.3. You can see we had a spike in our revenue in the pre-measurement period. To $22.2 million. To understand the new budgets, it was $22.2 million. To understand the new budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets budgets the fund balance is higher than what we had anticipated as of the proposed budget which is a good thing but again continuing to monitor this the fund balance is there to cover storms so we' hoping we don' t have storms but we' re prepared at this point but keeping an eye on it. With that I' m done and if you have any questions. All right questions. Let' s start with councilmember van overbeck. fabulous job of budgeting revenues and expenses not only your department collects the data but also you vet it but the rest of the staff provided you evidently good numbers to work with. And I think the city manager I always think of a quote from jerry brown they asked him if he was a fiscal conservative and he said no I' m just cheap so thank you. So my question I' m going to get around to a question my question relates to engine one and so the options as I understand it are we approve additional overtime or we hire three more people in order to take the burden and the staff to take the burden off the employees. I have a question for the chief actually the fire chief. Mr. Hack is there a middle ground here and what' s your recommendation? I think we want to see this engine staffed. to begin with thank you very much and thank you to director martin and her staff. Their ability to do the projections is exponentially better than mine I ran out of fingers and toes pretty quickly but they do a fantastic job. The challenge with finding a specific number as you were asked for is it' s variable when we' re dealing with a constantly staffed fire department or any department for that matter that has a constant staffing you' re dependent upon the leave usage and sometimes that' s a little bit higher sometimes it' s lower. To get to the meat of the answer there was essentially two additional people to cover those overtime positions or increase overtime. I hesitate to give you a specific answer because it would be a best guess at this point. It would be less than that 285,000 number in discussions with director martin the other day I told her I think it' s better off to go with the status quo now with the understanding there may be a request for additional overtime at the end of the year or the fiscal year. The number should be less than $285,000. If I would have to guess I would guess it was more in the range of $150,000 based upon some of the things we' re trying to do. this is the additional overtime? correct. thank you. you said the status quo you mean right now having no floaters is this your status quo? correct as of the council direction that was made to hire overtime reserve. additionally with that methodology it will give us a better chance to see how the model works and to provide a better cost projection for you in fiscal year 26-27. and understanding that we can demonstrate the floater positions are cheaper than hiring overtime and making that decision at that time. thank you. a bit of a pivot in here but one of the reasons why I was looking forward to seeing this midyear budget review was when the decision was made to fund the fire engine we didn' t know what the repercussions would be for the amount of money we took out of the road maintenance budget because it all came straight out of there. I wonder if Mr. auduboni could give us an update on how that schedule has changed and what projects are able to happen and which ones aren' I think Ms. martin would be better to answer. I' m not familiar with the number specifically how that relates to that. we had to for various reasons had to take away about $7 million worth of roads projects this fiscal year. we do have some extra dollars in the fire victims trust fund I think just under $1 million. we have a $7 million budget we have a $7 million budget budget that will go into the public infrastructure fund. the ongoing cost piece of it is what we' re still working through in terms of measure h. that goes back to my bringing up the point about the salaries and benefits because if we need to push more into measure h then that will reduce the ability to have those dollars. m prepared to bring an update back once we get all those finalized depending on what your decisions are tonight. can you repeat what the funds for the public infrastructure fund left over because I thought I read a different number than I heard. that' s just if you that was what was in the staff report was without the allocation of the dollars for the projects. again it' s preliminary numbers but it' s to give you an idea. we do end up with a $3.5 million surplus balance will be sending $875,000 to the public infrastructure fund. thank you. there' s a particular project I' m concerned about falling off it' s a grant funded project for north cedar we only need to provide our matching funds I think this is something that' s been waited for a long time it' s a concentration of low income people and high density housing it' s a problem. s a problem. it' s a problem. it' it' s a problem. s a problem. it' it' s a problem. s a problem. it' s a problem. it' s a problem. s a problem. it' s a problem. it' s a problem. it' s a problem. it' s a problem. it' s a problem. it' s a problem. it' s a problem. new anticipate that would be one that' s going to be affected but there' s no question we' seeing a shift in measure h funds going from capital to police and fire salaries that' s a fact. Every bit we add to that whether it' s by natural increases in operating costs or additional personnel it does take away from the potential for future capital projects but again I don' t think that' s going to suffer. councilmember goldstein. first towards the beginning of these slides there was other revenue that was a few million dollars can you remind me what that came from? the other revenues is intergovernmental! I think it' financial revenue and interest and to break that down our interest earnings amongst all of these funds because of the higher cash balances was about $2 million, $2.8 million of that and then the other significant items are we had some unanticipated revenue from mutual aid reimbursements so that has been a big part of the revenue that we get from the! So we had a lot of revenue from the So we had a lot of revenue from the the the the! We had a lot of revenue from our our our our our our So one of the items that we' re looking at allocating funds for was improvements to fire station 4 can you elaborate on what those improvements are? I can take it real quick it was the flooring interior of the entire station and the rear concrete apron needs to be replaced. That' s a strong need to do right now? Yes it' s impacting fire apparatus as they ingress and egress into the station and it' s old original and quite a bit of concrete that needs to be replaced. thank you. Initially I was going to ask based on the staff report it looked like there was over 4 million surplus and I was wondering if basically these projects shown on the screen were going to cut into the budget. I think you' ve already answered that question and I think you' ve done a good job of breaking down all of these numbers so thank you so much. I also have concerns obviously about being able to fund our roads when we decided at the budget hearing to staff fire engine 1 I expressed strong concerns with cutting into our roads budget further so that' s more of a discussion for later but echoing the council member winslow' s questions and comments about how we can make sure we' re funding projects so I guess my question here is in the 875,000 I believe are there projects earmarked within that for the infrastructure fund? I would say right now we' re in the process of preparing all of our 2026 projects to advertise for bid we' re also closing out all of our 2026 projects that we working on the 2026 projects through that process essentially we' re closing out projects and any unused dollars will roll over into the upcoming projects so we' ll identify what those needs are to complete the 2026 projects you mentioned north cedar there' s a little bit of a funding shortfall the reep funds the grant funds were reduced I believe last year so this would be a little bit of a!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pricing and the contractors are preparing for the backlog for the following year and they' re aggressive in their pricing and so we' ll see when we advertise and ultimately close the bids and get our low bid pricing. I don' t see you saying we really need to take from any of these other funds here but I was prepared to suggest that if we are really short on our roads funds since we had taken money directly from there to fund fire engine one staffing that maybe we could consider looking at these numbers and if there was any wiggle room to wait to fund more of the pension stabilization fund or something else. I' m just putting that out there if needed I would support better funding our public infrastructure fund but it sounds like we may not need to take that action yet. vice mayor bennett. thank you. I think the city manager said it well that unfortunately it appears that some of the measure h funds are being siphoned off into public safety however that is part of what measure h was intended for. I agree with councilor van overbeck I think engine one is critically important to the city of chico I think it' s a need that has not been fulfilled for quite a few years. it' I think the reality is there' s only so much money to go around and h has provided money for improved public safety critically important as well. It' s a reality there isn' t enough money to fund everything but again I think engine one is 285,000 it will be 1.3 million in the future I guess if I heard you correctly. thank you very much. I' m going to continue to support engine one and I think we need to move very cautiously as director martin does so well he does a fantastic job of keeping us on track and this is one of those things we' re going to have to absorb in one way or another. those are my thoughts at this time. thank you. thank you. thank you. council member o'brien. I' m going to allow the public to comment before we go any further I want to echo some of the comments that were made as far as money spent on public safety from my perspective that is money well spent and I will always support that. that will always be one of my priorities and funding engine one was critically important this last go around I' m going to support it again. but I will never say that is not money well spent it is and I' m proud to support that. all right. how many speakers do we have? we have one. all right. three minutes. okay. just a moment. let me get the screen back. okay. our speaker is jesse horgan. good evening. I' m jesse horgan. just to remind you I' m the parking services manager for chico state and the head of the alternative transportation committee. I' m here today on behalf of the university to express support for the city to prioritize funding on public works. especially the north street. we have a lot of students that come to campus through this corridor. this is the neighborhood that serves as an interest to campus on the northwest side. this neighborhood has a high percentage of students that come to campus through these corridors. so these improvements directly serve our population. as well as families visiting, touring the campus, prospective students, they often come to the campus through this corridor. so these improvements will help us to both improve the experience for our current students as well as those who may be coming and considering chico for their education. we want to be sure that funds are the matching funds for the grant are there so that we can keep these funds in our community and these projects funded so that they can be used for we want to be sure that they can help improve our image and our aesthetics and our experience for our residents. thank you. thank you. that was it. all right. further discussion by council. council member holly. i would just like to urge the rest of my colleagues to take action now to try to supplement what has been stripped of public work engineering budget in our last budget cycle. $7 million again was taken away from that 10-year plan. and i understand the reason for budget policy d.1.c for that 50% to go into the pension stabilization fund. but i'm hoping that we can have some leeway. whatever amount of money will get me one at least four votes. it's critical that we have an equitable lens when we're allocating our money. and if we already took a lot of this money from public works engineering having a surplus is the perfect time to allocate just a smidge of that money back. and yes we have allocated $875,000 to the public infrastructure fund. but compared to what was lost in the last budget cycle i would say that we need to override d.1.c and we're the only people who can do that. thank you. thank you. well said. i agree. vice mayor bennett. are you suggesting that we modify the budget policies? one time? or more than one time? is this a single request? or is it a modification of the budget policies such that it would be ongoing? thank you so much for the follow-up question councilmember bennett. i am only suggesting a one-time override because of the specific circumstances of last budget cycle. i think it's really admirable that this budget policy was passed especially because our pension stabilization fund is so critical. and i think we should keep that budget policy in future years. but because of the specific circumstances right now right here. i'm not going to say where i live in public but i utilize north cedar quite frequently so i'm well aware of its condition. we need to ensure that this is not kicked further down the road for sure. as was already stated by miss martin who did a wonderful presentation. thank you again. it only results in capital improvement projects being more expensive because of that specific industry's material skyrocketing. not only that. but there's even longer and more opportunity for residents to submit vehicle damage claims. councilmember winslow. i'm going to be the one to pivot again for a second. i'm thinking councilmember holly. because there was one conversation here which i think we're on the same page on as far as removing the floaters now and seeing how that goes. i just want to mention i thought one of the fire guys might have spoken on this. but i recall the first time the engine one proposed a floaters. i think the first time the engine one was brought by the union to me that was the preference of the union. because it was mentioned how having people work overtime more often is taxing on the workforce. but i think that's pretty sure that's consensus from their side too. as far as ensuring the north cedar project gets funded if we could suffice with just direction to staff to prioritize that in the use of the public infrastructure funds. maybe that would suffice. that's what i'm hearing. it sounds like we might have a later item in order to review that more thoroughly. if any direction from staff and the west course. i think what this report demonstrated to all of us is that we have our city budget in the hands of extremely competent sober grown up people. and we don't want to change the budget. i think that's a huge mistake. i don't want to change the budget policy. i think it would be a huge mistake. because of whatever the current concern is. i have a question for the city clerk. and that is as it relates to staffing for engine one do we need to make a motion on that right? because we have a decision between adding the three people or doing the overtime. or can it just be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. it doesn't have to be. and and to see if you wanted to make any other adjustments rather than not bring forth that information. Really no action is needed to move forward with the plan as it was already directed and staff engine one eliminate the floaters with the knowledge that over time will increase accordingly. you' re seeing that' s done. s done. we don' t need to do anything. that' s what we passed with anticipation of looking at this during budget season if we wanted to add those additional three positions. what I heard the fire chief say is he wants to play it out until june by adding over time and seeing how that goes. that' s what he said. I think that' s what he was saying. that' s what I heard him say. it won' t be quite june. we will have to substantially have the budget formulated certainly by april. I' m sorry you may need to help us out here chief hack. what I heard you say is that you wanted your recommendation was to move forward increase the over time amount and then you' d get some clarity around what to do with we can make the decision later? my recommendation would be to move forward with the status quo which you have already approved with the understanding that there may be the previous estimates for the over time that were added in there may not be sufficient in my opinion and maybe a little short. I take fiscal responsibility very seriously and I wanted to raise the concern that initial assessment by the former fire chief may have been a little bit shy. the opportunity to do that in addition to talking about the floater position. my recommendation would be to move forward with the status quo with the understanding there may have to be a slight budget augmentation in may or whenever that process occurs. I did get it right the first time. thank you. as far as council action required the staff report says staff recommends the city council consider allocating a portion of the surplus to amend the budget policy in order to say including in these one time projects would be the north cedar project. I suppose so but we are still at the mercy of for example we could go out to bid and maybe we don' t get any bids. maybe we get completely ridiculous bids I don' t think that' s going to be the case but I' m saying there are some things out of our control. I think we will continue to as far as the use of the surplus funds what we are asking for just those few items that I put in the presentation and in the staff report currently when we do close the books and have the final numbers will bring back the supplemental appropriation request for moving the surplus funds per the budget policy. if it' s not something that needs to be done in the future we will I think the only thing that is a consideration now is if you want to reduce the allocatable surplus funds by that 800,000 that is needed for those projects. that' s the most time sensitive. wouldn' t increasing those allocatable funds also be on the table then? budget policy. can you rephrase that? you' re saying we have the option to reduce the allocatable funds but not to increase them. m saying the surplus is going to be the surplus. what you do with that surplus is provided by budget policy but you are always able to override that with a majority vote. what we' re requesting tonight is those projects that aren' t funded right now we know there' s going to be surplus to fund those asking you to fund those now and then once we do have the audited financials we' ll bring back the rest of the surplus funds estimated about three and a half million dollars at that time you can decide if you want to move those funds or not. re going to have to allocate them per what the budget policy says or if you want to allocate them to other means at that time. we' ll have a better idea at that time too of how the projected road projects are going to be and that sort of thing. we may even have bid results on north cedar. north cedar will go out to bid. thank you for that elaboration. i appreciate it. mr. spurton can i clarify i believe you said earlier there' s nothing right now that' s stopping north cedar and you don' t see north cedar from not being done and if there was something that was stopping that you could bring that back? we could take care of it then? s true. just clarifying i thought you said you do not see north cedar going off the radar. i don' t. councilmember o'brien. thank you mayor. i agree we don' t have to spend some of that surplus i agree. by the way barbara you did a fantastic job on this and the rest of the staff. thank you city manager as well. i think we need to approve the 809.4 for those projects. we have to do that tonight. expenses that we did not anticipate i think we need to do that tonight. i think the rest of that can wait. we don' t have to spend money just because we have it in our budget. we can wait and make a wise decision a little bit later. but we do need to spend that 809.4 i think to these unanticipated costs we need to cover that. i think that' s a no-brainer. let' s do that and hold off on the rest of it and go from there. councilmember holly. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. mayor i have a clarifying question i believe it might be for our clerk. so at this point in time the remaining surplus balance will be heard at our budget next budget cycle. no action can be taken on that item now. the remaining surplus will be an item we bring it annually along with our financial statements so it will be in the probably january or february time that will bring that and generally we just bring it according to budget policy this is what we' re proposing to do at that time. you can make a pivot if you need to. okay as long as this will be returning. yes i absolutely agree with councilmember o' bryan that this 809.4 ought to be allocated now especially one of the larger items the alternate campsite additional security. that' s been identified as such a high priority i think across the board by all seven of us. councilmember guilson. it also sounds like if we wanted to ensure there is going to be enough funding towards our infrastructure improvements that we could allocate that now with that 809. one argument that i would make for that is again we took a lot of money out of the roads program. we had a lot of money in the budget hearing and it would be good to know that we have those funds to be able to plan ahead for what kinds of improvements we can make. i still fully support the idea of adding i don' t know an exact number but maybe an extra 500,000 of it back to the roads fund because of how much we took out previously. i will make a motion that we approve staff' s recommendation of the additional appropriations and additional adding an extra 500,000 of those surplus funds to our public infrastructure fund. I will second that. I will make a substitute motion. that is simply approving the recommended one-time appropriation of 809.4 for those projects that are we will approve those projects as listed in our documents and that' s it and we can have a discussion on the rest of our surplus at a later date. that' s my substitute motion. second. we will take the substitute first which was to accept staff' s recommendations and fund the 809.4 hundred. and bring back the rest of the surplus funds for future discussion. council member goldstein. no. council member holly. no. council member o'brien. yes. council member van overbeck. yes. council member winslow. no. vice mayor bennett. yes. we will have that in february or january when we have that full report. because I want to see cedar taken care of. 5.2 consideration of median roundabout safety ordinance. we have our police chief bill aldrich. can I just thank you and say thank you to all our lovely and amazing public works crew for coming out today and making our city beautiful. and we appreciate you. I know you' re going to slowly but surely start losing you but we do want to thank you guys for all you do. we know you do a lot. sorry I was out of order. I' m ordering myself down. all right. good evening. mayor, vice mayor, members of council, city staff and members of our community. thank you for coming out today. thank you for letting me come in tonight and present an idea that I have. ve been working on for a while. as you know one of my jobs as the chief of police is to always be looking for creative ways to either use technology or city ordinances or staffing movements to create a safer chico to live, work and recreate within. and one of the areas that we are seeing some significant issues in terms of safety and safety of our community is the and the safety to our motorists and pedestrians in the city is just that. pedestrians on the streets. tonight I want you to know that I have worked with city staff significantly with our city staff, our city attorney. I have met with most of you. I think the only one that I did not get a chance to meet with personally was council member holly. and went over the idea that I have for an ordinance in terms of removing people from the ability to use the public transportation and that is the ability to remain or stop, stand or remain within medians, roundabouts and pedestrian refuges around the city. with that I will get started with my presentation here tonight. I just want to say that I have set the bar a little higher than my colleague assistant city manager as I have gone to canva and not powerpoint. I just want you to look at this slide for a moment. I will just give you a little bit of a look at the slide for a moment. in 30 months and the reason I use 30 months was when I started this project I went back to when we started our new rims database system in our dispatch center. that was 30 months at the time. during that 30 months we have had 95 vehicle versus pedestrian collisions in the city of chico. do the math. it comes out to roughly three, what is that, three a month? I think that is about a quarter of a million. it was around the new rims. it was around the new rims. it was around the new rims. it was around the new rims. it was around the new rims. it was around the new rims. it was around the new rims. it was around the new rims. it was around the new rims. city and like I said me as the police chief one of my jobs is to try to find ways to create a safer roadway and street system in the city of chicago. Of those 95 collisions this is a heat map that shows you where they' re at around the city I have a couple more images for you shortly the red circles as you notice are mainly in intersections within the city. This is at 20th street the entrance to the mall and hobby lobby just to the north there is the entrance to the mall and then to the south is hobby lobby you will notice the design in that entire intersection there' s four center medians and then the red circles mall. We currently have a problem with people standing stopping or remaining within all of these medians we recently had a collision where subject was standing in the median here at the hobby lobby entry exit point and as a motorist was coming out they made the turn a little too soon hit the median struck a pedestrian and broke his leg. This intersection here is at now I can' t even that' s the east avenue complex there west east avenue for railies and save mart as you notice there' s a median at the save mart entrance exit and there' s also just that one there. We have a large amount of people who gather in this area throughout the day we also have people who gather on the east avenue complex who gather in the corner here at the old baskin robins just behind it. This here is the intersection of 20th street and forest. Notice there' s medians in the center of each of these lanes we have a problem with people standing stopping and remaining in all of these medians. Unfortunately this is also where some of the fire folks that do the fill the boot would do their activity and in all fairness I had a conversation with chief hack about that and let him know this would be an ordinance that would affect all people including firemen trying to fill the boot. And then these are unique this is at mangrove and valabrosa you notice those triangles there the those are called pedestrian refuges what that is meant to be a stopping point if you entered the intersection to cross and the light changes or traffic gets congested it' s a refuge for pedestrians to stop and wait until it' s safe to cross. That' s all. We have people that gather in these triangles also there' s four of them in this intersection can' t see that southwest corner one refuges at the freeway entrance and exit there at 8 and 9 by the police department. So what' s the research results? Looking at the federal highway administration research has shown that the pedestrians that remain in those areas significantly increase that exposure risk of accidents with pedestrians. So we have a lot of driver distractions and once we get a driver who' s distracted we know what happens accidents occur people get injured thus the reason in 30 months we had 95 collisions with pedestrians around the city. What can we do to help? In my opinion I think we just simply by reducing the amount of time a pedestrian is remaining in those locations whether it' s in a median at a roundabout or in a pedestrian refuge I think that simply by itself removes the hazard and will reduce will essentially decrease all of those accidents we have in those intersections. So what is my how and what? I know you' ve had a chance to review the ordinance that I' ve worked with the city attorney on and I' ve spoken to many of you about it or all of you about it and I think that the city attorney has been very supportive and I think that it' s my recommendation that the city move forward with a city ordinance restricting the standing stopping and remaining within our medians intersections and entry exits to retail shopping within the city of chico. I looked around to see what other cities have a like ordinance we' re not unique in this I did not come up with this out of my own mind when I grew up in north carolina we had one that was in place that' thinking about it so I did a little research and these are cities across the nation that have it you' ll notice something significant there a majority of them are in California. So with that I' d like to answer any questions you' re concerned you may have. I' ll start down here on this side. I' m more conservative about making sure that I' I was looking into what' s the justification here. You mentioned one there' s a guy' s leg was outside of the median and he got hit. I went on a ride along recently and there was somebody asleep on one of those medians. Not a great place to be asleep. I looked into some of these other ordinances and tried to find some others. Windsor California is one you didn' the judicial notice portion of their ordinance because they were concerned about some legal issues there would be with this. In particular about first amendment stuff. Basic question which you can punt to the attorney if you want is how is this reconciled with free speech rights? Go ahead. Councilman, mayor, if I may. I think the difference between our ordinance and the city of Windsor is that we are not focusing on first amendment activity. We' re prohibiting any activity regardless of whether it' s protected activity or non-protected activity. What you see a lot of times our city' s targeting certain conduct such as panhandling or whatever it may be. That becomes a content based regulation. Courts have looked at panhandling as protected first amendment speech. I believe maybe, Addison, that' s where that issue came from. I think we are prepared a content neutral time place and manner restriction. As the chief mentioned, one of the concerns early on was fire department doing fundraisers, things like that. We realized that would be a problem to make an exception for that. I think the chief spoke to chief hack and basically said this is probably something we' ll have to revisit and figure out what other ways are there to fundraise other than the boot fundraiser. Our ordinance was really focused on people being there that shouldn' t be there on those medians. Regardless of what activity they' re doing, it creates the potential risk as the chief indicated. Do you think the boot fundraiser poses a public safety issue? Absolutely. Absolutely. Another thing I noticed, you noted on one of the ordinance, San Rafael, it wasn' t any medians. It was specified to a particular length. I can see we have a lot of medians. We put trees in them. Those are obviously much wider. Some of the islands are less than the narrow strip we' re seeing in some of the intersections you showed. Another one I looked up, Tulsa, you didn' t note it but it' s just for 18 inches. It' s four foot for San Rafael. In Windsor, they note in their findings around it, I think they' re anticipating getting sued. They say the town engineer found pedestrians loitering and lingering on small medians is a public safety issue. They specify they' re small medians. I wonder if that' s a better direction to go is to specify when they' re very narrow. That' s an issue. If they' re a bit wider and people are standing because they' re advertising something or fundraising or whatever, at the intersections where people typically solicit, those are going to be small medians because they' re functioning as traffic dividers. We don' t put trees up to the ground. Those are my findings on the issue. Councilmember Vandenberg. Chief, I think it' s a no-brainer. Thanks for bringing it forward. I support it 100%. Councilmember Holley. Thank you, Chief. I understand this was a collaboration with other departments. I think through email I was excited to see some examples of other California cities that are in the same I think you have a lot of cities that have like ordinances and you provided a whole bunch that was really, really helpful to look through. I only have one question. Most of the other cities with median safety ordinance are limited to medians and traffic islands. Ours, of course, includes roundabouts, which makes sense because Chico has a lot of roundabouts, but I was curious why the addition of, and I quote, within or adjacent to retail driveway exit and entry, along public roadways? That last bit there. Sure. I can explain that. Let me go back here. So, right there. So this is the 20th Street with the mall and Hobby Lobby. So these medians here actually are onto private property. But the median is on the street but we can enact ordinances that are applicable to private property. And so these medians create a lot of the problems for us, specifically the one here on the Hobby Lobby entrance exit. So the idea was to word it as such that any of these kinds of medians that extend from private retail shopping like this onto a public street would be applicable to the ordinance. Okay. Sorry, follow-up question to that. Because I had assumed that those were medians, obviously as a result of not meeting with you. Sure. So that, I'm pointing like you can see, so the sidewalk corners themselves in the entry and exit points of the shopping centers, those would not apply. It would only be the strip of median. Yes, the idea is the medians that extend out. Okay. Perfect, thank you. Council Member Golsi. Thank you. First, thanks for the detailed staff report. Thanks for taking the time to talk about this with me. And I appreciated the collision statistics and maps in the report especially. I think they highlight the broader need for pedestrian safety in Chico. And my one question that I still had in my mind was just to make sure, this doesn't apply to crosswalks, does it? Or if so, how does it apply to them? So, I think the question is, are you, so the example would be someone is just standing, stopping, or remaining in a crosswalk? Yeah, you explained that if they're blocking traffic that that's already illegal, so. Correct. So, yeah, a person can't just stand out in the roadway in a crosswalk. There's a vehicle code section that already is applicable to that. This would apply simply to the medians, people that stop, stand, or remain in the medians themselves. Okay, great. So it just doesn't add anything for that. So there's already sections for people blocking roadways. That's what I thought. Thank you for clarifying. That's all I had. Council Member O'Brien. Just a quick comment. First of all, outstanding, not PowerPoint, but Canva presentation. You did raise a bar there, Chief Aldridge, so well done. I can see the Assistant City Manager, his eyes are already getting big and he wants to go bigger than what you just did. Black and white versions too. But well done with the report. Really, like Council Member Manoverbeck said, this is a no-brainer. It's a public safety issue. And I'll let the public speak before I make a motion, but I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention. Thank you. Okay. And I just want to say that this would not prevent somebody from doing something on the sidewalk. So if they wanted to fill the boot and send people into a parking lot to do something on private property or anything like that, or any other fundraiser type thing that would be happening, kids doing whatever, they can stand on the sidewalk safely and say, hey, we're doing this over here. We've contracted with the Chico Sint Mall and you can come in and do something and we'll do it for you. And it's nice and safe in there and we're not worried about people getting run over and all that good stuff, correct? The only thing that would apply during that would be, I believe it's the Chapter 19, correct, where it's the signage. Any kind of signage a person holds within an area like that, we have a rule on that if it blocks the vision of motorists, then we can remove that and remove them from the location or they have to remove the sign. Okay, perfect. Thank you. All right. How many speakers do we have? We only have one. All right. We'll take our speaker and then... Okay. And that is Freddie Wright. City Council, Mayor and Vice Mayor, thank you for your attention. My name is Freddie and I'm a resident of Chico. I primarily ride my bike, walk, drive my car, and take the bus in town in that order. I would like to address the proposed Chapter 1036 to Title 10 in the Chico Municipal Code, which in your staff recommendation prohibits pedestrians on medians and other roadway areas. I would like to address the staff recommendation directly and provide my own analysis of the situation and finally propose an alternative to the flat-out prohibition. First of all, it appears to me like an anti-loitering ordinance, that pedestrians may spend too much time at an intersection, particularly a median. I can personally say I've spent far too long on a median myself, but not by choice. I was stuck between waves of traffic, amounting to roughly two minutes of waiting, which is not that rare. Is waiting for traffic prohibited by pedestrians? And what if pedestrians exercising their First Amendment rights, standing at a corner of signs? As the first paragraph of this prohibition recommendation states, the city currently experiences vehicular and pedestrian conflicts in areas where retail use driveways enter or exit private roadways and where medians, roundabouts, raised or planted islands are used by pedestrians to wait, remain or stand. What if motorists blocking sidewalks or drive-throughs, of taking up entire lanes turning into the drive-through? Is there an ordinance for this? And we already talked about how the sidewalks won't be affected, so I want to correct some of that. But will it double dip in the citations is my question. Does somebody also get penalized by state traffic laws as well as this ordinance for the same infraction? The recommendation continues to say that pedestrians become an obstruction or distraction. Pedestrians, as I've implied before, are at the mercy of traffic flow. The inaccurate wording and reducing the number of pedestrians to mere obstacles in the road is disrespectful of the pedestrian situation and vulnerability. And third more, these types of ordinances can be used to profile, discriminate and intimidate pedestrians not unlike historic anti-loading laws. The solution is not to ban when we're forced to wait. The solutions provide safe crossings and more of them. Many intersections have inadequate or improperly labeled or lit crosswalks. Surely $10,000 in road signs could be used instead to provide median crossings such as what we see across Esplanade, East First Avenue and Lindbaum as well as Pine, Cypress and East 12th Street. And eventually add crosswalks, lights and lit crosswalks such as Cohasset near Esplanade or the one on Park Avenue. Please consider the safety of our most vulnerable population. Thank you. Thank you. And that's it. Alright. Consider a motion? So I will make a motion if the conversation is done. And the motion is to approve. We can have a motion on the floor. Second. Let me finish. So if you want to make a comment before I make a motion that's perfectly fine. Go ahead. Well we can have a motion on the floor and then discuss it. Okay. Alright. So I'm going to make a motion to approve an ordinance of the City of Chico adding Chapter 10.36 to Title 10 of the Chico Municipal Code prohibiting pedestrians on medians and other roadway areas. Madam Clerk, is that correct what I just read? Yes, it's an introductory reading. Thank you. That's all. Second to second time. Okay. Council Member Hawley first and then Council Member Colson. Thank you, Mayor Reynolds. To address some of the speaker's concerns, I do want to say in the final ordinance some key provisions include exceptions for crossing movements, lawful walking, permitted work or emergencies. Additionally, there are some exemptions listed like vehicle disablement, imminent danger, medical necessity, and assisting others. So first wanted to address that concern for sure. Secondly, sometimes the democratic process can have contradictions and this is one area where I'm having a lot of internal push and pull. On one hand, we've had some really unfortunate circumstances already pointed out by our Chief which make it a safety concern not only for drivers but also for people who are sitting in the medians. Secondly, I also have concerns although time, place, and manner provisions apply and this will be enforced equally across communities, I think it's pretty obvious to everyone who lives in Chico that this will disproportionately affect houseless residents or people who are living in the area. I would like to open the conversation to see if there would be any interest in making an adjustment that we specify how narrow the median is although there is currently emotional affliction. I would support considering that. I don't think there is any I don't know if others would comment first or you can substitute a motion. I will make my quick comments first. Again, supportive of traffic safety measures, I am also concerned that this is too sweeping of an ordinance and that it could have unintended effects even if our intent is good to prevent people from I don't want to criminalize the use of public spaces beyond where there is a clear safety need. As council member Winslow mentioned, there are cities provided in the list who have ordinances that are limited to a certain median with. I believe that if we are genuinely concerned about people sitting or sleeping on a narrow roadway and being worried about them stepping onto or falling onto the roadway, that is something that we should I would also echo the public speaker' comment about how we should also ensure that we are planning ahead for broader pedestrian safety. We look at these maps and statistics in this staff report and we are seeing numerous pedestrian collisions a year and that doesn't even cover pedestrian and bicycle collisions, cars hitting bicyclists. There is a much broader issue beyond this Thank you all especially as a reminder for discussing investing in our public roads. Back to council member holly. We have a motion and a second. We can take discussion before we vote on it. This comes up all the time. Most organizations that run with Robert shills of order they put a motion before discussing things. It sets where we are at so we don't have to do that. I will add a couple more my angles on this. First thanks to the chief officer for bringing out this ordinance before it was fully done and getting feedback on it. One of the things I recall from the discussion I remember about a year ago council member van overbeck agendized a discussion on criminalizing panhandling or aggressive panhandling. I think the reason why that never came forward is because we found this does this is a first amendment issue to the constitution. We are going to have to do that sort of thing. I think even if we can say that we are going to apply it to everybody so even maybe people are doing something fine there but we are going to enforce it anyway and that makes it okay. I don't think that affects my feeling and my responsibility to uphold what my sense of the constitution is and free speech. I see these historic pictures of Chico especially downtown and you see people all over the streets like people I think the city doesn't change and that's why it's illegal to walk on a freeway. The idea of declaring all the public roadways are like that in essence and will be I am not quite comfortable with. I was trying to think about what the things people would be doing in the mediums that would be okay. We have people asking for money and some of the cases it poses a danger and that's why the cities when they were trying to address the public also be blocking your view and it was more targeted. Thinking of the things people might be doing I think of the Salvation Army fundraisers that traditionally be like out in the streets and asking ringing bells. I think of people out there like taking photos that's the thing that people do sometimes but one that like sticks out to me the most is anywhere you go in the world you see people unions picket in the street on the medians that you do this for visibility right and there's a reason why we guarantee that people have the right to demonstrate in that way because we don't always have other opportunities and we could come up with all kinds of ordinances that could push protests into further more marginal places we can have a designated free speech area for the city just like Chico State does on their campus right. I don't think that's the way to go so I'd support make a substitute motion saying that we request an ordinance be amended to be somewhat circumscribed specifically to specify that we're looking at banning loitering on a median when it's four feet or smaller that's the largest circumscribed the largest circumscribed amount that I saw in any of these ordinances four feet and that would be my motion. I would second that motion. All right we got a substitute motion and a second I'll take that one first. Okay and what was the width of the median? Four feet. That's what I got okay thank you. So there was a motion and a second to amend the ordinance to reflect specifically banning loitering on four foot medians. To be sure I'm requesting the legislative committee members to comment on the amendment. member Winslow. I have a measuring tape and a trust city staff do too. Yes. Vice Mayor Bennett. No. Mayor Reynolds. No. It fails 3-4. I want to take further discussion because I haven't had may take time to comment on this and years and years ago we absolutely got our police department which got rid of our traffic division which has caused the worst drivers and I would venture to say almost the entire state and we've had three people die in a matter of 30 months. So I don't want to be accused of wanting people to die up here but has happened in the past. I cannot imagine a driver that sees somebody and says or even somebody who's standing is like oh that's four feet I can stand there but that's six feet and I can't stand there and when a car is cutting a corner they don't know whether it's four feet or six feet and or eight feet or ten feet wide. It's a dangerous for people to be on the corners where cars are turning. That's just a matter of fact and there's nothing that's stopping people from their first amendment rights and all their other things that they can do and standing up and lining lines and putting up signs and doing all the fun stuff on the sidewalk and do it legally. So I think we can do this. I think we can do it well and I think what we really should be doing is sending everybody in Chico back to driving school and tell them to leave 10 minutes sooner the heck down. We have too many people dying on our streets in the city of Chico. So save us in the police department. Save us in the fire department and just slow down. Anyways we can take a vote. Okay so on the original motion which was to introduce the ordinance let's see where is it council member Goldstein? No. Council member Hawley? No. Council member O'Brien? Yes and I do. I do also concur we should look at intersection safety in a broader context. I'm perfectly willing to have that conversation. Okay council member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council member Winslow? No. Vice mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Carries 4-3. Okay we're going to take a break before we head on to 5.3. All right we don't have a timer but we got everybody here. One, two, three. Oh no we don't. Oh yeah he's back there. He's coming. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. california at 421 main street. We heard several items that I will speak specifically to and individually. The first was as you remember we had discussion about finding ways to reduce the cost of building in our community. At least my position was I was all for that. I wanted to see that happen but I did not want to compromise public safety in the process. So what came back to us and specifically from the chico builders association were four items that were discussed and what I really liked about this process and by the way the front row right here do you see how dapper those gentlemen are with their v-neck sweaters? I think they are. Look at that. Speaking of that dapper front row, brendan who seems to be a regular attendee of our internal affairs committee meeting we abused the heck out of him. I have been meeting and other staff members have been meeting with the builders association to try to find some common ground on those four issues and I really want to applaud everyone for doing that. Really it is an example of government working at its best just like the massage ordinance same concept so really pleased to see that so thank you for doing that. But those four items and I will address three of those I think the fourth needed some further analysis if I am not mistaken director on a boning. I will address the fourth and I will start with the first three. The first three the first one was approved the staff recommendation regarding the storm water runoff calculations on the amended payment design standards. The second was changed to proposed traffic impact analysis threshold to 100 peak hour trips and third direct staff to review the street life foundation standard calculation provided by the cba to determine if they will be sufficient to meet public safety standards. And present that analysis in the report when the ordinance comes back before council which is tonight. So maybe director on a boning you can address number three for us please. yes thank you council member O'brien. This has been a lengthy process and doing our best to work with our development community to find ways of ensuring when we do our design standards and build public infrastructure it is done in a cost effective but sustainable and safe manner. We don' t always maybe are able to reach resolution and so sometimes we have to rely on especially as engineers and as a city engineer do our best to still maintain our professional responsibilities of ensuring that public safety. So as it relates to the street light foundation there' s kind of two main types there' s our standard street light that' s the 30 foot tall median light and then we have one of the specialty kind of street lights that' s like a pedestal light that' s only 18 feet tall. And so the day of the internal affairs meeting we received structural calculations that the cba had hired from a firm locally. In our analysis of that those calculations made some general assumptions that didn' t account for some of our engineering kind of worst case scenarios and we had to make And so not to get too engineering but basically in certain circumstances there' s assumptions made in their design calculations that assumed a constrained environment whether that was based on the soil conditions or for example like a concrete slab that contains that foundation. And so that assumption is a pretty big assumption. We have cohesion list soils at certain areas especially in the western side of the town. And so we have to make some in those circumstances if for example a seismic activity occurs liquefaction of the soil. If you don' t have reinforcing the cracking occurs in the foundation and in those cohesion list circumstances results in failure of the street light. And so unfortunately we' re not able to support the calculations provided based on some of those assumptions that were made. And so we continue to stand by kind of adopting the caltrans standard as the best way to prevent future failure of that. We recognize there' s cost associated with that. It' s pretty minimal. It is an industry standard I' ve seen in a lot of other jurisdictions. We just haven' t always applied it necessarily here. And so unfortunately we' re not able to justify the calculations that were provided to us as being appropriate to adopt citywide. . thank you. so I ask this question I think it was to director gus. I' m sorry his eminence the deputy city manager. Have we ever had a street light that fell down for any reason unless a car hit it? And I think you said no. I would just add if that' s the case we' re in big trouble. The design standards for those circumstances are to withstand extreme conditions. High wind events there' s loading that occurs on those. Seismic activity so in those worst case scenarios we don' t have street lights falling over. Landing on people cars in evacuation circumstances a lot of lessons learned. the question was have we ever in the history of the town of town had a street light fall over that wasn' t hit by a car? And the answer I got was no I don' t know of one. And so where' s the problem here? If we don' t have street lights falling over I mean a meteor could hit it there' s all sorts of things that could happen but it' s not something that' s failing currently. And it does add cost all these things add cost which is why the median house around here sells for $600,000 now. . . . . To make sure it doesn' t fall over. t fall over. To make sure it doesn' To make sure it doesn' t fall over. To make sure it doesn' t fall over. To make sure it doesn' t fall over. of thin air. I don' know if I asked that very clearly sorry. I guess I would just say again we don' t design for you know we design for worst case scenarios to prevent life safety issues I think you know one thing we learned in like the paradise fires for example certain infrastructure design has been modified and changed based on lessons learned from that. So from an engineering standpoint we provide design calculations to account for those worst case scenarios so that if or when they do it is not a catastrophic situation. And so as the city engineer it' s my professional engineers license that has to stamp a lot of these pieces and I put my professional liability and ethics associated with that and so from a practical standpoint yeah we don' t have street lights just falling over. But again I would hope we don' t that would mean we have a much larger problem because again those design scenarios are based on those worst case scenarios so that we don' t have exponentially more catastrophic situations when we experience for example an earthquake or high wind load or something like that. thank you. discussion about this item in the internal affairs meeting I think me and the other members came in with some different sides on it and we did make some adjustments based on the feedback that was received and we all ended up at a consensus. I' m comfortable moving forward with what we got but right now we can do public comment maybe. do we do these one at a time or all at once? we actually don' t have any speakers on any of the items but normally you take them all at the beginning. we have no speakers so we can do are we confirmation assistant? I' m just seeing if we need to do a motion and a second on each of these or if we' re just adopting. my opinion is we can do them all together if we want to try to make an adjustment on the street light thing that can happen with the rest of it be approved unless there' e any comments on the other issues. I have a question. I' a problem with the parklet issue this was discussed a couple of years ago. The city manager would know exactly when it was discussed but I think it was in the middle of 24. Is that right? I' ve had a lot of discussions. late 22. I knew you would know. council member van overbeck can we have internal affairs give us the report of what they' re recommending? the first item was what I mentioned just a few minutes ago regarding the changes to the building code and then the second item was a parklet analysis and this was a little more of a challenging issue. This has been discussed for a while as I understand it. And there' e a lot of layers to this one. One of the layers was do we want to put in very expensive parklets? s a lot of limits that are not going to conform with whatever plan we have with our downtown in the future and those would have to be ripped out. Certainly that is a concern getting ahead of that particular plan and then the second piece was if it' s going to be a temporary one we want to make sure it doesn' t look shabby. That looks poor. Poor quality poor design and actually detracts from our downtown. That was I think the challenges and what the internal affairs committee recommended was to direct staff to meet with stakeholders to gather input. Research studies with successful parklet programs, review parklet designs that were created with American rescue plan act funds to determine if they' re still relevant and feasible which is an important one as well. And finally present council with multiple decisions. have a list of design options focusing solely on temporary parklet designs in anticipation of downtown access plan construction. The designs should be functional, safe, aesthetically pleasing and economically feasible. And that passed 3-0. now council member if this only applies to downtown I need to recuse myself on it. thank you. thank you. any other questions? not necessarily right. that' s the only place they' ve ever been used theoretically. I can' t imagine where else. I think it would only by code it was only allowed downtown. I actually think that' s the case unless we decided to try to make this a thing elsewhere. I don' t know where we would. but I think the point of the committee was we need more information to make a sound decision. We don' t want to rush into something and make a bad decision. I think that would be worse than making no decision. So that is why we wanted more information. We wanted staff to dig in this a little bit more and bring back some possible solutions with some of those concerns in mind. brendan were you here when we did the I think I want to say you were not here during that time. I was here when we did the 2016 starbucks. sorry when we did the when we spent all that time and talked endlessly about what we could do legally downtown during the when we were transferring out of covid we had some stock designs even though I think they came out to like $100,000 a piece to build or maybe. more than that. but it still was not affordable. I was on my hiatus. can we just bring I really hate to invest a ton of money in I know we have a ton more staff time on this. But I do feel like there is possibly a way to come up with something. There is other communities that are doing it. I have seen ones that are like wire mesh on both sides and beautiful rock down the middle and flowers coming out and they have a da accessible and it is one of the most popular businesses in the downtown in that area. Like wire and mesh and rock. Cars not going to go through it. It has to be semi-temporary and semi-affordable. I think you can do this in I don't know who is doing it in a reasonable amount of time that we don't have to. I would just caveat for conversation sake or communication sake at least. Right now in our traffic division we have had some changes with some of our staffing. We have lost one staff member who moved to a different department. And then another staff member that is going on maternity leave so we are down half of our team right now. And so we are trying to shift some things around and we have a heavy workload so to be super timely I think would be a challenge for us to commit to. But it is certainly something we discussed in the internal affairs committee was some examples of other cities like San Luis Obispo that have some pretty robust programs and then just evaluating the areas of concerns we talked in internal affairs also about location matters main and Broadway higher speed higher certainly a higher volume of vehicular traffic would likely be treated differently from an engineering standpoint at least than say first, second or third streets. And so we can certainly evaluate those and bring those back for consideration. that was well put. I think that was almost like the same conversation we had on the committee honestly. And I think that this motion was intended to try to expedite it. But some of the businesses showed up with really kind of particular ideas of what they want to do what they thought would be affordable and feasible to them given the fact that we intend to tear up these streets in the future. And yeah hopefully this is something that can happen quick. Also because Brendan wasn't there when we used the American rescue plan funds to fund some designs we hired Galloway's company on it and nobody remembers where those went. So we just need the direction from the council in order to go forth and figure that out. I'm sure Galloway has a copy and he'll gladly give them to us. Thank you. Thank you. Vice mayor bennett. I remember what the number was, it was a lot. It didn't work out. But a lot of the downtown businesses are looking for some kind of help with this and they are thinking this might be one of the ways that it will help their business activity. So I think we owe it to them to look into it and I'm not going to put any timeline on it because you just explained you're a little understaffed but I think let's look at it. look at it and see if it's look at it and don't put a lot of time into it. I don't know what that really means but let' s take a look and see if something is possible. Can we do that? so fast and wrong is not right. We need to do this right and I get time is of the essence we want to make sure we' re helping our downtown businesses. I fully support that but I do not want to harm them in the process thinking we' re doing something to benefit them and doing it wrong. We do need to do something to look at other designs that are out there, successful park the programs, let' s bring those back to full council and take a more detailed look. all right and then lastly speed surveys and then we' ll go through and make a motion and vote on each of them which way we want to go. that was pretty cut and dry the only negative and I need to apologize to council member van overbeck we' re not changing the speed limit on force so we couldn' t do that for you buddy. But everything else was as presented and that also passed. pretty sure we' re authorized as the internal affairs committee to make the final decision. actually we were thank you very much that is one thing we can do without full council approval. we' re always up for transparency though. but yes we did approve that and again sorry for the no change on force. okay so back to item a municipal title are we going to accept and receive I' ll take a motion on the 18 amendments. I would make a motion to approve all of the listed internal affairs committee recommended 18 amendments and the going to approve them. I appreciate you guys doing that work. to recommend staffs recommendation for storm water runoff calculations because I made a big deal about it two meetings ago. it is a big deal. it is. just to be sure I' ll second your motion but you want to include the staff recommendation on street lights? that wasn' t on our. well the recommendation was to direct staff to review. they did yeah. okay. determined that they didn' t want to change them. yeah perfect. thank you. I want to make a substitute motion. I want to approve all of the changes except for the street light recommendation to increase the amount of concrete in the foundation. we have again never had a failure that anybody can tell me about for a street light that wasn' t hit by a car. and all these things have tradeoffs we' re adding more cost to building a house and pricing people out. this is unnecessary. this is not a problem. but approve the other items. so approve one two and three but not reject the staff' recommendation. I' m sorry approve one and two but reject staff' recommendation on three and leave it the way it is. okay. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you. the way they are is that to state and is there any code that we' re trying to bring it up to and would we not be in compliance with something by not bringing it? You said you' re bringing it up to the cal trans standard but why the change and what' s the change other than seismic and all the other things? just based on the engineering calculations provided had some of the changes that didn' t apply to every situation. I think again it' s hard because these standards there' s certain obviously in Chico we vary greatly especially in our soil conditions from the east side of town you have a lot of lava cap maybe more constrained than you would have and then we have obviously the sandy loam in the west side so it had more of an assumption based on the eastern side of town type of soil conditions. s just simply utilizing the state' s standards and so there' e no California building code or anything that it has to comply with. That' s kind of the nuance I guess of these as the city engineer essentially it' s my license and stamp as the city engineer on those and so you' d have to work around how to get past those and maybe in certain and get a license that would be required to exceed the minimum standards. there' s another facet to this too is quite frequently like road signage we use federal highway standards and among the reasons is and I' ll use the light poles even though nobody can remember one falling down on its own but hypothetically if a car were to hit one that' s not up to caltrans standards injure somebody. We would be asked if it went to trial why didn' t we follow these standards? What standards did you follow? So that' s another common reason for adopting caltrans standards federal highway standards is you avoid those conversations. but you would still be in that situation. I' ll go back to when was that poll put in and what standard did you follow and how would it lie at that time? While I want to give staff as much leeway as possible wouldn' it be great to be able to say if you' re working on the west side where ground has a lot of change then you need to do this standard but in areas where it' s probably hard for staff to do that but then it seems silly to force us to do something in an area where it' s not needed. How can we get there? I don' t want to die on this hill but is there somewhere in between on this particular item? I don' t know but you guys talked about it in internal affairs. can I just ask what approximately was the cost difference say per street lamp of one street lamp and one street lamp? I think it' s probably a few hundred bucks per street lamp. Okay that doesn' t seem like that' s going to impact the housing. The chico builder' s people told me it' was more like 500 all in excavation and everything and 500 here and 500 there it adds up. I feel like that' s worth making sure we don' Do you have any light poles that do not have the same standard applied? We do but we certainly do but I' m just saying if the current standard is x but we have y because we have built to a particular standard are those particular light poles sub standard because we' re not meeting that new standard. I' m not challenging you guys I have to find ways to save the building community money because they' re completely hit with things we do not have any control over. I completely get that. At the same time I struggle with this one because I don' t want to compromise public safety. You' re just telling us what is the safest and you' community money. Again I know that' s a tough question but understand what we' re trying to do is not compromise safety but also find some ways to cut some costs for our overtaxed building community. Councilor Brown if I can make a comment the people who pay for this are not the building community it' s the people who buy the houses or rent the apartments. Absolutely. They pass on the cost to us I completely get that but we' re trying to save them money so they save our community. Exactly. I would rather pay a couple hundred more bucks to not have one fall in my house. The way to be really safe is to rip up every single street light and wait for the foundation. I' m going to do something I have not done I' m going to ask the city clerk can we just postpone this to a future date? Defer it to a future date. We' re going to talk this to death and I don' t know where we' re going to be. This is just a recommendation. We have a substitute motion to accept everything except for number 3 correct on the. Number 4. Or I' m sorry yes number 3. Number 3 of 5.3. So we' re on 5.3A number 3 the substitute motion if I can understand it correctly. Sorry madam clerk I mean it too often. It' s to approve the items except for 3 which should not be amended to caltrans standards. And bring it back at a future. Well all of this would have to come back because it would require ordinances to implement the first two that it sounds like you approve. There was no second on that motion yet though. I' ll second it. We have a second on the first motion. I hate them. I hate them. Okay so substitute motion. Let me just put that in there. I' m going to make a second substitute motion. Okay and we can have. This was the last substitute motion. I know I hate them. I shouldn' t say that out loud. Well no parliamentary wise this is the third one. So. I'm going to make a second substitute motion. m going to approve these items except for the light pole design standards. And I understand you' re in a position where you are stamping plans. You things are always upgraded, changed, modified, improved. But this one is a sticking point. So I' m going to make that substitute motion. We approve everything except for the light pole standard design for the foundation. So the same motion as fan over pick. Okay. Is that the difference? It' s different. If I may clarify so we would then bring that back at a later time specifically? Yes. I will second that motion. Okay. All right. It' s a motion and a second to approve the first two recommendations from the committee and then direct staff to bring back for a future discussion the standard calculations on the light poles. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Goldstein. I don' t think we' re going to have any different information then, so no. Council Member Holly? No. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member van overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? No. Vice Mayor Bennett? Yes. Mayor Reynolds? Okay. Perfect. I think your motion did include approving the parklets or maybe you meant it to approving everything else. Yeah. Approving the parklets. Was that included? Yeah. We' re good? Okay. We probably need to note an abstain on the parklets for Tom and Verbena overbeck. I thought we were just voting. We can do that in a second. Okay. So the first thing that we acted on was A, which was the title 18R amendments. And then now on the parklet analysis we have one council member disqualified. And is there a motion on that one? I' ll approve the recommendations. I will second that motion as well. Happy to see this moving forward. Okay. And. Still no speakers? No. We didn' t have any. No. Council member Goldstein. Yes. Council member Holly. Yes. Council member O'Brien. Yes. Council member Winslow. Yes. Vice mayor Bennett. Yes. Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Carry 6-0 with one recusal. And then the speed survey is that you don' t really have to do anything. s just acceptance of the reports. You already have the authority. I' m going to confirmation of assistant city manager. Mr. Mark Sorensen. City manager Mark Sorensen. Thank you, mayor and council.
