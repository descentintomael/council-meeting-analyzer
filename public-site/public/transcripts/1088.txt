 All right.  All right.  Welcome, everyone.  And welcome to the adjourned regular city council meeting.  On November 15, 2022, 6 o'clock, we will call the meeting to order  and start with an invocation from Police Chaplain Peter Hanson,  substituting the night.  Appreciate you being here.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor, council members.  Let us pray.  Almighty and most loving God,  our city's council meets to join their hopes and desires,  to meet our city's common needs.  All want a good life.  All long for safer streets, happier homes,  great schools, and good citizens,  to lead rewarding careers,  to enjoy our families,  lovingly care for elderly and infirm,  and lead lives that honor you, respectful of each other.  Let this council seek a meeting of minds  to share our vision and hope for future things,  that in agreement on the ways and means they may achieve great things together.  Our best hopes are met only in you,  to walk paths of peace and harmony with gracious manners and patience,  to seek and to see more clearly the steps before us,  and with one heart to begin again.  In the grace and comfort of your service, we pray.  In the grace and comfort of your spirit,  may you receive our desires and our dreams.  Through your grace and mercy, we open this meeting,  knowing you always are more ready to hear than we are to ask,  and willing to give us more than we need or we deserve.  Father, we pray this in your most holy name.  Amen.  May you all have a happy Thanksgiving.  You as well. Thank you. Very beautiful.  All right, please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic for which it stands,  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right. Madam Assistant Clerk, if you can, Deputy Clerk, sorry.  You can take the role. I appreciate that.  Thanks for pinch-hitting tonight.  Mm-hmm.  Council Member Bennett?  Here.  Council Member Brown?  Here.  Council Member Morgan?  Here.  Council Member O'Brien?  Here.  Council Member Tandon?  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Here.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Present.  All right. Thank you very much.  Speaker Card Announcement.  Anyone wishing to speak on an item should first complete a Speaker Card  and turn it in to the City Clerk.  On my left, on your right, speakers will be taken in order their cards are received,  and they're available at the back of the room if you need to grab one.  Thank you.  And on the right, you'll see a card that says,  Once the first speaker begins to speak, no additional cards will be accepted.  And we have a Closed Session Announcement.  Item 1.6 from City Attorney Vincent Yui.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  The City Attorney, City Manager, and staff met in Closed Session on Agenda Item 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.  No action was taken and direction was given.  That concludes my Closed Session Report.  All right. Thank you very much.  Item 1.7, which was a presentation when the Arts and Cultural Grant Program was actually pulled from the agenda,  was not considered a consent agenda.  So we'll be saying that at a future meeting, I believe due to an illness.  So we'll move on to Consent Agenda.  All matters listed on the Consent Agenda can be considered routine in nature and enacted in one motion.  Speakers may submit one Speaker Card for the Consent Agenda in its entirety.  And do we have any speakers on Consent?  We do not.  Okay. No speakers.  Entertain a motion.  Move approval of consent.  Second.

Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined based upon the number of speakers.  The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda.  How many speakers?  We have five.  All right.  Three minutes.  First speaker is Robert Kassane followed by James Hutchinson.  Hi, folks.  I'm here to ask about what's happened to a certain attempted murder case in 2018.  I was attacked by three high school students from Fairview High and was put in the hospital for a week.  I was stabbed six times in the back.  They tried to stop me to death.  I have contusions head to toe and a crushed trachea.  After the hospital, I get out and I found out who they—I did my own research.  I've got my own witness who knows them from Fairview High School.  He knows about the case from them.  I reported this to Detective Haas and he did interview my witness.  He said it was a good interview, but the kid was underage.  And he said,  I'm going to go to the hospital and I'm going to tell you what happened.  And the mom, who my neighbor, didn't want him to do it.  He's of age now.  So I wanted something to happen there.  Let's see.  Haas did show me some DMV photos.  The guys' names are Christopher, Brandon, and Seamus.  Detective Haas knew Christopher.  And he told me after he showed me these DMV photos, which I couldn't recognize.  And I wanted to, but I didn't want to make a mistake.  But he said, afterwards, he said, well, Christopher was in this list.  So he knows them.  Okay.  So, let's see.  Anything else?  I did talk to Wayne Woods' mom, Charles, my witness.  And recently, she said that the stabber, Seamus, that's his M.O.  He's famous for it.  Was arrested.  And he might be in jail right now.  And as far as I know, the case is still open.  I was just curious.  Is there anything happening?  Because I know I emailed Detective Haas many times.  And Chief O'Brien, Chief Madden, and Chief Stauffer.  And haven't gotten any response for about two years now.  Until recently, the Stauffer called me back and said, I'll help you find them.  And then nothing.  So, I think we got them.  They're out there.  They're murderers.  I just want to know what's happening.  Anybody know?  You've all been giving us these emails.  There's five, among many.  Explain the whole situation.  Alright, we wouldn't be able to reply during this time, but we could refer you over to  talk to Chief Aldrich.  Refer me to the police officer?  Chief Aldrich.  Alright, we'll explain that to him.  Okay. Later?  Yeah, I mean, you certainly can just go over there and he'll  No, just when. Later, after that.  So during this period of time, we're not allowed to comment on your, whatever it might be.  I understand that. But I should talk to him eventually. When?  I think you can just, you can probably just  go and see you right now. Okay, thanks.  Yeah. Thank you.  Next speaker is James Hutchinson, followed by Katie Posey.  As I've explained before, I know a little bit of what he's going through, what he feels right now.  My own situation.  Anyhow,  we have El Monte, one of the places that you wish to annex on.  LAFCO has given that to you.  Okay. That should be interesting.  We have KRCR  playing the mayor's lament about people not showing up here.  I'm not sure how much of an impact it had.  Because I think people still aren't.  What we had in the news coverage on the El Monte was they drove a vehicle down to the camera,  wide angle, down the street, not showing anything that goes on  in any of these houses. I've talked to four people from that neighborhood now.  It approached me.  I shared this information with Mike,  Mike shared this information with Mike, you're annexing on places, and we're not even hearing what districts are gonna be in, what political districts are gonna be in. It's not on the maps, it's not on what you say here, It's not on the maps, it's not on what you say here, it's not what you add the annexation, didn't tell anybody. We're changing these districts so rapidly with what's been built. It's almost absurd.  How many hundreds of people are going to be added from places that are almost completed now?  Along Humboldt Avenue, for instance.  The people that got shifted over into District 7.  Huge numbers.  You're getting up there now over 1,000.  And what do we got going right now?  Preliminary results in the election.  District 3 has Mr. Bennett ahead by 20 votes.  Preliminary.  This is not the final results by any means.  I know that.  But your own declaration was talking about a small handful of voters who wouldn't get to vote in that area.  Handful of voters.  20 votes, a handful of voters?  Isn't my vote.  I don't know about yours.  I'm worried about where it's going, where this district thing is going.  And it's being abused.  We have these huge numbers that are changing.  And if you look at the number of people voting at the registration,  you have the enterprise record telling you that,  well, you know, these districts that they drew,  well, they weren't, you know, predominantly Republican districts.  None of them are, in fact, if you look at the registration.  It's absurd what's going on.  The elections aren't getting covered.  The issues aren't being covered.  And it's really hard to get it out there for a lot of us.  People that have to take the bus clear across town to the candidates' debate.  You know?  What do they do?  What's the provision?  What's the way forward for them?  I don't know.  Hopefully things can be improved.  I don't see it.  Our next speaker is Katie Posey, followed by Gina Backs.  Good evening, Council.  Well done to all those that were running in the election  and made it through the recent campaign season.  I've got two topics.  One is related to what happens in our community during campaign season,  as you know.  We have negative rhetoric and behavior  and a pronounced conflict between two groups, us and them.  I don't know that every community has to be as polarized  and eager to engage in the personal attacks.  And negative rhetoric, as we observe here,  one problem is this tendency to categorize people  and label them as either progressive or conservative,  right-wing or leftist.  I heard the use of these terms described as pools of quicksand.  I think that's an apt assessment in many cases.  The minute you slap a label on someone,  you've introduced roadblocks to potential connection,  and engagement around a similar issue of concern.  It's unhelpful.  I've also seen this tendency to call someone a Nazi  if there is behavior or a policy position  that someone intensely dislikes.  This is unfortunate, as using that term  sets up an impossible scenario.  It effectively tags a person as devoid of redeemable qualities  and someone to be avoided at all costs.  When I see this take place on social media or elsewhere,  I've been tempted to ask people to clarify  exactly what kind of Nazi they mean.  Are they referring to the concentration camp variety,  or the accountant working in an office in Berlin?  As someone who just finished a master's degree  in Holocaust and genocide studies,  my opinion is that calling someone a Nazi  is not the way to go.  Let's drill down to what that person is actually calling out.  A behavior they don't like?  A policy position?  Why?  I'm not suggesting that free speech  should be censored in any way.  The culture of free speech should never be in retreat.  What I'm talking about is resisting the urge  to attack and categorize people versus sharing  respectful disagreement of someone's policy positions  unwon or wrong.  I'm talking about the fact that  I think in the lead up to campaign season,  we should have a city-wide picture book  that everyone is encouraged to read  and then at some point discuss.  It wouldn't hurt to connect via a story,  and the humility requiring adults  to read a children's book could be a good thing.  I'm not saying it will solve the issues  of a polarized campaign season,  but it could be a start.  My second topic.  Thank you, Councilmember Tandon,  for the gathering you held near Windchime  on September 7th.  to be heard on an issue of concern is valuable.  I observed their neighbors speaking up,  people concerned with the treatment of the homeless  and their access to resources,  and others that were attempting to connect  opposing viewpoints with the understanding  that different groups actually wanted similar things  but were unable to articulate that.  There were also some people living in the park  that showed up as well.  I encourage you to consider facilitating  future events like this.  There were some heated exchanges, yes.  You also had people that were able to share their ideas  and concerns in light of what is going on  that they would not have had the time to do  at a Council meeting.  Yes, people did get upset at times,  but Councilmember Tandon was perfectly capable  of handling it, and overall, people were very appreciative  that this had taken place.  There was a desire among some of those  of totally different perspectives  to reach a solution.  I could see many of these individuals sitting down  and having more of a conversation.  I think that the more that these kinds of meetings  and spaces of connection happen that are open to members  of community, the better.  Thank you.  Gina Backs, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Good evening.  I am here to express my disappointment  towards political-side vandalism  that has occurred during these elections.  A lot of people don't know the amount of community effort  that takes place in the community,  and I think that is a sign of the fact  that we need to create, design, and distribute these signs.  Vandalism is just a sign of poor behavior.  Chico is a great community, and we deserve better.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Julia Keener.  Council.  I'm going to open by asking again  that we...  change our policy with community involvement  with this process and invite people who are remote  to participate real-time.  That would be beneficial.  That's something that I heard time and time again  on my outreach with the community,  is people would like to come here and participate.  They cannot come here physically unless they have a lot  of efforts put into transportation, et cetera.  That includes our seniors, people, children, et cetera.  If we could maybe put that on an agenda  and make a plan to make that happen.  Also, changing the policy  and who can speak.  I've seen a person come in that guaranteed  was going to speak tonight,  but because we were on speaker number two of five  and it already started, he had to walk out.  We don't get to hear what he had to say tonight,  and I'm sure it's important.  The last thing that I'm going to address again  is going to be our housing crisis,  because we have one.  It's not going away.  It's only going to get worse.  And instead of our community having a fight the...  fight the service provider,  fight the efforts policy,  we should be inviting people in for resolutions and ideas,  having an open forum of,  hey, what are your ideas?  Instead of, no, we're going to do our thing and that's it.  Because I think guaranteed that people have some ideas out here  and how can we offer immediate solutions for sheltering people  so they're out of parks and public spaces  and have dedicated safe spaces to be while we work  on this affordable housing crisis,  and we're going to be able to do that.  So I think that's going to be a crisis that we have  that will take quite a few years to add more housing units  to our supply.  It's going to take a long time and we can't just sit around.  What is our plan?  We have to have a plan.  If you look at the economy right now across the globe,  the United States and California,  our incomes are tanking as our expenses are rising.  We will see more from our community  that fall into homeless category.  First is going to be our seniors.  Our seniors will go first.  They're at that income level of around $900 to $1,000 a month.  That is the income level typical of somebody  who has fallen into homeless status.  They had an income.  That was their income.  That's our seniors.  I personally would like my grown children  to be able to live here in Chico.  They can't.  They can't afford to live here  because we do not have the affordable housing supplies.  And the city has to do something about that.  We have control of zoning.  Zoning increases.  The only thing we can do is we have to do something about that.  We have to take action.  We have to take the opportunity for increasing supply,  but we're not doing that.  What are we going to do for our city?  We have to take action.  Micro communities, addressing zoning,  doing what you can to embrace our housing crisis  and resolutions instead of fighting against it.  We cannot push people out of the city.  These are our people who live here.  These are our people.  These are your relatives at some point.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Mayor Coolidge, we have one more speaker.  Julia Keener.  Okay.  Hello, everyone.  I was here a couple weeks ago, and I am back.  And I'm still going to speak for Upper Bidwell Park.  So this is still a massive issue as far as I'm concerned.  I still am advocating for the park road to stay closed  at Diversion Dam to the city.  I am thinking of this through vehicles,  except emergency and service vehicles.  So people have been up there recently on that road,  and that it has been regraveled and redone.  So what I am looking at is the issues,  if we open that up to the end, the issues that  we'll need service for our people  would be porta-potties, garbage, fire,  public service, public service, public service, public service,  search and rescue, police, park rangers, signage. We have all the above. We can't even take care of  what we have. So I was happy to hear about the tax measure that passed and that will help bits  of Chico. There will never be enough to go around for all the services that we need.  And I would assume many people here in the chambers have memories of going up that road  in a car long ago and going into the swimming holes and all these great memories and everything.  But we also need to remember with that takes all the services. If you remember people doing  nefarious things up there, cars broken into, people getting stuck, people dying,  flip-flops, running around. All of this happened. There was Chico population was half, less than  half.  And we need to think about what it is now. Times have changed and we need to preserve the park  and do what we can instead of opening it up and just a free for all and it will be destruction.  So the other thing I would love to advocate for is a campground for the homeless.  I do a lot of reading in the city and all and I haven't heard anything, any updates on that and  why it's not happening.  There are people, we all know there's people in the parks, people have to have a place to be.  And they need community and they need bathrooms and they need garbage and they need a way to live.  And I think the city should be advocating for creating a campground for a place for the people  that are still out there a place to be. So thank you.  All right. Thank you. All right. Moving on to public hearings.  Hearing ordering formation of maintenance assessment district A52 Hicks Lane subdivision.  And we have our public works director of engineering.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor and council members.  A condition of approval of a final map being recorded requires the subdivider to provide a mechanism for funding future replacement and  maintenance of public improvements that provide a special benefit to the subdivision.  Bill Webb petitioned the city for formation of a CMD for Hicks Lane subdivision, which is northwest of Hicks and Eaton.  And the infrastructure that provides a special benefit to the subdivision includes stormwater detention facility, a park,  irrigated landscaping, street trees and a bike path.  There are after the final map is recorded, there will be 219.  Parcels are dwelling units in the area or in the subdivision.  And the cost of the CMD will be $565.17 per year.  Do you have any questions?  Questions? Thank you.  Have any speakers on the side? All right.  Open public hearing. Close public hearing.  Entertain a motion from council.  Move to approve. I will second that.  All right. So we have a motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Council Member O'Brien,  a resolution of the City Council of the City of Chico ordering formation of a maintenance assessment district  and approving a declaration of conditions, covenants and restrictions relating thereto City of Chico maintenance assessment district A52 Hicks Lane subdivision.  Council Member Bennett.  I am going to abstain due to the my concern about AB 1439 and possible implications. So I will not take a, not be voting on this. Council member Brown. Aye. Council member Morgan. I'm not going to vote just because I don't make a deal I'm not going to vote just because I don't make a deal when I'm kidding, yeah. Council member O'Brien. A simple yes. Council member Tandon. Yes. Vice mayor Reynolds.  And mayor Coolidge. Aye. All right, thank you very much. Item five, moving on to the regular agenda,  consideration of renaming of the airport and this is what I brought forward but I  believe Mr. Gufferson our public works director will be speaking on it.  Good evening council, mayor, vice mayor, thank you for the opportunity to speak  to you tonight. Quick presentation here yes is on the potential renaming of  Chico Municipal Airport and this item has been discussed at length at the  Airport Commission level really started in 2019 and in 2020 so that it might be  a good idea to just kind of recap that briefly and then talk about what was the  original objective and now that's kind of an evolved secondary objective that  has to do the revenue guarantee fund and then ultimately land on a staff  recommendation. So as I mentioned it it was discussed at length that the airport  Commission level was really a re-branding  effort that including the renaming of the airport and the purpose is really to  establish kind of a more regional approach casting a wide net. We're not  innovators on this this is this is pretty common throughout the industry  nationwide there's been a handful of that have airports that have done this  to really try to garner that regional approach for inbound and outbound  flights. Reno Airport is now Reno Tahoe International, Boozman and Montana's  Boozman, Yellowstone International, and the rest of the airport is now Reno Tahoe International.  Airport Merced Regional Airport and then Southwest Wyoming Regional Airport are a  few that have done it not long ago. So again it's kind of common in the industry  in a way that a lot of municipal airports are moving to drop the  municipal component and to really broaden the regional approach. Again the  Commission discussed it at length and ultimately formed an ad hoc committee in  2019 that consisted of Airport Commissioner Mike Antelok and then  Commissioner BT Chapman.  The ad hoc committee was founded in 2009 and it was founded in 2009 and it was  founded in 2010.  The ad hoc committee met regularly and conducted quite a bit of market research and then ultimately  partnered with the business school at the university and particularly the Department  of Finance and Marketing chair about a potential student project. The chair put the ad hoc committee  in touch with Professor Katie Mercurio who teaches marketing courses at the university  and after several meetings it was determined that the rebranding renaming initiative would  be the class project for a spring 2020 marketing 498 class. So the next thing I'm going to  talk about this afternoon is our airport service service service service service  There was a lot of enthusiasm by the university students.  All of them really had an interest in returning commercial air service.  A lot of them, of course, were from Southern California, Bay Area, and some other states,  and recognized the convenience in being able to fly in and out of Chico.  So there was a lot of enthusiasm from the students, and it was neat to see.  They were very excited to work on kind of a real-life project in their spring semester.  After the presentation, students toured the airport and then formed nine teams that consisted  of four to five students per team.  So it got off to a great start.  A lot of interaction, a lot of collaboration.  Unfortunately, as we all know, 2020 was a pandemic.  So mid-semester, the CSU system canceled in-person courses and went to online learning.  Many students returned to their hometowns mid-semester and did not return.  The course continued, but there were obvious hurdles with this type of group work in a  project that was tangible here in Chico.  So, excuse me.  A lot of questions.  The course dates and meetings with students, staff, and the ad hoc committee were canceled.  However, they submitted their projects on time at the end of the semester, but there  were no in-person presentations.  The ad hoc committee members were tasked with honing down the nine proposals or the nine  projects to four to recommend to the full airport commission.  And those four are listed there.  The first one, and they're ranked in order, Northern California Regional Airport, Chico.  Northern California, Chico.  Chico Regional Airport.  The third team, which was Team 5, used the same name.  They came up with the same name as Team 3, which was the first ranked name.  And then the fourth team had kind of a different take on it.  Chico Port is what their suggestion was.  So the airport commission heard this at the August 2020 meeting, again, discussed it at  length, and ultimately due to the scenario with the airline industry, the pandemic impact  on it, the commission directed staff to really pull back on this.  And just, you know, we're going to have to wait and see.  And we're going to have to, you know, remain in a holding pattern to kind of wait until  the industry returned.  And once we hired a marketing firm and kind of reignited our air service pursuit efforts  to forward these four recommendations to that marketing firm.  The student project was really kind of a full rebranding effort, but we've, again, through  that airport commission discussion, they pulled back and just really wanted to focus on a renaming.  And so we're going to have to wait until the industry returns.  So that's our renaming option.  There were logos and whatnot included in this class projects.  And staff worked on this one, which the airport commission liked at that August meeting.  And so we've been using it ever since.  It's based off the Soaring Star sculpture that was put at the airport in 20, or excuse me,  2001.  That's the picture on the right.  And then the logo on the left is what we've been using thus far.  So really, it was kind of pulled back by the airport commission just to really focus on  a renaming option only.  So, moving from then to now, to present day, the airline industry is still extremely volatile.  It's amazing.  It's like the stock market.  It changes by the month, the week, even the day.  Pilot shortages, ground crew shortages, fuel prices, inflation have significant impacts on the industry as a whole.  We are seeing flights starting to get close to pre-pandemic levels.  However, there's been kind of a big consolidation.  There's not a lot of regional airlines or regional flights that are moving into new markets at the time.  But that time will come as it continues on its current trajectory, and we want to be ready.  We formed an air service development working group that meets every few months, and Mayor Coolidge and Vice Mayor Reynolds are on that group.  In one of the recent meetings, we discussed some feedback that we've had from some of our stakeholder meetings on,  why is...  Why is this just Chico-centric?  We're kind of using some of the taglines you see there that are familiar with us, you know, choose Chico, help Chico fly, which is great.  But some of these stakeholders are outside of city limits.  They're well within our catchment area, but they're outside city limits and would absolutely use air service if it was here.  They kind of commented on why is this Chico-centric.  And they weren't derogatory by any means, but they were just some comments that we took back to the group.  And that's kind of why we're having this discussion today.  Why things work.  We're reunited.  Reignited, excuse me.  Moving forward.  So that changed our objective.  Again, the original objective, I think, by the airport commission started back in 2019 was to really broaden that regional approach for inbound and outbound flights.  But due to the feedback that we've received and the discussions, feedback from stakeholders that we received and discussions at the air service development working group,  it's really kind of evolved to...  I am Mike Bateson, I am Mike Bateson, I am Mike Bateson, I am Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bateson, Mike Bates  the west. So now that this has kind of reignited and council is considering it now and that was  from the vote at the September meeting, we worked quickly to kind of honor the airport commission's  direction in giving the top four CSU student proposals to now we have a marketing firm,  Aviatrix. And so we've done that over the last few weeks. Aviatrix and their team reviewed the  university's recommendations and then had their team kind of conduct some market research and come  up with their own. I won't go through all of those that are on the left column there, but they landed  on two recommendations that are on the right, Chico Northern California Regional Airport and  Chico Northern California Airport. Aviatrix recommended keeping the city and state order.  So Chico would be first before the state reference and then keeping Chico in the name. They found  that in their market research,  uh,  keeping,  Chico in the name really associates us with some known Chico amenities,  Bidwell Park,  Sierra Nevada Prairie,  the university.  So they highly recommended somehow keeping Chico in the name.  So,  um,  with that,  you know,  staff,  um,  considered,  you know,  input from the university students,  marketing class,  the air service development working group,  Aviatrix,  our city,  a public information officer who also has,  uh,  experience,  and these types of things.  We considered some recommendations and input from her.  And of course,  the airport commission and narrowed it to two options for the council to consider tonight.  First one is Chico Regional Airport.  It kind of rolls off a little bit better than some of the,  some of the others we thought,  and then Northern California Regional Airport,  Chico.  Uh,  we decided to put the Chico after the state.  It just sounded weird to put it before.  Um,  so that was kind of staff's preference to,  to have those two options available.  So we feel either option is suitable.  Uh,  we'll achieve both the regional recognition significance and revenue guarantee fund objectives.  There are some housekeeping items that we'll have to do if council does move forward with renaming the airport.  We'll have to apply to the FAA requesting the name change.  I don't see any issues with that.  This happens quite a bit,  and I don't think the FAA is really declined any of those requests or those applications.  It is important to note that our,  um,  acronym,  our Chico identifier CIC will remain.  That's FAA administered,  and that will not change.  It's just the naming of the airport.  We estimate the cost between five and 8000 to change some of the signage.  You can see our monument sign in the background of the slide there and some literature at the airport,  and I'm pretty confident if this is decided to move forward that the airport operating budget could absorb those costs.  So this is the staff recommendation at this point to rename it to either one Chico Regional Airport,  or to Northern California Regional Airport,  Chico,  and that concludes the presentation.  All right,  questions.  I have a quick one.  So Northern California Regional Airport,  Chico,  if you just went Northern California Airport,  Chico,  how important do you think is the regional?  It was,  I,  you know,  it was part of the one of the regional original objectives was to have the regional in there to really,  really cast that wider net.  I just think that Northern California and Castle pretty wide net too.  Sure.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yep.  I agree.  Anyone else?  I just have two short comments.  I would like to thank,  I don't know that anybody else picked up on your puns,  holding pattern and reunited.  Well done.  Thank you.  You just left Chico Port out there.  Like,  I don't know.  Yeah.  I have to say reignited,  but it sounds like it came out reunited.  All right.  Do we have any speakers on this?  I,  we have one.  All right.  James Hutchinson.  Yes,  but I was missing was the input from the other two counties.  I realize you need to talk to.  Okay.  I was missing some people from them.  But when we look at this proposal,  we see these three counties out there.  Each have at least two airports and they have airport conditions around them.  And we're not hearing input from these commissions.  That's what I'm waiting to hear is what the people outside of here said.  I didn't really see it in the material I've read,  but let's talk about airport names for a minute.  California.  There's a long tradition.  of naming airports not just for where they are but iconic names that  represent the region represent the people of that area represent the  direction of that area in this case we're looking for representing a broad  group of people who have similarities and differences from us and we're  claiming Chico Chico Chico but we're saying Duke County we're saying this  County we're saying that County but we're saying Chico City essentially is  what it comes out so in other towns they've used things like the Charles M  Schultz Airport Sonoma County Airport Alta Sierra Airport in Grass Valley Bob  Hope Airport in Burbank and unfortunately one that's having trouble  with the name problem the John Wayne Airport in Orange County because of  racist comments  that John Wayne Airport in Orange County because of racist comments that John Wayne Airport in Orange County because of racist comments that John  Wayne supposedly made in the past but the idea was a name that reaches across  these various meanings that we're talking about we're talking about  Bidwell Park we're talking about CSU Chico whose name would play in there  that would be different than the names we see most of California airports how  about Annie Bidwell how about somebody who stood for setting up a college in this  area the college is mentioned by other counties the two of the other counties  that we as available to their people for education the park you brought that up  of course Annie Bidwell for the park women's voting rights she was big on  that and in most the reviews you see of Annie Bidwell they talk about bringing  culture to the North State isn't that what Chico's about trying to bring it back but Annie Bidwell is a great example of that.  regional park and even on the fun if you take the letters of that a B or a does  anybody know what that also refers to it's a Pokemon character sigh character  somebody who teleports when it hatches out of the eggs to avoid fighting to avoid  getting in fights it's those hidden meanings that go and grab people people  are going to be looking who is this what is this?  that's what I'm asking how about considering that thank you thank you  all right further discussion  entertain a motion I have a procedural question sure if a motion isn't made  does it just stay the Chico Municipal Airport there's no action taken just curious thank you  yeah  I'll actually make a motion you had to know that we renamed Chico Municipal  Airport the Northern California Regional Airport Chico I think it will help but  you prefer something else I like Chico Regional Airport it's only one letter  difference and I think we'd save a ton of money  to rename the sign.  Yeah, if we're going to make  this change, if it really benefits  the airport  and potentially  commercial airline service again,  certainly I'm willing to do that, but I  agree with Council Member Morgan  that ultimately  the numbers have to pencil out.  I think that's how businesses are run. They have to make money  if I'm not mistaken.  I know I'm in the  minority in the city when I say those things  about the airlines.  My only concern is are we  ready for the influx of airlines  that are going to come when we rename this airport?  I'm just not sure we have  the staff capacity to handle  that. It's going to be amazing.  So if we are going to change it  and really ultimately  it's not going to hurt us. If we're going to  change it though, it needs to be simple.  It needs to be three words. It needs to be  Chico Regional Airport in my opinion.  Agreed.  So !  I'll make that  motion.  Well, I'll make a substitute.  I will second the substitute motion.  Alright.  Motion and second.  Okay.  When you're ready.  So this is the substitute  motion.  Council Member Bennett? Yes.  Council Member Brown?  As much as I can appreciate the exercise, I feel like it's just that and it's premature. No.  Council Member Morgan?  After everything we've been through together.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  I would have totally been all about naming the Aaron Rogers Airport, but we can't offend the people that don't like football.  So I'll go with Chico Regional Airport.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Alright.  Wait, wait, wait, I mean, I need two more minutes to win a bet.  No.  I don't, yeah, I might...  Really only a minute 59 seconds.  Wait, wait, wait, Item 5.2, I am hosting an agenda none.  Item 6, reports and communications, following reports and communications, I am provided for the Council's information,  no action can be taken on items under this section,  unless the Council agrees to this motion,  Council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda.  6.1 is City Manager's report.  Mr. Sarge.  No report.  All right.  6.2, Council Member requests,  and you might pick up your two minutes here, Sean.  Pursuant to APMP 1010, Council Member Zoya  verbally requests an item B agendized at a future meeting  after sitting with the item B,  a majority of the Council is needed  in order for staff to agendize.  Council Members may also submit requests in writing.  Any requests?  Okay, Council Member Tandon.  So, you know, we did not have a dock before, but now we do.  So it seems like it's, you only have one dock park,  you know, the Garba Park.  So I would like to see if staff can work  on getting some proposals on having dock parks,  maybe another one on the south side  of the park.  of the town, because it'll be good environmentally wise too,  because I think twice, like, I'm going  on the other end of the town.  So if I have the support, I would like staff to look  into that to see if we can, whatever,  wherever is a good appropriate spot in the city to create  at least one or maybe two more dock parks.  All right.  So, Council Member Zoya?  Yes, Council Member Tandon.  I'll make a motion to agenda as well.  I'll second that.  All right.  Madam Deputy Clerk.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Open to the conversation,  though I probably won't be here, yes.  Council Member Morgan?  I'm not a dog, yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  All right, any other requests?  I just want them not to make, sorry.  I actually want to look at the ARPA funds  and I believe staff will probably be set to bring those  back in the coming months anyway.  I've had a series of meetings with local businesses  to promote some kind of shop, local business,  local program, not necessarily using ARPA funds,  but certainly that could be a benefit to the program.  And in conversations with our Economic Development  Coordinator, that that seems like a very welcome idea  for our community is to have more focus on shop local,  particularly as we get further from the pandemic.  So, I'd like Council just to support that aspect  and make that a motion.  I'll support that.  Okay, a quick question.  Is it like a reallocation of those funds?  Not necessarily.  If there's funds that have not been used or utilized,  they possibly could be doing, they could be used for that.  But if there are funds that could be reallocated,  but I don't anticipate that that would be a huge chunk  of money regardless.  Is there an opportunity to ask staff a question?  Just kind of my vote would depend on it.  Yeah.  Have there been unallocated ARPA funds?  There are a couple of projects that don't,  I don't know, I don't know.  They do not look like they will materialize  to the point where they will consume all of the funds  that have been allocated to them.  Can you let me know what the projects are?  Just for good measure.  One of them is a downtown sidewalk plan.  That's the biggest one.  Okay.  The other one?  Seems like there was another one.  Oh yeah, we're still looking at the parklets.  So that's another potential dependent upon how that goes.  Thank you.  All right.  I'll second.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Member Brown.  No.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  And Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  All right, anything further?  All right, with that, we will adjourn the meeting.  Thank you very much.  You have another one?  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Jumped the gun there.  We had another request.  I was thinking so.  You know, I would like to have a presentation  from Jesus Center on the operations of the Pallet Shelter.  Just to, how has it been management?  If there are any issues that they are facing  or on an average, how many days we have residents in there?  If they're exiting, what's the reason?  Or what is the next step that they are going to,  if they are getting into transitional housing?  Or how many people are actually taking advantages of the services  that are provided there by the county?  That's a good question.  Yeah, that's.  I'll second.  Yeah.  And that is easy.  It's a motion.  All right.  We do have a second.  Second.  All right.  Do we have a motion and a second?  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  And Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  All right.  Anyone else?  No, no.  With that, we will adjourn.  Thank you.
