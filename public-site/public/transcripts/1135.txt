United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  All right, Madam Clerk, you do roll, please.  Council Member Bennett?  Here.  Council Member Morgan?  Here.  Council Member Tandon?  Here.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Here.  Council Member Winslow?  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Here.  Mayor Coolidge?  Here.  All right, we'll start with our closed session announcement.  City Attorney.  Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor and members of the City Council.  The record should reflect that the City Council recessed into closed session, with all seven  members being present to discuss the items that were listed on the 5 o'clock closed session  agenda, and the following is my report.  On item 2.1, Conference with Labor Negotiator, the City Council received a briefing from  the City's negotiators.  There was direction provided.  But there was no final action taken and nothing required to be reported at this time.  I'll go through the pending and anticipated litigations collectively.  It's item 2.2, 2.3.  2.4 was actually also part of 2.6, the rushing case, and also the Sutton matters.  All those items were presented to the City Council.  Either as an update or further direction.  The record should reflect that the Council provided direction and received the update,  but no action was taken that is required to be reported.  Moving on to item 2.5, which is the Public Employee Performance Evaluation of the City  Attorney.  The City Council conducted its session in closed session and then provided information  to the City Attorney that no action was taken but direction was provided, which will be  carried out accordingly.  That concludes my report from closed session, Mr. Mayor.  It's appropriate to continue with the open portion of the meeting.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  All right.  And we will also move on to our proclamation.  If Dennis or Ms. Haley would like to take that.  Ms. Ramirez can meet me down.  I'll switch to this one and then change channel.  See if I can talk a little bit about falling back.  Yeah, don't do that.  All right.  Come on.  Good.  Good.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  All right.  We're happy to do a proclamation for the California Native American Day, whereas the City of Chico  has been very active in the process.  It honors the fact that the community of Chico is built in an area native to the  people, and whereas the State of California, in partnership with California Tribal Chairpersons  Association, recognizes this year as the 56th annual California Native American Day.  And whereas California Native American Day celebrates the distinctive culture of Native  American people, indigenous to California, and calls attention to their triumphs and  struggles that comprise, and at times have compromised, unfortunately, their rich history,  and therefore be it resolved that I, the Co-Legislative Mayor of the City of Chico, on behalf of the  City of Chico City Council, do hereby proclaim September 22nd, 2023, California Native American  Day, and encourage all citizens of Chico to acknowledge, honor, value, and celebrate  indigenous peoples' historic and current contributions.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  Can I say a few words?  Thank you.  I appreciate this.  It's important that we remember Native people and their struggles and what's going on, and  we've been having this Native Day.  It's every, the third week of September in Sacramento, it's, too bad you don't have that  day off.  Our offices are closed throughout California, and it's important that we remember these  days.  And it's, it's fine to get all the tribes together, and, you know, I belong to the association  that we know what's going on and try to help everybody.  And I appreciate the City of Chico.  Mechuta's been here for forever, and I thank you for those applause.  I really appreciate the Native people in Mechuta.  And in the future holds, we don't know, you know, there's, there'll be some, some fun  times once our country's done.  I know the Casino's up and running, and I know Chico's gonna be rewarded for that in  the future as well.  So, and I thank everyone for this.  And I'm glad I made it here.  There was no construction on MArley 32, so that worked out.  So thank you, Larry, and I appreciate it.  Council, I appreciate all of you, too, as well.  So thank you, everyone.  And again, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And we like road construction.  The more the better, right?  All right.  So we will move on now to our always fun speaker card announcement.  Anyone wishing to address the council on any matter already listed on the agenda must first complete a speaker card,  which can be found at the back of the chamber.  Once completed, please turn the card in to the city clerk to my left, to your right.  And the cards will be taken in the order received.  And once the first speaker is called, no additional cards will be accepted.  So outside of proclamations, we ask that you not cheer or boo or anything of that nature  so that everybody has the feeling that they can speak and not be hindered in any way, shape, or form.  So from there, we will move on to the consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and can be enacted in one motion.  Do we have any speakers?  We have two.  All right.  And when I call your names, if you'd please line up.  It's James Hutchinson, followed by Grace Marvin.  Okay.  When we had this abandoned shopping cart discussion before, there were only two of us that got up and spoke.  I spoke about the law.  I spoke about the larger model of Target.  The other person spoke about a smaller model, natural foods, smaller type shops.  Do you understand that this is a blanket thing you're passing?  You're treating the small guy with all these responsibilities of having extra people,  for instance, to bring in carts, for instance, to hire somebody to go out and retrieve carts,  the same way you're treating Target or Walmart or Winco, the big ones,  the ones that have most of all the carts.  You're treating them the same way.  They have to put those hours in to make up those plans to say, hey, this is what we're going to do.  There's other ways of going about this.  The idea is you want to get those carts off the street.  Okay.  Why not hire, why not contract with somebody like RMS out of Burbank?  There are major cart retrieval, repair, several other things that they do, cleaning, rentals.  Okay.  And they can go out.  And handle the city, just like you handle tow trucks, for instance.  You sign a contract, send them out.  Same thing you do with recycling.  You have certain people that go out and do the recycling.  I'm asking you to consider the small guy in this because you're hurting him more than the big guy.  Target already has a couple that uses RMS incorporated out of Burbank,  I mentioned last time.  They already use those.  They're set.  Small guy going to go out and contract with them?  Or do we set up a contract to work with them to go throughout the city?  Set a firm up.  It doesn't have to be RMS.  It could be some other firm.  You can put out a contract and do it that way.  I'm asking you to reject this, but this is not working for the small guy.  You're hurting him big time.  You're going out and trying to destroy him.  That's all you can look at.  It was brought up to you.  The small guy last time, I felt sorry for him because he didn't have much chance.  Three minutes.  Given how long this thing is.  Not enough.  But the abandoned cart retrieval last Tuesday morning,  I was out at the corner of Forest and Humboldt helping city workers clean up carts.  Bring out carts that were down in the creek.  In the empty lots.  And several at CVS.  I'd set up some of them Saturday.  Came in that morning.  Cleaned up.  Helped them do it.  They picked up over 12.  Probably over 10 to 12 carts in a small area.  That's a small area.  It's one corner.  And that's with help.  Go down in the creek and try to pull all those things out.  And if you had carts like people, Joanne's.  I ask you to reject this and reconsider, please.  Thank you.  Grace Marvin.  Yes, please.  First, I'd like to say something more general.  I've had trouble over the last several years.  Understanding.  Speakers.  And I'm wondering if you could make for a better sound system.  How many of you have difficulty understanding people?  See, it's really, really hard.  And I would appreciate it if you could look into that.  Because it.  Anyway, I was going to say.  Isn't it backwards to charge people if something is taken from them?  Please do not find store owners whose carts.  Have been taken instead.  Consider consider incentivizing their return by the homeless themselves.  By giving each person $10 for returning the cart and keep a list.  So there's only one person returning it per cart.  And that would be a major way of being beneficial and not harmful to our community.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Any council disqualifications or no votes?  Just put me down as a no on was it 2.2 and 2.3?  Okay.  Any others?  That's correct.  Yes.  Entertain the motion.  Motion from Council Member Martin, second from Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  And that was a motion to approve the consent agenda as read.  And that included ordinance of the City of Chico, City Council repealing Title 18,  and replacing with the comprehensive Chico Municipal Code Title 18 subdivision ordinance update.  Ordinance of the City of Chico amending Title 1 Chapter 1.14 of the City of Chico Municipal Code  to revise a nuisance abatement chapter.  The last ordinance was ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico, California,  adding a new Chapter 9.32 to the Chico Municipal Code regulating stolen or abandoned shopping carts  and other carts, establishing an abatement and enforcement program related thereto.  Council Member Martin?  Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  And with it noted the two items that you voted no on.  And Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Thank you very much.  We'll move on to public comments.  Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda.  The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this meeting.  The Council is adjourned.  Any other comments on the section of the agenda?  How many speakers?  We have six.  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  And I'll call the first two names, Sasha Sarnoff, followed by Julie Threatt, and if you could both come to the middle aisle.  So, Sasha Sarnoff is first.  Well, thank you.  If everybody can hear me on this microphone that some people can't hear with.  Thank you for everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you for everybody being here, doing what you do.  I wanted to just speak to this ongoing debacle in Ukraine that is helping to establish a real state of poverty for the United States in funding this war.  And we're now at $73 billion and another $43 billion.  I think these numbers are so astronomical.  And I'm not saying that for a civil war in a country that we're.  So, we generally limit public comment just to items which the Council can act on or something within the city.  Are you telling me I can't have a comment here?  Are you serious?  Within the city's purview.  Oh, this is part of the city's purview because we are receiving less.  This city is going to be so screwed up.  Okay.  From the amount of money going to the war machine.  And we don't have, we don't have, this, there's going to be complete collapse.  Let me.  So, I don't think you have a right to tell me what I can say in my comments.  We are out of order, sir.  Okay.  Ma'am.  Anybody else want to tell me about if he's out of order or not, please?  Ma'am.  Let me talk with our city clerk and city attorney.  Generally, all comments from public comment are listed or have to be relevant to the city of Chico.  So.  Mr. Mayor, members of the Council, you are correct.  The Brown Act requires that public comments must be made on matters within the subject matter jurisdiction of the city.  So, you have to stay focused on city issues and city related matters.  Madam Clerk, you concur?  Yes.  Absolutely.  This city does not have money for the homeless situation.  We have no occupancy for people to rent.  That is a direct response relationship.  Okay.  Let's do this.  So, you want to start over?  Let's reset your clock.  And we can take from the top related to the city of Chico.  Are we starting the clock all over?  What are we doing here?  Yes.  We're starting the clock.  It says one minute left over here for me.  I am being very respectful.  I ask you to do the same.  We will start your clock over.  You can only do two or three, right?  Well, I had stopped it when you started to question her.  Okay.  So, this is where we're at.  So, go from there.  Well, I'd like to ask you to go from there.  I'd like to talk about how this council treats the public that comes in with comments.  Let's just start right there because this is completely unacceptable to interrupt somebody's  comments that you feel no relationship to.  Okay.  So, this is the reason we're at war right now.  There's no—there's a complete disconnect, right, between the war machine, the endless  war machine, and our cities that are going down the tubes.  Look at San Francisco.  Look at Sacramento.  And now look at Chico.  This is a complete disconnect.  Where do you think all this money is going to come from?  It's going to destroy this country.  This war will destroy this country.  I'm done.  If you can't see that and you think there's not a relationship, you're completely insane.  I'm sorry.  Julie Threatt followed by Rob Berry.  That's a hard act to follow.  Julie Threatt.  And I'm here on a personal matter.  And I gave you guys all a copy of what I'm going to speak to.  So, I'm being maligned and slandered by members of the GOP party in this community.  And as the leaders, at least six of you in the GOP party, I expect you to listen to me  and hopefully take some action.  The Butte County Republican women and the Chico-Eban Republican women have decided to  terminate my membership from their clubs because they say I'm a Democrat.  They say I'm a Democrat.  And they sent me a letter and kicked me to the curb.  Now, they didn't give me any chance to refute and rebut until the membership—the membership  that I'm in—was  personally, why that's a lie.  So, I need to come here in the town square, in the public community, to go on record,  and go on my Rumble Channel tomorrow, to let everybody know the truth.  They've lied and they've slandered about me personally, and I take offense.  Why am I here again, besides making sure that it's on public record?  I'm going to be running for trustee—well, I'm going to be running at least for the District 5  Board of Supervisors seat, under the Republican party, in March.  So, I've given you my resume of everything I've accomplished in the past nine years.  When I moved here and that dam broke, I led people to that Elks Lodge for rescue.  When that campfire broke, I supported Steve Murray and the Coral Apple Foundation for two years.  I worked at those vaccination clinics, got injured.  I helped get the needles out of this city.  I helped get the needles out from the Northern Valley Harm Reduction and got doxxed,  and I got the needles gone from the mRNA garbage at the beach.  When it got to Fairview County, I gave you a copy of that notice.  I worked on every redistricting.  I helped that school board make sure that the school board didn't gerrymander their map.  I walked every door in District 7 to make sure that Pika Tandon got in over, over.  I drove around with Andrew Kulisch, to make sure that he didn't get recalled.  I drove in Chase Ballas, for Pete Durffy.  I walked District Two, for Kami Denlay, so I would appreciate it, as the leaders of this Republican party, six of you, up,  –  there. If you have an opportunity to talk to Nicole Nava and Sherry Gillis and Kathleen or  Colleen Wall and Michelle Copper and Gina Bax, you better let them know. You better let them know.  It's 45 seconds left. I know, but you're not allowed to mention members of the public. Oh,  okay. So sorry. They're mentioning my name all over the community. So I apologize. Not here.  I'm done. Okay. So anyway, I just would appreciate your support on that because again, we're coming  into an election year and you all know this quite well. We do elections ugly in this community.  And if they're going to do that to me, they're going to do it to many members of this community.  And those that are America first candidates, the patriots who have had enough with the way that  the people are being treated, you all better be on notice. But again, I'm running under the  Republican party for Doug Teeter's seat. Thank you. Thank you. Rob Berry followed by James Hutchinson.  Well, I'm going to fit right in here. So I'm going to talk about housing tonight. You know,  if you're trying to build some housing in this community, you have to have the foresight  to,  to invest in a piece of property decades ahead of time. You have to go through the planning process.  You have to have the means and the persistence to follow the process through.  After many years, you have permits for air, water, drainage, power roads,  sort of never ending. And then you have to endure lawsuits, not just CEQA, but other  lawsuits as well. And now you have to endure puppet shows. My thought here is, look, folks,  these are not serious people. We have a referendum coming up in March on a specific plan that this  council approved. I would like to see this council's support and defend their decision  and take this conversation out of the silliness that we saw tonight.  And put it in a way that it's not a silly decision. And I think that's what we're going to have to do.  We'll see if it works, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it will, but it  the editor about his stand on the camps? Probably not. Maybe so. You don't have to answer, so you  don't. I know that. What's happened here is, though, he said that, hey, it's going along  beautifully. It's cleaning up. But maybe we ought to look at this campground thing. Well, let's look  at the campground thing. It's called Placerville. They attempted to put in an all-volunteer system  of a campground. Small town, what, 10,000 at this time, 11,000 or so right now. But it was a  volunteer system. And they were bringing people in to camp out, like they want to do here. They  had an all-volunteer. People took them to AA meetings. If you had an alcohol problem, the  people staying there, the homeless staying there, they took them to psychology. If they  had an alcohol problem, they took them to psychology. If they had an alcohol problem,  they had a meeting with a psychologist. They made sure they got there. They made sure they went  through the whole routine with them. There were very few police calls in their whole setup there.  And they tried this for a while. And within the camp, it worked beautifully. But guess what?  It failed beautifully. It's kind of a Genesis-type thing, vis-a-vis Star Trek,  where they talked about the idea of the Genesis.  And it's a failure. What happens? Things start building up real nice, and suddenly they fold.  And why did they fold? It was outside people camping around the edge of this area. The campground  itself was beautiful. The people did beautiful. But because of all these people coming in saying,  hey, here's an opportunity for me, here's people with money. These people are getting help. These  people can buy from me. These people...  Great for crime. And it failed. And it failed miserably. And it was just another campground  system. Beautiful system. Beautiful volunteer. Donating money. People were donating money to it  so you didn't have to have big federal funding. But it failed miserably. Our editor thought it  was a great idea, the campground. But then again, he went around the camps just looking at it.  By the way, if you ever take some time to look on the net,  you'll see the commander.  And then, if you ever go to the campground, you'll see that the Camp Ranchi Creek is still listed as a homeless camp in some sites.  Think about it. People are still coming here because they see on the net, they can look it up and find it as a content site for homeless people.  That's what you're getting for what you're doing.  Thank you. Bill Monroe, followed by Lori Monroe.  Hi. Hello. William Monroe on 234 West 4th Avenue.  I am in Addison-Winslow District. I think we're all getting used to this district concept and how it works.  And I was a bit appalled at the last meeting when Addison proposed to agendized the supervised campground,  and it failed, for lack of a second. I find this to be disrespectful, that every representative up here on the dais should have a right to propose the agendized,  of an object of an item  it should be an automatic second and you should be able to  to at least vote on it and  and  And then when the agenda item comes up at the next meeting  Then there can be a discussion and something productive can happen if you just simply squash a  a  Concept by not seconding it I find that rather  Undemocratic let's say okay. Thank you. Thank you. Laurie Monroe is our last speaker  Hi, my name is Laurie Monroe, and I just wanted to say how disappointed I was that two weeks ago when I  Addison Winslow brought up the agenda  requested that  You all talk about campgrounds that he couldn't get a second. There's two  reasons why one would  Promote a campground one is just kindness our neighbors who are unsheltered  Deserve a place to stay and to be safe in that place  The other is economics at that same time  Council meeting two weeks ago. You also shifted a hundred thousand dollars from one  Budget to repair damage that was done at the campground up on eat eaten  and so  and other economical things are  Healthcare that's not something the city pays for but we all pay for it eventually and  Safety issues  and policing which  people who are moved frequently and who have  Who are in less supervised places?  Tend to have more problems with lawlessness causing more cost in policing more cost in  court system and more cost in jails and so I would request that you  consider  Agendizing a discussion about whether or not campgrounds would be  beneficial for the city of Chico  I don't know that it would be beneficial, but it's not gonna go anywhere if there's not even a discussion allowed  Thank you, she was our last speaker  All right. Thank you everybody. We'll move on to public hearings item 4.1 public hearing of the  2023 consolidated annual performance evaluation  keeper for the  development block grant CDG and  the home investment partnership on programs and we have with us  Housing program analyst Mary Jo lots of welcome  Hi  Good evening mayor vice mayor and council members  My presentation is an end of year report highlighting what we did last year and also public hearing will follow as a required condition of receiving  federal funding through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, which we call head and  This report I'll be referring to as the caper  The purpose of the caper is to report on the progress and carrying out the city's five-year strategic plan  both for the CDBG and the home programs as well as reporting on specific achievements of our annual action plan and the city's actions  to further fair housing  The full caper report was included with my staff report and as attachment a  Today I'm just gonna highlight the uses of the funding it's focused on on supporting  the five-year plan and those priority areas of affordable housing homeless prevention homeless services  neighborhood revitalization and economic development  First we're gonna talk about the home funding the city maintains a continued partnership with the Housing Authority and  participating social service providers which has allowed assistance for 18 households through the tenant based rental assistance program  I just want to highlight that this rental program  provides 24 months of rental assistance to qualified households who meet program requirements and work tells  work towards self-sufficiency  Just for example, I wanted to highlight that we had a household that  Had a tragedy in their life ended up  Maintaining guardianship of grandkids and needed a larger house to live in didn't have the means for that applied for the TBA  Assistance was able to get the assistance was able to  to go back and get some rehab done so they were able to go back to work full-time  and has now exited the program and is able to provide housing for their family.  And so it's just that program in particular is one that's getting people in for a short amount of time,  getting them stable, and then letting them kind of move on from there.  I'm also, we're going to highlight a couple of housing projects that we have that have either completed or are very near completion.  This project on the slide is Creekside Place.  It's a 101-unit affordable housing complex for seniors and disabled adults.  It's across the street from Marsh Junior High.  As of today, the project's fully rented up, and staff received news earlier this week,  a few weeks ago, that they were going to be renting out a house for seniors and disabled adults.  We've heard from the developer and operator of Creekside Place that 41% of the new residents have come from homelessness  or were at risk of homelessness coming into this housing program.  As we know, data regarding homelessness shows that seniors make up a larger and larger portion of homeless individuals,  and we're pleased to see that this project has been successful in meeting this critical need in our community.  The next project, home funding.  Along with many other sources of funding, is going to be supporting the second phase of North Creek Crossing.  This is just down the street from Creekside Place.  The second phase is a 52 multi-family affordable housing project.  It's currently under construction.  It's expected to be completed in November.  And then last but not least, I apologize because I just drove by today,  and I realize the scaffolding is down, and it looks gorgeous.  But this is the picture I had as of the time I put my PowerPoint together.  This is 1297 Park Avenue.  It's where the Jesus Center site was.  This is a 59-unit affordable housing project.  The estimated completion date is January of 24.  And now I'll be moving on to CDBG funded accomplishments,  including the connection of three low-income households inside the city's nitrate compliance area,  which will guarantee a separate separate separate separate separate separate separate  Taylor Center to keep our seniors and disabled safe and at home.  Public service funding went to True North, Jesus Center, and Catalyst to continue their emergency sheltering programs.  These funds are also used to support small businesses through training and counseling services offered through the Small Business Development Center.  The program highly exceeded their goal of providing 289 low and moderate income businesses with counseling services.  And then this is a map that's always been included in the back of the caper.  I thought I'd show it in here as a visual.  This map shows the total number of code enforcement citywide.  And then the colored areas are shaded areas that HUD considers are low.  And then the colored areas are low and moderate income census blocks.  And all of the dots within those areas are what we count as where code activity has happened over the past year.  And anyways, this is a nice visual to see where those monies go towards supporting those areas,  which the improvements, the city improvements in those areas,  and coupled with code enforcement is expected to help arrest the decline.  And the.  The caper report also includes an up-to-date summary of the use of the CDBG-CV,  the COVID funding that the city received in 2020.  Three amendments have gone to council,  which you provided direction to us on where that funding was going.  Last year, I gave an update of kind of the first round of funding that we've gotten.  This is an update of the second round of funding.  We just closed out.  An agreement with CHAT with their master lease program.  And we supported.  I guess I didn't write it in here.  63.  63 individuals through their HESH program.  And then True North was also provided assistance to hire additional shelter monitors  to maintain adequate funding to support a low barrier 24-7 emergency shelter.  And then along with the HUD funding,  we're required to provide for housing, education, and workshops.  And so along with our providers,  we were able to provide for workshops that were given to 238 people.  And then we also continue to provide fair housing referrals to local, state, and federal agencies.  And we publish information on our website.  And also have brochures regarding fair housing.  And in closing, the full CAPER report was included in tonight's agenda packet  and was available on the city's website.  Public notice was published in the enterprise record on September 7th,  encouraging public comment.  At this time, we haven't received any public comments,  but if any are received tonight,  they will be incorporated in the report before it's submitted to HUD.  And upon close of public hearing,  it's requested that council approve submission of the report to HUD.  And this concludes my report.  I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have.  All right. Thank you. Questions?  Thank you very much.  Speakers?  We do not.  You need to open the public hearing, but we don't have any.  Thank you.  Speakers?  None.  Close the public hearing.  Thank you.  Entertain a motion.  Second.  Second.  Second.  Motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds.  A second.  Was that Mr. Winslow?  Yes.  By Council Member Winslow.  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  I move item 4.2,  hearing to consider adoption of the 2022 housing elements for 2022 through 2030.  Any others in favor of this motion,  please, th th  th  the document is compliant with state law. First from Housing Tools we have Sherry  Morgado, James Coles and Jessica Candela and then from the City we have Marie  Demers and Mike Solley. I would point out that I don't usually acknowledge each  team member but this has been one of the more difficult and involved planning  efforts I've been involved with in my 19 years with the City and everyone that I  just mentioned has made significant contributions and have brought  creativity and perseverance to a very challenging planning effort. I'm gonna  ask Sherry to first provide a quick overview of some basic background and  also how we got to this point and then I'll return to wrap up what I hope is a  brief presentation. Good evening Council Members and members of the public I'm  Sherry Morgado with Housing Tools and as Brendan mentioned we have been the  City's consultant for the development of the 22-2030 housing element. So we have a  very brief presentation for you just a few slides before we  start the public hearing. So after the presentation we are asking the Council  to hold a public hearing on version 4 Draft 2022 housing element, to consider  public comment, and then to adopt a resolution determining that the adoption  of the housing element is exempt from environmental review pursuant to section  15061 b3 of CEQA adopting Draft V422 housing element as the  final version and authorizing its submittal to HCD.  So I just wanted to provide a little bit of background on the purpose of the housing element  and its mandated contents for some context in case members of the public haven't been  involved in a housing element before.  So the housing element establishes the city's priorities for housing its citizens, and this  happens in eight-year planning cycles.  It sets goals for the allocation of funding, program coordination, and zoning efforts by  the city to support the production of housing, and it is one of the mandated elements of  the city's general plan, and it must be consistent with the general plan.  There are eight mandated topics which must be addressed in each housing element.  They're listed here.  This includes a description of the city's public participation process, a review of  previous housing element progress, a housing needs assessment, an adequate sites inventory,  a financial inventory, a constraints analysis, a section that really is more than one section  on affirmatively furthering fair housing, which is really a lens through which the analysis  and the decisions about actions are made through affirmatively furthering fair housing, and  then what we call really the housing element work program, and that is a set of goals,  objectives, and goals.  And the objectives and actions that the city is going to undertake throughout this eight-year  housing element cycle to implement and address everything that was discussed in the housing  needs assessment and the constraints analysis.  So I wanted to briefly go over the timeline because, as Brendan mentioned, this has been  multiple years for the sixth cycle of the housing element.  So this timeline, you see, I started it in 2022.  I want to acknowledge that back in 2020.  The city held a number of community meetings and focus groups where we were gathering public  input on the housing element.  But 2022 is when we produced the first draft.  So that's where this timeline starts.  So we had a preliminary courtesy review of the first draft by the State Department of  Housing and Community Development in April of 2022.  Then it went to the Planning Commission in June of that year for their review and recommendation  to the city.  And then in August of 2022, the City Council reviewed and authorized staff to submit that  version of the housing element to HCD.  That is what we know as V1 or Version 1.  Then basically from late 2022 until August of this year, we had a number of revisions.  So HCD reviewed Version 1 and provided comments as well as supplementation.  So we produced revised drafts, Version 2, actually two versions of Version 3 and Version  4.  So we've gone through a number of drafts.  The city posted each subsequent draft with a public comment period for each as required  by AB 215.  And then on August 24th, HCD issued its letter indicating that Version 4 is ready for City  Council adoption and HCD certification.  Thank you.  So you might be wondering what's happened in the last year with all of those versions  and what has really changed since the housing element was in front of the City Council.  So we've summarized here the seven primary topic areas with changes to the draft housing  element in the last year.  Those seven primary areas were affirmatively furthering fair housing, the adequate sites  inventory, the increase in sites available for low or very low income units.  Group homes, actions in Chapter 3 that are part of the housing program, mobile home  parks, and reasonable accommodation procedure.  And I know that the City Council has been provided both the track changes and the clean  versions of these housing elements.  So all of those changes that you see in track changes are everything that was changed from  Version 1 to Version 4.  All of the changes made were required by HCD.  Per AB 215, each revised draft was posted on the housing element website.  An email was sent to all subscribers and comments were received for a seven-day period on each  version.  And where appropriate, public comments were addressed by editing the draft before it was  resubmitted to HCD.  I'm going to turn it back to you.  Thank you, Sherry.  So given that most California jurisdictions, both the HCD and the HCD, have a public comment,  I'm hopeful that Council will support adoption of the housing element as it is presented  to you tonight.  Even minor edits at this point would require reengaging the State, an additional public  comment period, submitting the revisions and any comments received to HCD, and then hopefully  receiving a new letter confirming the revised housing element remains statutorily compliant  with State law.  I'd prefer we don't go through the process.  I think it would be better to do it now than to do it in the future.  Waiting on adoption could also potentially jeopardize the City's access to grant funds  for affordable housing and planning efforts.  And finally, additional time working on this document delays work on programs and actions  that are outlined in the plan.  So if Council, and I mean when Council, hopefully, adopts the housing element tonight, what happens  next?  Well, I shared that getting here has been a long and involved process, but honestly,  now the real work begins.  The housing element commits the City to an extremely robust work program that will take  planning, housing, code enforcement, and public works many years to complete, including multiple  phases of code and general plan amendments to increase housing production, which you'll  see as soon as early this spring, directly supporting development of affordable housing,  promoting education, and hosting workshops regarding the availability of resources, collaborating  with local partners, promoting ADUs, conducting housing condition surveys, constructing infrastructure,  infrastructure projects, promoting housing development, and more.  And we don't just get to do the work.  We're also required to assess and report on our progress annually,  which we'll share with the state as well as council.  And so I guess my overarching point is the work isn't over.  It's really just beginning.  So again, staff is recommending the council hold a public hearing  on draft version four of the housing element, consider public comment,  and adopt a resolution adopting the housing element  and authorizing its submittal to HCD.  And staff and the consultant are available for any questions.  Thank you.  Thank you, everyone.  Questions?  Mr. V, you made a statement that the city is committed  to meeting the terms of the housing element.  What penalties can the state,  put on the city if we're at variance for some reason?  We don't meet those goals.  What can they do?  We're committed to a work program.  And so there are some parts of a work program that are, you know,  investigate an opportunity for a farmer's market at DeGarmo Park.  And there's a date set, 2027.  So we will investigate that.  We will work with CARD.  We'll see if other people are interested in supporting something like that.  But if it's not achievable, if there's not interest, if there's not support,  we'll report back to HCD.  I guess I don't see a punitive aspect to it.  You know, there's a growing pressure from the state  to put on the backs of local jurisdictions the production  or meeting the RENA numbers, Regional Housing Needs Allocation numbers.  But that's a team effort that requires funding from the state  and tax credits from the states.  So we will continue to report to them.  What we are obligated is to ensure that we have adequate sites  that are vacant, that are appropriately zoned,  with the appropriate.  Density to allow that production to occur.  So if there were something that happened during our reporting  where we fell below a threshold,  we may in fact have to come back to the council and share that per the state,  we would need to rezone some areas.  I guess ultimately their hammer would be that we're not compliant with our housing element.  I don't see that happening and that we might forego some funding.  But I don't see that being the outcome.  This is a large document, lots of commitments to programs,  and work, but we'll report annually to the state  and have coordination with them if needed.  Thank you.  I just want to preface this with just expressing my gratitude  and admiration for everybody who worked on this and got it through.  It's a huge document and it's very complex and there are a lot of new laws.  I understand that it was a very tedious process to say the least.  I was just at the American Planning Association Conference in Fresno and sat  through a workshop called Recognizing the Emergency  and Recovering from Housing Element Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  There were a lot of people in that room who did not have certifications from the state  still and they're still going through rounds of revisions and everybody is really struggling  with this.  As a state and as communities, we're struggling with a housing crisis and I think it's fully  appropriate that we have this amount of time and effort going into this.  I think the fact that we're having, I think there could be more hearings.  I don't know that this Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing section is going to be a big  issue, but it's really important that we see it as a separate issue than it really is,  but it's really important that we see it as separate issues than it really is,  but it's really important that we see it as separate issues than it really is,  but it's really important that we see it as separate issues than it really is,  but it's really important that we see it as separate issues than it really is,  but it's really important that we see it as separate issues than it really is,  but it's really important that we see it as separate issues than it really is,  but it's really important that we see it as separate issues than it really is,  but it's really important that we see it as separate issues than it really is,  reversions where we showed 10 or 15 acres of vacant land appropriately zoned and their response was  can you share how you would get to that being broken up into smaller groupings and so we had  to go through some exercises where we might limit only five acres of it to meet our numbers so  it was through that interface with them that i wouldn't call it a roadblock but they said  we don't believe the 15 acres could all be produced the affordable housing so we would say  okay we'll pull it back to five uh five of the acres so it was through that engagement right  so a lot of the policies in the housing program we have things like implement zones that we already  have it's a continuation of policies that we already have but saying that we're going to  be committed to them through this the one that really stood out to me as the most substantial  change was the rezoning of industrial office mixed use where you could only have 14 units an acre and  it had to be like live work some sort now you can build 35 units an acre in all those areas and i  wonder if you could  summarize how we came to that policy where that affects in anything else sure  IOMU industrial office mixed use zoning designation was a new concept that came out of the  2030 general plan that was adopted in 2011. it was like i'll call it an experimental zone  and it was applied not very liberally it was in very focused areas one area is the wedge  park fair park 20th that little area that looks like a wedge and a few  areas along North Highway 32 leaving town.  And the more we thought about it, the more engagement we'd had with people,  some of the vision language in the general plan that talked about kind of the opportunity in those  areas to repurpose them. We just kind of  put our toe in the concept of some residential uses there, and we  thought, really, there's some real opportunities given that  why not increase the density opportunities,  especially along North, but also in the wedge, knowing that we had some interest of some folks  for some residential projects in those areas. And we think it just  made sense. It was like a continuum of an opportunity. And then the density,  of course, allows us to use that area to help meet our regional housing allocation  need. So it was just more of an inspired, again, I  mentioned earlier that there was a lot of conversations and thoughts, and we took  comments we received from the public, and we thought about those, and we  changed our own thinking.  We don't see it as a separate issue, but it's a separate issue, and it's a  separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue,  and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue,  and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue,  and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue,  and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue,  and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue,  and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue,  and it's a separate issue, and it's a separate issue,  I wonder if there were other actions to meet that shortfall of low-income housing capacity that were considered shortlisted.  I don't think anything as substantive as that.  And again, while there's a commitment to that process, it will have to go through a public process, go to the Planning Commission for its consideration, get a recommendation.  We'll dig into it, understand a little bit better maybe about some of the impacts given that it's industrial office mixed use, residential uses.  We'll have to think about adjacency of uses and how there might be impacts to existing more industrial uses.  So there will be more effort put into that, and then it will ultimately come to Council whether or not we make those amendments.  And if we didn't, that would be an opportunity where we'd have—I shouldn't say an opportunity.  That's when we would have to reengage the state and say some of that area that we were counting towards meeting our RENA numbers can't be used.  We think we're still above the limit, but we're getting closer to that limit.  So it's not a fait accompli.  There will be—  There will still be a public process.  Yeah.  It certainly is a lot of pressure on us to accept it now given the place and the process that we're at.  It's almost impossible to vet it fully on the fly.  It'll have to go through that process, I guess.  All right.  Vice Mayor?  I just had one question.  I was looking mainly on page 71 regarding the mobile home parks.  What is a non-profit housing development organization?  Like CHIP.  Okay.  So it would be CHIP would want to buy somebody's trailer park and turn it—and do something with it and turn it into potentially?  But it's not saying this is something—okay.  And then it got me looking at the 4.2.6.  It's calling the 2.44 acre, but actually 1.61 acres are owned by the city.  The other .83 is owned by—  By Chico State.  We aren't tied into having to do something with that.  We could develop the 1.61 acres on our own if we wanted to do something in a private—  Correct.  Like most of this, it's a point in time, and it's capturing an exercise where we identify that we do believe we have opportunities to meet those numbers.  Then that plan, that template, meets reality.  And the city is not—you know, we're not playing a game of Sin City where the planners are sitting around and putting things in.  There will be—that project might die for reasons unknown to us.  And then that will have to come off of our RENA list.  But meanwhile, other things might appear and show up and be added to our inventory.  And then city-owned parking within central city opportunity sites, a.k.a. downtown?  Pretty much downtown.  To be turned into housing.  Not sure I can buy on with that one, but—  It's just investigations.  I mean—and then—  And then the best vision of that is the Lost Park parking area and kind of the culmination of the partnership we have with this university.  Further questions?  No?  No?  Oh, no.  Okay. Sorry.  Go ahead.  There's a lot on this document, you know.  I hate to take a lot of time.  There's a lot more areas I think we can get into than I really am going to be able to.  But there are some—like another really substantial thing that I think didn't come out into the PowerPoint, but—  But when—in my experience in watching this process go on and seeing the changes, I noticed one of the most substantial things that HCD shot the city down on was, we did have our typical parking zoning, R3, medium, high density.  We had sites like that for low-income housing, but in the analysis of density to accommodate low-income housing, they have it crossed out because 22 units an acre, they determined, was not like high enough density to make affordable housing projects feasible.  So, I think that's a really important thing to think about.  So, when we're talking about the programs that we could do in order to make up that shortfall, I wonder, because 30 units an acre statewide, statutorily, you can accept that for low-income housing.  And why we couldn't just bump up the maximum density on medium-high density from 22 to 30.  That would be a proposal to change.  I don't know that—adding an additional program would also require us to go back to the state and require this kind of tedious work.  I don't know if we could do that.  I think it would be a tedious process to repeat, but—  It would.  But many of the areas that we identified, while the base zoning was under the MHDR, the medium—the R3 or the medium-high density residential, a lot of them are in the corridor opportunity areas, I think, which does allow much greater than 30.  Right.  There's a lot of areas—I mean, for example, in my district, on the Esplanade, where it's a boulevard with trees, it is not a corridor opportunity site.  So, when you have areas that are loud—  —up to 22 units an acre, according to the state's analysis, that's not good enough for affordable housing.  Not until you get to the north side of the Lindo Channel, once it becomes a strode with no trees and kind of barren out there.  That's when you can build high density housing.  I would just add—this is James Coles from HousingSource.  I would just add to that that Action 3.3.6 is responding to that need in which we—which the city's committed to amending the zoning code.  To allow up to 30 units per acre for affordable housing projects in commercial mixed-use zones and residential zones.  I also want to just point out that the—all of the sites that are in the lower income sites inventory must—they have a density of at least 30 units per acre.  So, that is a change that we made.  We made sure that all of those sites that are in the lower income sites inventory could be developed at 30 units an acre.  We're assuming 24 units an acre just to be conservative as far as the capacity.  But all of those sites can be developed at least 30 units per acre.  Thank you, James.  There is one further thing that I have to do.  I mean, just frankly, my—I think there's nothing more important coming from the council than like what our response is to the housing shortage and how we're addressing it.  And that's what this plan is.  It's both a requirement by the state, but it's also our opportunity to review the totality of our housing policies and look for a response to that.  So, I'm going to stop here.  There's one more thing.  There's actually a public comment here earlier that made me think about it.  Just in terms of the things that have happened since this whole process has taken—has gone on.  We have some policies in there.  I mentioned like implement the traditional neighborhood development code or says to implement our quarter opportunity sites overlay.  These are things that we put in the general plan to encourage like high density housing and kind of low income housing in places.  And I've heard now that one of our special planning areas that we have designated for the city is the housing housing program.  And I'm not sure if you've heard of it.  But it's a program that's been going on for like a mixture of housing.  It should address some of our low income housing needs.  There's a proposal to develop 15 acre ranchettes out there instead.  Sort of a—it seems like a threat that if this development is shot down, then they will go a route of providing less housing, even more spread out with even worse impacts.  And I wonder if we can put in a policy to say that the city would be committed to making sure that area in our sphere of influence does not get developed under county jurisdiction, under county standards like that.  15 acre ranchettes.  Okay.  Is that a question?  That'd be—I mean, that is a proposal of mine.  So it's up for the council to address.  Okay.  So let's wait for that portion.  And then we'll move on to more of the public hearing and take public comment.  Okay.  We have three speakers.  The first one is Annette Heinemeier followed by Katie Thoma.  We might have four speakers.  All right.  Three minutes and then we can line up behind you.  Okay.  Thank you.  My name is Annette Heinemeier, and I'm a relatively recent denizen here in this wonderful city of Chico.  And I thank you all for taking public comments on this very important issue of housing.  I really appreciate the effort that the council goes to with its general plan and planning for the various types of housing, including smart growth initiatives, which include infill.  I'm very concerned about the valley's edge development.  I'm being included in the general plan simply because it is the type of community from which I exited in order to come here.  It is a HOA-based, you know, master plan development.  And I can understand the appeal of all of that.  But it does do two things.  One is it really puts at high risk the demands on our aquifer system.  And I don't know—and this is my ignorance, and I apologize—but I really do want to understand.  And I hope the rest of, you know, my community also is seeking to understand the impacts that we're expecting to see from that sort of intensive development.  The concerns I have are also related to the nature of, you know, these parks that are intended to be built as part of this community and the nature of a rail line that will be going out to it.  It doesn't feel to me like this would be like Cal Park.  Let's use that as an example.  I mean, it's a lovely community.  How many people from downtown would actually go there to take mute?  Make use of the multi-use trails?  I don't see that happening.  And I think that this kind of community at Valley's Edge is very much going to be that sort of insular, sort of, you know, high-end community that isn't likely to kind of feel like a part of Chico, which is a unique and amazing community, really, that I've come to just love.  My hope is that you, the city council, and the rest of the community will come together to find a plan that is, you know, with all due respect to the incredible amount of planning.  I think that's going to be an effort that has gone into this so far, to come up with a plan that is less demanding on our aquifer and something that will help sustain the growth that we truly do need within Chico in a more, I don't know, sort of inclusive way.  So thank you very much for your time.  Appreciate it.  Okay.  Katie Toma.  And then let me just get back to that.  Julian Zinner is next after Katie.  Go ahead, Katie.  Okay.  Good evening.  Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and council members.  My name is Katie Toma, and I'm the executive director of the Chico Builders Association.  I am here this evening merely to comment on the 2022 housing element.  But the first thing I want to say is Chico needs housing, all housing.  And we'd like to begin our comments, secondly, to acknowledge and thank city staff and the consultants for this process.  And it was a huge undertaking for us.  We were very grateful to have them speaking on their part.  It was very tedious, as Councilmember Addison Winslow said.  So we just appreciate all the hard work.  And as we went through it, we were there from the beginning.  We fully participated as an organization throughout the process.  The document is very long and very detailed.  And it was an arduous process.  And at times very frustrating that HCD kept moving the goalpost.  And, you know, thinking it's done, then you have to go back.  CBA actively participated in this very public process of updating the 2022 housing element.  Much like the general plan, it is vital to participate in such important matters as these.  And we appreciate the opportunities to participate as afforded by statute and the municipal code.  And staff was tremendous, and housing tools, and keeping us all informed any time there were any changes.  And staff was tremendous, and housing tools, and keeping us all informed any time there were any changes.  made along the way. We have weighed in a few times with our concerns as it relates to the  housing element, and our concerns remain the same. As we stated in our letter to the housing  department on November 30th of 2022, the city identified 42 privately owned properties that  are categorized by income level from extremely low to above moderate that designate where  affordable housing units could be built. Though not required, the city did not notify the property  owners their property was designated as such. We still find this lack of transparency unacceptable.  When version three of the housing element was released, we were surprised to see the addition  of the exact language of inclusionary zoning in action 3.3.6. This language  includes the addition of the exact language of inclusionary zoning in action 3.3.6. This language  is similar language found in other cities who have an inclusionary zoning policy.  The city of Chico does not have such a policy, nor has the city council ever accepted it for  consideration. CBA, in conclusion, would like to note that private landowners are not required to  build affordable housing units on their property, even if it's been designated as affordable in the  2022 housing element. And in my final, final words,  Chico needs housing, all housing. Thank you.  Let me turn my mic on. Julian Zinner, followed by Kimberly Michael.  Good evening, Mayor, City Council members. I'm Julian Zinner. I want to congratulate the city staff for the remarkable  and extraordinary work that they have done to ensure that the City Council is able to maintain its original  and comprehensive element for Chico 2022 to 2030. The 479 pages with four revisions took a huge amount of work.  We learned that several new state and federal laws facilitate infill and available housing,  that millions of dollars of state and federal funds  have been given to the city and the county for our housing problems.  We also learned that one-fourth of Chico renters earn less than $20,000 a year,  and that one-third pay over 50% of their income for housing costs. And as you know, over 30%  marks an individual as housing.  We also learned that in 2020, when we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  we received a separate notice, we received a separate notice,  action plans to improve Chico's housing crisis.  It's also stated that adequate land exists within the city limits,  within the city limits for all our housing needs to 2030.  Yet when the rubber meets the road, Chico has done a terrible job building  for our needs as described by the so-called regional housing  needs allocation.  Since 2014 through 2021,  we built two times as many above-moderate income homes,  but only one-third the number of very low-income units that was called for.  The new housing element calls  for one-third of new units to be very low income  and one-third above moderate income.  Hopefully, we can do substantially better in meeting the needs  for all our population than we've done in the past.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Kimberly Michael.  Good evening, council.  I'll be short.  I just want to say I hope we all can collectively, especially you guys in power,  to do everything we can to improve the quality of housing,  to do everything needed to become in compliance with state regulations for housing.  All the speakers before me said it.  I'll say it again.  We need housing.  And I wasn't going to speak when I heard you want to prioritize parking spaces over homes.  I got a little energized.  So that's all I'll say.  Thanks.  All right.  That was it.  Yes.  All right.  Let's close the public hearing.  And  entertain a motion.  Can we talk for a second about inclusionary zoning?  That's awesome.  And that policy 3.3.6, it's like, you know, you get a, you can build up to three units  an acre, but only if you provide a certain number of affordable housing.  What I have to say about it is I asked a particular apartment builder about it.  And I thought, I expected him to say that that's not really feasible because if you  have to subsidize these units, then you're not really going to want to get that density  anyway, so it won't happen.  I was surprised he actually said that.  He thought it kind of could pencil out.  But he said that the parking spaces would be an issue, that having that many parking  spaces in the lot, it would make that kind of development in fee.  We don't really have any substantial parking reductions in this.  But what that, yeah, what that does is, I mean, perhaps the rest of the project are  feasible with it.  It's not quite inclusionary zoning by my definition, but, you know.  Thank you.  Can I ask staff to please address the issue of inclusionary zoning?  The mention that we adopted language that's...  There's nothing inclusionary about the action.  It's suggesting that, again, in consultation with the state, they're looking to make sure  that the projects, the zoning that we think historically has gotten us affordable housing  in the R3, medium-high residential density, has been in the 22, 24, 25, or even 30-year  25-unit-per-acre zone.  They shared with us that as becoming a jurisdiction over 100,000, there's just a new floor for  us, and that's 30 units per acre.  And so we shared, how about we come up with this action that says if there's going to  be a percentage, if we said 50% of units, honestly, any project that's affordable is  usually 100% affordable.  Let's be honest.  The city doesn't have these, you know, unique 15%.  We'd love to...  We'll indulge those, but...  So the point is if there's any units with a minimum of 15 that are going to be deed-restricted  or affordable, you instantly get to take that zoning up to 30 units per acre.  It's not a reverse.  It's not...  If you build 30...  It's reverse of what I would consider that type of zoning.  It's a carrot.  It's not a stick.  Does that make sense?  Gotcha.  So it's allowing them...  Yes.  Easily to go up to the 30 instead of sticking to the 24.  Right.  But it's not a mandated...  It's not a mandated.  And if when we come back with zone changes and the zone change for R3 has this footnote,  the Planning Commissioner and Council, or even if staff during the process investigation  thinks that some of these areas can handle more than 20 units per acre, we're not...  This isn't dictating what we get to do.  I mean, that would be fine.  And just as a reminder, because there was mention that there was people new to the area,  that our general plan was done in 2011 and it was about 10,000 hours that was put in it  and it was several million dollars over about what, a five-year period-ish?  Three and a half, probably.  Three and a half.  Okay.  Three and a half years.  So this was done in 2011 and now we're talking about different SPAs that are starting to  come online that were identified back then.  And I'm aware of two of them that are being done and one of them is going to add about  300,000 units per acre.  So that's a lot of money.  So we're talking about 300,000 houses over about a 30-year time period.  So, right, it's not a two-year build-out, it's about 300,000 houses.  So when we talk about meeting all kinds of houses, my understanding is about 10% of that  is low-income housing along with schools and shopping and parks and different things.  And while Chico, our housing prices are 20% higher than Redding, our neighbor just an  hour away where we're competing for doctors and lawyers and all the teachers and everything  that we want to come to our community, and we're not getting that much of a housing  budget.  And I'm aware of two of them that are being done and one of them is going to add about  And 62% of their houses up there sold for under $400,000 over the last three months.  So we're a little bit behind and losing those 3,000 houses would be a huge tragedy.  So thank you for all your hard work that you've done on this.  And I'll take that opening to share that, yes, the general plan is a compromise and  there's support for infill, but there's also support for the special planning areas.  They're supposed to be planned thoughtfully, have a mix of uses.  And when it was adopted, it understood that that area in Valley's Edge, that area in  Valley's Edge was moving up a little bit in the foothills, but the development will  be moved down and the areas to the east would be protected in open space.  And so if you support the general plan, you should be supporting all the special planning  areas as well.  Yeah.  So we're building on rocks instead of building on farming ground where we're building agriculture  and supporting our agricultural community.  So anyways, I would make a move to approve.  I have a quick comment.  All right.  One second.  Okay.  So we have a motion and a second.  We'll go to comment.  Comments?  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for getting this document to us today, everybody who worked on it.  I just also want to notice here that we do see, we always talk about affordable housing  and I'm not by any way negating it that we need affordable housing, but we do need to  see we have moderate income and above moderate income arena numbers are combined together  as more than the lower income housing.  So when in a city we need, that clearly tells us that we need housing of every kind.  And we need to explore opportunities for every possible kind of housing projects here, not  just affordable housing.  That's what I wanted to say.  Yes.  Thank you.  All right.  Further comment from council before we vote?  Just a little closing thing.  I was really uncertain how, if I would support it just because I do feel like we could add  a lot more in here.  I think we could step up our game a whole lot.  We haven't really had the opportunity to.  So I'm going to move on to the next item.  And there's two things that made me think that one is, remember like the urban forest  master plan and we like sent it off to the state, but we said we're going to come back  and like whittle it down later.  We sort of have the opposite thing going on where we're going to discuss a pro housing  designation.  So we have the opportunity to look at further actions to support addressing our housing  crisis in the future.  And what Mr. Veague just said that when we do implement some of these actions, we will  have the opportunity also to perhaps step them up a little bit, decide that we can actually  make more projects more feasible.  By doing the action a little differently, but really exceeding what we have in the plan.  And I think that's a good thing.  So I think I'm actually going to support it.  All right.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  I'd say with the same.  I think it's a heavy agenda, we have to take a break, but we're not going to because we  don't have a heavy agenda.  So, item 5, there is not, which I've never said before, I can't believe I've ever said  that.  All right.  Reports and communications, following reports and communications, items are provided for  the council's information, no action can be taken or items under this section unless  the council agrees to include it on subsequent agenda and 6.1 City Manager's Report.  No report.  Look at that.  We have a sun shining event at NYU, council member request, 6.1 City Manager's Report,  6.3% to AP and P10, 10 council members may verbally request an item be agendized at a  future meeting after stating what the item will be.  The majority of council is needed in order for the staff to agendize.  Do we have any council member requests?  All right.  Seeing none, we will adjourn.  Thank you all for being here.
