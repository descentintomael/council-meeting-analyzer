 Okay. Council member. So let's just start, let's just start that again. So we'll, because we just started recording we will reconvene from the regular city council meeting and call the meeting order. Madam clerk, you can do the role. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Brown here. Council member Morgan. Council member O'Brien here. Council member Tandon here. Vice mayor Reynolds. And mayor Coolidge. Virtually present. All right. Public participation due to the recent universal masking indoors mandate issued by the California department of public health and to protect the health of its citizens. The council is meeting this way, virtually via zoom. The public has been invited to participate remotely. Submit comments via the engaged Chico app or a link found on the city's website. With those comments closing at four 30. And as always citizens may always email their comments directly to the city council citizens wishing to address an item on the agenda will be asked to raise their hands. And we ask you to do that once the item has begun. So once you're given permission to speak, you will be asked to unmute yourself. If you're calling on a cell phone, or if you're calling in via zoom on the cell phone, you will use six star six to raise your hand and star nine to lower it. At the request of staff item 5.4 will not be heard at this meeting in order to be considered by the finance committee. So, and then I believe we have a closed session announcement from the January 4th council meeting, Mr. Ewing. I'm happy to read that if you would like. Okay. That's fine. Actually it's on, let me just pull it up. It's on your, I can read it if you like, please. Thank you. All right. So a closed session announcement from the January 4th council meeting. Item 7.2, Warren v. Chico. The city attorney announced that the council met in closed session for item 7.2, Warren versus the city of Chico. The council voted unanimously 7-0 to authorize the city manager and city attorney to enter into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs. That approval is not final until the presiding judge signs the settlement order, which could take up to two weeks. At that time, the city can discuss and disclose the details of the settlement agreement. Item 7.3, labor negotiations. This item was continued to a future meeting and not discussed at this meeting. So with that, we'll move on to the consent agenda. Item 2, all matters listed under the consent agenda are considered routine in that note nature and can be acted in enacted by any motion. Do we have any speakers on this item? So I would ask any of the attendees, we have 45 of them. And if any of them wish to speak on consent agenda items only, if they would raise their hand, we'll give it, um, give them a second to do that. I do not see any hands being raised. All right. Do we have any, uh, council disqualifications or no votes? All right. Hearing none. We'll entertain a motion. Move approval of consent. Second. Motion from council member Brown, a second from council member Tandon. Madam Clerk, you can take the role. Okay. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Brown. Aye. Council member Morgan. Yes. Council member O'Brien. Yes. Council member Tandon. Yes. Vice mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries seven zero. All right. Thank you. Um, item three business from the floor members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter on already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three. Minutes or determined based on the number of speakers. If you're interested in speaking on business from the floor, if you could please raise your hand now, um, and the council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. And then let us know in a second when you have the number of speakers. So right now we have four speakers, but I would probably, I would probably ask for a few minutes, um, just because the, that legislation that allows for adequate time for the public to raise their hand. And sure. So we still have only four. Are there any other individuals that are listening in when, who would like to speak from business from the floor? Okay. So at this time, mayor college, we have four speakers. The first speaker is Nicole Nava. All right. Three minutes. And as soon as Nicole unmutes herself, we'll be able to proceed. Okay. Nicole, go ahead.! Thank you. I appreciate you doing that every time we don't have an option anyway. Um, good evening. Um, so I'm basically calling in because like other people, I'm super confused at how we got to this point with the settlement agreement. And I listened to the press conference. I've read through comments made by the council that to date have provided comment. And I'm very distressed because it appears that, um, even you all are not, not an agreement as to what you heard and what was explained to you. And you are, some of you know, you didn't get the settlement agreement to read through. I'm frankly appalled that you would go off of a verbal that was provided by our city attorney versus you reading through documentation as our representatives. That is something you should be doing. I'm going to draw your attention to the settlement agreement. And in section, uh, where it outlines line 22 or, or number 22, knowing involuntary, I'm going to read this for everybody. This agreement is an important legal document and in all respects has been voluntarily and knowingly executed by the parties, the parties, and each of them specifically represent that before signing and within the time to consider whether to accept this agreement, they have each carefully read and fully accepted. Understand all of the provisions of this agreement. And they are voluntarily knowingly and without coercion entering into this agreement based upon their own judgment, plaintiffs, and each of them further specifically represent that before signing this agreement, they have conferred with counsel of their choice to the extent desired concerning the legal effect of this agreement and that the legal effect of this agreement has been adequately explained to. I, I am sorry, but you all, all seven of you were put there as representatives of this city. And I feel like at some level, everyone appears to be derelict in some regard as to their understanding of this document. And further, I will posit to you that the judges, um, ban did not necessarily include you taking a pulse point of your own community ahead of time, to say a temperature reading in general, because we can't share specifics of anything and do this at the outset on, on a scale of low to we're giving into medium to they're getting full boat. Where should we bug out and just go to court on this? And had you got that kind of buy-in, you might be getting a different reaction from people, but lying, ignoring, not reading, not doing due diligence, shame, shame, shame. I'm just, I'm going to put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, put it down here, the city has changed a lot but much more so in the last few years but you know that so many people come to these meetings to tell you how long they've been here and how disappointed they are with your performance that you're attempting to manage those changes the challenges are very significant and there are no easy answers the homeless population and the conditions are greatly affected by forces well outside of the council's power as well as forces far outside of the city limits you folks put up with a lot of abuse and i'm sorry about that if the job was easy more people would be commending you now with a conservative majority many of the supporters their supporters thought the council would solve the problems quickly complex conditions require a long period of time to address must be disappointing when you your opponents and your supporters are both complaining i came here tonight to tell you that i think i speak for the majority of our population doesn't everybody i know that you are doing your best i really appreciate you for your commitment to service and i'm sincerely proud of you thanks for all that you do if there's anything you can do to reduce division or equity i strongly encourage you to do so it seems a too much public comment during business from the floor and the local mass media or social media is coming from disgruntled people and it may trigger others to have a less than ideal emotional reaction consider setting up a task force on political reconciliation but limit participants whose public comments are sparse or maybe set up a second task force on political reconciliation for those people whose public comments are abundant the measured and the unmeasured reconciliation task forces to put a stop to this moment it is a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share I'd like to make a suggestion for you to consider for the future. So I was actually looking around. I stumbled upon on the Roseville City Council website. I stumbled upon this thing that they have. It's called Community Coffee with City Council. And it's basically this thing where city council members host coffees with community members to discuss city related topics. And it looks like it's just one council member at a time. So for example, January 26, one of the council members is doing a coffee, one of these coffees from 630 to 8 p.m. So far, it's not canceled. It is still on. So I just wanted to suggest it in light of the fact that I think it's a good idea to think about how we can build a positive connection and relationship between our council members and citizens of Chico, especially in light of everything that's going on. Sure, we can attend city council meetings, send emails. But there's something to be said for members of the council at different times throughout the year, sitting down and talking about issues that are important to them, as well as other members of the community. So, you know, in the past few years, we've had meetings that have been shut down. The public's been locked out in some cases. So it's a good idea to think about how to strengthen and in some cases, rebuild a positive relationship between our local government officials and the public. I know that people want to be informed. They want to know their local government. They want to know their local government. And their concerns. Something like coffee with a council member could be a really fun idea. And also give us a chance, you know, to hear from you guys. I'm, you know, you could figure out if you, you know, how you would do it. If you take questions, comments, all that kind of thing, you could obviously control that. But I think there are plenty of people that aren't scared to go out and sit in a well ventilated space. We know two years down the road with everything going on with COVID, we're not in a bubonic plague. And with that, we're not going to be able to do anything. So with that being said, I hope we can get back to in-person meetings soon. And hopefully the King, aka Governor Newsom, doesn't extend the mask mandate for too much longer. One can hope for the best. Anyways, thanks for considering this idea. And I hope you have a great night. Thank you. Julie Threat. Go ahead and unmute yourself. Okay. Did this work, Ms. Debbie? Fantastic. Well, okay. Hello, council. Hello, council. And it's not like we don't have a few things. I was going back and forth between the press conference and trying to put out a few fires with the redistricting happening at the school board. So I'm first going to cover that. So the Chico Unified School District, for all of you on the council, all of you staff members and everybody in the audience, they're going through the redistricting process like the county did. But they're going through it for the very first time. And we had a whole process that went on with the consultant, like normal, had maps prepared to be voted on tomorrow night at the meeting. Blue, green, and purple. All the strategies and all the philosophies. And over the weekend, we got an orange map that came out of left field from the four socialist council members. So everything's kind of had a big monkey wrench in terms of the timing and the deadlines in the meeting. So I just really urge everybody to go to the Chico Unified School District website, get involved, get engaged in how the maps will be drawn. Because once we do this, it's 10 years. And that's going to be the person that gets elected from that district or neighborhood and gets put on. Yeah. And that's going to be the board of supervisors. So second, I'll just tag team on what Dr. Posey said, as well as Matt York. I totally am also focused on the communications and the positive angle to this because now we can move forward. But I was also thinking about a communication commission. I hate that word commission, but a group of people that could maybe get together that are absolutely 100% all in on helping this thing go forward positively. And it's just another means, maybe a different means to get communications out there. And it really is a really fun moment to share a piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece of this piece piece of this piece of this piece piece of this piece of this piece of this piece piece of this piece piece of this piece piece of this piece same question. So if there's a way that that would be helpful, I would be all in on that. And then if there's, again, a website where we can just start housing this information, the settlement agreement, the press conference video, and it, again, doesn't have to be fancy at first. Let's just put it out there, and then we can go to that for communication. But yeah, I'm in agreement with all that, the task force, et cetera. And again, for me, if I have Topeka Tandon and Casey Reynolds and Sean Morgan and Chief O'Brien agreeing on this thing, I was all in. I'm good. So I appreciate all you guys do. Lucky to be quiet. Thank you. Thank you. Jessica Giannola, go ahead and unmute yourself. There, I think I got it. Okay. Thank you. Hi, Council. I just wanted to add some comments in on the the settlement, of course. I was really, really excited, honestly, excited and happy to see the different things that were going to be offered, hearing of different things going to be offered for people who have nothing right now. And I was honestly really surprised to see some of the community reaction being so strong against providing these necessary services that help get people out of their homes. And I think that's really, really important. And I think that's really, really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really them. It's going to help them and it helps the city. It helps everybody. So I was surprised. I was surprised to hear that we had a council member on city letterhead request that not, maybe not everything be accepted. And I'm just, you know, in my mind, I'm thinking, well, what in the world would you take off that list? Are we taking showers away from people? Are we taking food away? I just don't understand why we wouldn't take anything away. Whatever happened with the compromise. I think that Ewing, I think he eventually did a great job at being able to do his job, despite maybe being hired to enforce laws that turned out were extremely illegal. And we can't keep blaming the judge for enforcing rights. These are legal rights that people have that were violated. And we must remember that. And blaming the city's staff and saying that, you know, they did a great job. The city, gosh, staff, you're doing such an amazing job. You have to work under different council that have different views and try to make them happy. And it must drive half you insane. I don't know. But I appreciate the hard work of the city. And I just wish that our council, our elected officials would stop painting our poorest people as enemies, people from out of town and extremists. They're people, they're poor people. We have poor people here. And trying to deflect decisions that you made that causes litigation, just own it. And please work harder moving forward instead of blaming other people. Anyway, I'm hopeful for our city in what's being offered. And I'm hopeful that we can grow forward. And I just appreciate everyone's hard work in helping people and helping our neighbors. Thank you very much. Thank you. And we do have two additional speakers. Kelly Johnson, go ahead. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. Thanks. So I think the entire city of Chico pretty much can agree on one thing, and that is that Vince Ewing should be fired. Vince is the individual who wrote the series of laws that got Chico stuck in this quagmire of litigation. They were blatantly unconstitutional, specifically written to try to get around Martin versus Boise. He should have known that. He should have warned you guys against that. He led you straight down this path that is and will cost you millions of dollars. He infuriated the judge on day one by refusing to obey a court order. He hid the ball from the judge and the judge saw that right away. And that put you, the city of Chico, in the worst possible position in this litigation. He also openly lied to the judge. He wrote in the opposition to the temporary restraining order that the target team had to be removed from the court. And he said, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to put a tag on it. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. And it was a tag on a piece of furniture. when the judge slammed you guys for failing to adhere to a court order that y'all continue to retain Vince Ewing through this process, but it's high time that he is fired. Thank you. So we have one last speaker and you will need, if you can identify yourself, it is a phone number. Go ahead and unmute yourself. Hello, can you hear me? There you go. Go ahead. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. So this is Jeff Creed. You know, I'm not going to mince words and I'm not going to be the guy who says, you know, we all need to hug each other. I'm sorry. I told you a year ago, I told you longer than a year ago, you need to fire a bunch of people. And, you know, I didn't do that out of ignorance. You may see whatever you see when you look at me, but, you know, I've experienced in management and leadership in multiple types of businesses over years. And I've been to a ton of management and training. So when I was downtown outside the council building 20 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago, there's a torn flag in front of the building. The gold star flag is torn still again. And I know no business, no organization would retain a manager who goes to work in a building with a torn flag flying out. And I know no business, And it's been years, over half a decade that I've been bringing that up. So when I say you need to fire the city manager, I'm not saying that like some ignorant idiot off the street who just got a wild hair somewhere. I'm saying it with experience. I'm saying it with experience that most of you don't have. Most of you have lived in a bubble your entire professional career. I've worked on many, many different leaders under many different leaders. I've hired and hired a lot of people. I've hired and fired people in many different arenas. And so it just cracks me up. It just cracks me up. And again, I'm not going to mince words. The mayor should literally just resign. You're not going to stand up to the recall. There's no way possible. After what you said today and what Nicole Nava pointed out, there is no possible way you're going to stand up to the recall. I was 17 when I joined the military. I signed my first contract in my life. And I knew more about signing contracts when I was 17 than apparently the seven of you because I knew to read every single word before I signed it. And I knew what a power of attorney was. I was educated what a power of attorney was, which is essentially what you gave Vince when you voted for him to execute that agreement without you reading it. That's the best we can deduce from the chitter chatter from all the counselors is that you guys voted on a verbal agreement to let Vince execute that agreement. And I think that's the best we can do to execute that contract without reading it. That's the best deduction any of us can get because we're not getting straight answers across the board. And to have the mayor stand behind the podium and speak poorly of two other city counselors, that just blew me away. I almost fell over today when he said that. So, you know, the city needs leadership. You need to plan out and track a path to mitigate the damages that this settlement's going to do to the city. And you need to plan out a track to a clean and prosperous city. And you're beyond the horizon of planning. No, it's 2.49 on my clock. I get my full three minutes. The time is up, actually, now. Go ahead, Mayor Coolidge. All right, thank you. All right, so moving on to public hearings, we have none. So we will move on to the regular agenda. Item 5.1 is... Team Chico informational update. And for this, we will ask for Deputy City Manager Jennifer McCarthy. Hello. Hello, good evening, Mayor Coolidge. Vice Mayor Reynolds, members of the council. Jennifer McCarthy, Deputy City Manager. And tonight, I have the honor of providing you an update on the Team Chico organization and give you a little glimpse of the 2022 work plan that we're working towards. So with that, I'm going to share my screen. All right, everybody see that okay? Yes. Yes, I do. Right, okay. So Team Chico is a public-private economic development collaborative. It was formed in 2012, originally with five primary organizations. Those included the Chamber of Commerce, the City of Chico, Three Corps, Alliance for Workforce Development, and the Downtown Chico Business Association. The original purpose of Team Chico really was to help businesses through the development of a new business. And so Team Chico was the first organization to do the recovery from the Great Recession. But that momentum moved forward. And actually, over the course of the years, this became an award-winning statewide model. In such, the city received recognition and the team received recognition through the League of California Cities, as well as the California Association for Local Economic Development, also known as CALED. Throughout this time, Team Chico has really had the focus of understanding business needs and working towards responding collaboratively. As I stated, when Team Chico was originally formed, it had five member organizations primarily, but today that group has grown. And it has grown to really include all of the organizations that are providing direct services to businesses located in the Chico area. That includes our Alliance for Workforce Development, Butte College, the training place, Butte College Small Business Development Center, Chico State University, the Chico Chamber of Commerce, the Downtown Chico Business Association, Explore Butte County, the North State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, North State Planning and Development Collective, and Three Corps. And if we were in person today, I would ask all of those folks to stand up so that you could get to know them if you didn't already know them. So that will happen at a future meeting. So what is it that Team Chico does and how do we do it? Well, over the past year, most of the efforts of Team Chico have really been focused on assisting businesses through the recovery from the pandemic. And we continue to do that. So we're going to be working with the team to really share a piece of this work to share a piece of this work to share a piece of this work to share a piece of this work to share a piece of this work to share a piece of this work to share a piece of this work four areas, they're addressed through many different initiatives that we'll be talking about shortly. Primarily, we focus on getting information to businesses, understanding what resources are out there or what resources are needed, connecting businesses with those resources, and then also working towards a positive community brand. The action items that Team Chica will be working on over the coming year are primarily focused in the five areas that you see on your screen, and I'll go over them just briefly. Resources. Resources. Businesses are always interested in understanding what resources are out there to assist my business, so we are working on putting together an updated document that will provide that contact information and information on what services are provided and where and how to get a hold of people. That will be both in a document, but then it will also be available online, and it will be given to businesses when they actually come to the City of Chico to sign up for a business license as well. Business outreach has always been a backbone of the Team Chico program. We've always felt really the importance of the team, and we've always felt really the importance of the team, and we've always felt really the importance of going out and meeting directly with the business community to get to know them, to get to know their business, and get to really understand their needs. So we will be working on developing the outreach program. We'll also be taking a look at labor pool development and retention. We are, just like every other community, unfortunately, in the state of California right now, dealing with labor pool issues. So Team Chico will work to understand our local issues and work towards responding accordingly. Data tools. We'll be working on developing a data tool for the team to understand our local issues and work towards understanding our local issues and work towards understanding our local issues and work towards that data in a variety of different ways. That is really important for a multitude of reasons. It helps businesses consider expanding or locating in our area. It helps individuals determine if Chico is the right place for them, and it also helps inform policy and programmatic decisions. Finally, we're working on a little community branding opportunity through Choose Chico. Some of you might remember that back in 2014, the City worked on the creation of a Choose Chico campaign with private partners that work with organizations like that that work with organizations like that that as well. That campaign was really focused on how can we create a brand for our community that is positive and one that is seen not just here in the city of Chico, but elsewhere as a community that is a fantastic place to live and to do business. So we're picking up where that left off and growing that. There will be more to come. I look forward to sharing that information with the council as it becomes available. So in summary, in 2021, Team Chico has worked to reboot and put together our initial planning efforts. And in 2022, you're going to see us hitting the street and really working on these items. In addition to these items, as you know, the city of Chico will be working on several other economic development projects that are funded through the American Rescue Plan. Those projects include such things as the Business Enhancement Grant Program and a Small Business Assistance Program. Our team will be working on a number of other projects that are funded through the American Rescue Plan. Our Team Chico partners will help us through the implementation of that. Specifically, we'll be working with 3COR through a subrecipient agreement, but then our other partners will play a role in that as well. So when those programs are ready for implementation, again, you'll hear more from us and more details on those. So at this point, I'd really like to acknowledge our Team Chico players, our partner organizations, and all that they do to really help move our community forward. I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have. I'm assuming that there are also members from our group that are part of this that would love to answer your questions as well. So with that, I would love to share my screen back to you if I can see it. I've lost the meeting controls. While I work on that, let me know if you have any questions. All right. Do we have any questions for Ms. Park? All right. Doesn't look like you have any questions there. I don't have any questions, but I have a quick comment. It's super nice to hear the work being continued and looking forward to future updates on that. Thank you, Council Member Reynolds. We look forward to providing them to you. All right. Do we have any public comments on this issue? At this time, we do not have any raised hands. I'm just asking. Oh, wait, wait. Let me just make sure. If anyone wishes to speak on this item, if you could raise your hand. I do have one, and that would be Julie Threat. Go ahead. All right, you guys. This was just hard because I'm like, Team Chico sounds like a great concept, and we just got off of this hard project with the last agenda item. We're not all Team Chico, so I'm just trying to figure out, Jennifer, how to integrate some of that stuff or how this big... issue that we've got. How is your group or how have they been involved with the unhoused, the homeless, or just everything that's going on with this shelter? It should be an objective, I would think. Thank you. Thank you. Do we have anyone else? Let me check. I do not see any other... Any other speakers? All right. Okay, we'll move on to item 5.2, resolution of proving boundary line modification 20-09 and authorizing the city manager of Anne Arnaud a real property exchange with Bruce Road Associates LP to carry out the land transfer component of the Stonegate subdivision. And I believe we have principal planner Mike Solley here to talk about this. Go ahead. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. I'm going to... share my screen here. This is a proposed lot line adjustment on the south side of East 20th Street. People are probably familiar with Merriam Park on the north side of East 20th Street, building out very quickly on that side. The city of Chico owns about eight acres on the south side of East 20th Street opposite Concord Avenue. It's left over from the Jarvis Gardens affordable housing project, and it contains many wetlands. Adjacent to that is property owned by Bruce Road and Associates, which is part of the Stonegate subdivision that was approved in 2018. My animation isn't working, but here you go. The city of Chico property is in yellow, and the Bruce Road Associates property is outlined in white. And you can see where the white and yellow overlap. That's their shared property line between the two properties. And you can see that the yellow city property is... well, both of them actually terminate in a... very acute angle, a narrow wedge on each end of their property. So the proposal would reorient that shared property line where that red line is on this screen, and would result in a future configuration like we see on the next slide, like that. So to square off the two properties, it actually has the effect of putting a wetland that you see down here in black onto the city of Chico piece, consolidating the wetland resources in that area, and carrying out the... land transfer component of the Stonegate subdivision that was analyzed in the EIR that the city adopted a few years ago. And we did take this boundary line modification to the MAP Advisory Committee in November, and they recommended that the city council approve the boundary line modification, and authorize the city manager to sign the necessary documents to make it effect. And with that, I'll answer any questions you have. I have a quick question. Yeah. Mr. Sully, for the good. For the good of the public, can you explain the membership of the MAP Advisory Committee? Yeah, the MAP Advisory Committee acts on small subdivision type projects, boundary line modifications, lot line adjustments, parcel maps that don't ask for special permission for stuff that we would otherwise take to the Planning Commission. Who makes up that body or who appoints that body? It's the Community Development Director, Brendan Vig, and the Public Works Director appoints somebody to act on their behalf right now. It's development, Senior Development Engineer, Matt Johnson. So it's only those two staff people? That's correct. Okay, thank you. All right. Any other questions for Mr. Sully? All right. If anyone from the public wishes to speak, if they could please raise their hand, we'd appreciate that. Okay, we're starting to get some hands, so I'll go ahead and call Jessica Giannola. All right. All right. I don't know. Can you hear me now? Yes, go ahead. Thank you. Well, I would just lend my support to that fixing of that strange angle there. I live right there. That's my neighborhood and would love to see any preservation of our wetlands. And I could see that that would cover that little spot there. I don't know. I just want to say I support that. And hopefully you approve it. Thank you. Thank you. And then Keith D'Aglio, go ahead and unmute yourself. Hi, this is Keith D'Aglio. I'm with Rolls Anderson and Rolls. I'm here tonight to represent the applicant and the landowner. So really, if there's any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. Any technical questions. Mike did a great job. But if there's any questions by anyone, I'm available. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Keith. Looking and I do not see any other hands. All right. So any further speakers? Going once, going twice. All right. With that, any further council discussion or not? We'll entertain a motion. All right. Thank you. Move to approve. Second. All right. So we have a motion and a second for a resolution approving the boundary line modifications 20-09 and authorizing the city manager to enter into a real property exchange with Bruce Road Associates LP to carry out the land transfer component of the Stone Gate subdivision. Madam Clerk, could you take the roll? Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Brown? Aye. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Thank you very much. Item 5.3D, escalation and crisis intervention training and hiring and recruitment update. And we have our chief of police, Matt Madden. Yeah. Good evening, council, members of the public. Thanks for the opportunity. Let me get my screen going here. All right. So I'm here to talk about a couple things and report back to council on a council directive. And so I want to just make sure you know what we've been up to at the police department. And then I'm also going to take the opportunity to just give you a brief hiring and recruitment update as I filled a lot of questions regarding that. Can everybody see my screen? Yes, I can. Okay. Yes. So let me get this out of the way. Yeah. So just an update and a briefing on what came to be regarding CIT and de-escalation training. So in June of 2020, council directed myself, the chief of police, to include a training overview during the 2021 fiscal year budget meeting that was held in October. That training overview was to include the implementation of the training overview. So we actually had a crisis intervention plan for every officer to receive 40 hours of de-escalation and crisis intervention training within a two-year period. And there was also some, you know, there was funding supporting that training. I want to just real quickly address what de-escalation actually is. There's a lot of conversations out there. So I think crisis intervention training speaks for itself. But de-escalation, as described by the California commission, actually has a very large impact. on peace officer standing and training is the process of using strategies and techniques intended to decrease the intensity of a situation. So one of the things that I knew and we discussed with council and the public was this is all specialized training. And in order to kit all of our officers, this training wasn't offered in our area. So you're sending officers out of town for 40 hours. And then also the significant budgetary issues with that is backfilling with overtime to make sure that we have officers on the street when we are sending people out. So one of the things that we did was we partnered with some training groups that provided this type of training. We got our training post-certified, which means the entire curriculum was sent to the commission on post who went through and certified our training. So that was saved a lot of time and a lot of money, to be honest with you, to get this training done. So remember, we essentially had two years to get this done as the council directive was. And I can happily say that almost all of our staff is currently trained in this area. So this training really occurred over six sections that are started in August. And we were able to complete it at the end of the year. And it was a really fun experience to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer officers who weren't really on that list for that training, but we thought that training is important. So some of the recap from that, not only did the dispatchers attend the classroom portion of the de-escalation training, they also received additional training that was geared specifically to their positions and handling people in crisis over the phone, as well as understanding what the response would be from their officers so we can set ourselves up for success. This is a total number of Chico police staff who have completed de-escalation and crisis intervention training. So 117 staff members have received that training. In addition to that, going along with de-escalation and crisis intervention training is use of force in training as it relates to disengagement and non-criminal barricade. So 117 staff. 113 attended that. And then nine mainly trained the trainer and less lethal force trainers were sent to the Force Science Institute. It really gets into, you know, the human function and performance so we can really evaluate our officers and their abilities to perform in the field. So really excited about that. On a side note, I personally attended the classroom portion of this training. It was it was enlightening on, you know, where we're going and involving as a law enforcement profession. So and I did notice that, you know, post last year put out a very significant document called Strategies and Techniques on De-escalation. And I did notice there was a lot of reference to that document. And that training was really designed to tailor around what post guidelines are. When it. Comes to de-escalation. So really excited about that. So, again, just a real kind of our goals in the budget and our outcomes that's there before you to see two years to complete. We did it just over a year. There's the budgeted we were budgeted for. We were able to deliver that training in a timely manner. And we were also able to send additional staff to the training and also add additional training as it relates to use of force de-escalation. And we also had a lot of training to do with the police department. And we also had a lot of training to do with the police department. So I can answer any questions on that, but I'm going to roll right in just real briefly to talk about hiring. I get a lot of questions of kind of where the police department is at. So currently in 2021, Chico BD hired a total of 24 employees, eight sworn officers, two in the academy, five public safety, six in records, one parking service, one sworn park ranger and one academy training for that park ranger position. As you can see at the bottom, not every all of those hires either progressed through either completed the academy or were able to complete the field training. But those are the numbers there. And my next slide will indicate this is where you're currently your police department is at as it relates to staffing. So we currently have eight sworn police officer positions. We still need to fill five public safety dispatchers, three records technicians and one park ranger. So with that, that concludes my presentation. And I can take any questions if you have them. All right. Do we have any questions for the chief? I have a couple questions. Go ahead, Council Member Brown. Chief Madden, first of all, thank you for bringing this information to us. When we had talked at a previous report that you'd given, you mentioned reality based training as kind of being the state of the art approach to reducing use of force. And can you can you speak to that as was it a part of this training? How is that? How is that integrated? Well, that type of trip was separate from de-escalation. This is really about concepts. The reality based training is actually, you know, making this happen. So there's been a lot of changes in technology and how that looks. One of the things that I'm aware of is both the Butte College Police Academy, as well as the Butte County Sheriff's Office, is looking at. Virtual training. I believe there is some funding out there that's that's coming our way through the college. That's going to provide essentially that virtual type of reality where you're training in these environments. There is some really, really good new technology that we're looking at. We have a demo coming to us where it's VR training. And so you literally can take an officer and get into a virtually reality. You can have a training. There and you can walk them through just all kinds of various scenarios. Mental health crisis, domestic violence situations, whatnot. And you can capture that information. And so you can go back and evaluate as a as trainers. We can actually put the officer back to see how they handled the situation. We can also take the officer and put them in the other view of the person that they're dealing with so they can see movement. They can hear voice tones. And. And all those things. So virtual reality training coming to law enforcement is going to be very significant. It's very expensive. But I think that's something we need to look at because it can provide that type of training in low level stress environments where we can actually turn, you know, turn the heat up. We can monitor and we can watch that human performance and reaction. So it is something that we're very excited about. And you'll probably see on council. The police department coming during budgetary process. Talk about that maybe a little bit more as to where we're at. Great. Interesting and innovative. Obviously, Chief, this direction was given by a previous council. I just want to commend you for following through not only in a within the time frame allotted, but so much sooner and following through on your kind of approach to do this in the most fiscally responsible way possible and also the most, you know, making sure that our officers are trained. Yeah. I appreciate it. I appreciate the report and commend you for that. I appreciate the report and commend you for that. Thank you. You know, and if I can just add one thing, you know, we've already we're already seeing at least from the chief of police, the officers really absorbing what was going on and really taking this training to a different level. I think there's probably several scenario cases that we've seen in Chico the last few months that maybe looks a little bit different as far as your police response. So I appreciate my officers. Not being afraid to get this training and really evaluate what we're doing. And so, you know, training is good. This is just another tool in the toolbox and a highly trained police department is a good police department. So I appreciate the opportunity to get this training to our people. Thank you. All right. Any other questions for the chief? All right. All right. Seeing none. Um, we have any public comment on this item. If you're interested in speaking, please raise your hand now. Okay. We have three hands up so far. All right. So let me go back to that. Um, I believe it, the first speaker is Jeff Crete. Jeff, can you unmute yourself? So I know you can't answer these questions directly. But, you know, I see a lot of other departments in the past about recruiting. They would offer like home, uh, assistance, find homes in the community. So they were in the community. I was just wondering if that had been explored. The other question I had, uh, you know, I'm curious what the staffing goals for the city are long term. Cause the previous chief was very adamant that Chico didn't need to follow national standards and we're seeing record violent crime now. So I'm wondering, you know, is Chico going to change its course there and actually believe in the proven national standards of, uh, citizen to police ratio. And then the last question is, you know, I want to, or comment was, you know, I want to say congratulations on the DS. I would ask if you were able to open that training up to other local aid agencies. And, um, you know, I know when I was doing some training, some departments would, um, you know, I was doing some training. I would ask if you were able to open that training up to other local aid agencies. And, um, you know, I would ask if you were able to open that training up to other local aid agencies. And, um, you know, I would ask if you were able to open that training up to other local aid agencies. I think that would be a good opportunity for you to explore. I'm sure you had talked about it at least, but, uh, thank you for the good work and I appreciate it. Have a great night. Thank you. Our next speaker is Ruth Sarnoff. So Ruth, if you can unmute yourself. Okay. Um, my concern is, uh, is a long-term one because I have, um, experienced and been involved in, um, actions of police departments all over California. Um, and the pattern is, seems to be the same everywhere. And it's disconcerting that the issues of, um, abuse and the number of people that, um, die in custody and in, uh, prisons and in, uh, other institutions. Um, and, um, I'm concerned about a whole lot of things to do with policing. Um, I, uh, was had the opportunity because I was, uh, away and I have a, um, flash drive of the meeting of the ad hoc committee on policing. And, um, and I also have a lot of documentation. I would like to have a place in a way publicly to share that because, um, that's not easy to do. I'm. And it is a fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, a piece of fun moment to share, um, here, right here, downtown. And I think that the references that I saw in the paper to that are accurate. And I think there is an attempt to develop a water reservoir there. We are, because it's been raining and snowing and cold, doesn't mean that we're not into climate change. Climate change cannot get on the agenda. Right now, we have freezing weather and we have a volcano underneath Antarctica that is producing, it's active. And it's in the newspapers right here in today's paper. If everybody would just look at today's enterprise record and read all the AP articles on what's going on, because it's all there. And we are in a climate crisis and thank you. Thank you, Ruth. And last speaker is Jessica Giannola. Go ahead, Jessica. Thank you. Just real quick, I just wanted to request or at least observe, it would be nice if we were able to see our council members while we're commenting. I don't know why their cameras, oh, thank you. It's just nice on the interaction end. And also to respond to this item, gosh, I wanna thank Chief Madden so much for his comments with just sharing that he was able to connect with some of the material that he learned and that it made a difference. And I think that's really the point behind that extra training is we don't always, you know, we don't always know everything about our jobs or the people that we work with in the public. And until we are given an extra training that introduces us to ideas and knowledge about what some other person might be experiencing and why they're responding the way they do during interactions, that's when we learn. It's by having that training and that training is critical. It's critical in developing community trust and giving you the tools that help you to be able to do that. And it's also critical in helping people to have better endings to any interactions that are happening with various community members. And I don't know if this is a one-time training that our officers receive, or if there is room for having refresher courses, like most professions do, they'll have some, you know, you have to keep up on your profession so that you're on top of things and not forgetting something, CPR renewals every two years, mandate reporting, you know, all those positions you wanna keep on top of, you know, you're on top of things. Otherwise, you know, if you don't use it, you lose it kind of thing. So that would be neat if we don't have that in place, if we could look at that. The VR sounds awesome because I just learned about that recently, a VR, I'm at my age now, and wow, you actually are in a setting and it's, you can relate better to that training when you have something that's tangible and help you experience what you might experience in real life so that you can learn and fine-tune those tools. So whenever that comes on the agenda, I'll be supporting that for officers too. And just to touch on what Jeff had brought up with community access, honestly, having access to deescalation skills and any kind of mental health services techniques or understanding the trauma that people are experiencing in our community, especially in our community, that's something that I think that we all would benefit from. I don't expect our program to be able to do that, we're not a police force or city to pay for it, but if we had community members out there that can offer, there's a webinar or something, I think that we would benefit from it. So I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Jessica. She is our last speaker, Mayor. All right, thank you. Okay. Any further questions or comments from council on that item? All right. I just, I have one quick question, Andrew. I just want to make a statement that I really do appreciate the chief coming on and giving us that update. Also just a reminder of how expensive training is. So I know a lot of times when we're having these conversations, there's a lot of encouragement sometimes to take money away from police and put it into other places. And so if we want to continue to have our highly trained police officers doing the amazing job that they're doing, they are required to do these classes. I think every couple of years, two years, three years, whatever it is, there is an ongoing, ongoing training aspect to that. And as we go into these higher technical types of training, it does get more and more expensive. So I look forward to the shared view college and the county type model. Hopefully that'll save us some money, but just a reminder that while training is great, we have to backfill all those shifts and it costs us a lot to do that as a city. So it's an investment in our guys and gals out there. Thank you. All right. Any further comment? All right. That item was informational. Thank you, Chief. We appreciate that. All right. Item 5.4, of course, was removed from the agenda. As I mentioned at the beginning of the meeting, item 5.5 amendment of the CalPERS retirement contract affecting Sworn Park Rangers. And I believe we have Director Jamie Cannon for this one. Hello. Good evening, Mayor and Council. This is the final action required by our city council in order to amend our contract with CalPERS. This amends the contract specific to our Sworn Park Rangers, putting them into a safety classification versus general miscellaneous. As you'll see in my staff report, council introduced the ordinance on December 21st, and then action this evening would result in the ordinance being adopted. I'm happy to answer any questions. All right. Do we have any questions for Ms. Cannon? All right. If you're wishing to speak from the public at this time, if you could raise your hand. We do not have any speakers on this item. Okay. All right. Will the council? Move to approve. Second. We have a motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Council Member Morgan. Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll. Okay. And that motion was to adopt an ordinance of the city council, the city of Chico, authorizing an amendment to the contract between the city council of the city council and the city council of the city council. And the board of administration of the California public employees retirement system by reading their title only. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Brown. Aye. Council member Morgan. Yes. Council member O'Brien. Yes. Council member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries seven zero. All right. So we're going to move to item 5.6, which was my request to put forward. I had a restaurant. Owner in downtown Chico approached me about this and felt that it was something that we needed to pursue as a council. We agendized it and here is back. So. You know, back originally when we had some of the funding being sent out to restaurants. Throughout the nation, over a hundred thousand of them actually received some of these vital protections. Through the restaurant and restaurant management. And we're going to talk about that in a little bit. So we're going to talk about the restaurant revitalization fund in the American rescue plan, but unfortunately there were 177,000 applicants, some of which are here in Chico that did not receive funding. So this restaurant owner is just trying to draw up support anywhere they can. For this program, which is understandable because there are, of course, a portion of restaurants. About 17%, almost 18% that were left out of this program. And we just really like to see them get some help. So, you know, I thought. At very least signing a letter, sending it to our representatives would be something that we could do, but of course, I wanted to bring that in front of the city council. You have the letter in your packets. Happy to answer any questions you might have. Okay. Thank you. All right. Do we have any public comment on this? So I believe I might have to. Great. So I'll go ahead and call them. Davey. If you could unmute yourself. Thank you. All right. All right. Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you for having me. I applaud you all for, for these platforms that we're sharing. I like this idea. I think this is wonderful to, to bring about, you know, more activities in the community and along the lines of, of plant-based diets and care for the ecology that, which I've heard here as well today. I think that a lot of people is, is a fad going on these days. There's a lot of things going on. A lot of people like plant-based diets. So it seems to me, perhaps, you know, the aspects of promoting such could, could bring, you know, you know, community respects as well as, you know, activities toward, toward fundings. So I'd be happy to go out more so in all honesty, you know, it's like, you know, I go to different restaurants and I get plant-based diet foods myself, you know, for the aspects of the ecology as well as my health. And, and, you know, there was, there was something else that I wanted to say. Oh, I was also thinking along the lines is that, you know, it's just, it's a little bit relative, but it's just not quite about the, the restaurants. I was also thinking the last time I was in the meeting, I shared about, about ecology. And I was also thinking about bamboo. Bamboo is a wonderful resource towards, towards paper respects and, and communities for, you know, financial generation. It seems to me that, of course, I wouldn't want it in like backyards and such like that, because it kind of acts like a weed. However, I think that it could be great for farming, you know, to, to bring financial generation. Thank you. I appreciate you all. Thank you. Our next speaker is Ruth Sarnoff. So Ruth, if you could unmute yourself. Am I in? Yes, you are. Go ahead. Has, has general comment taken place yet? Yes, that was at the beginning of the meeting, Ruth. Okay. I, I assume I can't go back to that at any point in the meeting. And it was a fun meeting to share, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, a moment to share a moment, have tablecloths and serve four-course dinners and all that. We also have a lot of people that have very little access to nourishing food, hot food. I checked out, I looked at the tents there that are housing a warming center downtown. And it was really kind of disappointing because human beings have the same needs. No matter what. No matter where they originate or where they come from, what color their skin is, what language they speak. They're all part of, if you look at a census, it's one of the reasons I don't think people understood, or maybe they did understand how important, like a census often shows big differences. And now that with looking at some of the census things, there are places in America and places in California where if the census is taken right, and all people that are residents are counted and not just those that are on the local voting list or something like that, that's not a census. And I think we have serious problems of enough food. And I can tell you that. So we're starting to see that in the Antarctic now. There is a volcano explosion and it's raising water and it's causing havoc. And we have ice storms going on all over the country right now. And I suggest that you learn how to read the map in every issue of the Enterprise Record. The map that shows the temperature and the weather. Thank you, Ruth. That's awesome. Your newspaper. Thank you, Ruth. Thank you. Our last speaker is Melody Probstall. And I apologize if I messed up your last name. Go ahead and unmute. Melody, can you unmute? Okay. So, Melody, are you able to unmute? We have given you permission to speak. So, I'm not sure, Mayor Coolidge. Yeah. I can't. I seem to get her on. I'm trying to make sure. Let's see. Yeah, let's double check before and before. Okay. Now, Melody, are you there? Okay. I seem to get her on. Yeah. Unfortunately, sometimes people can leave these open and not return. So, I know that happens from time to time. All right. Any further discussion from council or motion? Oh, I'll move upon that. I'll second Council Member O'Brien's motion. All right. We have a motion and a second. Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Yes. Council Member Brown? Aye. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. And did I get Council Member Bennett? Okay, I did. All right. Carry 7-0. I just want to make sure. Forgot to circle it. All right. Thank you very much, everyone. So, item 5.7. No items added after the posting of the agenda. That's number six. Here is reports and communication. The following reports and communications items are provided for the councilors information. No action can be taken under this section of the agenda. Unless the council agrees to put it on a subsequent agenda. And we're going to start with the city manager's report. And if I could ask, too, that possibly we can have Madam Clerk, as well as the city manager's report. Well, Inter and Debbie, if you could assist us maybe with Mark here on this about the Zoom meeting status and moving forward. So, Mr. Ormer, if you want to give your report and then Ms. Cresson, you can maybe chime in on the Zoom meetings and your thoughts on moving forward. Yeah, absolutely. I had two items. One of them was the Zoom meetings. Okay. That's perfect. Perfect entree for the city clerk, Cresson, to be able to speak to that item. The first item, though, which I know has been very much something that many in the community have been asking about is with regard to redistricting. And I just wanted to let everybody know that City Clerk Cresson, City Attorney Ewing's team, and I met here recently. And everything is going to start moving forward starting at the next city council meeting. So, all of those folks in the public, I know all the council members are very interested. But in the members of the public, it is going to be moving forward with public hearing number one on that on February 1st. So, the first meeting. And then at the beginning of next month, our next regular meeting, there will be the first public hearing. On that date, the official map tool will launch. And then the community will have those next couple of weeks to bring in their initial maps and create maps. And that's when everything will really get started. And then over the next couple of months, we'll go through the adequate number of public hearings and enable folks to give feedback to maps. And so, I just want to make sure that everybody's aware that that really is going to get started here very soon. So, thank you. Be prepared for that. The other item is with regard to remote meetings. I know that currently we are, because of the state of California and the rules that they have in place, with regard to masking, the council has chosen that we should do this to enable the most people to engage in these meetings as possible. So, I don't know, City Clerk Preston, if you have anything to add to that. No, that's a great segue into it. I mean, obviously, the council can revisit that. But we... The reason we had scheduled this meeting to be Zoom was because we weren't sure what was going to happen because it was supposed... The mandate was supposed to end January 15th. And we wanted to make sure that we were prepared to have it remote in case it was extended, which it was. And we were notified early enough and we got that on the agenda. So, currently, I believe the mandate is in place until the 15th of February, which would mean that we would probably fall securely. And we believe it to be a really fun event to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. And it really is going to be fun to share it with people. being able, because of the social distancing requirements layered on top of everything else in the council chamber, we really were limited to a smaller number of people in the chamber. So that is why we reached out to council, or actually I did. It's part of my job as a city clerk to seek advice from the council. So it is up to you if at this time you would like for us to move forward going back to in-person. Again, I would caution you only from the perspective that it will be limited to the number of people who can fit in. We will set it back up six feet, social distancing again, and making sure that we can keep and maintain the safety of our public and all of our citizens. The goal was really to ensure more access to more people, or access, or better access, or just any access, because some people may choose not to come because of the Omicron seriousness, and others, like right now we have 79 participants in listening to this meeting, and that's a lot. We wouldn't have 79 people in the council chambers, per se. We haven't in a long, long time. We can't because of the requirements of social distancing. So I'll turn it over to you. All right. So Mr. Arm, did you have anything further on your report? Nope. Those are the only two items I had on my list. Thank you. Okay. And I mean, we could bring this back for a further agenda, but I think with the two weeks that we have, because I think it is exactly two weeks until the next council meeting that happens, if all, that same way that it regularly does for us, because we're coming back on the 1st, I think, of February. So, you know, obviously there's a lot of factors that can occur between then. Yeah, we've seen that occur over the last two weeks for sure. So I think maybe as we get closer to that council can make that decision. So if everybody's willing to, is okay with that. Not seeing any nodding heads. Are we all okay with that? Just as we move forward to getting a little closer, seeing what the conditions are like, seeing what mandates are in place. Sure. Yeah. Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. So, all right. At this point in time, item 6.2 council member requests. So pursuant to AP and P 1010 council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. A majority of council is needed in order to vote to agendize council members may also submit requests in writing. Do we have any requests at this time? I have one. Okay. Go ahead. I would like to have a discussion of doing a letter of support for AP and P 1010. I would like to have a discussion of doing a letter of support for AP and P 1010. I would like to have a discussion of doing a letter of support for AP and P 1010. It's a bill that would replace prop 47 language with pre the two pre 2014 language. I have emailed a letter to sample letter to Debbie that we could use as the basis for the discussion. All right. I'll second that. A second from council member O'Brien. Who made the motion? I'm sorry. I don't have the measure. Me, I guess. I would like to agendize. Okay. Thank you. Council member Bennett. Yes. Council member Brown. Sorry, just a point of clarification.

So we're going to move forward to the next item, which is the! We're going to move forward to the next item, which is the! And then we're going to put it down to a meeting to share it to the board.

Okay, that discussion will come back in 30 days. All right. So moving on to closed session, I ask anyone wishing to comment on closed session to raise your hand at this time. This would be for a special closed session that was called regarding the, well, so how are we going to do this? I should probably ask. So is this for both the closed session and the special session that was called? You can consolidate all of them. Okay. So let's consolidate. All of them for comments. And because they are, in essence, going to happen at the same time. And do we have any speakers on this item? So for a closed session, if you would like to speak on the items that were listed on the regular agenda or on the special agenda, if you could raise your hand. Right now I have one. And so I'll call Nicole Nava at this time. And Nicole, if you could unmute yourself. And the timer could be shared. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. Okay, perfect. So I would like to direct my comments to item 7.2, leading up to also 7.3. So what I would like to speak about about the settlement that you will be discussing and continuing in closed session is that I do think there are elements that I do support. And that's why I don't like these really short time frames to talk and no. I'm not saying that I'm going to be able to do it. I'm just saying that I do support the fact that the county will be there with the experts to be able to provide services as far as referrals and other things. For those who are willing to accept it. Of course, they can't make them, but willing to accept it. What I'd like to get on record is I think it would have been important to try to also explain what the outreach should be as far as going literally out into the common spaces and other spots, not just sitting at desks to do that outreach. And to engage these folks. I don't disagree with the very basic services like potties and some of the other things and trash. What was is a hard thing to take on is the city taking on the expense of all the meals and all the other things that dumps it up into the millions and millions and we don't know how much will get covered and quite frankly it's still our taxpayer dollars whether you get the cramp me or not. So, it's just that it won't be dipped all from the general fund. So I just want to make that clear. But. My other big concerns were all the caveats to the enforcement. So in this closed session I truly hope that I of course we don't know what it's about, but I would hope that you guys will be revisiting how you all approach this, that you should have had the entire document and and to read through and understand several times before you wait in on it, you should have been clear with the direction from the attorney because to me, all seven of you needed to be clear. All of you should have been privy to, to me to conversation. I'm not going to be in conversations with the judge I don't understand why even one council member would be there and the others not. And unless you guys were buying off on that and then you are having to deal with what they tell you and interpret off of that. I'm just finding lots of these elements problematic, but I am hopeful that the experience where it is will be a better experience and that people will access the services and that they will go out of our parks and waterways and that what is written for enforcement. Is. And unfortunately I think there are too many outs and too much was left to. We have verbal assurances from the judge to this community, I don't think that's good enough. And I get you're saying wait and see and we don't have a choice we do have to wait and see, and we had zero insight, and I think there were some failures everywhere and that is disappointing. So hopefully that will improve as to the Tyler rushing. How about standing up for our police department and understanding what went down, it was widely available, please don't cave and just give. in and hand that family over money, the person was. culpable for what they did, thank you. Our next speaker is Ruth Sarnoff go ahead Ruth and unmute yourself. Okay. I wanted to share something about how. Listening to the community. took place in Southern California. And the. Person who was the judge there and was handling that. actually took. The. The issue. Of housing into the places where people were intense and, by the way, everybody in the country. Every single state and every single big city has. 10 colonies and has had for as long as I can remember. And so it was held. I think it was. Alsop was his name. And and the community people that were homeless, it was right there in the center of where there was a special. Spot. And it was set up at one time because. There was problems of people being able to use a sidewalk to lie down and there were people that couldn't even lie down and that was in Los Angeles and. So. The thing was that. The numbers of people that needed that were much greater than the people than the space that they gave them, which was very tiny. And it was just like kind of like maybe. I don't know. Tiny. So the the the actually one side of Broadway, which is main street down there on one side. Is risky stuff on the other side. Community and it was really a study in in. What. A. Massive. Deprivation and. A lot of the people there. Were Hispanic. Black people. And racism has got to be dealt with. In our time because we need to pull together because climate change is happening pretty fast. There are 21 cities who are iced in and they're the biggest cities in the United States. And they're the biggest cities in the United States. So go back to your weather map and it'll tell you the suffering that's going to take place. If corporate doesn't decide to weigh in. I don't know what to say. The game's over. You have a supply chain problem. You have a trash all over the place and you've been using the ocean as a sewer for too long. I thank you, Ruth. Jessica Gianola. Go ahead and unmute yourself. Okay. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. And share this moment. that we're wrapping up here. And I don't believe that the city can change anything at this point as far as what's been decided as far as I understand. So what I would hope moving forward with what's been decided is that there's support from the city. And I know that there are members of our council and our community that are really, really wanting to get into any of the parks and public spaces. We all would love to have our parks and public spaces as they should be used. However, we do need to wait and making sure that we're not enacting any of those move along laws until we actually have things in place. So people need to have a space they can go to, pallet shelters have to be set up and all those things need to be in place before we're acting to do any of those things. So the second one, and then also whoever you're hiring or agreeing with to run the program, please, please make sure that you're thinking about people who are experienced, who know what they're doing basically. So someone that is gonna come forward, just please talk to each other about it and don't make a political decision, make a smart decision for the people. With Tyler Rushing, unfortunately, I heard that on a scanner happening years ago and it was heartbreaking. I knew that it was gonna end the way it did just because I could hear the escalation that was occurring. And we had the wrong people that were calling the shots that night and it ended with Tyler's death. And to blame him for that situation, sure, whatever would have happened criminal wise, who knows? He was killed that night and that could have been avoided. Could have been avoided with more, but it's not gonna happen. if you're gonna have to do the escalation training like it's being received now. So that needs to be made right with his family. His family, they do not have their son anymore. Labor negotiations, if this is about the raises for the city employees, they need to have their raises. In over 18 years, they need livable wages. They can't even live in the city. That's pretty bad. So I do support raises there. That's budgeting whatever needs to happen. Those are things that I hope you're discussing beyond these closed doors. I hope you have a good night. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Jessica was our last speaker. All right. So with that, we will adjourn into closed session. We're going to council members. So you have time to log on to the other link if you could do that, but we will convene there in about 15 minutes. So at 7.50, we have a few issues in the clerk's office. We need to, we need to square away to make sure we're all good to go there. So 15 minutes, we'll see you at 7.50 council members and associated staff in closed session. Thank you everybody. Meeting adjourned for the night. Thank you. Thank you.
