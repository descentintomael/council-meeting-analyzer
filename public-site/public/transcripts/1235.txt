Okay I'll call the first two names  and if you can stand and come up in the  middle aisle.  Carrie sorrenti followed by misty wright.  And if you can pull the microphone  closer to you that would be great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Can you hear me okay?  Okay I am here to formally request  the immediate code enforcement  regarding the use of the emergency  vehicle easement located on the  corner of stewart avenue and  bidwell avenue.  This access point which is legally  designated for fire police and  ambulance entry has become  obstructed by transient individuals  who appear to be actively using  drugs and leaving hazardous waste  and furniture in the area.  They have found it to be an easy  area to hide from law enforcement  while distributing and buying  illicit drugs, traffic and stolen  property.  The situation poses a serious public  safety risk.  Emergency vehicles cannot reliably  access the easement in its current  state.  Drug related activity and discarded  paraphernalia endangers residents,  children and pets.  The presence of the encampment in  this restricted zone is a risk to  the community.  The city has created both health  hazard and ongoing disturbance to  the community.  I understand the complexities the  city has had and emphasize with  the individuals experiencing  homelessness and addiction but  this specific location is not safe  or lawful for habitation allowing  it to remain obstructed jeopardizes  emergency response times and puts  the entire neighborhood at risk.  I respectfully urge the city council  to direct the emergency response  direct code enforcement and  appropriate city departments to  take corrective action immediately.  Our community is not only asking  for enforcement of existing  ordinances but also seeking  assurance that emergency  easements remain protected for the  purposes of which they were  designated for, saving lives.  Thank you.  Misty Wright followed by Lynn  Reynolds.  Good evening mayor Reynolds and  members of Chico City Council.  My name is Misty Wright I am the  director of Butte County Library and  I just wanted to come tonight and  tell you about a couple of exciting  things we have going on this month.  September is library card sign up  month and I would like to encourage  everyone here and all of your  constituents to come to the library  and sign up for their library card.  Our theme this year is one card  endless possibilities and as many of you know there is  a lot of things that you cannot do  without your library card.  You can rent physical books,  ebooks, you can take online classes  we even have baking pans  and laptops for checkout.  So please encourage all of your  constituents to get their library card.  In celebration of library card sign up  month the board of supervisors  was so gracious to let  us have a fine amnesty  month for all of September.  Please let your constituents  know come to the  library you can get all of your  fines waived. If you have  library fines, if you have overdue  books it doesn't matter how old or  how much we would love to waive  those fines for you.  Moving forward for the next  year we are embarking on a one  year pilot program to become  a fine free library.  So after the month of  September there will be no more  daily fines for late fees.  Of course if you  don't bring the book back or lose  it there will be charges for that.  But as soon as you bring the book back  all of those fees will be removed as well.  So please come back to the library  come get your fees waived. We want to waive  fees for everyone  and get everybody signed up for their  library card. Thank you.  Thank you.  Lynn Overholzer followed by Lori Monroe.  Hello I'm sorry I'm getting my  voice back but my name is Lynn Overholzer  I live on the first street down the  levee from the alternative site.  Twice in a one month period in the  last six weeks I have been told to  shelter in place in my house because  of police presence on my street  involving a gunshot and incidents at  the alternative site.  On August 17th at 1 p.m.  and this didn't even make the news  even though Eaton Road was  closed down for a few hours between the  bridge and Morseman.  I unfortunately opened my door  because I thought it was somebody else  and I looked out the window and I didn't  see him.  I thought actually a home invasion was  happening and the person was wearing a  hideous mask.  It was actually blood and it turns out  as I found out later it was a gunshot  wound to the person's left side of his  head. He was at my door.  He was naked. There was blood on  his head. There was blood everywhere  and purple stuff and his eye was gone.  I slammed the door shut and called 911  and  felt like a sitting duck in my own  house because all my windows and  everything and I didn't know what had  happened. I thought it was a crazy guy.  He's naked. There's somebody out there  did this to him. I don't know what's  going on. No cars came down my street.  I looked out the window. I saw no  neighbors home. I called back to 911  and I said I feel like a sitting duck  in my own house. I want to look out  leave. I said I'm going to leave.  Is it safe for me to leave? Is that  why nobody has shown up on my street?  Has this incident been taken care of?  They said no, you need to stay in your  house. A few minutes later I got in  my car and figured I would run down  anybody who was out there because I  felt like I couldn't stay in my house.  That's when I realized the road was  all closed in that area. I came  home a few hours later to blood all  over my driveway and my front porch  and my doorbell and my door handle.  After all of that all of that all of  that all of that all of that all of that my street as well. He was apprehended, at least I found out that time would happen. The reason I'm here is because according to the Warren Settlement Agreement, that alternative The reason I'm here is because according to the Warren Settlement Agreement, that alternative site I request and recommend that it be moved. There's nothing that says it can't be moved, it needs to stay in the same place. I realize there's only six months to maybe 16 months left but the criminal elements and the violent people, they're too comfortable in their  But the criminal elements and the violent people, they're too comfortable in their own skin there.  It's been there for three years.  It's too secluded.  It's out on the edge of town.  There's no street lights.  There's a bike path.  There's dirt for them to park in.  They need to be shaken up.  They need to move someplace else for the safety of the resident, the campus who are supposed to be there,  and all those residents around there.  If you move it more into town where I just, and they're not so comfortable,  I think it would be safer for the residents who are supposed to be there and those of us who live around there.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Excuse me, Ms. Overhalter, can I ask you a quick question?  Yes.  I'm assuming you're not the only one in that neighborhood that feels like you do?  Oh, are you asking me if I'm the only one?  Yes, are your neighbors feeling like you do is a more direct question.  Well, I was the only one on my short street that doesn't have very many houses on it that was home alone.  So they probably weren't as scared as I was.  But I do know after I left the street, I texted them all because since what happened a few weeks earlier,  we're really in touch more than we actually have in the last few years.  To let them know what they might be coming home to and that I didn't know what happened.  I let them know I was coming tonight.  They were happy to hear it.  I did read in the paper that someone did come a few weeks ago.  I didn't come then because there were too many people here and I knew I'd be cut to one minute.  So I decided to wait.  But yes, the neighbors, they were all, I mean, there's little kids on my street.  It was a Sunday.  I'm so glad they were not playing on the street like when this happened.  I still don't know what happened.  My phone number's on the card.  If anybody would like to give me the courtesy of a phone call.  I don't know what happened to that man.  I don't know if someone has a loaded gun again like six weeks ago and they're running around near my street and the bridges and all these places to hide out there.  It's just, it's not a, it's not.  It's not a good place for this collection of people.  Thank you for that.  And I'm sure Captain Struthers would love to have a conversation with you at some point.  So thank you.  Thank you.  So our last speaker is Lori Monroe.  I want to take the time to thank those who were on the ad hoc on house committee for meeting several times this summer.  I was able to attend several of the meetings.  I learned.  I learned a couple of things.  I want to share that right now.  And I have a thought for you after I share my learning.  One is that people who are on house are most looking for safety.  And so if you want them to enter shelter, you have to create an environment that meets their needs for safety.  And sometimes their needs are rather unique.  The other issue is that it's not.  It's not a one size fits all thing.  One shelter isn't going to meet the needs of every single unhoused person.  And many of them have said that they have a hard time being in large groups of people.  Like, and not that the shelters that exist that assist more than 100 people are bad because they're doing a good job with what they do.  They just don't meet the needs of some individuals.  So one.  Suggestion that came up at the last ad hoc committee was safe spot communities.  This is spearheaded by North State Shelter Team.  And it takes the work of North State Shelter Team, a church that would host a tiny home on their property, and some buy-in from the city.  Because there's zoning and things that need to be evaluated.  And those.  So my ask for you today is that you consider agendizing a follow-up and directing staff to work with North State Shelter Team and a church which may be willing to do this.  To date, no churches have been willing to come forward and say that they will do it.  They say they're interested, but they worry about what the expectations of the city will be.  And they don't know that.  The city hasn't been able to respond.  Because they haven't been directed by the council to do so.  So even before the report from the ad hoc committee on the unhoused comes out, I ask that you direct staff to look into what the rules and regulations and things that would need to happen in order to have a safe spot community on church property here in Chico.  Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you. She's our last speaker. All right. That takes us to, we have no public hearing. It's a regular agenda, 5.1, consideration of designation for the voting delegate for the California cities. Ms. Presson. Thank you Mayor Reynolds and Council. This is that time of the year when we select a council member to attend the League of California cities annual conference that we need a voting  Because of all of the  Because of all of the  Because of all of the  Because of all of the  be things that they want to push forward and it has to be a designated council appointed  council member to actually attend last year um vice mayor you were vice mayor at the time but  mayor reynolds attended and um i'll just turn it over to you if you have any questions it's in  long beach this year it's in october and any questions anybody have any questions  i'm happy to go again if the council so desires but if there's somebody else that's interested  i'm happy for anybody to go as long as it's not me okay perfect  i happen to enjoy conferences and i went one year but i found the value of it was really in  meeting other people in similar roles in other city attorneys and city managers and getting this  broader perspective of what um like how cities run and how they operate differently you learn a lot  about people's different ways of life and how they operate differently and i think that's a  relationships with with staff and other council members so i think it would be beneficial given  that there's like no real like political purpose of it like we need to stay in the organization  it's very helpful overall but there was no resolutions i think the last two years um we  didn't vote on anything and if we did it probably didn't matter i was i was going to recommend one  of the younger ladies who just joined the council uh go just because i think it'd be beneficial in  the long run of being able to meet a lot of other people in similar circumstances and they'd be  they'd need to learn more from it so  councilmember o'brien so i i do think the mayor needs to go and represent the city that's  her function and i'm going to support uh the mayor going and i agree with tom anyone but me but um  yes i think the mayor would be the perfect choice to attend um i'll add that i'm also interested in  going i don't always agree with the league of california cities but i think the networking  opportunities and learning what other cities are up to is valuable for new council members but also  supportive of the mayor and  whoever feels they have the most  time and resources and energy  towards representing us the best.  I would go if nominated.  it sounds like the  default would be the mayor  attending on behalf of the city  that'  s the face of  the city itself if you'  enthusiastic and excited to  learn from that experience I  would wholeheartedly support  that.  we met the person that is doing  our city attorney recruitment  right now we actually met at  the whatever you call it they  all have their booths.  That'  s where we met and  it was resourceful to bring that  back to the city and use it.  If I'  m going to go do we  need a nomination?  I need a formal action so I  can fill out the paperwork and  say you'  re the  mayor.  m going to do a  formal action if I may.  I'  m sorry you have something  I was going to make a motion  but go ahead.  I will nominate the mayor to  attend on our behalf at the  league of California cities  annual conference.  second.  we need an alternate?  absolutely.  and bryce as the alternate  council member.  I will accept that as a  friendly amendment.  as the alternate if you can.  that way if something happens.  absolutely.  thank you.  that way I will put in both  names in case you can'  t go and you would be there as  a designated.  council member goldstein.  aye.  council member holly.  yes.  council member o'brien.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  mayor reynolds.  aye.  carry 7-0.  thank you council.  all right.  item 5.2 council van overbeek's  request for ad hoc committee on  wayfinding signs.  briefly in the  city of  in may of  23 may 9th  23 the council approved  a wayfinding sign project for  downtown.  and then I learned that  explorer butte county had  contracted with a consultant  to do a wayfinding and they  were doing a wayfinding sign  project for the whole county.  and so we  in talking to the city manager  about it decided to put the  whole thing on hold and see what  they came back with which was  supposed to be a year ago it  took two years.  so we have there'  s 200 page documents  and there'  s some very good stuff in  there we don'  t have any signs I think they  spent a quarter of a million  dollars.  and so but what we don'  t have is an  implementable wayfinding sign  program that will be used to  program for downtown although  we have some good elements that  were defined in the consultants  report.  so I talked to the mayor this  morning and said I'  ve got a full  plate would you mind  doing this or suggesting  somebody else and the mayor  graciously agreed to take it  on and so with that I'  m going to pass  the baton to you.  I don'  t know where we want to go  so the three of us were on  so do you want to talk about  what we'  ve done so far in terms  of what was proposed for the  committee?  so the committee was one  council member and then four  people from the community one  from chico velo, megan kurtz  from the university and dcba  michael lee who'  s a local  business man and we needed  would have the money to use  the existing polls wherever  possible to hang the signs so  either eric or schuyler was  going to do that.  those four people would  basically be an advisory  committee the council person  would take it back to council  and the council would decide to  go forward or not.  got you.  I have a bunch of work I'  ve done  that I will send you.  thank you.  thank you.  sounds good.  what we'  re asking for is  approval to have a committee  ad hoc committee?  my only question is does all  of council know where we'  re at on  wayfinding because the only  time it'  s ever come up was in  internal affairs and it was with  a previous council it'  s actually you and I were on  internal affairs together back  in 2024.  right.  april of 24 it was brought.  I wonder if we wouldn'  t benefit from the entire  council being maybe just  brought up to date as to the  $250,000 what was spent what  was done give a presentation on  what we'  ve got and then we can give  better direction as to the  ad hoc committee if we decide to  do one.  that'  s kind of a question.  does everybody know where we'  re at on it and what we'  re doing and why we do what'  s the need?  this is a citywide.  this is not a citywide.  this is not a citywide.  this is not a citywide.  the idea is it'  s for downtown and then once  we get that and it'  s easily redeployable so  this will quick turn what do  you call that addison the  temporary public works.  quick build.  quick build.  thank you.  so the idea is there'  s the downtown street scape  redesign thing going on in the  meantime we can work out where  these way signs should go but  it'  s not that complicated so  we could bring it back to  council but I don'  t think we'  I think we'  t think we need to do that  but you'  re the mayor.  I'  m just opening it up to  conversation.  do we have public comment on  the item?  do we have any speakers on  this?  we have one.  let'  s take our speaker and then we  can come back to.  jesse horgan.  good evening.  I just wanted to talk a little  bit about this.  I'  m working on projects like  this for chico state so  personally I am a member of the  committee.  I am a member of the  I wholeheartedly support the  formation of the committee.  there'  s nobody better to represent  the university than megan  kurtz.  excellent choice.  I wanted to add some  suggestions in as you'  re considering the  scope.  first of all the interior of  your parking garage acres of  blank space.  you can use that for way  finding.  look to ucsf medical garages.  they do amazing way finding in  there on their walls.  I think it'  s a great way to do that.  also if you are considering how  to solve problems for downtown  one of them is the perception  that there'  s no parking.  you can use the way finding  signs to direct people to  underutilize parking.  I also think you should pay  attention to the digital parking  presence.  a lot of people use gps even for  routine trips let alone all the  visitors who are coming into  town.  and right now the city is maybe  three or four miles away from  downtown.  I think it's about 30% sees  control of their digital way  finding presence.  so that's things like parking  lots, landmarks, historic spots  that can be put on the maps for  people who are coming who are  looking at their digital map  apple or google maps anyway.  I've recently done this with the  university.  thousands of people per month  look at those changes I made.  they send you a report that  tells you how many people are  coming.  how many people looked at them  every month.  also I'm in the middle of  rolling out the university is  going to have way finding two  open parking spaces.  so they'll have maps that show  you where open parking spaces  is.  it's not very expensive and it  gives people the ability to stop  circling and go right to a spot.  so there are ways to sort of  expand the scope and have a  bigger impact on the downtown.  under time.  look at that.  thank you.  jesse can I add one thing?  the university has a very well  designed well thought out  pedestrian way finding.  I don't think there's enough of  the signs but the way they've  been designed they're elegant.  they look right and cost  effective.  so I mean we have an example  right here in town of like how to  do it.  so thank you for that if you  were involved.  sounds like another potential  committee member.  thank you.  discussion from the council?  I had a question actually I  was surprised to see that  explorer butte county wasn't  listed as having a representative  on this ad hoc committee  considering that they.  this is about downtown?  yeah.  we'  re not concerned with the  county we'  re concerned with  downtown.  isn'  t the project explore butte  county was implemented used to  be to streamline all of the  cities encompassed in butte  county to kind of have an  overall.  s a county wide signage  program and what they'  re proposing is great but it'  s not specific to the city so  we want a way finding signage  program for downtown chico.  okay so we wouldn'  t use all of the material  well I mean there'  s a lot of good stuff in there  that we can use.  we can certainly look at just  one of the things the committee  would do is to look at what the  explorer butte county stuff is  and decide whether to use it or  not to use it.  okay sure I don'  t think it'  s a bad idea I love the  idea of way finding signs and  completely agree with your  sentiments I just worry about  using so much staff time on  reinventing the wheel if it'  s something that could just be  a staff report and an update on  what internal affairs did  previously with the previous  council.  I think it'  s a good idea to do that.  and just going over what are  our sops surrounding this is it  something we'  ve done in any  capacity before and what'  s the most cost effective way  to implement it is it going to  be only when we do major  rehabilitative road work that we  implemented or are we going  piecemeal?  so I'  m a little wary of having a  committee formed specifically on  this issue but open to hearing  other council'  s opinions on this.  council member o'  bryan.  so I support the  committee's decision to use  I support what you want to  accomplish tom wholeheartedly.  there are three new council  members though however that  were not part of this process I  think there'  d be some value in  bringing back a staff report  that doesn'  t have to be pushed out for a  year or something can be almost  immediate just to get us all up  to speed so then we can take the  appropriate steps but I support  what you'  re trying to do I think it'  s very valid and in the end I  will support that but I would  like to have some more  information that would be  helpful for at least three of  us.  thank you.  so I don'  t know if it'  s a staff report because the  staff really hasn'  t spent time on this but maybe  you could tell me what you'  re looking for just the  background of it and the process  to.  just some basic information  because we really have very  little right now to go on.  okay.  so mayor reynolds we could  forward all of the minutes from  this matter.  this discussion actually occurred  in 2020 but I think it'  s all of the present  of all of the present actually occurred in 2024 in front of internal affairs and I think Explore Butte made the presentation to the body. We could forward that. It's a very comprehensive study as well as the minutes and then you may take it from there and then want to maybe have a presentation here and get council input before you form the ad hoc. It's just a suggestion because  of all of the present here and get council input before you form the ad hoc. It's just a suggestion because we do have a lot of information that went to IAC.  exactly which staff member  would be best to bring that back  do you think?  my office can do that because  we have all the documents.  can we do it in two weeks?  because you already have  everything all together so let'  s have a  presentation brought back in two  weeks and then we will all be on  the same page and up to date and  then we can peruse it and be  prepared for whatever questions  because I'  m absolutely in  support of doing it.  I'  the only amendment I would make  is we do it citywide maybe we  start with downtown but it'  s a  citywide signage product.  I think we start.  I think the next place that  needs it is the park because we  don'  t have  any very little signage in the  park but there'  s  signage for cars and pedestrians  and cyclists and they'  re all  we will have a report in two  weeks.  we don'  t need to have a motion  because we'  re using staff time for this?  okay.  it'  s not going to take very long  at all to pull the reports.  it was already prepared.  thank you for thinking about  it.  okay.  so are we all good on that 5.2?  okay. 5.3 climate action committee  commission interviews and appointment.  ms. Preston again. thank you mayor renner. I'n  d like to thank the council.  unfortunately we did have an  unscheduled vacancy on the climate  action commission so we have a  term with three remaining years.  based on state law we had to post  the vacancy for a certain amount of  time before we could even start the  recruitment.  typically in the past we have  always gone to our last  recruitment which was held in the  fall of 2024.  we contacted all of the remaining  applicants who did not get selected.  I believe we only had one who  wanted to still be considered.  so that wasn't a choice in the  past council, past practice has  always been that we would still  do a recruitment so that you  have some choices to go through.  so fortunately we did that  recruitment and we now have four  applicants and they are included  in the packet.  the candidate who was selected  who vacated that position was a  nominee.  she is the nominee of council  member goldstein.  so she would what I would  recommend is that we hear from the  applicants and then if she could  nominate someone and if the  would still require a full council  confirmation with the majority vote.  do you have any questions?  all right.  sounds good.  just to let you know I know  that two of the applicants did  contact us and let us know that  they're going to be here. I'm going to call all four names.  please note in the internal policy  that guides this process,  attendance at this meeting is not  a requirement for appointment.  so I will call their names.  Natalie Norton.  good evening, mayor  reynolds and council members.  my name is Natalie Norton and I'm  honored to be here tonight to express  my commitment to serving on chico's  climate action commission.  I bring over a decade of experience  designing and leading social impact  strategies with nonprofits,  philanthropy and fortune 100  companies.  as a uc climate steward and  certified volunteer administrator,  I have expertise in both the science  and community engagement necessary  for effective climate action.  at rise against hunger, I supported  climate action advocacy initiatives  that mobilized volunteers worldwide.  more recently as a strategic  consultant with realize worth,  I advised on governance leadership  networks and volunteer and community  engagement strategies for companies  like adobe, google and sap.  skills that directly align with the  commission's role in advancing the  climate action plan and driving  community participation.  I've also partnered with the united  nations impact 2030 initiative  contributing thought leadership around  climate action and engagement  aligned with the un sustainable  development goal number 17,  partnerships for the goals.  that work centered on building cross  sector collaboration for climate and  social impact.  experience I believe is critical for  chico as we partner across government,  nonprofits and residents to meet our  climate commitments.  I'm also deeply rooted here as a  csu chico alum and former board member  for illuminate, a chico based nonprofit  that uses low cost video technology  to expand access to education in  underserved communities.  I help guide strategy and strengthen  partnerships.  that experience reinforced the  importance of innovation, accessible  tools and community led solutions.  the very kind of approach chico will  need as we continue to implement our  climate action plan.  beyond my professional background, I  have a personal stake in chico's  climate resilience.  my children are growing up here and  they are my daily reminder of why this  is important.  their future and the future of all  chico families depends on the bold  choices we make now.  if appointed, I will bring strategic  thinking, partnership expertise and  unwavering commitment to help chico  meet and exceed its climate goals.  thank you.  thank you, natalie.  bryce ingersoll.  to formally introduce myself, my name  is bryce ingersoll and I'm a recent  chico state graduate with a bachelor's  in geography and planning.  this degree's coursework covers topics  of urban planning, sustainability and  stewardship.  all of my extracurricular activities  included serving on the associated  students sustainability affairs council,  being a student organizer with the  california faculty association and  partnership with the chico state  university.  I was also involved in a campaign to  reinstate sustainability as a high  priority on campus, garnering the  support of over 2,000 students.  at that time, at the same time that I  was participating in university affairs,  I was also engaged with broader local  happenings.  I had an internship with  society that exposed me to some of our  struggles to balance stakeholders in  the sigma process as climate change  will cause substantial reductions in  ground and sea level rise.  my experience doing prescribed burns  with big chico creek ecological reserve  has shown me the possibilities and  limitations of good fire as a tool for  climate resilience.  my experience volunteering with butte  environmental council has shown me how  community scale collective action can  create composting programs, community  gardens, environmental education, and  creek cleanups.  with this position, I hope to spark new  conversations between existing community  organizations, community organizations,  the university, both students and staff,  and the city.  through my experiences in chico, I've  learned that humans can thrive as we  continue to make progress towards  carbon neutrality.  renewable energy can lower electricity  bills, bikeable cities can increase  quality of life, and filling the missing  middle housing gap can limit urban  sprawl.  I feel that chico should continue to  double down on the things that make it  special because many of these things can  also save the planet. thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you. of these things can also save the planet. Thank you. Thank you. Sarah Lanham.  good evening, council.  my name is sarah lanham, and I've  applied to sit on the climate action  commission because of my commitment to  environmental protection.  I've been working with the university  to better understand symbiotic  relationships and ecological theory.  this demonstrates how each component  within a cycle is interdependent upon  the next, and how each cycle is necessary  in order to make up the vast ecosystem.  I have a goal of researching restoration  of soil using fungi and other  microorganisms.  after learning the importance of  the harmful impacts of human civilization  on the environment, and ways in which  we can mitigate such impacts.  I have a passion to use my voice and act,  something that many young people aren't  aware they can do.  I have been elected by the chico state  student body to represent their voice  as the commissioner of sustainability  on ways in which we can improve our  practices to be more sustainable and  resilient towards the climate.  in this position, I am given the  opportunity to chair the sustainability  affairs council, where we make  recommendations to the board of  directors and the associated students,  as well as I am given the opportunity  to involve other students and empower  them to use their voice as I use my own.  we also can review data and improve  based off of that as they are  working on the sustainability  sustainability report that comes out  once every three years for the  CSU schools.  I also have a stake in the  alternative transportation committee  where I am also developing an  alternative transportation student  advisory committee.  I just wanted to say that I would  be honored to be nominated on  this council, and I would use my  voice to better  improve the  sustainability of our  thank you.  thank you.  cecilia laura ramsey.  good evening to our mayor, our  city council, and all these wonderful  applicants behind me.  I am so honored to be considered with  them.  thank you all for the great work that  you are doing already.  I lived in chico in the area for  over 20 years and raised my children  here and will soon be raising my  grandchildren here.  it makes me invested in the health and  well-being of our community going  forward into the future and  our environment and our economy  because climate action is also  economic action.  it is healthy for our environment if  we have a good job opportunities and  that goes with a livable client.  I got into anthropology when I began  doing work with a tribe called  the Brazilian Amazon as they were  facing climate change.  this was before we really started to  talk about it here and feel it here.  they were living the results of it.  I got to see first hand how that  impacted their livelihoods and their  abilities to survive in a healthy  environment.  I think anthropology brings the  valuable skills because we have the  skill of going in and engaging  populations, particularly marginalized  communities that you often don't hear  about in the community.  opportunities that we don't hear from  but need to be included in any type of  plan.  I think we can look around and see  that we don't see a lot of our  community represented in these rooms.  bringing engagement to them to bring  them into these plans is important.  I think having a strong understanding  of how humans are engaging with their  environment and social systems is  going to make a plan effective.  the most important thing in bringing  a plan is being able to enact it.  into our community.  it's not as good as the paper it's  written on.  being able to go into the community,  speak to and engage with different  populations, retrieve that data, analyze  it and put a plan in that's going to  work is going to be important.  I'm currently working on a project with  Chico State that we're partnered with  Amy's Organic Kitchen.  what they've done is hire us to engage  with farmers through Oregon and up into  Washington where we are engaging with  them to find out how to move them from  organic farming systems into regenerative  farming systems.  we're going in and find out where their  hesitation is to implement new policies  and where the incentives are so we can  learn how to move people and mobilize  them into new policies.  thank you again for the consideration.  I have a 5 a.m. wake up for work so  I'll be leaving shortly but I'm grateful  to be here.  thank you.  thank you.  council I know typically we have the  interviews at one meeting.  we're going to be talking about it,  meet with them, ask more questions if  you want.  however, and then come back in two  weeks.  I know we're kind of putting council  member Goldstein on the spot unless you  would like more time.  the reason being is this commission  actually by the municipal code meets as  needed.  if we don't have a quorum and if people  don't notify there's been meetings where  we've had a lot of discussion about  the urgency in filling this position and  since it was only one we thought that  perhaps we could do it in a  consolidated manner.  so I'll just turn it over to  council member Goldstein if you have  any additional questions of the  applicants or if you'd like to  nominate someone.  this is tough mainly because we  have four really good candidates here  and I feel very on the spot.  also congrats to jared for his first  baby.  just wanted to say that.  and yeah it's really great that we  have a community of people who are  really interested in serving on the  climate action commission.  I served for two years before getting  elected to council and so from that  limited experience what I see as  important in a member of the climate  action commission among many things is  community connections of course passion  for addressing climate change in our  community but also the ability to bring  new ideas.  and I see that in all of our  candidates.  I think I'm ready to nominate and I  swear I'm not biased here.  Bryce Ingersoll.  okay.  biased because of the name.  and I just want to let the council  know that I will keep the remaining  applicants and applications on file  and absolutely reach out to them in  two years when we do another biannual  recruitment.  so you just need a little bit of  I will take a motion and a second  to confirm and a vote.  for Bryce Ingersoll.  I will second that motion out of  respect for council member Goldstein  that was her nominee that stepped  down so I will respect her wishes in  this particular nomination.  thank you.  all right we have a motion and a  second.  council member Goldstein.  yes.  council member holly.  yes.  council member o'brien.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  mayor reynolds.  aye.  report to communications.  reports have been provided for the  information no action can be taken on  items under this section until the  council agrees to include it on a  council's request for council  members to be  I have one.  I will get my legal mumble  jumble out of the way.  pursuant to council members may  request an item to be  agendized at a future meeting  after stating what that item  would be a majority vote of  council is needed in order for  staff to recognize.  I know we have one coming out of  our committee.  I don'  t know if that'  s the one you'  re hopping on right now.  it'  s another one.  I intend to do our committee one.  I would like to agenda as a  discussion mayor on the alternate  site and the warren settlement.  I actually did not solicit miss  oberholzer to come and share her  experiences.  I don'  t think I'  ve ever spoken to you before but  she did.  It was impactful at least to me.  I want to discuss the current status  and options as it relates to location  rules and other specifics contained in  the settlement agreement regarding the  site.  I'  m sure staff who by the way have  done a fantastic job introducing changes  to enhance safety would love to provide  those details to us.  I believe this discussion is important  for us to have as a council.  But equally as important we want to the  community to engage in the  stage especially neighbors like miss  oberholzer who are impacted the most.  That'  s my request.  I'  ll second that.  all right.  I'  ve got a motion and a second.  can I add one thing?  I don'  t know if this is possible but I  don'  t know how heavy our next agenda  is.  If we can add it to potentially  waive our rules of the 30 days  because I think this is if there'  s to come back in two weeks if  we'  re not too heavy.  it'  s not too heavy.  And so you can as part of the motion  if you want to bring it back in two  weeks instead of the 30 days.  That'  s great.  So I'  ll make that friendly amendment.  Yes.  Okay.  Excellent.  Thank you.  council member goldstein.  yes.  council member holly.  yes.  council member o'brien.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor bennett.  yes.  mayor reynolds.  aye.  carries 7-0.  anybody else down here?  I have one.  I'  ll wait for you.  okay.  so we have been talking a lot in  our ad hoc committee.  And I don'  t know exactly when the report'  s coming back but we'  re in the process of  pulling that together now.  But one of the things that we  wanted to jump on and we all  talked about last meeting was  having directing staff to begin  a conversation about what it  would look like to have the tiny  homes on church lots and that'  s going to be a big  It' s going to take more than  an hour' s worth of time.  I want to have an agenda as a  discussion to direct staff to be  able to work on that.  second.  I want to.  okay.  so that was so do you want the  report here or at your ad hoc  committee?  well.  no.  what I want to do is agenda  is a conversation here to direct  staff to have them.  I'  m going to have them look at  begin looking at the legalities  and what would need be necessary  for having tiny homes on church  parking lots.  and then we'  ll be bringing we may have the  staff report from the ad hoc  committee back in time but I  don'  t want to wait on that  conversation for the staff  report.  and specifically it was  released in our ad hoc committee  meetings it was discussed for  women in the community that are  homeless.  and it was discussed for women  to stay in those tiny homes  that was another part of that  conversation.  I will add the way it came to  us was the north state shelter  team safe spot community  proposal which involves them  working with churches.  but I like that we'  re kind of framing it a  little broader than just the  safe spot proposal but that'  s one way to do it.  for whatever works.  yeah.  because it could be anybody.  it could be any group  proposal.  yes.  okay.  thank you.  thank you.  all in favor of the  all in favor of the present  all in favor of the present  present  all in favor of the present  all in all all in all all in  all all in all all in all all  all in all all all all all  all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
