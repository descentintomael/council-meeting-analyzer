 to the regular Chico City Council meeting here on February 7th and we will call the meeting to order and start with an invocation from Carol Ranner. Did I get that right? All right, welcome. If there's any disruption in your thought this evening, if there's any fear or dislike to anyone or to anything in this world, if there's any clouded past or anxiety for the future, let it all vanish. Release it to your Heavenly Father. Love for you right now with a few moments of silent prayer. Heavenly Father, we take this moment to count our blessings. Thank you, God, for the abundance of rain to quench our thirsty trees, the abundance of grace we share with one another, and with the abundance of wisdom to direct us. We stand humbly before you. From Isaiah, arise, shine, for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon me. Amen. And thank you. And if we could, I'd also like at this moment in time to have, we had a request from one of our council members, and I think Mr. Bennett, it's appropriate to have a moment of silence in memory of Howard Slater, who was a well-known figure in our community, but also gave back to our community in a big way. So if you'd join me in a moment, a brief moment of silence on behalf of Howard Slater. All right, thank you. Will you please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance? Thank you. All right, just a reminder here, silence your cell phones, please. And I won't make a comment that that was someone's cell phone I heard going off during the prayer. All right, and we will start with the roll call. Adam Clark. Okay, just so you know, the meeting has started. I don't know why it's locked on saying the meeting will begin shortly, but please note the meeting has begun. All right, and is that, we are viewing on Channel 11 online? I will check to do that. So let me call roll. Council Member Bennett? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Tandon? Here. Council Member Van Overbeck? Here. Council Member Winslow? Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds?

To my left, to your right, is the City Clerk's Office. Speaker cards are in the back of the room. Speakers will be taken in the order the cards are received once the first speaker begins to speak. No additional cards on that item will be accepted. So, and we will start on item 1.6 with the closed session announcement from City Attorney Vincent Yu. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. The City Attorney, City Manager, and staff met in closed session on the listed agenda items. No reportable action occurred, direction was given. That concludes my closed session report. All right, thank you very much. Item 1.7, we have a presentation from the Arts and Culture Grant Award Program from Kimberly Rinella and Monica McDaniel, if they want to come on down. Welcome. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you for having us back. This is Kimberly. I'm the chair of the Art Commission. This is Kimberly Rinella. She's the vice chair of the commission. We wanted to do a comprehensive report of all of the grant funding since 2018 with the City of New York. We had a chance to share with Council how grateful we are and how grateful the organizations are to receive these grant funding allocations. And so we have a report for you. And then we can answer questions once it's done. So do we start it? There it is. Here we go.

Business from the floor. Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined based on the number of speakers. The Council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? Eleven. All right. Just under the three minutes each. Okay. So our first speaker and what I'll do is I'll call the first two speakers. If the first two can actually line up in the middle aisle, that would be great. Yolanda Niderost followed by Marlon Wade-Davis. So Yolanda will be first. And just so you know, the microphone is up on the top and you don't, you just can just speak. It'll pick you up. It is. Right here. Mm-hmm. Okay. I am a little nervous. Okay. First time here. Okay. Okay. Good evening. And I'm timing it. My name is Yolanda Niderost. Edward Niderost. I am here to demand that the City of Chico refund the money, amount the money we pay Edward and me for the Miller Mansion PG&E bill. This is because Casey Reynolds was sending homeless to the mansion at that time. Edward and I owned the mansion. Casey Reynolds never called us, emailed us, asked if we would agree with her decision. Casey Reynolds, before sending homeless to the mansion, he should investigate whom owned the mansion, why Jim Colley was there, if he had the rights to rent rooms. Casey Reynolds is a small lady, college degree, city council with enough experience. When I got the first bill the first PG&E bill for $1,500, $1,800, $2,200. I went to the mansion. Jim Colley was there. I showed him the bills right here. I told him you have to pay for those bills or give me the money. He refused and he was renting rooms, collecting the money and putting the money in his packet. Dad has a loan. He still didn't offer the full amount. probably we pay $100 a month, no, $2,000 a month. Who was Gene Collier? Why he was in the mansion? We didn't even know who he was. One day, knock the door. He put stupid ideas in my husband, 83 years old, with health and mental problems, to buy the Miller mansion. A month before his brother had died, he went to Wells Fargo, took a loan, put the Miller mansion down payment. A few days later, Gene Collier moved into the mansion, like his own place. He called the Chico ER for interview. He had having all kind of parties. To me, he was an intruder who took advance of elder people. At that time, we were paying Miller mansion PG&E, property taxes, insurance, landscape, swimming pool service, Wells Fargo loan, almost all our savings gone, money that we deserve because Edward worked hard in construction for 65 years, and I was a housekeeping for 20 years. Part of the money that we have, it was for our grandkids' college education, but it's gone, almost all. I am Chico resident for 32 years, Edward 35 years. We pay property taxes, state taxes. Time is up, I apologize. So usually we have a clock. Unfortunately, today it's not working. Well. It's usually on this screen. It is working on my screen, so I'm monitoring it, but I will let everyone know for time. I apologize. But I give the idea what's going on. Thank you. I'll finish for her. And then if you could maybe just say, say 30 when they're done. Okay, I'll raise my hand when it's 30 seconds. There we go. So Marlin Wade Davis is followed by Loretta Torres. Here. Here we go. And this. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. since Ed worked very hard in construction for 65 years and I was housekeeping for 20 years. Part of our... Oh, she already read that part. Let's just start here. Ed was my husband for 32 years, a happy couple, always together, going to breakfast every Sunday after church. We took short trips. One day I asked him if he bought them in our mansion. He told me, it wasn't me, Yolanda, it was not me, with tears in his eyes. Lots of stress, depression, pain and tears for both of us. The last three years of our lives have been misery. It was very hard for me to take care of him. I asked God to help me to get him out of bed. He passed away at home next to me, holding hands. I miss him. I still talk to him. I miss him every day. I know he's in heaven now. I have an angel that protects me. Thank you. Thank you. Let's see, where am I at? Loretta Torres, followed by Margaret Swick. My name is Loretta Torres. I'm a resident of Chico and I'm here to talk about what I watched. You guys listening to and hearing all the detrimental things that were said about your decisions to go forward with Valley's Edge. And I live in that area and we're talking 10, 20, 30 years of construction. But it would be very easy for me to say to you, not in my neighborhood, but yet, because I have a farming background, I don't want the city to sprawl in towards the river where there's wonderful farmland. And in my area, there is nothing but rocks and weeds and sometimes some cattle. So when I'm really asking, I guess, it's because I see the usual suspects are suing the city and costing us money and litigation. I would like those people who are suing this city to think about when the infill happens and it's being done incrementally all over. We're doing housing. Planning Commission is doing their due diligence for that. I would like some answers and some input from the people that are so against Valley's Edge. I want to know where they think after the infill is done, what Chico should expand to. Answers that I know that you don't have, but I hope in the hearts of people that are going to cost us money with this referendum and with the lawsuit, they think twice, look in the mirror and think, where would I, where are the solutions from my standpoint? Thank you. Thank you, Loretta. Margaret Swick followed by Lynn Bellante. Good evening. Here we are in a new year with a new council and a new police chief. Still, around the country, the same issues of police brutality continue unabated. I am here to ask you to look at our police department and make sure that our police are operating humanely and well within the law established by Assembly Bill 392. It mandates that police will only use deadly force when necessary to save life. We have a tragic history in our city with the shooting to death of Desmond Phillips, Tyler Rushing, and Stephen Vest. Many in Chico think that these men would be alive if our police had acted humanely rather than so quickly choosing to use deadly force. Are we simply fortunate that the national spotlight hasn't shined its light on our police shootings? We have learned that police have always been able to use deadly force, but have they been able to use it? that the team of officers that killed Tyrae Nichols in Memphis had a history of acting with impunity and outside the law, which was ignored. As a result, that special task force was dissolved. Yet Chico apparently continues to have an elite violence suppression team described as a proactive team going after organized crime, career criminals, and people already on supervised release. There are so many red flags about this. Does the violence suppression team operate with unmarked cars like the officers did who killed Tyrae Nichols? Where is the data on the operations of our violence suppression team? Have you reviewed it? The public just said, the continued acquisition of military equipment, canine, drones, and license plate readers. Now, we know that in Butte County, the violence we have seen by law enforcement is not simply against people of color, but against the poor, the indigent, the mentally ill, the confused, those in some kind of crises. In other words, the fragile, which could become any of us, actually. I think that the police should make an arrest when necessary and follow the law so that anyone arrested can appear in court and exercise their right to due process. The police are not hired to be judge, jury, executioner. We have zero citizen oversight of law enforcement in Chico and Butte County, no citizen commission anywhere. We depend on you to make sure that our police department is fully transparent, that we are not accountable to the public, and that any use of force is humane and within the law. Thank you. Thank you. Lynn Belante, followed by Amshar Singh. My name is Lynn Belante, and I live in North Chico. And I have a concern regarding the law enforcement. My joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint But I wanted to point something out about the secondary site that was chosen in June. And I was here, and I didn't realize at the time that the property line of that secondary site on Eaton and Cohasset shares a property line with a school. And I don't know if you were aware of it. Some of you weren't voting in June. It's called Oak Bridge Online Learning Academy. Don't let the name fool you. It is not fully online. It is a Chico Unified school. They were in the mall until the spring. And sometime in the spring, they did move right there. It's K through 12, above sixth grade, does have mandatory attendance time at the school. And other than that, students may go there for tutoring, teaching help, counseling. They even have a garden right there in the parking lot, very close to that property line. I don't feel that that's appropriate for the alternate campsite if we need to go to a second one. Back to the first one. I don't think the majority of campers are actually supposed to be there. There's right now two campers inside the site. They're not supposed to be there. A third of the space has been blocked off for cars. I'm not really sure about car camping and if the cars belong to the campers, how that's supposed to be. But that's all taking up a lot of space that could be used for if more campers do need to go there. They could be given allotted space size. Some places do this. And I just want to remind you that actually both of the sites are in a B1 overflight. They're in a B1 zone. And the reason for that kind of zoning is because trash increases birds, which is dangerous for the flights. It's dangerous for the people living under there, their electronics. It causes a danger as well. That's why the zoning is B1 unless it was changed, and I don't know about it. And a year and a half ago, the San Jose Airport was ordered to move their camps or they were going to lose several million dollars in funding from the FAA. And now the Chico Regional Airport is looking at opening up again. And getting some money from FAA. So that might be an issue. Anyway, so the point I really wanted to make was if a second alternative site is needed, I hope that you choose a different location and one that does not share a property line with a school. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sure seeing followed by Nicole Nava. Good afternoon, City Council members. Pure coincidence, this wasn't planned, but I'm going to talk about the alternative site as well. I represent the owners of La Dolce Piazza, which is on that corner of Cohasset and Eaton. And, well, we're not really pleased with the city because we feel like the city forced the situation upon us. We're a family-owned business. We bought that plaza. And about a year and a half ago, after the fact, we found out that that had been deemed an alternative site for the homeless community. We found out after the fact. This wasn't something we were given prior notification of. This is something we were aware of. We didn't realize it was going. And it was going to be passed. After the fact, a few months passed, and it's okay. But recently, if you drive by there, it looks like a junkyard occupied by human beings. There's trash. There's clothes. There's people. I mean, it looks terrible. It looks terrible. Not only that, it's spilling over onto our business center. Within the last few months, with a really rapid increase, we've had cases of vandalism, graffiti everywhere, broken windows. We've had water mains ripped and broken into, and the wires torn apart, which I can only assume was to get some sort of electrical charge. There's garbage everywhere. We have two garbage dumps there, but there's garbage strewn all over the center. We have, there's human feces. We've had to clean that up. We've had human feces. We've had people going in there and a lot of other sort of vandalism. Just last week, one of our tenants had their car being stolen, had to call the cops, because their car was being stolen in broad daylight. And that's one of a few small instances of some of the criminal acts that have happened since then. This site. Since that incident, within the last, sorry, not since that incident, but within the last month and a half, we have had two tenants approach us and said that they are not renewing their leases directly and only because of the homeless site across the street. So that's put a lot of pressure on us. And now we're asking the city, how are we going to resolve this issue? Because this is something that was, one, forced upon us. And we feel like it was just kind of dumped there. And it wasn't regulated since then. We've had, I mean, there's a lot of people. But to sum it up, I guess I'm going to be coming back here a lot to bring up the issue and try to ask you guys how we're going to resolve this. I mean, we've had damaged infrastructure. We've had cars broken into, people being harassed. We've had our tenants where they had people walk into their offices and harass them. We've been trying to call the police, and they have responded. But now we're trying to get some answers. And we're trying to figure out how long this is going to last and when we can figure this out. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Becca. Good evening, council and real Americans. Statistics matter. Some statistics are shiny and held up to blind us to reality. So other dirty, inconvenient facts are buried or left to rot in plain view because they are unfavorable to personal ideologies. Let's compare recent national news and local news. At tonight's State of the Union, President Biden will say what a fantastic job he's doing. Unemployment fell to a 54-year low of 3.4% in January. That means we have created more jobs in two years than any four-year presidential term than any time in two years, said Biden. Please note what Biden has not said, but it is true for real Americans. These job gains are a recovery from massive job losses due to Biden and Newsom's COVID shutdowns and include retirees forced to go back to work, people working side gigs, and teenagers working to help out. Inflation is still ugly. Utilities, groceries, fuel, and housing costs are sky high. How many Americans stopped contributing to or lost their retirement or savings? Work overtime? Defaulted on credit lines? Stopped buying preferred products or buy less? Stopped taking vacations? Can't retire yet? Biden won't factor our sacrifices into a skewed statistic because they are dirty, inconvenient facts, so he needs to blind you with his shiny jobs-added object. And what of the Chinese spy balloon fiasco? China tested Biden, and Biden tested Biden. It didn't just blink. Our president took a full-on nap while that spy machine flew across our beautiful nation. He failed a crucial test and showed weakness. Now let's look at Chico. We still have encampments left to clear where mountains of trash get dumped in our public spaces. The stench, rodents, and contempt for our city by the campers who caused it and fake environmentalists who do nothing is disgusting to behold. It is a public health hazard that we 100 percent can address for our non-littering laws and the state's legal legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic legalistic costing us hundreds of thousands of dollars due to their fake idealism. We can choose to stop allowing fake environmentalists, aka the toxic enablers, to dictate what happens and stop them from trashing our town. Just stop donating and awarding them grants. Remember the national news? And now this local issue. Look at this shiny object over here so you don't look over there and see what the enablers are doing with their dirty big secret. It isn't about the environment. It isn't real data. It only matters when it impacts their personal politics and to line their pockets. They don't care what taxpayer want or need or what's going on with our own eyes. Stop blinking. Time to take these clowns to the train station. And by that I mean take their trash to the dump, the violators... That seems appropriate. The train has arrived. I have no idea where that came from. All right. I apologize. That's new. We may want to just keep that. For the end of everyone's speech. It's way more dramatic. Okay. I'm showing my age here but I'm remembering the Gong show. Come on down. Becca followed by Jeremiah Black. If anyone was falling asleep, they're now awake. Howdy. My name is not Becca. My name is Joey Tansen. Becca is a co-worker of mine. She has agreed to take a later position later on this afternoon if that's allowed. They're taking in the order received. Yeah. So if she could come up, that would be great. Okay. Thank you. Hello. My name is Becca. And first I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to stand before all of you. Like I said, my name is Becca. I am a worker at Enloe Medical Center. And I moved here with my family from the East Bay where the cost of living required either two working parents or one working parent with three jobs just to live. We moved here thinking it would be a little bit better but realized that Chico's cost of living isn't far from where I left in the Bay. I always thought working at the hospital, we would at least have a better life. And the worst case case is the worst case case is the worst case case is the worst case case case is the worst case case. My family still has the joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint It sends me that the community is struggling just to make ends meet. And it's hard to afford just the basic necessities for many of my coworkers. And that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Jeremiah Black, followed by Joey Tansen. Good evening. My name is Jeremiah Black. I've currently been at Enloe for almost two years now. I've also been around the Chico area since I was in fifth grade, moved up from L.A. Again, cost of living was high there. Came up to Chico and lived here for quite a while until I decided to pursue my culinary goals elsewhere. Went to Santa Rosa, decided that was too high. Came back to Chico, and now I still see that the amount of rent is high no matter where I go, as well as our retention bonuses. And the joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint the kitchen. Now, granted, we're happy on what we do, especially being able to serve food to our patients and our employees, but the biggest issue now is having the cost of living going up, as well as the constant rotating door of employees coming in and out within our businesses, especially in Enloe as of now. So we just come together today to ask them at one point in time, we have a meeting with the council later on to discuss more about this issue that concerns all of us, and not only us as employees, but our community as well. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. Joey Tanson, followed by Tanya Robinson. Long time no see. Joey Tanson here again. You've heard from my co-workers at Enloe Medical Center. They work in dietary. I work in housekeeping. So it is my department's responsibility to make sure that when a patient comes into Enloe Medical Center, that they have a clean and safe and infection-free room. That is our job. My boyfriend's job, it's relevant, works at the movie theaters. Hands-off popcorn, tickets, la-di-da-da-da, all that stuff. We started the exact same day, and about two weeks after we started our jobs, I picked him up from work, and we talked about our days. He started, and he told me that, you know, he handed out popcorn, did the things, and then it got really slow at the movie theaters and the concession stand, and one of his co-workers brought his Nintendo Switch, so they started playing Animal, no, not Animal Crossing, Mario Kart right there at the concession stands for a few hours on the clock because it was super slow. The same time, roughly, that my boyfriend was playing Mario Kart with his co-workers, I was cleaning a patient room that was a shared patient room, and the patient on the other side was, was, on a ventilator saying goodbye to his family because he was dying of COVID. He was on comfort care at that time. Him and I, to this day, still make the exact same wages. We make the exact same amount of money, and that does not seem fair to me. Every time that I clean a room and I make someone's bed, I ask myself if I'm making someone's deathbed. I think people who are called healthcare heroes deserve a little bit more respect than that from our employers. So, to really drive it home, I'm asking for your support, Congress-, Congress members-, council members-, and would love to speak with you as soon as we can about this issue. Thank you. Hello. My name is Tanya Robinson and I am a lifetime resident of Butte County. As the state's well as my mother, my sister, my sons. They all live here within the Chico community. I have worked in the healthcare industry for the last 28 years and the last eight hospital specific. We have a real staffing retention crisis in Butte County, specifically in Lowell Hospital. We have a revolving door of staff that are not being paid enough to live in this city and barely this county. So they make barely over minimum wage and I hear day in and day out on multiple jobs for multiple people working full time. It is unfathomable that we have an employer within our county that is trying to propose a three-year contract where they do not want to raise wages at all for a lot of the employees within the hospital. We have a staffing retention issue currently. We have a staffing retention issue currently. We have a staffing retention issue currently and it is going to get worse if we have people that are already going to be experiencing burnout from working multiple jobs. So we are asking for the council to give us some attention to talk about the staffing retention issues that we have in the healthcare within our county. I have lived here my whole life and it was affordable at one time to be able to rent a house here in Chico or maybe even live like all of us were lucky enough to buy homes when they were affordable. It is just not reasonable. It is just not reasonable. It is just not reasonable. It is just not reasonable. It is just not reasonable. It is just not reasonable anymore where people cannot afford rent when their income is so low. So we would like to set a time if possible to be able to meet with some council members to discuss the issues we have. Thank you. Thank you. That is it for business from the floor. All right. Thank you very much. We will move on to item four, public hearings. We have an appeal, public hearing guidelines. I just want to go over real quick. So we have an announcement of the ex parte communications staff report up to 15 minutes. Then the council discussion and questions of staff, that is an additional 10 minutes. And we open the hearing for public input, no more than 50 minutes of which the appellant gets 15, additional speakers 30, and then the appellant gets three minutes if we so grant it. So then we close the hearing and then council discussion, 20 minutes longer as needed. So this is item 4.1, appeal of variance 21-01. And we start with a report from Kelly Murphy, senior planner for the development department. Good evening, members of the council. The project site under discussion today is located at 279 East 2nd Avenue on a parcel zone R3, that is our medium high density residential zoning district. Surrounding land uses include single and multifamily housing. The project proposes to construct a two story structure containing a single family residence and an attached accessory dwelling unit, or ADU. Single-family residential uses and ADUs are allowed by right in the R3 zone when consistent with density requirements of the general plan. The subject property is a legal, non-conforming parcel that does not meet the minimum lot size of 4,000 square feet for interior lots in the R3 zone, nor does it have frontage on a public street. The site dimensions are 39 by 50 feet for a total lot area of 1,950 square feet. Access to the site is provided via an alleyway connecting East 1st and East 2nd Avenues between Oleander and Laburnum. Due to these constraints, the site has not been developed. The project proposes a building footprint of 918 square feet. The main unit would consist of approximately 600 square feet of living space on the ground level and 870 square feet of living space on the second floor for a combined living area just under 1,500 square feet. The proposed ADU would be located on the ground floor and have an area of 324 square feet. The zoning administrator may grant a variance from the requirements governing only six specific development standards, all relating to dimensional standards, which are more objective in nature. The project would comply with the required front and side yard setbacks, the project proposes a rear yard setback of 5 feet 6 inches. While this distance complies with the rear yard setback requirement for the ground floor ADU, relief from the standard is necessary for the main resident's living area on the second floor above the ADU. In addition, the project is seeking relief from one of the two off-street parking spaces required for the main residence. These were the two adjustments or variances requested by the applicant. Single family residences are required to provide a minimum of two off-street parking spaces. As proposed, the project would provide one in the front setback area. No parking is required for the ADU, as there are two bus stops within 800 feet of the site. Staff is supportive of the one space parking reduction request due to the fact the property has substandard area and access constraints, is in a mixed-use area served by public transit, and that the parking reduction, is not likely to overburden public parking supplies in the vicinity. At its meeting on December 13, 2022, the Zoning Administrator conducted a public hearing and approved Variance 2101. All public correspondence received on this item has been included as attachment four to the staff report. An appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision was filed on January 3 of this year, citing objections related to the required findings of approval. So all the points are valid. The first points of the appeal have been summarized in the staff report, each followed by a staff response. The first point of the appeal is in reference to findings A and D, and the appellant contends that no other property owners enjoy the privileges that the zoning administrator will be awarding, therefore giving special privileges that are not present for other sites of similar size. And to that, staff would like to point out that as stated by the appellant, the subject property is unusually small and represents a unique situation in this neighborhood area. Despite being a legal building site, the unique characteristics associated with the site instigate the need for variance to adequately develop the property. As acknowledged by the appellant, the size and shape of the subject property represent circumstances which do not apply generally, so the appellant is not required to provide any specific information about the property. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. Classifications are still the case. for any single family residential use, regardless of bedroom count or unit size, making this another example of a nonconforming parcel with a nonconforming parking situation. Staff also found evidence of a use permit approved several years ago for the property just adjacent to the alley-locked parcel we just discussed at 179 East 2nd Avenue, which authorized a reduced rear yard setback, construction of a second dwelling unit, and the provision of only two of three off-street required parking spaces. Therefore, it's staff's position that strict application of the development regulations for the proposed project would effectively deny the property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and within the R3 zoning district. Granting the variance will allow for construction of a single family residence and accessory dwelling unit, which is allowed on other properties zoned R3 and does not result in special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other R3 zoned properties. In reference to finding B, the appellant contends the City of Chico is not obliged to change the zoning of property in order to grant property rights and that the proposed project is inconsistent with the zoning and building codes and poses a threat to health and safety. In accordance with the purpose of Chapter 1926, which governs variances, the variance request is not, a change in the zoning or flexibility in land use regulations. The land use is consistent with the R3 zone and the project's been conditioned to comply with all state and local code provisions, including those of the building, public works, fire departments, as well as Butte County Environmental Health. No impacts to public health and safety are anticipated as a result of the project's development. In reference to finding E, the appellant contends the construction of new infill units, on this residential block, should have been considered as they contribute to increased traffic and safety concerns. The appellant also noted concerns about fire danger, stating the variance will eliminate open space, which could precipitate a major residential fire event. Development of the site will require building permits to ensure project consistency with city zoning, building, and fire code. For instance, the proposed dwelling units shall be required to be fire sprinklered. Granting the variance for a reduced rear yard setback and one space parking reduction will not, under these circumstances, be materially detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or welfare of the city, or injurious to property and improvements in the vicinity. The appellant contends the highest and best used for the subject property would be a small home. The proposed project would result in the creation of two new dwelling units on a vacant lot intended for media use, a medium to high-density residential development. Building height is allowed up to 45 feet in the R3 zoning district. While the appellant would prefer to see a small-story home developed on this site, the staff believes that the density of development and two-story design is more consistent with the R3 zoning district. Furthermore, the proposal is consistent with several general plan goals and policies, specifically related to our housing element, which promote construction, and the construction of a wide range of housing types enables sufficient construction of, or excuse me, enables sufficient housing construction to meet future needs, and to maintain an adequate supply of rental housing to meet the needs of all renters, including university students and employees. The appellant's letter cited additional questions and concerns, all of which have been addressed in the staff report. In summary, owner occupancy is not required for ADUs. The property owner shall be required to submit payment of, in lieu of, or to pay the residential fees for alley maintenance. Residential runoff into the alley is not allowed, and adequate on-site drainage shall be required. Further, the project would comply with lot coverage standards for the R3 zone, is exempt from further environmental review, and allows adequate access for construction vehicles and equipment. So for these reasons, the recommendation of the community development director is that the council deny the appeal and uphold the zoning administrator's approval of variance 2101. That concludes the presentation from staff. I can take any questions. All right. Do we have any questions? Mr. Bannon? Very thorough. Thank you. I just heard you say something that I may have missed or not understood. An ADU does not require owner occupancy? That is correct. A junior ADU, as defined by the government code, a unit, no more than 500 square feet, and fully within the walls of an existing single family residence, would qualify as a junior ADU, and that is subject to an owner occupancy requirement. Junior, okay. Yes. Okay. And in summary, and you summarized it very well, in summary, this particular change, or this particular subject, is fully compatible with the existing city codes and standards. So the zoning decision by the zoning person is not adversarial in any way to the Chico policies. I just want to make sure I'm clear on that. That's correct. This was processed in accordance with Chapter 1926, which, as I mentioned, allows for relief from only six very specific standards in which this project met the criteria for. Okay. Thank you very much. You're welcome. All right. Any other questions? All right. I'm going to move over here. Would you like me to leave a map up, or are we done with the slides? Well, we'll be done with the slides because we're going to have the timer anyway. Okay. All right. So council discussions and questions. We'll move it on like that. We'll open the public hearing for input. We'll move on to the next item. We have more than 50 minutes, and Madam Clerk, I'll turn it over to you at this point. Okay. We have four speakers, and the first three are the appellants, and so they'll get five minutes each because they have a total of 15 minutes for them. So the first speaker is David Semmon, followed by Ken Erickson, but, David, you have five minutes. Yeah, and so the public understands, too, because they are actually appellants, they get a total of 15 minutes. There's three of them so we're going to divide that five minutes each and then the response will be three minutes from the public as each Member comes up, but just because you have five minutes doesn't mean you have to use it. I have less so thank you I'd like to thank the City Council and staff for giving us the opportunity to at least voice our concerns and about this project First of all, I'd like to say that I'm not against the proposed residential development of this parcel so The parcel being substandard of small size it's 39 by 50 so it fits in this room pretty nicely Consideration of its small size the proposed structure I believe should be much smaller and allowed to be more in balance with the with the actual physical size of the property It seems that the two-unit two-story structure design is kind of using a loophole in the state of California Is a DU plan and it's kind of an intention to create a duplex is what we kind of look at there Most 80 use that I know of our additions to existing residences The parcel contains several mature trees providing bird and wildlife habitat All of these trees will be removed during construction Most of the trees are approximately 70 feet One of them is 34 inches in diameter at breast height It appears that there will not be enough room after construction for any landscaping and the tree canopy cover will be gone The city is currently in the process of it adopting a Chico urban forest management plan Advocating for a building design that will remove all trees Covering this parcel seems in contradiction with the goals of that plan and I might mention the strategic plan And I'd like to give you the item numbers 2.9 5 point H 7 point G and 7 point I The view shed which is of great concern to most residential planning will be greatly diminished What we'll have instead of the trees is a two-story structure with a single car parked in the front on the alley side adopting this building plan creates a need for on street parking and In my mind is the symptom of a deteriorating neighborhood Ingress and egress for the alley is to First Avenue has some definite risk of accidents And I think the larger occupancy levels of this project will add to this situation the the exist the existing Alley has a major draining issue and if the city is going to approve this type of plans they can Should consider investment in drainage curbing and resurfacing Improvements using any money generated by this project and previous projects of the alley In conclusion the the neighborhood owners are not against residential development of this parcel but would encourage the council to Ask the developer to downsize the project for greater compatibility with the existing neighborhood So thank you very much Thank you, Ken Erickson Good evening, my name is Ken Erickson and I own the property directly across the alley from the proposed building My alley is or my lot is actually a hundred feet wide which is double the width of the proposed property and If the two-story building is actually created it will look down directly in my backyard which you know, I understand you know that the price paid for this property needs to be recouped through renting it out and I admit that Chico needs more housing, but I think it's single-story piece of housing piece of housing would be a lot more appropriate for the neighborhood and You know the payback could be longer but so be it The other thing is that Once this house is on the alley the alley will become a thoroughfare because There's only one way you can go on that. I mean if you come in on off East second you got a discharge on the East first and half a block down at East first and only in there There are continual Accidents there and the I had to line of sight on only underneath first is a lot better than it is coming out of that alley I will guarantee you that there will be accidents on that alley The other issue is if you're coming down these first either way and you want turning that alley. It's a sharp turn and You're getting that back up with backups. They are also where you end up with rear enders The alley is substandard along with the lot size Where the house is gonna go It's in bad shape already the majority of the people that travel down the alley are on my side of the alley and It's dipped I mean it's rolling down to the side If it's gonna be used continual as a thoroughfare because there is no place to turn around on it You're gonna come in one side and you've got it good out the other side regardless of which side you end up on or enter on So it's all about the Staff said that the fire department is good with this project I defy The fire department to get a piece of equipment down that alley the only way that Truck trucks make it down there is they start on 5th Avenue? and come down the alley the whole way. They could not make a turn off of 2nd or East 1st Avenue onto that alley. I've heard this building being referred to as a 2nd Avenue address. It's between East 1st and East 2nd Avenue. I don't know how they came up with a 2nd Avenue address. If the alleys I'd much rather see the money, in lieu money that the developer is going to pay go into the alley improvement right away as opposed to going in lieu because we will never see that money as far as alley improvement. Other than that I'm not against it but I would much rather see a single story structure. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Jennifer Spanker. I have a photo to distribute to the council members and an extra one for the clerk. Thank you. I just want to clarify something that Councillor Bennett brought up and maybe I'm just not as versed in this but it's a non-conforming parcel and it could not be built without the variance. I just want to make a point. I want to make clear that it doesn't require a zoning change but it does require this variance. And so I do think that the city, I'd like to see the city be more conscientious or careful in allowing this variance. And now I'll read from prepared notes. I work full time and am a single mother of a teenager. I have not wanted to spend my time attending hearings, communicating with planning staff, meeting with folks and preparing for and attending the city council hearing. But I must do this because it is us neighbors who will have to experience the negative impacts of this outsized development. For example, the developers in lieu fees for tree removal and alley degradation will not go to mitigate the impact on our neighborhood but will go into citywide funds. Neighbors have knowledge of the location that is not available to planning staff. As evidence of this, our written appeal to the variance as for clarification on how the proposed building would be constructed with not enough setbacks, the staff response in their written report was that since four infill units had already been built on this alley in the last year, then obviously construction can occur. This response misses the point. In fact, the previous built infill buildings were built on much larger lots with plenty of open space to handle the trucks and equipment, which is not the case for the subject property. This makes, this is one example that makes me insecure about a lack of thought about the importance of the the 항 항 항 항 항!! 항 항 항!! The resident parks a second car illegally on the alley on an ongoing basis, as you can see in the photo. Our alley is 1.5 feet narrower, and there is no reason to believe that a much worse situation would occur at the proposed three-bedroom plus ADU development on our alley, creating a hazardous situation. Planning staff refers to this project as a house, when in fact it's a three-bedroom house, and so we could assume that at least three people, if you think it would be college students, at least three adult college students would be living in this house plus another one in the ADU, and they would probably all have cars. City Council has a unique role to play in this process. You have the latitude to consider factors that the planning staff cannot. For example, the house. Housing element lists the need for one-story homes in walkable neighborhoods for seniors. This location and non-conforming lot would be ideal. The avenues neighborhood is one of the few walkable neighborhoods that is also close to the hospital, which is ideal for senior housing units. City planning seems to be guided by maximizing the square footage and number of bedrooms on this lot, even though it is way outsized for the lot and narrow alley. Another consideration for the council's latitude is that the subject lot is on R. 3 land and across the alley is R. 1. So the impact of creating R. 3 project is more acute in this context. Our small alleys in the avenues with no sidewalks, parking curbs, fire truck access, or easy egress and ingress were not designed to accommodate essentially duplexes that fronts on them. City Council can still abide by the general plan recommendations and support a smaller project that fits with policies. In fact, a small house plus ADU could be built without a variance. City Council can still abide by the general plan recommendations and support a smaller project that fits with policies. In fact, a small house plus ADU could be built without a variance. City Council can still abide by the general plan recommendations and support a smaller project that fits with policies. In fact, a small house plus ADU could be built without a variance. Or the owner could sell the lot to the adjacent apartment owner. Why not let the free market determine the question on building on the lot without city intervention? Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Ryan Beckle. Hi. I'm representing the owner. I guess as far as their concerns, the property needs variance either way. So without the variance, it'd be unbuildable whether it had an ADU or not. The thought with the variance and the setbacks was to prevent it from being three stories and to keep it two stories. Any tenants there are going to realize that they don't have parking option. One tenant will be able to have a spot. So it's going to lend to in-load traveling nurses might be walking students at white walk or bike. Obviously, if they're not going to be able to have a parking option, they're going to have to go to a parking lot. If they don't have a spot given to them, they could choose to park on public spots farther away from the property. If people nearby are concerned with that, not having their own property, they could put driveways on their property rather than using the public parking or being dependent on that. The, you know, as far as like free market, it was for sale. The neighbor with the apartments could have bought the property three years ago, but they didn't. There's fire sprinklers. So the fire sprinklers are going to have to have a parking spot. trucks also would take a hose that property like anything else down the alley that's already built and developed the uh trees are unfortunate but a tree being on a property doesn't make it unbuildable you can't say that you know that's prevent us from taking a tree down and ultimately trying to help with uh info housing is needed and uh the city at the building department supported the idea so that's what drove the uh setbacks and the variance request so that's uh all i've got thanks thank you we don't have any other speakers all right so we will go ahead and close the well actually we have to give the appellant three minute rebuttal if they so choose so if you would like to come and address the concerns that were made you're welcome to have three minutes at least well you know i would just like to say i know you probably think it's pretty gutsy of us to um antagonize the planning department and i i realize that the planning department approved this the higher ups approved it and so you are probably thinking that you want to rely on what the staff put in their report and so i can see how that might be um you know a difficult one for you however let me tell you that you know we brought up at least one of the questions that we had and i think that's a good one and i think that's a good one um i i i'm not as concerned about less parking frankly i'm concerned about the hazard created by double parking there and you can see evidence of that in that other project just a couple blocks away that that's what's going to happen i mean even if it's even if it's visiting nurses whatever they're gonna and walk to end load there's still going to be an issue with the parking lot and the issue with that double parking on that on that alley and the alley is really tiny so i also understand the issue of the r3 but it's still a tiny tiny lot and i think that the developer made a mistake i mean the developer bought it thought they could get a variance thought they could build on it and um they were they were i think um foolish and unfortunately i think that the planning department has you know um supported them in in their reasoning but you all do not have to be as constrained as the planning department in um in in its analysis you all can think beyond uh what's in the planning department's recommendation and look at the um outsized quality of this and what a huge impact it's going to make in um the avenue of development and i say this because i think it's one of of of more proposals like this actually around the corner from me on second avenue there there's a big huge double lot and they want to build a house i don't know what they want to build in an adu but they're lacking looking for a variance from parking and setbacks so this is obviously a big issue for the council here and the planning department and i just caution you that the avenues is historic the avenues is um charming according to the planning department and i just caution you that the avenues is historic the avenues is historic the avenues is historic the avenues is historic the avenues is historic according to all the city brochures and that by building these like mcmansion oversized um projects on steroids it's it's going to really have an adverse effect thank you for your consideration thank you all right so with that we will close the public hearing and move on to council discussion motion and vote um before i do that we need to have an announcement of expert take communications which i have not done so go ahead all right um i i spoke with the um the appellants um i went and visited the site with them and talked about their issues um and gave them some of my uh feedback all right anyone else i know the um builders and have spoke with them and asked a couple of questions about it all right anyone else no we're not all right that out of the way we'll move on to council discussion motion and a vote all right anyone else no no other speakers so all right anyone else all right anyone else i have a couple of questions and a couple of thoughts i'll kick it off here um i but in um regard to the public safety mr fire chief could you address the fact is this a common occurrence in our city that we have um lots that have no public street face-to-face streets um are there any access. Can you just, I don't know, is that a lot, a few? With the ADU changes to laws, there have been a proliferation of the ADUs that have been built with, with Aldi access. It does present a challenge for us, but it's something we, we adapt to and, and we put our, we put our review process to make sure we have adequate access to those areas. But it also entails the city making sure that those alleyways are being cleared from trees and other debris. Because I know Public Works has so much extra time right now. This one, I'm just going to be honest, this one gives me a little bit of heartburn. I just, for these neighbors, there was a letter in here on one of them, and I'm not sure, Ms. Higgins. Spengler, if it was yours or somebody that said there's already been four or five ADUs built on this street. And so I think that's where I'm, you know, imagining like my street and four more houses built on my street that have no off, on off street parking. You know, I just, I'm feeling for the neighbors and it's feeling like a tight squeeze to me, but that's just kind of where I'm falling right now. Right. These are difficult decisions. This type of challenge to us in the area of, yes, it does meet the city standards. Yes, it does. It should be permitted according to the city and staff. And staff, you did an excellent job of analyzing this, in my opinion. But it's also a neighbor concern. You live there. You're right next door across the alley. So it makes it very, very, I'm going to use the term challenging. Does it create heartburn? It absolutely does. But you, I hope you understand that we are in many ways obligated to be adhering to the rules. And I think that's a very important part of the process. Yes. Adhere to the city standards and the city criteria. So all I want to say is that we feel your pain. And that's an overused term, but I'm going to use it tonight. We feel your pain and then we'll be making a decision shortly. But thank you for your time. Thank you for putting the effort into it. All right. Councillor Witzel. Thanks. Councillor Roswell. A lot of the issues, regardless of the legitimacy of them, I don't know that they bear on what's specifically mentioned in the variance or what's being allowed as a rear yard setback. It doesn't seem to really have much of a consequence in being different just because it's a two-story structure. The parking requirement, I think that requiring two parking spaces for an individual housing unit is one of the most straightforward reasons we suffer from a housing shortage overall. I don't know that there's a request for parking reduction that I wouldn't support, especially in a neighborhood like the avenues. One of the appellants mentioned seeing this as a symptom of the deteriorating neighborhood, and I have to say I see it in precisely the opposite light, that there's a lot of building going on in this alley and in other parts of the avenues because it is a very desirable neighborhood because people want to invest in there and make good use of the space because it's R3 zoning. We allow good use of the space there in order to prevent more of our housing demand from being met in areas outside the city where more sensitive habitat, more trees are destroyed by the development. So this is what infill looks like, and this is the sort of development that we should be encouraging overall. I think that it's an unfortunate planning overall that we have a narrow alleyway. We have a narrow alley separating R1 zoning from R3 zoning, and so we're bound to find this kind of friction between the areas. Overall, I think it's a relatively small structure, although on a small alley, and it is probably more compatible with the neighborhood than it would be if it was a large apartment building that was three stories, which, as mentioned, would be the other alternative with this kind of site. I do have a lot of sympathy, I want to say, with the issue, which I think we're going to find again. Again and again, as areas like this that are desirable to live in, that are good neighborhoods and walkable neighborhoods, are going to get a lot of development, and especially in a case like this, there are in-lieu fees that are paid that go into a citywide fund, and I think the feeling in us in older neighborhoods is that that money is not being returned into our neighborhoods, it's being put elsewhere, and we don't really have a mechanism for making sure that the neighbors who are experiencing the impacts of new development are able to receive a benefit from that. I would like to see some way that the... In-lieu fees from all the accessory dwelling units and this being developed in this alley would turn into an actual improvement of the alley and less of what we see here. I don't think the intention of the photo was to show the drainage issues in the alley, but it does show that, and I know that it's an issue in that alley as well. Overall, I think the only way to meet the asks of the appellants would be to ultimately reduce the number of units that's being built here, and I think that more people deserve to live in neighborhoods like the avenue. And even when there are particular issues, we need to lean on the side of allowing more housing. I can make a motion to accept the community development director's recommendation to deny the appeal. All right. We have a motion. We have a second. Second. A motion and a second. Other comment? I just have one more quick question for the city attorney. So, although... Yes. It is preferred to give a variance for parking, we as the city council have the authority and can make a decision not to allow the variance for parking, correct? That's correct. That is correct. So, the developer could come back with a one-story with a one or two-bedroom and one parking spot and still develop this. He could have the variance for the setback. He could have the variance to have one parking instead of two and still have the site developable and developed and have it be more in line with what's in that. And we would be within our rights to do that, correct? So, Vice Mayor Reynolds, I think the last part of your question is probably better answered by the planning staff. Okay. Planning. Okay. So, for a single family structure... Okay. ...you could have a two-story. By right, they can have a two-story. So, what you could do is you could uphold the appeal, in which case not allowing the variance for a reduction of one parking spot. I don't think that bears on what they would bring back and ultimately develop there. They might have to do a change site design to provide two off-stream parking spots. It's not about the height that is what they're requesting. That's not what the variance was about. It was only about the setback. It was only about the variance. And the reduction of parking. Does that make sense? Yes. They could bring something back that has two parking spots and they could still develop the site. Right. But it could also possibly be two-story. Correct. But when they bring that back. Three, right. Or three. Correct. Okay. So, if they found room for the parking, they could do a three-story and bring that back if the setbacks were correct. Yeah. Correct. But a two-story. It depends on if they were doing a multi-family. They might need more parking. So, there's just a lot of variables. But at this point, they have a request for the variance from the one off-stream parking and the rear yard setback. What they might bring back if you guys uphold the appeal, we don't know. We don't do that here. That's getting their engineer back and thinking through what that would look like. Yeah. I can certainly sympathize with you finding that out. I mean, I've lived in the avenues almost all the entire time in various locations in the avenues that I've lived in Chico and I still live there. But I lived in a spot at one point in the avenues that had 17 windows looking in our backyard because it was R1 against R3. So, I very much understand how that is not wonderful. But yeah, it's certainly a question. You know, I think the consideration here is, you know, a developer comes back with a three-story unit, you're going to have more of an issue. But at the same time, I think we have to look at it in terms of, you know, infill development and what we're charged with doing. So, any other comments? All right. Madam Clerk, can you take the roll? Councilmember Bennett? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am going to support planning staff and recommend the denial of the appeal. Okay. And Councilmember Morgan is gone. Yeah, that's a note he had to leave because he was up. Right. He wasn't feeling well. Councilmember Tandon? I think I'm looking at overall I would have to go with the staff decision. Okay. Councilmember Van Overbeek? Yes. All right. All right. Councilmember Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? No. Mayor Coolidge? Yes. Okay. It carries 5-1 with one absence. All right. And that's a resolution of the City Council to say that you go denying an appeal and upholding the zoning administrator's approval of variance 21-0. And with that, we will take a short break. Thank you. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. It was agendized back in December, early December, it was agendized as diagonal parking. And with information that I have learned since after being educated by our excellent engineering staff at the city and learning that our 1908 vintage sewer mains need to be ripped up means that we need to literally dismantle our streets in order to replace the sewer mains. So that gives us an opportunity for the first time in 50 years to rethink, reimagine what we're gonna do with our right-of-ways, how to use our right-of-ways. We may decide we wanna put them back exactly the way they are, but before we make that decision, which we will live with for the next 50 years, I think we need to get some input from the stakeholders at DCBA, the public, working with the city staff to determine how we should reconstruct the streets after we put the new sewer lines in. And I think Ms. Sutton has a presentation on that. Excuse me. I need to say that the city attorney has advised me that I should recuse myself because I own property downtown. He thinks there may be a conflict of interest and with all respect to our very capable city attorney, I disagree and am pressing forward nevertheless. All right. And then, I know there is a staff presentation, but why wasn't it attached to the agenda? It's on screen. No, I understand that it's on the screen. I'm just wondering why we, okay. Okay, so let's go ahead with the presentation then. Good evening, Leigh Ann Sutton, Director of Public Works Engineering. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council Members. Just like, I don't think I can really, like, have a good time with all of you, have, but Council Member Ben Overbeck said, other than I can talk about some planning efforts that we have coming up, which align perfectly with, you know, revisioning the downtown streets, the right-of-way, the uses of the right-of-way space in downtown, specifically the core, but as we're looking at all this, we would like to look at the whole downtown area. So we have the pipeline replacement program, which as you know, we have the sewer rate study that was approved, and now we have money coming in for pipelines annually, and that includes some budget for paving, and, you know, as part of that project, or process of putting those pipeline projects together, we would like to come up with a design and concept for each street in the downtown area, especially the ones that have the 1908 pipelines, but I think we should look at it in a holistic way. We also have the active transportation plan underway, which we're getting a lot of feedback from the public regarding the downtown area, and we want to be able to incorporate that into any design work we do for the downtown area. And so, anything, rather than doing one project on Main or one project on Broadway, I recommend that we take a holistic view of the whole downtown area, and even beyond how that links with neighborhoods and other areas close to downtown, or even within the whole area of Chico, for example, car traffic, bike traffic, pedestrian traffic, and many other transit, many other uses that the downtown area is helpful in creating. So, I recommend that we study the best use of the right-of-way space in downtown, and that we develop alternatives and come back to starting with internal affairs. But just to touch on the 2008 project that was put together, to add diagonal parking on Main and Broadway, that project was designed at a time before the current general plan was adopted, and it did not include bike lanes. Since then, the general plan has been adopted, which has a vision for attracting heavy pedestrian traffic into downtown, and that downtown is walkable with supportive parking facilities, and new development is designed with the pedestrian and bicyclist in mind. And also that public parking in downtown will be easy to find and will facilitate pedestrian access to the central core, and that we would be slowing the speed of vehicles on the streets in downtown. So, with that, I recommend that we take a holistic view of the downtown, especially the core area, how the best use of the right-of-way come back with some alternatives, and that we coordinate this effort with the pipeline replacement program, and also with the ATP plan, so that we can leverage any grant funding that might be available for these projects. And that concludes my presentation. All right, questions? Ms. Sutton, how much of the repaving costs will be covered by the sewer funds? So, I believe that it was either slurry or rehab paving costs were included for the width of the street as part of the pipeline replacement costs. So, it wouldn't cover, like, the whole cost of all the right-of-way replacement, including the sidewalks and, you know, all the other things we deal with, but it would be a contribution towards being able to upgrade and improve the right-of-way wherever we're replacing it. All right. Council Member Wentz. Ms. Sutton, how wide are the lanes on Main and Broadway, the traffic lanes? I believe they're 14 and 15 feet. Thanks. That's correct. Yeah, I measured it. Yeah. I should have said I know they're 14 and 15 feet, but yeah. Vice Mayor. This is, it's all great information. I just want to make sure, I'm a little bit of a stickler on rules, I don't want to be a stick in the mud, but this was, like, our first time requesting to talk about this one, isn't it? And I don't remember ever getting a staff report on a time when it's first agendized and we're just, Councilman Overbeek discussed the implementation of parking, but yet we're getting a presentation from staff when we haven't directed staff to do anything? Yeah, this was information that we pulled from 2008. Okay, so it's just a reiteration of what's been happening. We're talking minutes. Okay, perfect. I just want to make sure. But it looks great, and I agree that if we are going to do any changes, I would like to have lots of input from lots of different people, especially the stakeholders down headtown, who will mostly be affected by if we do traffic calming and go to one or two lanes or no lanes or whatever the vision is. Okay, Councilmember Bennett. And I concur with Vice Mayor Reynolds. This is a a complex project. I was a part of this back in 2008 when I was on the board with the DCBA, and I remember we spent a couple years looking at this, and Alan Chamberlain came up with the walkable downtown plan, all that. So on one hand, it makes me feel a little old, and I'm looking back at this, but on the other side, I completely agree it's time to take another look at this, but we need to move very, very cautiously. Unintended consequences keeps popping up in my head. So thank you for the presentation. Thank you for the information that you prepared. It certainly was beneficial to give us a good overview. Thank you. Councilmember Taylor. You just mentioned that we have an active transportation plan of getting input from the community. Could you reconfirm how people can reach out or present their comments? Is it on our website? Yes, it is on our website. I don't have the exact website, but I can send that to you. Sure. Yeah. And we've had a couple workshops, too, where people have provided input, and we're compiling all those comments. Do we advertise it anywhere? Because this is like once in a lifetime, you know, probably we'll probably see, you know, in 100 years, we are doing it again. So probably in the next 100 years, we won't be changing anything in that downtown. So I think we should try to reach out as much as we can. And we have been trying to have that on social media and newspaper to get that input as much as possible. Yes. All right. Further questions from Council? Councilmember Winston, another question? We can wait until after public comment, for comments, if you like. I have a few questions, too. So originally, if we were just to proceed with the pipeline project, what was the timetable? You mean the pipeline project in downtown? Yes. Probably five to 10 years. to replace all the pipelines downtown. Okay. Would this expedite that? If we get some grant funding, it could. Okay. So in terms of coming up with this plan, this plan wouldn't necessarily be pushed forward immediately? Well, as part of the budget process, I was thinking what we would do is we have a CIP in place right now that's called Main and Broadway Reconfiguration. I was going to request that that get renamed to, you know, Downtown Core Right-of-Way Design or Downtown Right-of-Way Design and that we could move forward with design. Because right now we don't actually have a capital project in place to move forward with what I just spoke about, an overall vision for downtown. So that's what I was going to do as part of the budget process. Do you know how much is in that fund? It has $800,000. $800,000. Okay. All right. And I'm going to ask the city manager what he thinks, maybe after public comment, in terms of a route for this. I would just say, you know, I looked through some of this information in the 2030 downtown element, you know, keep the bulbs, the sidewalk bulbing. I think the sidewalk bulbing was a huge mistake that, you know, stopped us from having bike lanes through the downtown. I've never been a fan of it. And it puts pedestrians right on the edge of traffic, which I don't love. It wasn't the way it used to be. I'd also love to see our famous back-end parking disappear from the map forever. I can't find a single person who likes it or can do it. So anyway, it's terrible. And I think one of the worst things we've ever done in the downtown. You know, just my opinion. But okay, with no more questions, thank you. And we will proceed with public comment. Okay, we have three speakers. All right, three minutes. The first speaker is LaDonna Kanagy, followed by Nicole Nava. I'll just correct you. LaDonna Kanagy. If we massacred that, we apologize. Is it LaDonna Kanagy? Kanagy. There we go. Yeah, good pronunciation. Hi. Thanks. And wait for that clock to come up. Okay. So I turn it on, even though it's not showing. Okay. So let me restart your time. Time's wasted. Yeah. Okay, just a second. Yeah. Yeah. Debbie, can you close out the presentation? I am. That's what I'm doing. No, I'm just asking if you have the ability to. I handle it. Yeah, I do it. Awesome. There we go. All right. Now the floor is yours. Hi. Thanks for this opportunity. I wasn't clear exactly what was going to happen at this meeting tonight. There was a lot of press about voting on having diagonal parking. And I so much appreciate. I was just said because I feel like this really needs to be part of a larger plan, a larger plan for the entire downtown area. We I've been on the, I was on an ad hoc committee. That was a Chico bicycle and pedestrian advocacy group, and we've formalized it to cat tech, Chico active transportation, tactical assessment, or something. And I was, we haven't, this hasn't been on our radar. And um, Okay. Okay. Okay. So I think we're going to have to make sure that we're looking at this entire downtown area and how it connects to the rest of the surrounding neighborhood and look at it as a plan to make a more walkable, likable, livable, healthy kind of a downtown that, um, you know, studies are showing that that's, um, fosters, you know, get your downtown businesses, um, makes it, um, a more pleasant environment. And so there's, um, since 2007, I think you said in this plan. 2008, we've had a lot of changes in the transportation, um, design of how we're creating spaces. And so I really would like to see this part of it. Um, I teach at Chico state and I have a couple of classes that have done projects in collaboration with the city, um, um, with Wyatt and with the city, we did a couple of tactical urbanism projects where we made temporary street treatments. It's a great way to try something out before you do it and put a bunch of money into it and see how it works. Um, looking at doing third and fourth street. Having a nice way to, to bike to the park. I think a gateway to bidwell park from downtown would be fantastic and should be considered as part of the whole, you know, holistic plan of looking at downtown and how it connects to the, um, surrounding neighborhoods. So I, I appreciate the, um, discussion that was, that was, um, brought, um, um, by, uh, staff. And I just wanted to, you know, make sure that we're really looking at, um, more than just parking. Thank you very much. So Nicole Nava followed by Travis Thornberry. No gums involved. All right. So, um, last time on this topic, I brought up that it would have been good to have like a big picture. So I'm kind of happy that seems to be where we're going so that the citizens can kind of follow the bouncing ball with this. I do have a couple of comments on the topic of downtown. One of which. Which would be, um, consideration of, um, staff. Like, so I get a lot of times these are outside vendors that come in to do the work. Um, but a lot of times my understanding is it involves cross coordination with like public work staff who are exceedingly impacted right now because of other issues like having to do, uh, homeless encampment cleanups and, uh, sidewalk repairs, other things. And so I would just say, um, I would love to know like sideways impacts to city staff time and resources being used on that. Um, the other thing is I absolutely totally concur with the hate the back end parking. Um, that I would love to see go to. I think a lot of us would. I literally almost got hit head on, um, myself heading down Broadway, um, right along by the city Plaza and someone did not know what they were doing and literally was going the wrong way to pull in. It was insane. So that's not good. Um, diagonal parking would probably bring us the more spaces we're looking for. The only thing I would say is, is there a way when they look at the plan to factor in the larger cars that tend to be a part of life these days to some people have small, some have the big pickups. Um, I was recently over by where, um, cafe Coda is, and they have, um, diagonal parking on the block nearby. And there was a pickup and it was pulled nose in as far as it can go. It was protruding so much that I had to go partway in the other lane. So we need to think, about things like that because then I'm hearing that there's a mandate. If you're redoing all this, you have to have the bike lanes, which I'm not opposed to by a love bikes. Um, but that could be problematic when factoring these in, um, delivery hours I'm understanding would be in the morning, but there's a lot of things to consider with this. And so, um, some of those other things, um, are good to consider. Another thing that concerns me a little bit was the funding piece. And if there's leftovers, I just want to really stress that it would be great. That we don't try to scoop from the sales tax measure funding because all of the Chico wins would like to have the benefit of the roads getting redone. That was really a big push. And so if we all of a sudden start sliding and there's a differential and we pull from that downtown gets a lot of attention and I get it. It's the crown and jewel and all that east Avenue gets redone because they have big capital funds and other grants that come in. And I worry that the rest of Chico won't get the TLT. That, you know, they've been looking for for a long time. I'll use the last time in seconds to say thank you so much to public works and their staff. We, they have been working their fannies off all over Chico and done a lot of the sidewalk work lately. Thank you. Thank you. Our final speakers, Travis Thornberry. So I just like to say that I really appreciate the comments made from in the presentation. I thought those were really thoughtful in terms of having a holistic view of what downtown looks like. I do think with respect diagonal parking is might be surface level and we should probably start looking at things like what was said before like in the future. We're not going to be able to do this for another hundred or fifty hundred two hundred years. So I think it's really important to have that in mind. It's really important that we adapt now and start changing things. So that more more well-equipped for the future. I really hope that downtown starts, whether whatever happens more traffic calming is needed. It makes it really unpleasant when cars are going by really quickly and it makes, you know, the sort of ambience feel really hectic in terms of the speed of the cars, and how much, how many cars are going through downtown. I'd just like to say I've been to both active transportation meetings, and they are fantastic, and I think everybody should go to them. If you're here, you should go to them if they have another one. But they're really insightful and thoughtful in terms of transforming Chico into a more mixed-use, better place. So I'd just like to say that that's very appreciated, especially for people like me who ride their bikes all the time. I would also like to comment that it seems like diagonal parking kind of interferes with bike lanes, if that is of importance to you. But regardless of what happens, I think that the capacity... and the traffic calming that the diagonal lanes give is probably well-needed. So, yeah, just thank you so much for your consideration. Thank you. He was our final speaker. All right. Thank you, everybody. Okay, I'm going to ask our city manager here, because he has a wealth of expertise, especially back on his time on the council. Do you have a suggested route that you might think this whole thing should go, that would make it easy for your staff? Yeah, and that would be the recommendation that was on the last slide. Okay. We're handed off to engineering to come up with some right-of-way design alternatives for downtown, not just Main and Broadway, but all of the downtown core. And that's going to be some different... come back with some different options that balance in different ways, bike lanes, travel lanes, maximizing parking. We hear from some, including this council, seven or eight months ago about widening sidewalks, which takes up more right-of-way. So some different concepts that the public, DCBA, you all can comment on before we cement any particular direction or put it in asphalt, whatever material we're using. Do you think that that should go through? Is there a very important coming back to council from staff recommendation or straight to council? Well, it's up to you all. I think it could go either way. I suspect that you could probably... It's up to you. I suspect there's a high enough level of interest where you might just want to bring it back to council. Okay. All right. So further comments? Yeah. I think we need to have a mechanism, a mechanism to incorporate the input from the DCBA and the public. And we could do it at the council, but I think it'll be a time suck because there'll be a lot of people that show up and want to talk about it. But in internal affairs, it would be a good creative forum so that we could integrate those views and then working with staff, come to the council with something more concise. But whatever the wishes of the council are. Well, keep in mind, a typical progression would be some public vetting of some concepts, you know, to get some initial feedback. So that would usually be the progression because very frequently the public has good input. Yeah. Okay. So by handing it off to engineering, they would do that public comment. Yeah. All right. You know, including working with groups like DCBA. And any other, there will be all manner of downtown businesses that will be very interested in what the downtown landscape looks like. So I'm sorry, Mr. Sorenson, you're saying you prefer to not use, have this go through internal affairs and do direct? No, you could do any path you want. But all I'm saying is typically those kinds of plans, those conceptual plans would see daylight for public feedback before they'd come back to council. Right. Right. Right. Right. Like they're in a vacuum. And that's the first time the public ever gets a chance to see them. And it may be before council several times. True. So I don't feel like. Oh, true. And particularly. Three o'clock on a Monday. I know. I mean, it's kind of tough for some people. And particularly because initially it'll be some rough concepts that will have to get refined. All right. Further calls? Council Member Winslow. Yeah. I was thinking about Council Member Bennett's comment. That we should move cautiously and how much I really agree with that sentiment. And that seems to be the direction of the recommendation that we're looking at creating a large plan, looking at the whole downtown streetscape. And that would happen very gradually, talking about five to ten years. And then I'm thinking of if I can indulge you in just like a little circulation history here that this current design we have with the three lanes, 14 to 15 feet, goes back to 1950. So the time when we were reengineering downtown to accommodate a lot of vehicle traffic. At the same time, we're also demolishing some of the largest buildings downtown for parking lots. And in the time since we've had this configuration, we've had the freeway be built. We built the Pine and Cypress couplet and making another arterial road between those going the same direction. We have Highway 32 there. And just recently Caltrans decided to spend $32 million resurfacing Highway 32 and decided that there's no room for Roswell. bike lanes on Walnut Street, in spite of the high density and the usage and the amount of people that walk and bike in that area. And I don't think anybody would propose the current configuration that we have again. I think it would be insane to put this scale of traffic flow infrastructure in the middle of our downtown where we want to emphasize people walking, being able to get around, go into shops. And so when it comes to moving cautiously, I think we should consider that we have, I think, a really bad design for our downtown currently. I think it does negatively impact the businesses there and the environment for pedestrians. Highway 32 and 8th and 9th Street going through downtown and merging with Main and Broadway creates a sort of monstrous kind of traffic situation, not just for the drivers, but for people outside. The junction there used to be one of the hottest commercial districts in Chico, and it is still an area of urban decay and blight and vacancies. And because of Highway 32, we can't really do anything about. We can for the rest of downtown. And I think it would be beneficial for us to move in some direction towards making it more walkable and safer and more comfortable downtown. When looking at streetscape redesigns, I see a lot of cities implementing these, like any city worth its salt would not be maintaining a highway going through the downtown at this point in human history. And the strategy that used is doing something that's inexpensive and temporary and more experimental. Once you see how that works or you learn from the design, you implement something that's more permanent, spend more money into actually cementing it or putting in asphalt. And I think that we can try some of these things, just like in Ms. Kinege's class, they have installed temporary changes in the streetscape and then have been able to learn from it. And they actually have reports on those things, including making protected bike lanes on 3rd and 4th Street that we can learn from and we can experiment more with. That's all to say. I would be very much open and I might be the odd one out and I would hate to be the odd one out, but that in moving forward more with more certainty towards having a Main Street and Broadway redesign that can be temporary, it doesn't need to be the most expensive or the most intensive way of doing it, but going that direction. As a secondary thing with this recommendation here, the first line says develop right of way design alternatives for downtown corridor balancing needs for traffic flow, traffic calming, parking, sidewalk uses and bike lanes. And as much as I'm not sure if that's the right way to go, I'm not sure if that's the right way to go. But I have to say, with all of the things I love, balance, I would really like to see traffic flow put very deliberately beneath traffic calming and saying that we're going to prioritize safety and comfort for people outside downtown over the speed of vehicles moving through downtown, even if we can anticipate some adverse impacts to the traffic flow. I think that that's a priority that we ought to have for downtown, and I think that that is what it says in our downtown element. Thanks. All right. Any other comments? Any more? Okay. I feel I like the city manager's recommendation to follow the recommendation, too. Thank you. I will say that we don't always have our city manager weigh in as much as I think they should, and that's not a comment on Mr. Sorensen because he's new here. We'll still consider you new. But actually, if you look through some of our bios, it says the city manager can participate quite a bit in our discussions, and I think that's welcome, and that knowledge is, too. So that being said, I'll make a motion for the recommendation, and I'll let the city clerk read that. That would be to develop the right-of-way design alternatives for downtown core balancing needs for traffic flow, traffic calming, parking, sidewalk uses, and bike lanes. And coordinate this effort along with the pipeline replacement program to leverage sewer funding, and coordinate this effort with an ATP plan to leverage grant funding. I'll second. Can I propose a friendly amendment? I figured you would. Yeah? In the first recommendation there, that we emphasize that traffic calming be given priority over traffic flow in the proposals. I'm fine with that. But not at the, you know, not at sacrificing flow. But I think they could be... Maintaining balance. Yeah, maintaining balance. Maintaining balance, prioritizing traffic calming. Yeah, that's right. Traffic flow or safety over speed. Yes. Council Member Tannen, are you okay with that amendment? Yes. All right. Madam Clerk, can you take the role? So what was the friendly amendment ended up being? So just that traffic flow and traffic calming would be looked at equally. Or wait, or... Well, I said prioritize traffic calming over traffic flow. You have to maintain balance. Is that... Yeah. There we go. I'm uncomfortable with that. I agree... No? Okay. I agree with the sentiment. But I think we should get public input and input from DCBA before we jump to conclusions. I agree with you. But I think it's premature for us to start dictating the parameters before we get input. And so I have... I have a substitute motion. And my substitute motion is that I would like to refer item 5.1 to internal affairs to solicit public input from citizens, the DCBA, and work with the staff to formulate options for downtown core right-of-way design. All right. So we have a substitute motion. Do we have a second? All right. No substitute motion. Second. So the substitute motion dies. So we have the original motion with the friendly amendment. And I don't know how much that's going to make a difference, the friendly amendment in terms of the overall, you know, after we discuss all this. Obviously, it's got to come back to us when we have to do it. I don't mind in terms of concept, looking at both things in that respect and putting calming over overflow. I think everybody agreed that calming traffic through the downtown is important. All right. Further discussion? Madam Clerk? I think it's a little early to start putting parameters on this. Okay. I think we just need to get started. Let's just move forward cautiously and not place any restrictions on this. We're just beginning this process. There'll be plenty of time to start talking about other considerations. All right. Well, we do have the motion with the friendly amendment accepted. So why don't we go ahead and get the vote on that. We'll move from there. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Morgan is absent. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck? Yes. Councilmember Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. All right. Okay. Moving on to item 5.2, amendments to the City of Chico budget appendix B1 and B3. And I believe we have our direction. Director of Human Resources and Risk Management, Chelsea Phoebus. Welcome. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and members of the Council. Before you for approval tonight are two items that amend the city's budget appendices. The first item is a request for an additional human resources technician position that will be dedicated to support risk management. Risk management functions include managing general liability, vehicle, drone, cyber, and employment liability coverage, processing liability claims against the city with multiple outside vendors, processing all workers' compensation claims, verification of and follow-up on evidence of insurance, and proactive loss prevention activities in all of these areas. Risk management currently has no administrative support personnel and the structure of the Human Resources and Risk Management Department is such that none of the current support personnel can take on any additional duties to assist on the risk. The total ongoing cost of adding this position would be approximately $80,000 per year. The second item is an administrative cleanup item. Approving this request would add the already approved assistant park manager to the approved employee pay schedule, Appendix B1. There's no change to the budget at this, as this item and its cost were approved in the 2022-2023 budget. Staff recommends approval for, of amendments to the pending budget appendices B1 and B3. And I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Questions? All right. Seeing none, thank you very much. Public comment? All right, no public comment. Entertain a motion. Move to approve. Second. I have a motion from Vice Mayor Rounds, a second from Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk, when you're ready. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Morgan is absent. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. All right, 5.3, review of Board and Commission and by annual recruitment update. And we have a report from our very own wonderful city clerk, Pepper Pressman. Come on down and get the, I'll time you. That's great. Just don't hit the bong. Bong. Don't bong me. All right. All right. Well. So, Mayor Coolidge and Council, thank you very much for this opportunity. It's not often that I actually get out of that chair to come over here. I think it's the first time to make a presentation. So, what we're going to do today is quickly go through ideas and then we'll talk about the board and commission. So, I know I gave you a comprehensive staff report. So, I don't want to go over all the pages. But I want to talk about why we felt at this time that an analysis would be due or was timely. And in 2006, the council directed me as your, as a council appointed person for all boards and commission activities, reviews, all the training, everything falls under your city clerk's position. So, I've spent a lot of years. I've been here 23 years. And we've done a lot of different things with the board. We've done a lot of different things with boards and commissions. And so, in 2006, the council asked me to do a review. And at that time, it was comprehensive. Finance department provided us with all fully loaded rates for staff members. We got accurate numbers for the number of meetings that were held as well as all of the staff who were present. And that study revealed that for seven commissions at that time and four council committees, we actually was, the council was investing $750,000 in the board and the board was investing $500,000 a year to support those boards and commissions. So, based on those recommendations, we looked at what are they doing, why are they doing it, and is there a better way or can we streamline it so that we can develop efficiencies? So, in 2006, they did end up deciding to disband the parking place commission as well as two of the council committees. And then in 2008, they disbanded human resources based on that same study. They waited a couple of weeks. They waited a couple of years to do it. And then in 2015, unfortunately, because of the layoffs that occurred with the city with the deficit that we were faced with, the council also changed the arts commission from monthly meetings to quarterly. And then in 2019, just most recently, they added a new commission, and that's the climate action commission. So, what we're going to talk about tonight is we're going to talk a little bit about the advisory bodies, the structure and the roles and their responsibilities. And, of course, I did give you a lot of meeting information, how long meetings lasted, the number of cancellations, the number of items that were discussed, and the number of staff who were present. In addition, I'm hoping to get some direction from council regarding some streamlining efforts and possible changes that will make us work better, smarter, and faster, hopefully. Recruitment and trends, I think it's important to know that we're going to talk about our biannual recruitment and the fact that we just went through biannual recruitment. And you'll see I have some information related to the number of recruitments and how many times we have to re-recruit and what does that actually mean. So, the city of Chico does have currently six bodies, advisory bodies, and it's the airport commission, that's a five-member board, the architectural review and historic preservation board. And that is a five-member board as well. Arts commission has seven members. And bidwell park and playground commission has seven. Climate action and planning commission also all have seven. I just put down here just to remind you that advisory bodies come in different forms and functions. And we do have council committees and those are currently the finance committee and internal affairs. So, I've been asked recently, so how are advisory bodies created? How are the numbers determined in terms of membership? And it really depends on council action. And they can be created by charter. That requires a vote of the people. And they can also be created by ordinances and resolutions. But it really is at the council direction that those are created. So, history, historically we've had a lot of different commissions and you can see why perhaps some of them have gone away. Sorry for the typo on library commission. But, you know, commissions and boards and committees and ad hocs are all based on the current needs of the council and the current needs and the direction of your priorities, where we're heading and community needs. So, at one point the library did belong and was our responsibility at the city before it went over to the county. And so we had a library commission. Obviously civil defense and disaster council, I couldn't find a lot of information on that. And that was a lot of information that we had to go through. And we had a lot earlier. We had a human relations commission, parking place commission, personnel board. And those are just a few that more than likely fulfilled their mission. And that they were, you know, and we can celebrate that. It was because the needs changed in our community. So what guides the work of the commissions and why? And so really want to talk about how does the work get done and how does it get delegated to the commissions? And how do they have authority on their own to create their own items? So really the council is the elected body. You're elected by the citizens. They put you up there. And then you appoint your commission members. And so council, based on your priorities, based on the budget needs, based on the current status of certain projects, you will change your priorities and you will memorialize that in the adoption of your budget. And then staff goes out and does all the work. So council referrals happen. There may be a need. You might want the parks commission to take up a matter. We recently did that with the park rules. Possible recommendations from that body. And it came from the council. Staff initiates items. You have a professional staff that actually knows when things change at the state level, laws that have to be implemented, as well as things that need commission review prior to getting to council. So staff will initiate items. We also have applicable laws. Those are all tied to state law in various components. And we also have our own internal policies that help guide everything that we do. So one of those policies is AP&P 10-1, which governs all the advisory bodies. And the reason I highlighted item number 10, which is the final code of conduct, it's really talking about advisory bodies and perhaps what they shouldn't be involved in. And that's in the day-to-day administration or operations. And that the commissioners or board members do not have the authority to direct staff's work. And the reason I bring this up is because we always need to keep that as a constant to remember what is the role of our commissions and bringing it back to the council to see do you want staff to switch directions and work on something else. And I believe that that is the role of our commissioners. And that authority comes from the council. So it also talks about budgetary option or items are operational and not part of the responsibilities of a board or commission member. And that is really, really clear. That document is a guiding document for everything that staff does, everything that we move forward on, and what the work of the body of whether it's the park commission or the ARHPB, that's what that is for. So the meetings. So when you have a meeting. When you have one meeting. I think that some people think that, well, you just get to the meeting, yes, you get a staff report. But there's hours and hours of staff research that goes into perhaps one staff report. In addition, it may require legal review. So it's not just public works staff working with the parks commission. It may need legal review. It may need to be talked about with the city manager in order to see how it falls in line with the budget proposals and those kinds of things. So legal review is critical to that process. Then you have to have an agenda. We all are governed. Every single board and commission and all of our committees are governed by the Brown Act. And it's important because it ensures the public participation at every single meeting when all items are being considered. We then have meetings in here. We have to turn on the air or turn on the heat. And sometimes you think we didn't do either. And we also for some bodies have meetings. We have videotaping and or streaming live and public access. So those are all components that go into creating just one meeting. And then after the meetings, that's when our real work begins. We have staff follow-up. We have implementation of the action. We also have commissioner requests that come up. And then whether or not and how deep we delve into those and how do we present that back to the body. We'll talk a little bit more about commissioner requests in a little bit. Again, some of the stuff may need to still after a council meeting or a commission meeting may have to go back to legal for additional review. Then we have minutes. That's the legislative history. It's required by law. And trust me, I do a lot of minutes. And we spend hours doing minutes. But it's a critical part of our process. And then for commissions, there's especially for our planning division, ARHPB, the zoning administration, we have all of those things. as of tonight we had a hearing. But those types of bodies which are quasi-judicial can have appeals and they can be appealed to the council. So there's always additional work that goes into that. So the appeal, the item was heard at a commission and then it was appealed to council. And so that's the staff members who participate in that process have to write two different staff reports and analyze the appeal and be able to present that to the council. So who's responsible for your boards and commissions? So I just, I was trying to get brownie points from Eric and Brendan, but I really think it's important to talk about this because when I started delving into it, I realized you have three departments that are responsible for all your advisory bodies. And I want to talk a little bit about Director Gustafson. And he has not only the airport commission, but he has the Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. And on top of that, in blue, you see Vina GSA and Butte Choice Energy Authority. He's also, and his staff are participating in those meetings, coordinating them. Some are held here in this building. Some are held jointly with the county, but he still has all of these responsibilities. So he has his regular work to do every single day. And then he has his airport commission. It meets quarterly. You have your Bidwell Park and Playground Commission. It can meet. It can meet monthly. And then you have Vina GSA. And I will tell you that in 2022, Vina GSA met 26 times. So you talk about having a workload, your staff is definitely producing a whole lot of stuff that is critical to our community. So community development, even when looking at that, Director Veague has the planning commission, the climate action commission, the planning commission, meets up to two times a month, as well as the climate action commission can meet once. Architectural review and historic preservation board, that actually can meet twice a month. And then you have zoning administrator meetings. And I believe that they met eight times in 2022. And oftentimes have to have three to four staff members there, as well as map advisory committee. I think they met more than that. And those meetings all take, a lot of time. So for me, I volunteered in 2015 because the council had moved to, they wanted to retain the arts commission. Unfortunately, during the layoffs, we lost our arts project coordinator position. And so the council was looking, grappling with, do we go with a regional approach? What do we do? We did all that review. And then council decided to keep the arts commission to amend the membership requirement. And we have all of our departments still was at seven members, but it would meet four times a year. I volunteered at that time because that position, our project coordinator always reported to the city council, excuse me, the city manager's office. So, in regards to that, because they were meeting quarterly, I felt like I could help get it through maybe, you know, as much as I could, I love our, you all know that when you come to my office, um, and felt that I could handle that. But I want you to know that on top of that, of what I do for the Arts Commission, which meets quarterly and sometimes we have special meetings. And they are very diligent about making sure that we don't have to have a lot of special meetings. And it's been phenomenal working with them. I have city council responsibilities. And in 2022, you met 22 times for regular meetings and you had 11 special meetings. Finance committee met seven times and internal affairs met four times. So when you total all of the meetings, even if you do it without the zoning administrator, map advisory, VINA GSA, there were 92 meetings held in 2022 in some capacity by your staff that is currently sitting here doing all of the other things that they do. I just feel like when I look at what both community development and public works O&M has to do, you can see there's an extensive workload in just meetings and staff reports. So I'd like to move on to recruitment. And I know that I have shown you in 2002, we had one recruitment. It cost about $1,000. We had seven boards and commissions at that time, and I received 95 applicants for 21 seats. Used to have a ton of applicants. 2016, fast forward, I spent about close to $1,700. We did one recruitment with one extension for five advisory bodies, and we received 40 applications for 17 seats. In 2018, we did, again, two recruitments. We did the original 30-day and then an extended, probably another 30 days. That's typically what we do. For five advisory bodies, we received 24 applicants for 11 seats. And in 2018, we received 2020, we did four recruitments. It cost us $10,000. We had six advisory bodies, and we received, after the fourth final recruitment, we received and we had a total of 59 applicants. In 2022, I've spent almost $4,000. I did one recruitment of 30 days. Actually, we extended it an extra two weeks because it fell over the holidays. And so it ended on January 2nd. That is for six advisory bodies, and we received 38 applicants. Five of those applicants applied for more than one board. So if they're selected for one board, you may not have enough applicants to consider for your other bodies. And we do have 22 seats open. I will tell you that you currently have 38 board or commission members. 38 of us. And their terms are all staggered. They're four-year terms. We oftentimes have vacancies. A lot of the things that we're going to see for this 2022 recruitment represents a vacancy. And those vacancies typically come with two years left on the term. So for airport, we needed three spots to be filled, and we only received three applicants. I will tell you, in the past, past practice always has been council has wanted us to go back out for more recruitment. In order to have more applicants so that you have a choice. It's just been standard practice. ARHPB, we have three positions open, but we have one vacancy, and we have four applicants. I will tell you that one of those applicants applied for another board. So if that person is selected for the planning commission, then you don't have enough applicants to choose from for your ARHPB. Arts commission. We need three applicants. We need three seats filled and one vacancy, which has a remainder of two years. And we received 10 applications. So you're good to go there. On Bidwell Park and Playground commission, we need three seats to be filled, and we had seven applicants. On Climate Action commission, we need three plus one possible vacancy. We have some attendance issues, and the policy is that if you miss two or more, you're not going to be able to apply. So we have meetings in a row, then we need to address that. So it could be that we have four seats, but we only have five applicants. And so for planning, we need three members, and we have nine applicants. And I will tell you that some of them also applied for other boards. So again, if they move around, you may not have as many applicants for consideration. So a quick question. So down at the bottom, that's cumulative applicants. That's not applicant. So for example, airport. One. One of those could be an applicant for planning and get selected, and then we'd only have two available, correct? Right. And I'm sure there's some situation that happens. Right. So we have crossover, and it just depends on what you ultimately do. Once you appoint, then we say, okay, that person's taken out of the mix for your other boards and commissions. Based on just these numbers, I believe that it would behoove the council to actually direct me to go back out to get more applicants. I think that for the Climate Action commission, it's going to be a little bit more. I think that for the Climate Action commission, we definitely need to look at that because I think we have four. We will have four positions, and then we have only five applicants. Again, with airport and ARHPB, it's up to the council, and I'll take whatever direction that you give me, but I'm hoping that you'll be able to help me with that. So possible efficiencies. You know, when we look at this, obviously, I want to talk a little bit about commissioner request. I think that I provided all that information. In the summaries for each board, I think Bidwell Park and Playground had maybe nine commissioner requests that were agendized, and some of those included even talking about the Measure H funds and how they could be used for parks, and that's a budgetary item, and it really is under your purview for that type of a discussion. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. We could talk about commissioner requests. I think that what's interesting is that the policy for council members is that you have to get other council members and the body, a majority of the council, has to approve an item being agendized, yet our commissions can do that at any meeting and ask for it, and if they vote on it, the commission can do that, but it never comes back to council to decide whether or not you want staff taking up those matters. I think it's important when we're looking. I think it's important when we're looking at streamlining and developing efficiencies that you look at the bandwidth of your staff, especially in community development and especially in public works, when we have all these other meetings that we're responsible for, as well as all of our additional daily work that we do. So do you want to talk about commissioner requests and perhaps creating a different way? We can memorialize that in a book. We can do that in a policy. Frequency of meetings. Right now we have airport commission. They're quarterly per year. They might require a special meeting every now and then. I know that Eric is always willing to do that if it's needed, and he makes that decision. I do the same thing with the art commission. They meet quarterly, and if we need to have a meeting to review something, we do that, and we make sure that that happens. Bidwell Park and Playground meets monthly. They had some meetings. Several cancellations in 2022. Climate Action Commission actually had one cancellation in 2022, and the Planning Commission, it varies because Planning Commission and ARHPB is actually driven solely by development, and they meet when needed. They do not ever agendize commissioner requests. So that is just a very smooth running process. I think that's a great point. We have a great group of advisory bodies. So those were some possible efficiencies. I think in terms of Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, as well as the Climate Action Commission, I was hoping that perhaps the Council would at least allow me to pursue with legal to see if we could amend our code to allow for them to meet when needed. That would allow staff to drive those topics when they're needed. If you look at the Climate Action Commission, we have a list of all of our mission information that I included in the packet. Some of those requests were because we need, you know, we want to agendize presentations and then they would ask even departments to come in and make presentations. And I know staff is always willing to do that, but is that what needs to be done? Is there another reporting mechanism? And so I think that just being allowed to maybe work with our city attorney to look at ways to change the frequency of meetings. We always have to do a notice of cancellation. So it would be easier if we just agendized items when they're needed. So Bidwell Park and Playground, I know that they did have three cancellations. And I know that their body does approve some permits for the city plaza, different races in the park and that kind of thing. Staff could bring that to them. And I think that you would develop an efficiency there. Again, this is just, I'm throwing out thoughts because I think that anytime we get the opportunity to evaluate what we're doing and perhaps redefine something so that we're more efficient, I think that's a good use of taxpayers' dollars. But it all has to be fitting within the vision of the council and your priorities. So that's what I was thinking about. One thing that I do want to say is that none of this happens without the commissioners. They are volunteers and they dedicate their time. They rarely get a thank you. They take time away from their families, just like the council does, just like all of us do, to be here, to be at meetings and to participate and to make a difference. So believe me, this is nothing about the commissioners or the board members. It's about making sure that we protect the city. What are the priorities and how do we fulfill our commitments to this community? So any questions or comments? Anyone? Go ahead. Ms. Preston, thank you. That was a great presentation. So four of the committees, Arts, Bidwell Park, Climate Action Planning, have seven members. Is there any reason that the joint summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit summit in terms of why did council decide to go with seven. But I will say that on, like, for instance, ARHPB, which is Architectural Review Historic Preservation, when we added that historical preservation component, that there are, there's criteria for people, they have to meet the criteria in order to apply. You can have two members at large, but you have to have three that are heavily, whether they're into being an architect or they have to have a professional background in order to do design reviews. And Brendan, please jump in if you need to correct anything. So I think that that's a five-member board, and I still struggle. You look at that, and I don't have, you know, I don't have very many applicants. So I think that it was just based on what council felt was the need at the time, and the Arts Commission was created 20-plus years ago, long before I arrived. And they've kept it at that. But, you know, Airport Commission has worked fine with five members and quarterly meetings. So it just, it's up to the council what you think you need. And the Arts Commission has one rep for each council member, too. Well, so in the past, back years before I arrived, commissioners were selected literally with their names being drawn out of a hat. I'm not kidding. And so then the council decided, they did the interviews, but then just in order to pick, each council member got to draw a name out. Over the years, council felt there was value in actually making individual nominations. Council members individually do not have the right to appoint someone. It takes the whole body. So what we do is we bring in your applicants, you review them, and you nominate someone if you are up for nomination. So the positions are, they're staggered. When four council members get elected, four members on the Arts, Climate Action, and Planning Commission, and Bidwell Park and Playground are up as well. And those incoming council members get to select someone or nominate someone, and then the full body votes to whether or not they agree with it. We have had, in the past, councils not allowing someone to be appointed. So again, it is a nomination by the individual council members. That, for example, that procedure actually has bounced back and forth over the years, but it was incredibly painful when we went through voting rounds and your applicants are sitting out there and the council cannot, the votes are not there to move a person forward. It literally took hours. And so the council, this new process of having individual nominations and then the full body votes on it has made it, more streamlined and much more efficient and less painful for our applicants. So, I mean, it's, granted, if you went to five members on every single board and commission, you guys would vote on that and maybe we would, out of 18, if we had 18 applications for Bidwell Park and Playground Commission, all of you would get to nominate one person to move forward. And then you would collectively vote. I mean, I can see that happening. That's actually how the process was before. But it would just depend on what the pleasure of the council is. If you feel like five is better, that's something that you could give us direction and we would look at. Yeah. Council Member, I don't know, Rebecca, if I may. So part of the reason why, at least because I was part of the group that made that change back, so it kind of bounced back and forth. We had the council as a whole and make the appointments and then it bounced back to individuals, the individual council members making the appointments. And part of the reason why I went towards individual council members making the appointments is because the body as a whole, if it was conservative, if it was liberal, would end up just completely appointing whoever was on their side. And so you would end up with seven of leaning a particular political direction even though your body was four to three. So I thought it was more fair in my view. And certainly at the time people disagreed with this, that you would have it mimic the makeup of the council. So it was instead four to three. So those commissions and committees ended up having better discussions. Also, when you individually appoint and a person is tied to you, there's some ultimate responsibility from you to that individual. So for example, if my planning commissioner is completely out of control, I can just say, I'll ask the council to remove my planning commissioner. So whereas in the past, if a planning commissioner was completely out of control, there was no one they were tied to. So no one would do that moving forward. So and certainly there's an argument on the other side of that issue too, which was, you know, we should appoint them as a whole body and, you know, we'd get a larger number of people. Well, my experience with being on lots of boards and is that the, the board is not, you know, the board is not, you know, the larger the number of people on the board, the less gets done. And so I get those issues, but it is people that absorb staff time and if we're trying to be more efficient, and I think we should, I'm just suggesting that five would be more efficient than seven and certainly ease the recruitment problem. And then do we have any other additional questions? Clerk Krenz? I just need a question. In case there's a motion, I need to get that. Yeah. Well, thank you. We'll have, we have to do speakers too, so. Yeah. Council Member Wenzel. You can ask a question from over there, wherever you want. If we were to open up the recruitment process again, is you feel like there's one option of putting in another, you know, some thousands of dollars or can we do less expensive recruitment processes like doing targeted outreach for Climate Action Commission? I'm thinking groups under the university that might have an interest in submitting applications if they were just reached out to individually knowing that there's not a, you know, a wide recruitment process involving ads in the newspaper and all. Well, I definitely think if Council has suggestions on who to reach out to and have contact, I'm happy to always include that. You know, on the four recruitments that occurred in 2020, it kept coming back and Council kept saying, please continue to do those recruitments. So that's why it ended up being $10,000, and that was equivalent to about 14 ads. So, thank you all. So definitely, in the past, we've contacted service organizations and, you know, hoping that perhaps people would get the word out. But we're definitely open to that, and that would be a great strategy if we did go back out to recruit for this existing process. All right. Further questions? Council Member Bennett. So my observation from what you have shared with us, and thank you very much for the presentation. It was great. Is that there is a degree of self-initiated meeting agenda items. I'm reading into that a little bit. That perhaps needs to be looked at differently, and I'm going to suggest better controls. And... And better a handle on it such that it is not a self-initiated, we're going to have another meeting next month, and this is what we're going to discuss, whether it's necessary or not. And that's my big concern is it may not be necessary, but it's something that we want to do or I want to do. Somebody brings their own agenda to the meeting. So that's one observation I have. And then the second one, we have a major talent in this room who... Who has been on boards and commissions, has been sitting... Has sat up here, has been mayor. So I'm interested, and I don't want to put you on the spot, sir, but I'm interested in hearing from you what you think. Because you've lived this for years. Now you're in charge of this, sort of. Well, I agree with Debbie's point that I think what... You know, to Council Member Van Overbeck's point... More about... Bodies does require a little bit more time. But what requires even more time and energy is more meetings and more agenda items. So I thought the streamlining ideas were good ones. And your point about, for lack of a better term, limiting and controlling to what does go on the agenda for boards and commissions to those things that are necessary. Of course, then we get into necessary and whose eyes. All right. All right. Advice, Mayor Altsman. So to kind of summarize it, Dan, it sounds like, Ms. Preston, what you're looking for is kind of direction on three different ones that I noted was the process of commission requests and having you relook at that. And making sure that commissioners aren't agendizing things just to agendize things to take up time. The frequency of the meetings. I would definitely like to look at that. I would like to have staff coming... Calling meetings. When staff needs something done or when the state of California says you have to update this or you have to do that. So I'm all about... It seems like every day we get a cancellation in our email about a different board meeting being canceled. So I think you can look at that frequency. And then it looks like maybe we have enough applicants for art and planning, but definitely not enough for the others. So I think we need to consider going out for another recruitment. So I think those were the three. And then I think that's the main things that you were looking for direction on. And so if we go out for another recruitment and then maybe you can work with Vence to find out what's legal. I'm definitely not looking to go down to five members. I lost my appointment last time when I was elected. And I'd like to actually have my appointment this time. So I'm fine with the seven members on each board. I think having more people and less meetings would be a better way to get that efficiency. And I can turn that into a... I can turn that into a motion if you'd like, but that's what I'm going to do. Not yet. Public comment. Oh. I have one more comment, sir. Is that all right? And then we'll get to public comment. Okay. Go ahead. I'll wait. Okay. That's fine. How many speakers? I believe we have two. All right. Monica McDaniel, followed by Erin Wade. All right. Hello, Council, again. Thank you so much for taking this up. And I really have to... I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the City Clerk's Office, who does oversee the Art Commission meetings. We did go from monthly meetings to quarterly meetings, but we have continued to attract a robust group of volunteers. One thing that probably would help us, and to speak to Councillor Bennett's concern, is to possibly have work plan items that are approved and actually initiated by Council. In the Art Commission, for instance, people were emailing the City Clerk's Office, that their public artwork was getting defaced and vandalized. What are you going to do about it? And so we discussed it at the Commission meeting, well, maybe we could do this, and maybe we can do that, and how are we going to solve this problem? But none of that is codified by Council. So the Commission, prior to when we still had our City Staff representative, we had 10 to 15 work plan items that we would work on in monthly meetings. Now that we've streamlined the process to go to quarterly meetings, it would be helpful to have a plan item that would be approved by Council, and it would be great if we had maybe five work plan items. That way we can stay focused. Some of the things that the City Clerk has pointed out that the Commission has been working on, for instance, Commissioner Nava suggested doing decorative art wraps on some of the City boxes. And we've been talking to him about it for about a year, but we can't really get any traction on it because we don't have that collaboration with Council. So we have a robust group of volunteers. We want to do the work for you, but we want to do the work that you want us to do for you, especially as we reflect your appointments. We serve at your pleasure, and we want to know what it is that you want us to work on. So that is the one thing that I just wanted to add to the conversation, is that this might be a way to help City Staff get more work done if we as Commissioners know what we're doing. Okay, thank you. So Erin Wade is our next speaker. And I have one minute. Oh, no, you have three. Okay. Hi, I'm Erin Wade. I am a board member at 1078 Gallery, and I just want to say a few words in support of the Arts Commission, specifically, and that continuing to be a robust thing that we have in the City. So I'm involved at 1078. I'm also a faculty at Butte College and an artist who has received a couple of mini-grants back when that was a thing. So like everyone involved at 1078 Gallery, I'm a volunteer, and I think that this is a worthwhile way to spend my time because I believe that the arts make our community a better place to live. And I know that this is true because people thank me all the time for the work that we do at the Gallery, and they mention just the bright spot that the Gallery has become on Park Avenue in South Chico. And so that's a really great feeling, and that's why I do it. Okay. So why do we need representation with the City? For one thing, it gives us legitimacy when we're seeking other funding at the state level. So we're currently a fiscal receiver for a California Arts Council impact grant of about $20,000. That's going to bring several new murals to South Chico. It's a project by Sienna Sinocchi. And that in turn makes us a more attractive venue for regional and national artists and performers to bring their, to bring that higher level programming to our small town here. 1078 is part of an arts ecosystem in Chico that all kind of works together. An example is that in December we had a show by a Chico State BFA student, Tamara Murphy. It was actually our most successful show in terms of sales ever with over $11,000 of sales in one month. She was then able to parlay that into a job teaching service. And she's now a director of arts and ceramics at Butte College. So all these parts work together and the City being involved in that is really important to us. In this era of social media, a mural or a piece of public art becomes our calling card to the world. You know, just like that with having a photo taken and being posted. And to not have a City entity that can capitalize on the talent that we have here would be a shame. So in conclusion, funding and commission support from the City has been integral to our success. And to helping us help the community. Thank you for your time. Thank you. And just a thank you to all our commissioners for their time too. It is sometimes a big job and certainly at times a thankless job. So we appreciate all they do. All right. So further discussion from, although we had quite a bit, but I believe Mr. Bennett, you had an additional comment there. I'm going to ask an awkward question. I do that quite often. Would you feel comfortable, and I'm just, we haven't made a decision, but would you feel comfortable if Director Gustafson and Director Veague became more involved in the agendas and actually reviewed them and made that determination, or should we do it in a different way? I don't know. Well, I'm happy to answer that. And please correct me, gentlemen, if I misspeak. I believe they do play an active role. Again, Brendan's group does not bring items forward other than Climate Action Commission. And I think that they do play an active role. Where I think the awkwardness lies is when a commissioner wants to bring an item forward where they want to talk about the sales tax revenue, and where they would like to see it perhaps go for parks. I think that it's a great conversation, but that is not in their wheelhouse in terms of what their responsibilities are. And so I feel like it's very hard to tell a commissioner, you know, that's something that will have to be considered at the council. It could be very hard because that commissioner could say, well, you're always stopping me from putting items on the agenda. I think a more outlined procedure would be, would be helpful, would take the onerous off of staff. It would make it clear. If it's budgetary, it goes to the council. If they really have an idea, I know that Monica mentioned the work plans. That was actually my idea back in 2006. And it worked well because we were trying to rein in our commissioners. And by developing that work plan and presenting it to the council, it was in place for two years, and it was great. But then it also became very onerous for staff. You had to review what was done, where are you at, and having all these reports out. And so really what we were doing was trying to fix the need to have more control over our boards and commissions. We value their input. That's why they're there. And they have great ideas. So how do they get those great ideas to the council? And to me, instead of having individual work plans that have to be monitored for two years, approved by the council, and then updates provided to the council, maybe they submit a letter as a body to the council saying, could we talk about this? We would like to take this matter up. Ten to 15 items on a work plan was very difficult for staff to manage. And I think that, again, it could, and Monica said, let's narrow the focus to three to five, that kind of thing. But how about if we just change that process so that if an item comes up where a commissioner wants to talk about the budget related to, or related to the parks or have speakers come in to another commission, that it comes forward so that you can decide what you want your staff working on. We've heard comments before. Can we expedite a process to 30 days? There are so many moving parts and so many responsibilities that those departments and our departments have that how do we streamline and make sure it's efficient and that it represents truly what your priorities are. Which is either done through strategic planning or done through the budget process and the approval. So being able to come to council meetings and saying to the council, I'm a commissioner for X, Y, and Z and I would love to be able to talk about this. Do you think if council wants to take that matter up and direct staff that we want you to not work on this? Because you have to identify what do you not want us to do when we do other things? Or perhaps you rely on us to make those work. Or perhaps you rely on us to make those recommendations. Or you expect us to just get everything done. So I think, I was just thinking of all options. Probably the latter. Sorry. But I digress. I just think that staff definitely understands what the role of the commissions are. And I will take complete ownership of this. We have not had training for several years now. And that is on me. When we did finally get it scheduled, COVID hit. It's supposed to be, it's supposed to happen every other year when we get new commissioners. I, council felt so strongly about it in 2006. They directed that it was a requirement and it was to last eight hours. And people always wondered what could I possibly talk about for eight hours? And I don't have a problem. But anyway, I just think that it's important and I haven't been fulfilling that. And it's something that we need to get back to. Because then we can have these discussions with the commissioners and help guide them. Their work is important. Their input is valued. And they may have great ideas. But you as a body, elected officials, can't just place an item on the agenda. You have to get council approval. So here you have advisory bodies that can add items that you don't even know about. And they can discuss it. So it's just a thought. digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive digestive a work plan is a scary thing because i don't want to let the planning commission think that they're developing a work plan because they're not developing a work plan for us we've got a work plan it's quite robust all right so i just want to add that thank you i i would agree that i think we need to at least i'm suggesting that uh the architectural review and planning commission they operate on an entirely different basis they're driven by applications and once those applications are deemed complete then there's a time frame that comes and so i'm kind of leaving in my head i was leaving them out but i didn't articulate that and i like your idea better thank you thank you all right vice mayor reynolds well i would go back to what i said earlier if i can turn that in the emotion into a motion um in the effort of efficiency for our city um i would ask miss preston to come back with a um how we can improve the design of the work plan and then put a commission request um and the best way to do that consult with the city attorney on how to do that um and revisit the frequency of meetings and come back with a recommendation to council of that and then to re-go out for a recruitment on the at least a airport hrpb and climate action commission it looks like we might be good on arts but well and planning um but we at least need the recruitment on those but i'm open to okay discussion on that so i'll second okay perfect and then could i just ask a clarifying question um on our if we go if we move forward with the arts and planning appointments would you like those scheduled soon we need to actually do the interviews first and since we do have a number of applicants it would behoove us to have a special meeting get those two situated and appointed and at the same time concurrently i would be running the recruitment for the other um bodies they could do arts joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint I agree with your motion. I'd like to add one item. That is that when the clerk comes back to us, that she consider combining, and I'm thinking ARB and planning, they both canceled half their meetings last year. I'm all for architectural integrity and historical preservation, but there's nothing that they do that the staff can't do and planning can't do. And having built projects and had to run through those gates, making that whole entitlement process more efficient, I think is very important. But I would like to have Ms. Preston come back and tell us whether she thinks that's a practical idea or not. I will absolutely accept your second amendment on that. I tried to do that two years ago, and Mr. Bennett talked me out of it. But I'll at least definitely bring back the information. And I would definitely have to work very closely with Brendan in order to come back with that, unless you want to address it already right now? Why don't we address it when we come back to it? It's just more appropriate that way, I think, because we're already in the friendly amendment process. Okay. Perfect. So friendly amendment accepted on the second. And? With that mouthful, do you want to take a vote? Yes. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck? Yes. Council Member Winslow? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. Thank you. Thank you, Council. Thank you. Item 5.4, items added after the posting of the agenda. There are none. Six reports and communications. The following reports and communication items have been provided for the Council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section of the agenda unless the Council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. 6.1, City Manager's report. No report. Thank you, Senator. 6.2, monthly financials are attached for information only. 6.3, Council Member requests pursuant to AP and P-1010. Council Members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating what the item would be. Majority of the Council is... Need an order approved for staff to agendize. Do we have any Council Members wishing to agendize anything? All right. I'm not necessarily need to agendize, but I would like to request a report from... Regarding that, we have discussed about the... A lot of community members have requested to have a... A private meeting maybe where constituents can participate via Zoom and comment on it. And I would like to see maybe some information on pros and cons of going in that direction in the future or not so we can comply with the regulations that we need to follow as per the state policy. I'm happy to bring that. Would you like that under reports and communications as an update or an informational? I think we need to agendize it. Do we? Can we just report? So... Okay. Mr. Ewing, if I can ask you for a second. So because this is our area where we generally agendize something, does she need to agendize it first for us to discuss it so then she can have the report brought back or what's your thoughts? Those would be my thoughts that you follow your procedure, right? Right. You bring up what you want your colleagues to consider and then agendize it and have a discussion about it and then... Yeah. So you would have to ask for it to be agendized. Okay. But can I ask a question? If we vote no to agendize it, there's no reason that we couldn't request to have Ms. Pressen bring it back in a reports and communications at a further time than the city manager could ask to bring that information back. If I could offer a hybrid, I think the request was of council, would you like the city staff to come back? Okay. Okay. So the state legalizing the joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint joint and then if you all support that, then that's what we would make happen. Okay. So request to agendize this discussion. Request to agendize the information. Then bring back the report. If I may add, Mayor, there's some legislative changes that are fluid right now and they will be for the next 30 to 60 days. It is my intent to, once that fluidity settles a bit, to bring what would essentially be a 2023 legislative update type report to the Council anyways, irrespective of the request. That would include some of the issues that were raised by Council Member Tandon's request. So I just want to know that that's coming, but we're just keeping an eye on Sacramento to see ultimately what happens. Okay. So it sounds like that request is probably forthcoming anyway. Yes. So Neil, do you mind just withdrawing until then? Yeah, sure. All right. Goal is to keep us all updated, so. Yeah. Okay, so we'll just look forward to that coming back on a regular schedule. All right, and with that, we will adjourn. Thank you very much, everybody. Birthday boys out in the audience. Wait a second. That's your kid. That's me. You called me out. I know. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
