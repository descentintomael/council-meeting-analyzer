All right Madam Clerk can you take the roll and welcome back. Thank you. Council Member Brown.  Here. Council Member Denley. Here. Council Member Huber. Here. Council Member Morgan. Here.  Council Member Tandon. Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Here. Mayor Coolidge. Present. All right thank you very much.  So a note on public participation. This meeting is conducted in accordance with Executive Order N-2920.  The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or view  a streaming video found on the City's web page. Public participation during the meeting. The Engage  Chico Civic Engagement Program was available for citizen input on individual items prior to the  meeting and that program was assessed through the access through the City's website. Engage Chico  comments were closed at 4 30 this afternoon. Public comment will still continue to be accepted  during the meeting by email and can be sent to publiccomments at chicoca.gov. That's public  comment.  During the meeting prior to the close of public comment on an item. The public is encouraged not to  send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email. So if you  are interested in commenting on multiple items please do so by sending multiple emails. Do not  group them in one email. All right we'll move on to the consent agenda. The consent agenda is for  routine matters in nature and can therefore be acted on in one motion. Do we have any public  comments or council disqualifications or no votes? I'd like to register a no vote on item 2.1.  Right that's a no vote on 2.1. Yes I would also like to register a no vote on 2.1.  Okay so noted. All right public comments. We did receive 23 comments from Engage Chico and then I'll  check with Danny to see did we receive any public comments in the email. Two of those. All right so  and I'll go ahead and read the names and the council's been provided with a copy of all the  comments from Engage Chico. So the comments were received from Jessica Giannola, Taylor Skinner,  Jessica Bender, Alicia Triter, Ingrid Butchart, Casey Croninger, Mark Chekowin. I apologize if  I'm massacring these names. Julie Threat, Kimberly Burke, Jackie Smith, Teresa Jewett,  Robin Indar, Kim Dietz, Chanel Fowler, Peggy Gerlin, Yvonne Johnson, Nicole Nava, Erica Witowski,  Gary Vertel, Claudette Ritter, Michelle Burton, Ruth Cernoff, and Mark Ruffner.  All right has everybody had time to read those over and were there there are no further comments  correct team? There were two public emails.  Teresa Jewelich and Warren Kennedy. All right. Does anyone need more time to read those? Okay.  All right, everyone ready?  All right, everyone ready?  All right, everyone ready?  All right, everyone ready?  All right, everyone ready?

Just waiting for my machine.  That was a motion by Vice Mayor Reynolds,  seconded by Council Member Morgan,  to approve the consent agenda as read with it noted  an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico  amending Title IX, Public Peace, Safety, and Morals  by adding Section 9.29, Syringe Exchange Programs  prohibited to the Chico Municipal Code  to ban syringe exchange programs,  as well as it noted that Council Member Brown  and Council Member Huber voted no on Item 2.1.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you.  Okay.  At this time, while business from the floor,  members of the public may address the Council  at this time on any matter not already listed  on the agenda with comments being limited  to three minutes or as determined by the Mayor.  Based on the number of speakers, of course,  we're doing this.  Yeah.  Engage Chico.  The Council cannot take any action at this meeting  on requests made under this section of the agenda.  Madam Clerk, do we?  Okay.  So in Engage Chico,  we received 38 comments from business from the floor.  And then I would ask Danny how many public comments.  One public comment from Alicia Trigger  from business from the floor.  Okay.  All right.  So I'll read the names as Council's reading those comments.  Katie VanderWaal-Cook, Andrea Martin, Jessica Giannola,  Taylor Skinner, David Hare, David Peterson,  Julio Domingue, Alicia Trider, Mary Lopez,  Susie Ling, Mary Anderson, Kimberly Burke,  George Deeds, Ruth Sarnoff, Tom Daz,  Rose Toulin, Melissa McHarris, Ed Hollihan,  Sabrina Struth, Daniel Toms, Julia Flynn,  and Mary Anderson.

All right.  So we have a number of comments.  All right, we'll give everybody a few minutes.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You're buying that.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Okay, we're good?  Ms. Brown?  Good? Okay.  Alright.  So we will move on to public hearings.  It's an administrative  appeal notice of determination of Bruce  Road Rehabilitation Project.  And  before we start the staff presentation,  we need an announcement of ex parte communications.  At this time, any council member who received  information or evidence about this matter outside  of the public hearing to verbally disclose  off the record  contacts relating to  this item, A,  the nature of that communication,  B, with whom the ex parte  communication  was made, and C, a brief statement  as to the substance of the  communication. So, does anyone  have any ex parte communications  on this subject?  Yes, I spoke to Richard  Harriman about a week ago, and  he mailed me  a copy of  the appeal.  Okay.  I think we're alright.  Anyone else?  Alright, seeing no  more at this time, we'll proceed with the staff  presentation, which is to be no more than  15 minutes.  Unless your computer turned off.  Our computer turned off.  Right, it's being rebooted  right now.  It's rebooting,  so,  no worries.  We'll see how fast you get up  and run in here.  Of course.  Do we have any council questions prior to  the presentation?  Yeah, how long does it take to reboot your computer?  It's thinking right now.  It's a good sign.  I see it.  Yeah, why don't we do that?  Public comments?  Madam Clerk, why don't you just start reading the list,  and council members, we can read through them at this time  before.  Okay. So, we received  on item 4.1,  we received 31  comments in Engage Chico,  and Danny, how many public comments?  Six.  Six, okay.  So, in Engage,  Stephen Marquardt,  Jessica Giannola, Katie Toma,  Karen Laszlo,  Maggie Scarpa,  Andy Wilhoyt, Peggy Gerrolin,  Ingrid Butchert, Casey Kroninger,  Frankie Miller, Margaret Higginson,  Bill Broward, Megan  Tompkins, Clark Gardner,  Ann Nielsen,  Jackie Smith,  Doreen Denley,  Michelle Burton, Bill Knudson,  Ed Rogers,  Neil Potts, Ed  Hollihan, Carrie Welch, Adele  Wickman, Diana Wright,  Jennifer Dewar,  Lance Whitaker, Susan Smead,  Nicole Nava,  Ruth Sarnoff, and Kate Leiden,  and then Danny, the sixth.  Assemblyman James Gallagher,  Kate Leiden, Jacob Builders,  Chris Gapatini and Chip,  Chris Giannulli, Maggie Scarpa,  and Tom Bond.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll just continue to read through those as your computer downloads.  Thank you very much for your patience.  We do have hard copies.  Worst case scenario, we can utilize that.  We'll need a few minutes anyway.  Okay. Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's been 20% for a while.  It says ETA 15 minutes.  It's coming up.  I do.  Can we do that?  I'm done.  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's still at 20%.  We're going to try that.  Okay.  Okay.  Do we have a...  Okay.  Don't see one.  Okay.  It's like my favorite thing is one of the clocks on the  computer that, you know, says it's this much time and then  it just keeps growing and growing.  .  For anyone joining us at home, we're just working on an issue  here and we'll be back up and running in a second.  I thought 2020 was behind us.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . I will start with the project components and get everyone up to speed on what the project entails, what it is, and then I'll pass it over to my colleague, Director in Planning and Housing, Brendan V,  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  The staff report provides a lot more detail than we're going to cover tonight,  as well as the record of decision that Mr. Veague utilized in the filing of the notice of determination for our CEQA document.  So, what is the project?  The project is widening Bruce Road from Skyway to Highway 32.  It includes widening and raising the existing bridge over Little Chico Creek.  It will construct a center landscaped median with lighting and center turn lanes at certain areas,  storm drainage, as well as traffic signal modifications and sidewalk gap closures.  So, this is essentially the limits of the project.  You can see the cross-section diagram there, widening it to four lanes, again, with center median street lighting,  as well as...  Actually, one of the highlights of the project is a 12-foot wide separated Class 1 bike path,  which is on the west side of the corridor that will connect all the different land uses along the corridor.  We'll have additional path lighting on that west side, as well, to light up the path.  In addition, on the street, we'll have buffered bike lanes.  So, really trying to incorporate our design standards for complete streets and multimodal transportation.  The environmental document...  The environmental document had a detailed traffic study.  After the appeal, staff did some additional kind of existing conditions analysis of proposed traffic,  just to kind of highlight the demand for the project and the warrants that it meets.  So, currently, we have about 13,000 average daily traffic ADT.  With all the approved projects that you can see highlighted here that have been environmentally cleared,  approved, and essentially ready to build,  you can see...  Those components there, Marion Park, Oak Valley, the Chico Unified School District, future high school site.  We loaded that with those land uses and came up with estimated traffic counts with just those projects.  So, not assuming build-out of our general plan.  And that alone would generate approximately 28,000 vehicle trips per day.  From an engineering principles and practices, the warrant for a four-lane roadway is about 20,000 trips,  just over 20,500 trips per day.  So, just alone, we wanted to highlight the fact that this project is warranted based on what's currently approved and environmentally cleared already.  Project delivery process.  These projects take years to go through the process.  We start with the project initiation, identify the project need, the scope of work.  And so, that started in roughly the 2008 timeframe.  Then we started with some survey and general design concepts.  And then we go into our preliminary design.  And our technical studies for our environmental document.  Which leads to our preparation, which is our ISMND.  Which is our initial study mitigated negative declaration.  And then once that is filed with the notice of determination,  we proceed with permitting from all the state and federal agencies that are required for that project.  We then finalize all the right-of-way needs.  So, we're in the process of that as well.  And then we package our final design plans and specifications.  And then we put that out to bid and go into construction.  Project funding for the preliminary engineering phases, the environmental and the right-of-way.  Is about $2.5 million.  And we have estimated construction with contingencies that we always put into our construction projects.  And our construction management.  So, inspection and engineering, construction services at $27.5 million.  For a total project cost of $30 million.  I would venture to guess this is probably by far the largest dollar figure project in the city's history.  The sources of funding that is going to pay for that is we were awarded last year just over $22 million for an infill infrastructure grant.  Which is associated with housing.  And that's through the state of California through the Housing Community Development Department.  Can I ask a quick clarifying question?  Sure.  Was the grant awarded specifically to expand Bruce Road to four lanes?  Yes.  The scope that was discussed was the same scope of work that was included in the grant application.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Then the remainder of costs are made up with development impact fees through our street facilities fund.  Which is fund 308.  And then also state transportation funds.  Again, the IIG, the infill infrastructure grant investment in affordable housing.  Through that grant is intended to help deliver 259 units of affordable housing.  As well as an additional 2300 units estimated of market rate housing.  So, that's the scope that was discussed.  So, you can see here this was the figure that we utilized in our grant application.  Which highlights the corridor and what they call a qualifying infill area.  And so our, which is a QIA.  Our project, QIP, qualifying infill project is the Bruce Road corridor.  The area is the housing units that are associated or tied to that scope of work.  That concludes my portion.  So, now we're going to get into the environmental elements with Mr. V.  Thank you, Brendan.  And good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council.  Brendan V., Community Development Director.  So, yes.  As Brendan mentioned, I'm just going to speak directly to what this appeal is really about.  It's the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA.  So, on September 23, 2020, the city issued a notice of intent to adopt a mitigated negative declaration.  Along with an initial study environmental checklist prepared specifically for the project.  These documents identify potential impacts associated with the road widening and bridge crossing.  And document mitigation measures that would reduce those impacts to less than significant levels.  Consistent with the city's code, the city accepted public comments on the documentation for 30 days.  Ultimately receiving eight comment letters and providing comprehensive responses to four comment letters  that questioned the adequacy of the environmental review.  Those are all included in your staff report.  On November 24, 2020.  Consistent with CEQA guidelines, the city's code, and the same procedure used for dozens of capital improvement projects over the past 10 years.  I approved the project and the notice of determination.  The notice of determination was followed with the Butte County Recorder's Office, as well as the state clearinghouse.  As allowed by the city's code, the city clerk received a timely appeal of my CEQA determination on December 7th.  A date was set for council to hear the appeal, which was shared with the appellants.  The appellant's appeal form is included as attachment A.  The appeal form is included as attachment B.  The city staff response to the appeal,  provided as attachment B, and the record of my decision,  is included as attachment C, here, staff report.  So, my notice of the determination, was based on substantial evidence, in the record.  The initial study checklist,  did identify some potentially significant effects,  associated with the project,  but, revisions, or mitigation measures,  added to the project,  and agreed to by the applicant,  in this case, the city,  would avoid those adverse effects,  to a point where, clearly, no significant,  inte,  impact would occur.  And there's no substantial evidence of a fair argument  that the project with incorporation of those mitigation  measures would have a significant effect on the environment.  These are important secret concepts that were critical  to my decision to approve the notice of determination.  I am confident that nothing has been provided  by the appellants to establish a fair argument  that the project may have significant effect  on the environment.  So comprehensive responses to issues raised on the appeal  are provided in your staff report.  I hope you've reviewed some of them, they're quite lengthy.  I'm going to provide a very summary response  to some of the key issues raised.  First, the appellant suggests that the project  is not consistent with the city's general plan.  Let me be perfectly clear, the project is without doubt  consistent with the city's general plan.  The area around the project site has been planned  for development for decades, and the need for Bruce Road  to be a four lane arterial between State Route 32  and Skyway has been identified as needed infrastructure  dating back to 1993.  for the city's 24 general plan circulation element.  Bruce Lane is a four lane arterial,  is also currently identified in the city's 2030 general plan  circulation element, which was originally adopted in 2011.  The general plan matches up a land use diagram,  which you can see on the screen,  which shows where and how the city wishes to grow,  with the circulation plan that shows how we plan  to accommodate that growth.  Honestly, there's nothing more consistent  with the general plan than proceeding with the project.  The project is also consistent with regional long range,  master planning documents,  including the Bute County Association,  the governments, regional transportation plan,  and sustainable community strategy.  The project has also included  the city's capital improvement project program,  again, a council approved program  that identifies infrastructure needs,  both existing and planned future development,  envisioned by the city's general plan.  The intelegate also suggest  the project is inconsistent  because of purported inadequacies  in the general plan, based on changes  in the baseline, or the environmental baseline,  since the general plan intelegate,  was last updated in 2017, including the campfire.  First, let me be clear.  An appeal of a sequent analysis for an individual project is not the appropriate manner to challenge  the General Plan's adequacy.  Further, the initial study mitigated negative deck for the project are based on conditions  at the time of the environmental review and when it began.  It's not based on the General Plan itself.  To the extent necessary or useful, the environmental analysis is based on data collected after  the campfire.  As an example, the traffic transportation study was prepared in April 2020 based entirely  on traffic volume data collected after the campfire.  Finally, the project implements other General Plan goals and policies by implementing multimodal  transportation infrastructure.  Specifically, the project will construct a new 12-foot wide bike, separated bike and  pedestrian path along the west side of the roadway, as well as on-street buffered bike  lanes as well as bus stop pullouts.  This is the type of infrastructure we're looking for.  This project goes above and beyond implementing non-vehicular transportation infrastructure  in a connected and consistent manner, not only with the General Plan, but with the 2019  bike plan.  Appellants have not described any specific analysis in the initial study or mitigated  negative declaration that should be updated based on a substantial change in the environmental  background.  Further, appellants have failed to describe how the proposed project does not comply with  the Chico 2030 General Plan.  Ultimately, appellants failed to establish a fair argument that the project will have  a significant effect on the environment.  Appellants also suggest the project has growth-inducing impacts.  Let's remember, this is not a new roadway.  It already exists.  Again, the project will not have growth-inducing impacts, including related to other planned  and expected development in the area, such as the Stone Gate project, which by the way  is already approved by the City, and the Valley's Ed project, which is undergoing its own comprehensive  environmental review.  The intended purpose of the project, again, is to alleviate existing need and accommodate  a planned future development identified in the City's General Plan, including the recently  approved 100-unit Creekside Place and the 159-unit North Creek Crossings affordable housing  projects, which are identified specifically in the City's infill infrastructure grant  application.  It's also worth noting that four additional affordable housing projects, totaling 475  affordable housing units, received state funding late last year and are located along the Bruce  Road corridor and would also directly benefit from this project.  Thank you.  This project is simply thoughtful and well-planned infrastructure planning.  Finally, Appellants argue the City's analysis of several specific impacts on the environment is deficient,  including plans to move an existing rock wall, water use from a landscape medium, and wildfire impacts.  First, the initial study plainly describes both the potential significance of the rock wall  and a plan to relocate it consistent with previous environmental review that was prepared for the Merriam Park project.  Second, Cal Water and the City have planned for water use necessary for the landscape medium  because Cal Water, as part of its long-range planning or master planning,  assumes demand based on the City's general plan, which includes, again, the Bruce Road as a four-lane roadway.  And finally, comments regarding wildfire impacts relate to the adequacy of Cal Fire's fire hazard severity zone maps  rather than to potential environmental impacts to the project.  Ultimately, a widened roadway might serve as a barrier to a fire,  and also allow for better response times for emergency crews.  I'd like to highlight a few of the project's citywide benefits associated with the project.  I think Brandon's hit on a few, and I've also hit on a few, but just there's some additional ones I'd like to share.  The project, of course, is an upgrade to a key piece of existing infrastructure  that was initially identified in the City's 1994 general plan,  and again identified in the City's current general plan to accommodate thoughtful growth.  The project includes the receipt of $22 million from the State to construct infrastructure  that is going to be used to build a new infrastructure system for the City of Cal.  The project is directly linked to the production of 250 affordable housing units,  and since that time, an additional 475 units that could benefit directly.  There is substantial benefit to the City in completing the project comprehensively,  as proposed, rather than as piecemeal, project-by-project approach,  as individual projects build out along the corridor.  Ultimately, that is the intent of a capital projects program.  The roadway surface will consist of concrete.  This application will have more than twice the life expectancy of traditional,  and the roadway surface will have more than twice the life expectancy of traditional,  asphalt surfacing, therefore reducing the need to truck in new asphalt and oil products  with its associated greenhouse gas emissions.  The project represents multimodal infrastructure to assist biking, walking, and busing students  to an approved Chico Unified School District school site on Bruce Road.  The project is an infrastructure upgrade identified in both the Oak Valley EIR,  our Environmental Impact Report, from 2004,  as well as the Merriam-Park Environmental Impact Report from 2006,  to address potential traffic,  and circulation impacts associated with build out of those projects.  To not build the project would be to not address the City's responsibility  identified during those environmental reviews.  The project will improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions  by reducing congestion and vehicle miles traveled.  The project will raise and widen the bridge over Little Chico Creek  to meet current floodplain design criteria.  And finally, the significant infusion of state money  will free up capital funding, capital projects funding,  and allow the City to build a new roadway surface,  which will allow the City to prioritize other highly needed roadway projects throughout the community.  Attempting to slow down this project only hurts the City's ability to accommodate existing and future growth,  meet past-sequel obligations,  utilize state money to improve deficient infrastructure,  and to develop affordable housing.  So no concerns were raised when this four-lane arterial was identified in the 1994 General Plan.  No concerns were raised when this four-lane arterial was identified in the 2030 General Plan.  No concerns were raised when this project was included in the City's capital improvement project list.  The City followed the same environmental review process that follows for all capital projects.  As fully described in the initial study, the mitigated negative declaration,  the City's response to public comments, and the response to the appeal,  there is not sufficient evidence to establish a fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the environment.  Therefore, staff recommends that Council deny the appeal regarding the notice of determination  and uphold the Community Development Director's administrative decision,  which will be passed in a second. and uphold the Community Development Director's administrative decision to adopt the mitigated negative declaration. I made it just under the wire according to my clock.  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  inte  All right, Mr. Hewer, fire away.  No? Oh, okay.  All right, so we'll open the public hearing, which is 45 minutes allocated,  up to 15 minutes for the appellant.  Do we have anyone here?  So I just wanted to let it be noted that Richard Harriman,  who filed the appeal on behalf of John Merz, is not here.  He was invited to attend this meeting and be able to come in and speak,  much like we had handled the last public hearing.  We have not heard from him.  He received not only an email with the agenda,  but also a hard copy of the letter notifying him of this date.  So I would turn it over to Andrew for any comments.  All right.  Dan?  We have one additional email from a lawyer at Laurel Doyle.  Okay.  Can you read the speakers that we had then for public comment?  I already actually read those just a little bit ago.  Oh, that's right, while we were waiting.  Yes.  I'm happy to read them.  No, please don't.  Okay.  All right.  So with no rebuttal, I'm sorry, I was just thrown off because he's not here.  All right, so we'll close the public hearing,  counsel the discussion, and possible action.  Mr. Hewer?  Yes, thank you.  Thank you.  You know, for me, the most difficult part of being a counselor  is when my opinion on an issue is in conflict with people who I share many values.  In this case, friends, fellow nature enthusiasts, and environmental advocates.  Unfortunately, sometimes that's part of my job,  because my job is not about doing what I think my friends want.  It's about doing what I think is right and correct for the city,  after reviewing all the information from all sides of an issue.  Okay.  Thank you.  About a decade ago, I was riding my bike along Bruce Road with my two children.  After waiting for just the right moment to cross the bridge over Little Chico Creek,  we hurried across.  Upon reaching the other side, I hit the unpaved loose gravel on the narrow shoulder  and fell into the roadway.  It was only by luck that I wasn't hit by a large pickup truck passing at that moment.  Farther south, the too narrow roadway drops into a muddy slope with dangerous implications.  For anyone with car trouble, trying to ride a bike, or pedestrians.  If it were up to me, I'd love to see the fields and foothills south of 20th Street kept as open space,  for the white-tailed kites and horned larks that live there.  But the development of those areas is not what is in question.  Those are battles for other days and other venues.  The threat of making future development easier by halting a necessary infrastructure project  is not a violation of the law.  It is a viable solution to the challenge of protecting our perimeter.  What is in question is a much-needed road improvement that's been planned for a quarter of a century.  Just considering current traffic numbers along with already entitled projects,  Bruce Road is insufficient to handle the flow.  This plan not only adds needed vehicle capacity, it adds bike lanes,  and will interface with regional transportation plans.  To my friends who would like me to vote otherwise,  I regret that I cannot in good conscience vote to uphold this appeal.  Thank you Mr. Egan.  Anyone else?  I'd just like to comment on Brendan's passion in his defense of his position.  That was awesome.  I think if I was like gonna approve the appeal, which I wasn't to begin with,  you would have changed my mind there.  It's hard to do, man. Good job.  Yes, thank you Mr. Began.  Thank you Mr. Adelbunny. I appreciate it.  Any more comments from council?  All right. At this point in time, we will accept a motion.  I'll move to deny the appeal.  I'll second that motion.  I have a motion and a second.  Quick question for clarification.  We have comments, public comments, was that while the hearing was open because I didn't get enough time to...  Oh, you still need some time? Sorry.  Yeah, absolutely. We can take some more time.  That'd be great. Thank you.  Thought we were all clear on that.  So we'll take a few more minutes to just have everybody read through if you haven't finished. [inaudible] Thank you. [inaudible]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  What's happening to our way?  Anyone else?  Anyone else?  Any more time?  No, I'm just going to repeat my motion.  Go for it.  Go for it.  Oh, okay.  Madam Clerk.  All right.  So motion by Council Member Morgan,  seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds to deny the appeal.  Just a really quick comment.  I agree, Council Member Morgan.  That was an incredible presentation  and a very thorough staff report.  I felt that some of the concerns brought up by the public  were completely reasonable  and things I wanted to learn more about  and have a better understanding of,  and I believe that staff  did their due diligence  to make the case on this particular item,  so I am going to support the motion.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Moving on to Item 4.2,  Hearing Ordering Information of the Maintenance District A40,  Merriam Park,  Subdivision Phase D.  This is unlike our previous one,  not a quasi-judicial hearing,  so at this time we will just open the hearing  and we will have a report by Mr. Brendan Adubo.  Thank you very much, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council.  A condition of approval of a final subdivision map  requires the property owners,  in this instance Gonzales Development,  to provide a means for funding the future replacement  and annual operation and maintenance costs  of that division.  This is a portion of the Merriam Park development  and recommending adoption of Chico Maintenance District A40.  That concludes my report and I'm available for any questions.  Any questions for Mr. Adubo?  All right.  Seeing none, we'll move on to the public hearing aspect.  Any comments received on this item, Madam Clerk?  Yes, we received one in Engaged,  and that was from Ruth Sarnoff.  And then...  I don't know if we received any public comments on this item,  on item 4.2,  other than Ruth Sarnoff.  She's shaking her head.  Okay.  She already had it.  All right, so we just have that one comment.  All right, so at this point we'll close the public hearing  and then...  entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  I'm a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, please take the roll.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Thank you.  All right.  On the regular agenda,  item 5.1,  Paradise Here Project,  Cooperative Work Agreement and Project Committee presentation.  Katie Simmons, welcome back.  Nice to see you.  And then Mark Maddox.  Mayor Coolidge.  Thank you very much.  Yes.  Because of what I would expect to be a lengthy discussion  and presentation,  can we take a break at this moment?  Sure.  Let's take 10.  Thank you.  What did she say in our speech?  You'll excuse us.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Thank you.  What's happening here?  No, I'm just going to...  I'll never try to show you stuff here, John.  I don't have glasses, so I'm just going to...  All right.  All right.  All right, we're back from break, and we're ready to proceed.  So, Ms. Simmons.  Good evening.  Floor is yours.  Thank you.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, council members.  My name is Katie Simmons.  I'm the Disaster Recovery Director for the Town of Paradise.  I'm here with Kevin Phillips, our Town Manager, Mark Maddox, Public Works Director,  and we should have Clint Snyder with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board on the phone.  We're here tonight to reintroduce the Paradise Sewer Project  and to ask for your approval of the proposed cooperative work agreement  and participation in the Sewer Regionalization Project Committee.  Highlighted in yellow on the map is the sewer service area,  which, with some exceptions, include properties encompassed along Clark, Pearson, and Skyway.  This project is an overall L2.  The project is an effort to provide a long-term solution for the collection, treatment, and dispersal of wastewater  from parcels identified in this SSA.  This slide walks us through 52 years of history on this project,  which shows the completion of the Paradise Sewer Project HDR Engineering Phase 1 in 2020.  Pre-Camp Fire, Paradise needed a sewer because perpetual on-site treatment and dispersal  was not sustainable due to high water quality.  The reason for this is due to high groundwater, limited land availability, and poor soils,  ultimately restricting multi-family housing density and commercial operations  that rely on water usage like restaurants.  This is a quick snapshot of Paradise showing septic system failures,  the failure rate of others, and in the blue checkered area, constrained parcels.  So why now?  Paradise has lost 83% of its population and 90% of its housing stock in the Camp Fire,  Butte County lost net 16,000 residents, but Chico grew by 20%.  Chico's revenues did not grow as quickly as wastewater flows due to more people sharing households.  Paradise's ability to make a full recovery is largely dependent upon overcoming our septic constraints.  With the sewer service area allowing for the development of multifamily housing, for example,  we will have the ability to house our densest population along our major evacuation routes, building back safer.  To re-engage, the town selected HDR engineering for Phase 1 and Phase 2.  HDR analyzed collection, treatment, and dispersal in Phase 1, providing three project options.  One, no project, two, local treatment plant, and three, regional connection.  To study these options, HDL looked at five factors, economic, social, environmental, implementation, and operational.  The regional connection options scored highest across all five factors.  For economic, it presented the lowest capital and net present value costs.  For social, it offered the lowest community impacts during and after construction.  For environmental, it holds the least probable environmental impacts.  For implementation, the fluid...  Fewest permits are needed.  For operational, it is the least complicated to operate and will benefit from experienced Chico staff.  Regional projects are preferred in California.  We are studying three examples of similar projects, Midwestern Placer Regional Sewer Project,  South County Regional Wastewater Authority, South Placer Wastewater Authority,  and on the policy side, State Water Board policies encourage regionalization,  and the City of Chico Municipal Code contains procedures for regionalization.  Can I ask a quick question?  Sure.  What makes them similar projects?  I'm sorry, say that again?  What factors make them similar projects to the project being proposed here?  Just that they're regional, or is there something else that's a common thread?  Oh, so we're just looking at other regional projects in the state of California sort of as the new norm,  and making sure as we move through the process of the EIR that we're looking at other regional projects.  So we're looking at the processes that they go through, such as the Cooperative Work Agreement,  and project committees such as this that connect jurisdictions with the ability to discuss project components during the EIR, for example.  So the distance of this proposed project, for example, is not necessarily consistent with the other things that they're doing?  No, not necessarily correlated.  Okay, thank you.  Yep.  To move the regional connection alternative forward in the EIR process,  the Paradise Town Council approved the following at the December 8, 2020 Council.  Council meeting to secure additional funding for the EIR, including a grant to be made available for the City of Chico,  and work with the regional board to form a Brown Act-compliant project committee consisting of Town of Paradise and City of Chico elected officials.  The next two slides really outline what the town will do in Phase II EIR, studying the regional connection.  The EIR is not a fast track project and will take approximately 18 months to complete.  The town is excited to engage the larger community.  The EIR will be working with the community in the EIR process to ensure we achieve the best version of the project.  And among the scope of work, we will be seeking project financing as well.  So a couple of key collaborative benefits for the City of Chico include some points.  Wastewater systems present economies of scale.  As more people are served, the cost per person for treatment goes down.  Revenue to the city from the regional agreement will provide financial resources for infrastructure projects.  In the city's long-term capital improvement plan.  Regionalization will increase the city's footing to secure future financial assistance.  And regional recovery equates to a stronger economy for the town, county, and region.  The Town of Paradise wants to ensure existing Chico ratepayers do not subsidize the city's efforts to study the Paradise Sewer Project viability.  To support Chico's participation in the EIR, the Town of Paradise has secured a water bottle,  and a core Division of Financial Assistance DFA grant for the second phase environmental impact report.  $300,000 has been made available to the City of Chico to perform work as a vendor to the Town of Paradise.  With this DFA grant, the City's scope of work will inform the city and town of true impacts of project collaboration concurrent to the EIR.  The City will analyze current and future flows and loads, evaluate hydraulic capacity,  create a process model for future flows,  evaluate regulatory requirements and capacity improvement alternatives,  modify the WPCP facility planning report,  and analyze the potential Paradise Sewer Project connection fee.  Tonight, the Town is requesting two things.  Action 1, to authorize the City Manager to execute a cooperative work agreement approved by the City Attorney.  A CWA is required to memorialize terms of scope and fee between the Town of Paradise and the City of Chico.  Ultimately, all work is reimbursed by the Water Board Division of Financial Assistance.  Action 2 is to select two representatives to sit on the Sewer Regionalization Project Committee  to help facilitate the EIR process while providing avenues for public participation and regular updates to elected officials.  The Paradise Town Council selected its Mayor and Vice Mayor to represent the Town.  We know there are several questions about the EIR process.  We have many questions, many, many questions, more than we can put on one slide, about this project.  The EIR process and the project committee will seek to answer these questions through the next several months in Phase 2 of the EIR.  A couple of example questions include, what is the pipe alignment?  What are capacity impacts to the City's plant?  Will a JPA be formed?  And what are the terms of the agreement?  The Paradise Sewer Project is one of the largest,  infrastructure projects of its kind in the state.  It is 12 out of 136 projects receiving funding from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund.  It is the largest in the Central Valley region, including Roseville and Stockton,  and the largest in the North State by far.  After many years of study, a universal understanding among Federal and State elected officials  is that regionalization is our best collective path forward.  Congressman LaMalfa voiced his support recently, saying,  that proposed connection would also provide  much needed upgrades to the water treatment infrastructure in the City of Chico,  where many residents of Paradise relocated.  Assemblyman Gallagher says this option also provides for economies of scale,  benefiting both jurisdictions by distributing permitting, operations, and maintenance costs.  After this presentation, the Town will engage LAFCO and the Butte County Board of Supervisors.  Now I'd like to ask Kevin Phillips and Clint Snyder, over the phone,  to provide any additional comments.  Thank you, Katie.  Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council Members, thank you for allowing us to be here tonight.  I'm just here to basically reach out and say thank you for listening  and just taking this into consideration for this Intertie project.  I also want to say, to kind of separate two projects,  obviously I was with PID,  in my previous life,  and this is completely separate from the Water Line project.  It is included in Assembly Bill 36 as an item to be considered  for the opportunity for a design build.  But the projects are not connected by any stretch.  So this is not a water pipe from Paradise to Chico.  This is a sewer project to support the rebuild of Paradise.  This project is instrumental in the recovery  of Paradise,  but it's also instrumental in the recovery of the region.  This allows us to bring in low-income housing,  multi-family housing.  It allows us to rebuild our economy up there.  And so with whatever questions we can answer  to move this project forward,  I would appreciate your consideration.  Thank you.  So just quickly to recap,  we are asking for two specific actions tonight.  For the City Manager to receive authorization  to execute the Cooperative Work Agreement,  and for the Chico City Council to select representation  to participate in the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control  Board-led Project Committee.  And with that, we'd like to say thank you  and answer any questions.  All right, questions?  Does everyone have a question?  Oh, I see.  So apologies.  Clint Snyder is on the line,  and he would like to make a couple of closing comments  before we go to questions, if that's okay?  Okay, Clint, can you hear us?  Can we hear him?  Yes.  There we go.  Okay, I think we've got you now.  Go ahead.  Good evening, Mayor Coolridge, Council Members.  My name is Clint Snyder.  I'm an Assistant Executive Officer  with Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board.  I manage the Board's Reading Office.  I'm really here this evening just to say, you know, I'm really excited.  I wanna speak briefly,  just briefly, just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  just briefly, just briefly,  The ask tonight is really to ask the City of Chico Council to designate two representatives to assist the Town of Paradise and the Central Valley Water Board with a very transparent approach.  And I would say a rather novel approach to exploring the benefits of the Town of Paradise and the benefits of the City of Chico and getting a successful project, particularly a regionalization project of this size, really needs to provide advantages to both the Town and the City.  And I think this one does.  I think, you know, particularly for the City of Chico, you know, there are opportunities for improvement to the City of Chico wastewater treatment plant, including the addition of tertiary treatment.  We need to start walking through this process to explore and evaluate.  We'll turn it over to the regionalization.  I will add to you that this concept of regionalization isn't new.  As Katie mentioned earlier, it certainly complies with state and regional policies on regionalization and recycling opportunities.  I think you certainly benefit.  I think that potential economics of scale, as mentioned earlier, brought to bear the regionalization approach.  And really, you know, at the end of the day, if any of these projects move forward, it's a lengthy process.  As many of you know, these things don't happen overnight.  I'm not being asked to approve the project tonight.  But just to explore the opportunities to approve a project at a certain point in the future.  I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  But I'm really just here to explore.  I express my support, CalEPA's support, State Water Board's support for this project.  And give them the potential benefit in both the town of Covise and the City of Chico.  Particularly as we look long-term in groundwater basin management.  So I appreciate the time tonight and thank you very much.  All right, thank you.  All right, questions.  Councilman Brown, you have some?  Yeah, thank you for your presentation and report.  A couple of things that you mentioned that I wanted to ask a little bit of clarification on.  You said you looked forward.  To robust public engagement.  And a speaker on the phone just mentioned a transparent approach to this project.  I'm hearing from a lot of citizens of Chico that there's a feeling that there has been a lack of transparency.  With regard to this project leading up to tonight.  And you know, while I appreciated the information in the presentation and the report.  I'm no sewer expert.  And I feel like ill-equipped in terms of education to continue this conversation without having it.  How do you plan?  To engage the public in this process?  And what's your plan for maximizing transparency in the process?  Sure.  So the committee that we're inviting the City of Chico to participate in will be Brown Act compliant.  So these will be public meetings.  So the two jurisdictions discussing this process through the EIR will be public meetings with public comments.  So there will be many opportunities for the citizenry to get involved.  So we encourage obviously that to be taken seriously.  And that's what's taking place as we go through the EIR process.  Other options were obviously taken off the table.  We don't have the information about the extent of those options.  The cost associated with those options.  Why those options weren't selected.  While I appreciate the categories that the benefits were highlighted under.  It's hard for me to be able to make any informed decisions without understanding what options were explored.  And the details behind those.  So can you give an overview?  And I don't know that it's going to be adequate for tonight for me.  But at least for the public's understanding.  So I'm going to go ahead and ask for your information.  Sure.  I'll give that a try.  And then I invite Mark Maddox to jump up and help me with the technical side of things.  But phase one was really studying the local alternative.  Which was the local treatment plant and the regional connection.  And it was determined through the study process that the regional connection was the most viable.  The only viable option for the town.  It did score the highest in the five factors that were applied to the study process.  And you know I would say that this project having been through almost a year.  Almost 52 years iteratively of study.  We have this entire process resulted in really the regional connection being the only option for our community.  Do you want to say anything else Mark?  Can you explain why it was the only viable option for your community?  Good evening.  Mayor Coolidge and council.  My name is Mark Maddox.  I'm the public works director for the town of Paradise.  As Katie mentioned.  The local alternatives have been analyzed over the last year.  Over the last four decades.  Have been studied thoroughly and exhausted.  But what it comes down to is there really is no other viable project for a local alternative.  Because of the reasons we highlighted in the presentation.  Due to high ground water.  Limited parcel size.  We did study siting a treatment plant along the Clark Road corridor.  Along the Skyway corridor.  Neal Road corridor.  It doesn't pencil out as being a viable alternative.  In addition.  It creates a new discharge point.  Currently the water pollution control plant with the city of Chico discharges into the Sacramento River.  The effluent is dispersed amongst the river.  And the town of Paradise and a local alternative doesn't have the benefit of that water body to discharge to.  So it's not permittable.  It's more costly.  And the environmental impacts are much greater.  With a local alternative.  And much higher risk.  Whereas the city of Chico has the infrastructure that we can work together.  Whether it be a direct connection.  Or whether it be a connection to the existing collection system.  Where there's certainly much less risk.  For a potential issue operating a second wastewater treatment plant in the region.  And just a follow up question.  One of the objectives of this project is to ensure existing city of Chico rate payers do not subsidize the city's efforts to study the Paradise sewer project viability.  Is it fair or safe to assume that rate payers will subsidize the development of this major infrastructure project?  So to answer that question.  At that point we haven't really discussed cost of the project.  So when we're talking in terms of the overall project.  We're at 182 million dollars.  With 30 million set aside for the remaining phases.  Post environmental.  And 152 million for construction.  Across 300 standing structures in Paradise.  That does not pencil out.  As we look to recover the 83% population loss.  We know that we're going to have to work creatively with our legislators.  With our communities as a whole.  But the intent is to work with the water board.  And you heard it from Clint here this evening.  That we are going to search for new money.  That does not burden certainly city of Chico.  And especially the town of Paradise.  As we look to come up with a solution that helps the community recover from the campfire.  Thank you.  I might have some more questions.  But I'll let other folks participate.  Alright.  Mr. Huber do you have questions?  Yeah I have a few.  Thank you very much.  First question is to our city manager.  And Mark I asked you earlier today if our city staff had a recommendation on this.  And thank you for telling me no you didn't.  But I just wonder.  Our city staff has had a recommendation on virtually everything that we've ever been asked to do.  Is there a reason that our staff doesn't have a recommendation on this?  We'd be happy to give you a recommendation if you'd like one.  But we're not doing this because we had another municipality approach.  And asked to speak to our council.  And we have been coordinating, cooperating, collaborating with the town.  And so it wasn't our staff report.  So we didn't have a recommendation to give.  So we're happy to give you a recommendation if that's what this council desires.  Yeah I'd certainly like to know what that is.  Fire away if you want.  Sure.  So as we look at city government as a whole.  When we move forward year to year.  What you're going to find is that the only way that you're going to find a level of  success is through regionalization of many things.  I know that there's always this impugned opinion that says that cities have to stop trying to do everything on their own.  They have to coordinate with the private sector.  Contract out where possible.  And look for collaborations with other jurisdictions.  Chico has reaped the benefit over many years of really kind of being its own municipality here.  Tucked away in this beautiful location.  And when disaster strikes.  There are times when staff has to look at what optimal situations can occur to leverage costs impacts for future.  And one of the few ways that we're finding is that potentially collaborations.  We're looking at it on the homelessness front.  The city can't do it all themselves.  So how are we going to work with the county?  How are we going to work with our partners in the county?  Other municipalities?  I view this from the city manager's seat as one of those that you're looking at a community that was detrimentally impacted.  We are supporting them tremendously from a support mechanism aspect.  The only way that they're going to help with the regionalization growth of our region is enabling them to have a proper system in place for their sanitary sewer.  And so from a staff perspective, moving forward with this evaluation, we would recommend moving forward with this evaluation without knowing the numbers.  Without seeing what the costs actually are.  We're sitting here going.  We don't know.  And so the only way that from a staff perspective that we will know what type of recommendation to give to the ultimate question, do we partner with them and enter into a long-term agreement?  You have to have these quotients known.  And so that's where staff would be on this recommendation.  We don't know what the ultimate big picture recommendation will be because we don't have the information that this will bring about.  I hope that helps.  It does.  Thank you very much.  You bet.  All right.  So a couple questions.  Two or three.  Okay.  So in regards to Councillor Brown's question about public meetings or transparency, would it make more sense to have those public meetings, get those questions out and answered, and that transparency before this council decides on what to do with this issue?  Or are you suggesting that it would be better for us to agree to move forward with this and then have those meetings?  So phase two is really dedicated to that Q&A process with that public engagement piece.  Phase one was really just studying sort of the engineering options, the technical components of the different projects we were looking at.  Phase two, which we're asking the City of Chico to engage with the Town of Paradise on tonight, is really for that Q&A process.  So now it's really time for the public to be getting engaged.  We have several community meetings.  We have a couple of meeting presentations planned in Paradise and in Chico over the next couple of months.  We have a presentation we'd be willing to bring to other boards in the region to make sure they're understanding the project.  We're really hoping for a really robust public engagement process.  And it was really important as we kind of set up this regional project committee that it was Brown Act compliant to encourage the public to be part of it.  Great.  Thank you.  So it's my understanding.  And correct me if I'm wrong.  But I had a couple of understandings about the 2017 feasibility study that was done.  The first was that the pipeline at that time was considered to be more expensive than a local Paradise based treatment facility.  Was that the case in 2017?  When evaluated on upfront costs only, the argument for local versus regional was quite close.  With bringing on HDR engineering in this phase and the relook and the post campfire comments,  we're looking at the new economy that we're dealing with for construction costs and projecting out over an 80 year O&M lifecycle.  Certainly regionalization far outpaces any local option that we could do on our own.  Okay.  The other question is also in regards to that study that indicated that the economic burden of the project on Chico businesses and residential customers would be significant.  Is that still true or has that changed?  Yeah.  I'm not sure where that comment could have originated from.  The overall intent of the study was to make sure that the project was sustainable.  The overall intent that we're working towards is to ensure there are no impacts to Chico businesses, economy, capacity.  That's the role that Clint with the Water Board is going to help us facilitate to make sure that there is nothing that Chico is losing by adding Paradise to their system.  Okay.  Two more sort of technical questions and I'll be completely honest with you.  I am not 100% sure that I understand the whole idea of recharge.  I'm not 100% sure that I understand the whole idea of recharge.  And water banking.  But the additional water created from us here treating Paradise wastewater in Chico, will that increase our recharge into the Chico aquifer?  So I think this is a good opportunity to clarify the scope of the project again as mentioned by our town manager Kevin Phillips.  The PID groundwater recharge transmission pipe potentially between the two communities is completely separate.  The only thing this project has to do with groundwater is in the water.  improving groundwater quality. Right now we have 300 scanning structures in Paradise discharging  their on-site septic systems to groundwater through leach lines and through soil capacity or  soil filtration. So with regards to the question about impacts to the groundwater aquifer recharge,  that's not relevant to the scope of this project and we're not proposing any sort of tie-in to the  groundwater through the treatment process. Okay. All right. I think that answers my questions at  this time. Thank you. All right. Any other questions from council members?  Council member Tandy. This is for Mark. I just want to know at what capacity is our wastewater  plant operating right now? Yeah. So I'd have Director Gustafson if you want to six  megatons. I'm kidding. It's uh he'll give you the specifics of that. Sure. Currently we average  between six million and seven million gallons per day and we're licensed  for 12 million gallons per day. A little bit you know scenario with our existing plant is we kind  of have two plants within one. We have a plant one which is an old plant and in plant two  which was expanded in 2007-2008 time frame. So they're roughly a little over eight on one and  a little over four on the other to get our 12 MGD. So right now we operate our plant two and it would  take some substantial you know internal infrastructure upgrades to  fire up our plant one again and we're kind of doing our own internal study as you know at this time  looking at the benefits of potential expansion on our plant two to just operate that plant and get  the desired capacity that we want long term. So it's kind of a good opportunity to have the  regional water quality control board also involved at the state level to look at this analysis and  kind of help us maybe achieve those internal goals as well. Thank you. All right. Any other questions?  You have a couple more questions? Go ahead councilman.  Particularly related to my previous question about the alternative option of a local  facility. You had mentioned that the Chico rate payers wouldn't bear any cost burden or you're  seeking funding opportunities for the Chico rate payers not to bear any cost burden for the  infrastructure improvement. Have you explored or discussed funding mechanisms for a local treatment  facility given that you're seeking you're going to be seeking a regional funding?  Officer inte  Officer inte One thing I did want to mention while we're reaching out for Clint is the EIR as we commence the EIR process and a full CEQA and I would add CEQA plus really to add this project regionalization committee is that the local alternatives is still going to be in that document.  Officer inte  Officer inte  Officer inte  Officer inte One thing I did want to mention while we're reaching out for Clint is the EIR as we commence the EIR process and a full CEQA and I would add CEQA plus really to add this project regionalization committee is that the local alternatives is still going to be in that document.  Officer inte  Officer inte  We're still going to review it. It's part of the document, part of the process.  And so all of that will be rehashed in the document.  But really, the preferred alternative moving forward now is seeking out the best version of the regional project  that we can possibly find that further reduces environmental impacts to the maximum extent possible  and really study its viability with the City of Chico hand in hand.  And so if I understood your question correctly, did that answer that?  Yeah, I was mostly speaking to the cost constraints that you referenced in your response to that previous question  and whether measures to fund a local option would be plausible since you'd be seeking funding for the regional option.  So every indication, every study we've had, and back in 2017, the staff recommendation was to move forward  and have this dialogue, and we came to the council and looked for additional grants,  was the regional is the preferred.  There.  The local option is neither permittable and there are no funding mechanisms for that.  There is funding for regional broader efforts as we're trying to work together,  protect the environment, and move this forward.  So it'll still live in the EIR and be considered and rediscussed,  and it certainly can look at the committee, but it's not viable in the sense of funding and permitting.  And just physically based on the topography, we have ridges on both sides of Paradise  and the soil condition.  The soil condition is completely not conducive to dispersal and land application.  Storing hundreds of acres of water near the landfill just is not a viable option at this point.  One of the concerns that I'm hearing raised by a lot of residents of our community is that this particular project  could be growth-inducing along, you know, where the pipeline is running,  which would have significant environmental impacts to our community.  Can you speak to that?  Sure.  I'd be glad to.  Recovering 83% population loss really is more recovery-inducing, not growth-inducing.  But with that said, whether growth is induced by this project is something for the EIR process  and something we're certainly open to talking about, discussing further, and documenting.  But again, the intent is to recover from the Camp Fire and bring people home to Paradise  and support multifamily affordable housing for the region.  So for the growth-inducing portion of your question, I think that'll definitely be addressed in the committee and the EIR process.  But also just to clarify that we're looking specifically at the sewer service area, not the entire geography along the pipe.  So we're specifically looking at those parcels along Skyway, Pearson, and Clark to connect to the Chico Water Pollution Control Plant.  Great. And forgive my questions. This is the first I'm hearing about the extent of this project and to be able to move forward with the decision.  That's okay. Great.  I think we're going to have to have some clarity around some of these things.  You'd mentioned that you're going to be engaging the County of Butte.  Why haven't they been engaged up until this point, given that this would run through unincorporated areas?  Well, certainly they have been engaged for many, many years, again, in the 2017 study and years before that and other versions of the study.  We are penciled in for their agenda on February 9th, a week from tonight, or a week from today,  No, we just verified it.  to provide a similar update.  Okay.  And really invite them to participate in the Regionalization Project Committee, provide comment on the EIR document.  Really, their role is going to be broad and include the approval of a potential encroachment permit that would discuss the kind of pipe alignment between the two jurisdictions. Absolutely.  But I think the reason we're here tonight really specifically is because it's action-driven around the Cooperative Work Agreement and the Regional Sewer Project Committee.  Great. Thank you.  All right.  If not anyone else, I'm going to go with a few.  Mine are going to be short.  You can do yes or no.  So basically, this is one of the first steps, correct, in taking us through this process.  It doesn't mean we're approving it tonight.  It doesn't mean the pipeline's being started tomorrow.  What's the, this is not a yes or no question, but what is the timeline if and in fact, you know, at best-case scenario and worst-case scenario, what are we looking at?  So the timeline for the EIR process is approximately 18 months.  Right.  So we would commence somewhere here in the next couple of months.  We're getting the agendas ready for the project committee, so 18 months from about now.  Okay.  So, and then beyond that, obviously, for the bill and everything else, you're looking at a multi-year process.  Yep.  Many times, many community things.  One of the things that I would like to say is that if and in fact you have meetings up in Paradise, and of course you will and you'll have them down here, is I'd just like to see an equal number, if not more, down in our area because we are the ones taking this on.  Sure.  General sentiment-wise, I think I can, you know, even with the city and staff that I've discussed this with, you know, obviously, and it's a big public concern too, but I think, you know, zero negative environmental impacts for the city of Chico would be necessary for us to move forward on this.  You know, negative costs, no increased costs to our rate payers would be necessary for us to move forward on this.  I'm sure these are all things you understand.  You know, obviously, I think as a community, we care about our neighborhood.  We want to assist you in the rebuild, but at the same time, we want to be cautious about making those steps forward.  So, and then, you know, in terms of the growth aspects, a lot of people have actually commented on that as well.  And obviously, this is to facilitate growth back into Paradise.  But, you know, if it were to spur any growth in terms of the pipeline and its route, that would be a county issue that they would be able to approach already, if not in other ways.  So, you know, I don't know that it necessarily facilitates that, but there is a process for that as well.  And then, you know, like I said, thanks for putting this process forward.  It's certainly been a long time coming.  I remember when I was originally on council, we talked about this as well.  So, thanks for your time tonight.  But I do want the public to understand this is the first step of many steps.  This is more of studying than it is answering the question of whether this will be built or not.  That actually will come during the next phase.  And that is in process.  So, at this point in time, do we have any public comment?  I know we do.  We do.  On this item, we received 13 comments in the engaged Chico.  And, Dani, how many are public comments?  21.  All right.  Council can start reading through those if you haven't already.  I know we also received a lot of emails to us personally on this item.  So.  And then we'll look through that and give us a few more minutes beyond that.  Okay.  All right.  The comments in engaged were from Steven Marquardt, Katie Van Der Roel-Cook, Jessica Giannola,  Jessica McKenzie, Richard Harriman, Cynthia Contaris, M.K.  Benson, Maggie Scarpa, Jessica Binder, Alicia Trider, Suzanne Hermanson, Karen Laszlo, and Ruth Sarnoff.  Public emails were from Mary Kay Benson,  Steven Marquardt, Susan Nanchini, Duncan O'Byrne, Maggie Scarpa, Grace Marvin, Amanda Riley,  Maya Torzin, Elizabeth Devereaux, Jared Geiser, Charlie Green, Anne Kolbe-Vicca, Brianna McHale,  Karen Laszlo, Sonia Hitchcock, Mary Frances, Marvis Dieman, Emily Anspar, Janessa Anderson,  Lauren Kennedy, and Deborah Lucero.  All right.  All right.  So we'll take just a few more minutes to read over those comments.  And I did have an email as late as 7-0-1 on this.  I'm not sure if that was to all of us or just a few of us.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm good.  I'd like to ask one more question, though.  All right.  Council Member Brown, go ahead.  I believe you mentioned this in one form or another,  but just for clarity, I got a question from a member of the public.  Will we be committed to this project if we enter into the agreement tonight,  and what does entering?  What does entering into the agreement bind the City of Chico to?  So if I'm understanding correctly,  tonight what the city is agreeing to is engaging in the project committee,  which would be the Brown Act compliant public meetings,  and also the cooperative work agreement,  which would be the sort of the scope of work that we outlined that I could read again,  and that is with the DFA grant for $300,000 of the Town of Paradise secured for the city  to be studying certain aspects of the project that will inform both the town and the city,  through the EIR process.  And as I read in the report that you submitted,  there would be regular reports back to the Council on the progress of this project,  and items of concern that come up during the process?  Yeah, I would imagine that would be one of the first decision points the project committee would make,  would be kind of the frequency with which they report back to their governing bodies.  I think like with us not being sewer experts, right, and having to come up to speed pretty quickly,  and if I'm not on the committee, then, you know, we're not going to be able to do that.  And really needing that information, regular updates are going to be pretty essential.  And I also think that the vast majority of Chico citizens who tune into local government meetings  are tuning in right here.  Sure.  And so I think transparent exchange of information in this space is pretty critical to my support for this,  moving forward with this.  I think that would be encouraged for the town as well, so I think the same is true for both of us.  All right.  Will the Council?  Quick question.  Quick comment.  Mr. Mayor.  Mr. Vice Mayor.  I just wanted to say that, not to be repetitive, but to let everybody know that I do share some of the same concerns  that a lot of the emails we have received.  So I do look forward to a, you know, robust and transparent thing,  but none of which come above the fact that we have a sister community next door,  that we really want to do anything that we can to possibly go.  And selfishly, it sounds like us as a city are going to be able to find out,  a little bit more about our systems and have some of those costs covered by this grant  as we delve into and dive into, find out what our wastewater treatment plant is able to do.  So it sounds like it, in the long run, it could actually fiscally save us some money,  just to know the information of what we have going.  So I will support finding out more information and moving forward on this,  and then we'll make a decision later on where we go from there.  All right.  And I have a comment also, if that's okay.  Sure.  Based on Councillor Brown's question, thank you very much for that.  That sort of clarified that this is really a research portion of the process  where it really does open the whole thing up to community inspection  and transparency to a wider range of people than what has previously been done.  I think that changes my mind about,  at least entering into this phase of the agreement.  So thanks for that.  So, all right.  Mr. Martin.  My history is a little fuzzy.  This came up before, years ago.  Paradise was looking at doing this, and they wanted us to split the cost of everything,  and I think we gave them a hard no because it's like we can't honestly do that.  This is a much better approach.  Obviously times have changed.  As everybody pointed out, we're just talking about doing a study.  It's like, okay, relax.  I know the town manager for Paradise a little bit.  I obviously know Katie.  And I know they're not going to try to do anything that's going to harm the city of Chico.  I feel good about getting into any kind of cooperative work agreement with them,  especially if it helps Paradise and it's good for Chico.  I think there's a lot of things that could come out of this,  and I know you said this is different than the water line,  but we have to look at the whole chessboard,  and maybe eventually this leads into that.  These discussions have to happen for the good of Paradise,  for the good of the city.  We might be separated by 12 miles or 15 miles,  but at the end of the day, it's the same community.  So I would move to approve the cooperative work agreement,  and then in like fashion with the town of Paradise,  appoint our mayor and our vice mayor to be our city's representatives  because that's what their town did.  That would be my motion.  I probably should have asked you guys.  I'll second it.  How about that?  I'll second it.  That's my agreement to serve on committee number 10.  All right.  Further discussion now.  Let's move forward with the vote.  Madam Clerk.  Councilmember Brown.  Aye.  Councilmember Denley.  Aye.  Councilmember Huber.  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan.  No.  Councilmember Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Councilmember Lig.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  We are actually going to take a break in the closed session  because one of the items that we have for closed session  actually could possibly affect our discussion on item 5.2.  And in the past, council has had closed session sometimes before meetings,  sometimes after.  But we're going to take item 7.2,  conference with real property negotiator in closed session,  and then we will continue the council meeting as we return here shortly.  Thank you.  And subsequently, we will have a report out from closed session at that time.  So we will reconvene with a meeting,  with a report out of closed session by City Attorney Andrew Jurd.  The record should reflect that the City Council recessed into closed session at 7.45 p.m.  There was one item to discuss, item 7.2,  conference with real property negotiators.  The item was discussed.  Direction was provided to City Manager Orme.  And the City Council recessed from closed session at 8.10.  Includes a report from closed session as of this item.  All right.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.  And thank you for everybody's patience at home and here.  We're going to move on to item 5.2,  which is creating sheltering options.  And we will start with City Manager Orme,  but also I believe you're going to kick this off and introduce Suzy for us as well.  Sure.  I will just kick it off by saying that the City Council authorized staff to hire a Homeless Solutions Coordinator.  The City has been fortunate to have Ms. Cockhams on board as Homeless Solutions Coordinator for the past number of months.  She's diligently worked hour after hour with many service providers, the county, the State of California, you name it.  She's been meeting with them and just been trying to come up with some options for Council to take a look at.  So tonight, you're seeing some of those options before you.  We are going to continue to diligently look for other opportunities.  But this is what you have before you tonight.  So with that, I'll pass it over to Suzy and thank her for her dedicated service.  So take it away, Suzy.  Thank you, Mr. Orme.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and Council members.  As a community, we are faced with a sheltering and housing crisis that only serves to exacerbate the public health crisis we are facing with the pandemic.  As the City's Homeless Solutions Coordinator, it is my job to provide options for Council to consider.  These options must provide our most vulnerable population with safe places to sleep to protect our entire community.  Over the last seven months, intensive time has been spent with service providers, advocates, and stakeholders discussing opportunities, approaches, and planning for what is hoped to be pilot projects in our community.  That of safe camping and non-congregate sheltering.  The projects proposed will take total time.  And funding to execute appropriately.  City staff will continue to seek out opportunities for funding in collaboration with our partners, the county, and the COC.  But that will take precious time, which is fleeting.  As elected officials, you are continually being confronted with making difficult decisions to help protect the health and safety of our entire community, which are often controversial in nature.  With that being the case, staff is offering a number of options.  We will be offering, for your consideration, some potential options that will help fulfill the desire of living in a beautiful community that is safe and clean.  If it pleases the Council, I would like to take staff's recommendations one by one for discussion.  There's a lot in this item.  I think we'd like to do that, but what we'd like to do is at least have you just read them into the record and then we'll take public comment.  And then we'll go back and approach each item individually.  Absolutely.  The gist of what I'm getting from the Council in terms of our will.  Okay.  The City Manager recommends that the Council consider the following.  Item 1, authorize the use of city-owned land at 2352 Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway to establish an outdoor shelter, in parentheses, legal camping environment.  Item number 2, direct staff to return to the March 2, 2021 meeting should the fundraising efforts to raise $600,000 to fulfill the relocation of the park.  Item 3, authorize staff to use $282,934, a Community Development Block Grant, Coronavirus Funding, in relation to the issues of homelessness, and to take steps necessary to implement its use.  item 4 authorize the use of $250,000 in general fund dollars to support the efforts of the Chico  housing action team to secure a long-term lease for a non-congregate shelter site which will  contribute to the advanced program engagement options for unsheltered populations item 5  consider the use of $400,000 in general fund dollars to support the hard costs which are  one-time costs required to implement the outdoor shelter environment should funding from the  continuum of care for alternative sheltering options not be available in the next 60 days  consider the use of $200,000 in general fund dollars to support the operational costs required  to begin operating the outdoor shelter environment should funding from the continuum of care for  alternative sheltering options not be available in the next 30 days and item 7 evaluate and provide  direction on any other information contained herein as it relates to  identification of non-congregate sheltering options for unsheltered populations and the  identification of non-congregate sheltering options for unsheltered populations and the  unhoused population to include the safe parking proposal.  All right.  So at this point in time, let's take public comment.  Jane, would you?  You're doing the solo act now, so we'll give you a little time, but there are an extensive  amount of contacts on this, correct?  Correct.  There are 121 comments.  And engaged.  Okay.  51 public comments, and then there were numerous emails sent to regular email.  Yeah, and then I think we probably all got another 100 or 200 emails on top of it, so.  Mayor Coolidge?  Yeah.  Just a point of clarification.  Did we complete the staff report portion of the presentation?  Well, yeah, I mean.  That's all that's being presented to us about these options?  Yes.  I was asked to keep it.  I was asked to keep it brief because the discussion was going to be lengthy.  Okay.  I appreciate you clarifying.  And I think we should ask questions, but I think we should do that as we move through each issue.  Sure.  Yeah, I was just expecting a little bit more of a robust conversation.  Okay.  Or presentation.  And I can ask this after we read all these comments.  It's impossible to go through these one by one.  Well, some of them are linked.  I just want to make sure.  I mean, I think we can have a general conversation as we move through item one.  We could include.  We could include, obviously, item two and three, something of that nature.  Okay.  Well, so since we're sitting here, can I ask you a couple of questions?  Because there's no point in you standing there while we read through all this stuff.  Sure.  Item two, $600,000 to move the BMXers.  The block grant, item three, can that, roughly, $300,000 be part of one and two or no?  No.  Why?  The CDBG coronavirus funding has to be linked, have the nexus to COVID response.  I don't think moving the BMX truck would be that nexus.  Okay.  Can item three be linked to item four?  Yes.  All right.  Item five, that $400,000, is in relation to item one?  Or is that completely different?  No, it is.  Well, it's linked to...  So, if you make a decision to use of the property, whether you make a determination to go towards a legal camping environment or towards tiny houses, that's what that money was.  Okay.  So, after we had $600,000 to move, the BMX fund would need $400,000 in general fund dollars for one-time hard costs.  And then another $200,000 to start operating it.  Yes.  So, those are all linked.  Yes.  Thank you.  Can I ask a follow-up question?  Sure.  Okay.  Later in the report, it says that there is a donor that is offered.  $300,000, as long as the other $300,000 for the BMX site is earned or raised.  How are we being asked to approve $600,000 when $300,000 is spoken for?  Yeah, you're not being asked to approve $600,000 for the BMX relocation.  In essence, what is occurring is there's been an effort afoot for staff to try to coordinate raising of funds for the BMX site.  So, if we're going to do a BMX relocation, there has been an anonymous donor.  And they said that they would be willing to give $300,000 if the other $300,000 could be raised by the community.  And so, obviously, there's nothing in writing, so that could go away.  But I think that the effort here is to say, highlight the fact that community, we need some donations in order to get that other $300,000 so that we can relocate them so we have a full parcel available for potential use if it's council's desire.  Okay.  But if we allocate $600,000, that $300,000 donation would go away and we would be on the hook for all of that?  Yeah, we're not asking for $600,000 in this report for the BMX relocation.  Okay, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.  Yeah.  To return in March 2nd.  Yeah.  Right, that would be the request.  Yeah, so basically what I'm doing is this allows, this enables city staff to ensure that the public is aware that we need to raise dollars to get the relocation.  Yeah.  That BMX completed.  And so, by putting it in the staff report and saying we're going to come back in 30 days if the community hasn't been able to support that effort, it highlights it once again to come back, if it's council's desire, to say, look, we're about $100,000 short.  And I can bring that back to council.  Council can have that dialogue.  Hey, is this something maybe we want to try?  Or is this something that we need to have an additional push for another month to see if we can get this additional $100,000?  I'm not recommending that council fund that.  I've tried that three times now.  Yeah.  And so, that's not the recommendation.  That's not the recommendation in this report.  Okay.  Can I have a follow-up to your follow-up?  Please do.  First, a statement, because I'm getting emails even now that people are like, support the city manager's recommendations or reject the city manager's recommendations.  And city manager's only, the only recommendation is we consider these things.  So, it's like, yeah, we're doing that.  Number two.  So, if the citizens raise.  Then, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get, you get,  this site costs twice as much  because we've got to move somebody out of there.  And we're just hoping somebody else pays for it.  Okay.  So I have another question on the same topic.  Be a follow up to my follow up to her follow up.  That's correct.  In addition to this meeting and staff report,  are there other ways that we're putting the word out  that we're looking for donors to this project?  Yeah, there's been a lot of personal contact made  with individuals that may be willing or able.  And so that has been happening for months.  And so it will continue to happen.  It's my hope.  I will tell you, there are some very generous people  in this community.  And there is already one individual that said,  if Council does decide to move forward  on this type of project utilizing that space,  that they would be willing to help  in that fundraising effort.  Because city staff, we can get projects done,  but we're really not built  to go fundraise.  So we're going to continue to strive to do that,  but we need help.  And so there is somebody who's willing to help.  And I also know there's been council members  that have been willing to reach out  to their constituencies as well,  which has been very, very helpful.  And that's candidly, I think how we got  to the anonymous donor.  So for whatever that's worth.  Yep.  Mayor Coolidge, if I may.  Yeah.  I want to slightly like hit a timeout button  if I have one.  I'm just picturing myself sitting at home  because I was recently there in this environment.  We've already discussed,  recommendation one, two, and three  in like the last five minutes.  And I don't think the community members  have any idea where we're at.  If we can, my personal recommendation,  because these are a lot of very large dollar amounts,  many of which are related to the general fund,  really think it would be prudent  for community transparency to address these one at a time.  And we're already like very far into it.  I do.  And I would like us to do public comment  at this point in time.  So let's do the public comment aspect.  Let's read through that while Danny,  you go ahead and help us out on that.  And then we'll come back.  Susie, we'll have you bouncing up and down a little bit  here tonight on some of these questions.  But I think some of them we can group together, but yeah.  Okay.  And engaged.  And there may be people that have made comments  in both places.  So you might hear their name twice.  Angela Risden, Steven Marquart, Jessica Giannola,  Jessica McKenzie, Andrea Martin, Katie VanderWaal-Cook,  Karen Wilhout, Cynthia Contreras,  Melis Bonifacio-Jerez, Sharon DeMeyer, Mary Kay Benson,  Heather Clark, Samuel White, Swan Perkins, Ryan Sanders,  Ira Robles, Mary-Lisa Wood, Rebecca Sanoglu, Jim Burfriend,  Tammy Swanson, David Hare, Veronica Coates, Amy Stolman,  Jessica Bender, Andy Wilhout, Taylor Skinner,  Hulya  O'Dauming, Alicia Trader, Mary Lopez, Lenita Federchuk,  Anthony Jones, Susie Ling, Casey Kroninger, Mark Cechuloyne,  Teresa O'Connor, Andrew Puckett, Tammy Oshbaugh, Mary Anderson,  Karen Laszlo, Mark Kopelwatz, Ciceri Sherry, Mike Trollander,  Dave Cornett, Tom Valentino, and  Kim Knott, Rhiannon Felipe, Michelle Gawley, Susan Carter,  Anika Hendry, Douglas DeSoto, Becky Strosner, Louise Lee,  Emily Toole, John Coleman, Patrick Spillman, Corey Johnson,  Deanne Allen, Wahoon Wong, Stephanie Stomp,  Dolores Cornett, Lisa Salzman, Katherine Jackson, Kelly Steven,  Nancy Park, Brandi O'Rengeren, Anna Marquez, Mason Wong,  George Dees, Suzanne Hermanson, Amy Wheeler, Rose Stolen,  Stephanie DeMichelle Cockrell, Melissa Antonowich, Harrison Pratt,  Adam White, Ray Flores Owen, Naomi Beckman-Strauss, Rice Goldstein,  Anna Moore, Tom Daz, Carolyn Arp, Heather Lyon, James Joseph,  Katie Schaefer, Melissa MacKerris, Ed Houlihan, Katherine Dosbach,  Mary Grace Schwartz, Teresa Juhlt, Melanie O'Hara, Kate Roark,  Zoe DiMacurio, Chaz Kelly, Deborah Jones, Steven Breedlove,  Diana Wright, Roger Breedlove, and !

And that's all.  So I will mention that Lisa Currier sent an email with video comments.  I saw it.  Okay.  Everybody else see that?  There was a video.  Okay.  And just again for the public at home watching, so we're reviewing the comments that people submitted.  There were obviously quite a few.  We're going to try to do that.  Most of us try to keep up on them as they come in over the last couple of days.  But we do obviously get some pretty late in the game, so we want to make sure to read all of them  prior to moving forward and having a discussion on the issue.  So that's what we're doing at this point in time.  So your TV volume didn't disappear.  We're just being silent because we're going through these individual comments and ask for your patience.  Thank you. [inaudible]  All right, everyone, thank you.  All right, everyone, thank you. [inaudible]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I will preface that by saying I'm not 100% positive if that coronavirus CDBG funding can be used for acquisition, but the nexus is there to COVID response.  Yeah, we wouldn't be talking about acquisition.  Long-term lease, yeah.  So that would be for a short-term lease?  A year.  Right, for a year.  So the next thing is it would be, I'm sorry, excuse me, up to a year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the property might, we might be able to make that purchase any time up to that year.  And our request would be that CHAT would be provided that funding to use for the lease for the extent of time that that's necessary.  And we are anxious to buy it as soon as possible.  But that if we could obtain the entire amount of money rather than just basing it on how many months we end up leasing,  because we are going to need funding to help operate it as well, this would just be to gain possession of the property.  We would still need assistance through that means that could help us to run the property.  Because we're going to need a good amount of case management.  We have to work with it.  Okay, so, but now we're like completely off the agenda.  Yeah.  All we can talk about is what's here.  So, and what I see here is $280,000 of money that doesn't come from the general fund that can help CHAT, who you know I'm supportive of,  but immediately set up a long-term lease for a non-conjugate shelter, which arguably we need and could use.  And whatever you decide to do with it in the future or in the next year or all these other things.  In the meantime, the state is literally throwing money at people for COVID and homeless things to buy hotels and things of that nature.  So, not personal to CHAT, but it's almost offensive that somebody would ask us to spend general fund money on things like that  when the state in its infinite.  wisdom is pouring money out to do that.  And when I asked the county, did you guys apply for any of that?  No, no, no.  We were busy hiring people.  But those two things together make perfect sense.  They're on the agenda just that way.  Three and four.  We could be like, yeah.  So, why don't we follow with, because this is very complicated in terms of bringing these together.  What I was really seeking to do is.  Table that discussion based upon a premise that obviously isn't true.  So, why don't we move back to what we were doing in terms of discussing maybe option one and two and three together if we like.  What's the will of the council?  Mayor Coolidge, if I may.  Please.  Would it be possible for some of us to make sort of big picture comments about the.  I think we can make big picture comments.  What I really want to stay away from is each of us, you know, going off for three minutes on each of these items.  And, you know, having an excruciating long time where we're, you know, rounding up the entire homeless discussion in a 21 minute dialogue from seven different people when the public didn't have that.  So, I know everybody's respectful of that.  I just want to make sure we don't end up there.  So, fire away.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, I don't have three minutes on each of the seven items.  Just two minutes on sort of the big picture and then some questions about some of the others.  So, my appeal is to my fellow colleagues.  You'd be hard pressed to find a topic that's agreed upon more than the need for solutions to the ever increasing number of people lacking housing in our city.  At the same time, there's general agreement that when COVID is finally behind us, there will undoubtedly be a wave of evictions that forces even more people out of housing.  We are unprepared for that possibility.  Scores of letters and editorials keep telling us to.  Just solve it.  We hired a homeless service coordinator to just solve it.  Here again are some options that won't completely solve it, but will certainly reduce not only some of the suffering and deaths we see among the folks without housing, but will also reduce many of the impacts on our community by providing authorized and regular shelter at many levels.  From a simple regulated campground to places where people living in their cars can sleep.  To a non-congregate shelter facility operated by CHAT, a proven, reliable partner.  These are real solutions that get people off the street and into places where service programs may be able to provide an exit from homelessness.  Of course, they require an investment.  But I'm willing to bet that investment is significantly less than the cost of policing, enforcement, removal, siting, booking, incarceration, overdoses, ambulance calls, emergency room visits,  fire, and even more.  And debris removal.  All of these costs have been shown through numerous studies to plummet when shelter and services are provided.  Show this community that we are willing to try solutions.  Not everything will work.  It rarely does.  But don't let that stop us from doing what leaders do.  Which is making the tough decisions when they're the rightful.  Right decisions.  These options are our best hope for making all of our lives a little better.  I yield.  All right.  Thank you.  And I, you know, in hindsight here, maybe discussing each one of these individually is near impossible.  So, but I would like to ask a question.  And so let's do it this way first.  Are there any more questions for our staff members?  I have a question.  I have a question for Ms. Leslie.  Why we still have you up there.  Yes.  So just to be clear, with $250,000 in a relatively quick amount of time, you can secure the townhouse motel short the 10 beds that the Torres shelter is moving this time.  But the other 20 rooms would be fully available.  Because it's about 30-ish rooms, if I'm not mistaken, somewhere around there.  Would be fully available in a relatively short order.  That's our understanding.  Okay.  Suzy has talked to the owner directly.  The owner today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  About that specific question.  Because knowing that non-conjugate sheltering is the direction of the state and everything everybody is pushing for, that is obviously, you know, a very attractive deal to getting us to where we need to be in a relatively short amount of time.  So thank you for the confirmation on that.  I do have another question for Leslie.  Yes.  So I understand it's a bigger lot.  How many parking lots could we have some of the cars could be parked there?  As we were talking about using the ride-and-share place for people to park their cars and shelter in them.  Could some of the area of that motel be used for that as well?  Oh, that might be possible.  That isn't something we've talked about, but that's an interesting idea that I think...  Because I understand it's a whole acre lot and there's a small building there.  So you have plenty of...  Open room there, too.  Yes, there is a lot of space there.  That's true.  And that open space is what they plan on expanding the units to.  So it's a rather large parcel that's...  A portion is unoccupied with buildings, they should say.  So that's where they plan on expanding and adding...  But as of now, we can use it if we need it.  Well...  It's your turn.  Yeah, we're getting into a question where we're asking service providers and staff who might not have that...  Expertise that gets more into a planning land use issue.  Sure.  And any restrictions on parking requirements under the code, things of that nature.  So it's a good concept, but there would need to be more analysis...  Definitely.  Before we make any decisions based on what these folks are saying.  I was just clarifying if that could be an option going forward.  Of course, I understand we might not be able to make a decision right away.  Thank you.  I have a quick question.  About items 5 and 6.  It looks like, just based on what I'm reading here, that the city is, and or in collaboration with a service provider,  is intending to pursue funding from the continuum of care to cover the costs of 5 and 6.  But we're being asked to allocate that funding in case that funding cannot be secured through the continuum of care.  Is that correct?  Yes.  So there are multiple...  Issues with that.  Number one, it is continuum of care funding.  It's regional funding, so they have to RFP it out.  Number two, it's probably a good six to eight months out from happening.  Sure.  And there's multiple pots.  So I would say the first pot that we're discussing is six to eight months out.  And other ones are further behind that.  And the cost to operate, whether it's a camping environment or a tiny house environment, is going to be expensive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We received from one service provider, it was about 800 and some odd thousand dollars.  And it had a lot of holes in it just by my review.  You guys probably saw it.  There's several things that isn't included in there.  So we're probably talking one to $1.2 million a year to run such an environment.  So although the COC will have some of that funding, I would presume, that's not a guarantee.  So this is like backfilling or helping getting it off the ground before that money shows up.  That makes sense.  Sorry.  Quickly.  And then that funding, could that funding be used to reimburse for costs already incurred?  Good question.  Depends on the funding source.  So one of the funding sources is ESG funding, Emergency Solutions Grant funding.  That is all reimbursement money.  Sure.  So we have to expend it.  Whoever we are, is it Chad or Jesus Center, City, whomever, has to be expended first and then reimbursed.  So to answer your question, yes.  That funding would work for that.  Okay.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Yep.  So and it's how much?  Did you say $1.2 million?  And that's a guesstimate at this time.  But yes, about $1 million to $1.2 million.  And for how many people is that?  On the camping environment, we recommended 40 tents and up to 50 people.  In the tiny house environment, 30 units, up to 40 people.  Some of those would be, you know, husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend.  All on the same property?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Two phases.  I have a couple questions.  In reading the staff report on page four, I noticed, which I liked, was it said,  accountability measures should remain in place to guard against persons from other communities  taking advantage of Chico's efforts to better the lives of its residents.  I am curious.  I just noted that it said should remain in place.  And I was unaware of anything in place that does guard against persons coming from other communities.  I know that's a really large concern.  I'm concerned from people that maybe new things are going to draw folks in.  What measures are in place to ensure that?  Yeah.  Well, there are measures that we can put in place, although they may not be popular to some folks.  And I know I've worked in other jurisdictions where they have required residency requirements for programs.  That's an accountability measure that taxpayers want to make sure they're serving people that contributed to the financial environment of the city or the jurisdiction.  Currently, I know the accountability measure is not in place.  I don't think there's any accountability measures that we have going on thus far or primarily through law enforcement.  But I don't think they, you know, ask for IDs as they're going out and doing their work.  There's going to be accountability at the environments, whichever route we decide to go,  with respect to keeping things clean and tidy and organized.  And there will be rules, obviously.  So that level of accountability will undoubtedly take place.  Okay.  Thank you.  I was super curious because it said,  should remain in place, and my ears kind of perked up that maybe that was already happening.  But that looks like we could consider it.  Mr. Mayor, to elaborate on what Ms. Kochan was saying,  the accountability measures regarding residency and things of that nature,  we should really use caution with those.  There are specific aspects of that.  I don't want to give the impression that it's an absolute way  of controlling things.  So it really needs to be taken into account what that's going to mean.  And while it has been applied in other jurisdictions at other times,  we really need to look at that carefully.  Okay.  That makes sense.  One other thing, since we were kind of bouncing around on the three and four a little bit here  with the block grant and then the $250,000 that was needed by chat,  and we're kind of living there right now,  so I'll just take a moment to address just a question I had on that with the CDBG,  CV, it's a mouthful, funds.  I don't know who can clarify that, but it's my understanding  that those don't necessarily have to go towards sheltering,  that they could go towards any range of eligible activities that prevent and respond to the spread  of infectious diseases, not just sheltering.  I just, I wanted to be able to consider that that's not money we're sitting on.  It has to go somewhere.  That could also be used to possibly outfit the chambers for public attendance  to reduce the spread of coronavirus.  So that was just a side note on that.  We don't have to use the grant.  And I'll save the rest of my comments for when we get into other areas.  All right.  So, Council Member Huber, if you can hold on a second.  We've had some people haven't talked.  Any, at this point, I just want to do questions.  So, and on any of these particular items before we move forward to making motions or anything like that.  So does anybody else have any questions?  Okay.  Mr. Huber, go ahead.  Thank you.  Susie, regarding item number seven,  which is,  essentially, a catch-all.  A few months ago, the previous council wrote off the airport as a camping option.  Is the airport still an option if this council wanted to revisit it?  I don't see why not.  What are your thoughts, City Manager?  In that environment, it would take a declaration, probably, from me to be able to do that.  Unless we can, yep.  And so, I'm not sure.  Obviously, we had shared the cost of doing that.  And so, I think there's a misimpression that the City Manager can just go do it every once.  And I just want to quash that.  The purse strings are controlled by the council.  And the City Manager can do nothing without funding.  And so, I think it's important just to affirm that, yes, potentially, any property that the City Council deems may be appropriate could be used.  And, and, I think that's a good point.  I can use that authority that you've designated to me to move forward.  But I can only do it with funding to support that effort.  So, I hope that brings a little clarity on that one.  Do we still have the funding figures that were originally developed on that?  It was around $700,000 at the time.  And so, but, yeah, the funds weren't appropriated.  So, yeah, that didn't move forward.  I know you know that.  All right.  Thank you.  So, any other questions?  So.  Yeah.  The direction being asked to authorize the use of the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway site as a legal camping environment is contingent upon the funding being raised for the BMX property to move forward.  And we wouldn't engage in further discussion about the makeup of that program until after those things occurred.  Is that correct?  Or are we being requested to allocate funding for that today?  So, there's two phases that we proposed.  Yeah.  Phase one would be the legal tempy.  Tent camping environment or outdoor sheltering as I prefer to call it.  Got it.  That is on the western edge of the property which is not currently being utilized by the BMX.  That's number five, $400,000 on this.  Well, that $400,000 or $200,000 can go to either one, the outdoor sheltering or the tiny house village.  Got it.  For the tiny house village to be set up, then obviously BMX would have to move because that's on the eastern side of the parcel.  Great.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Okay.  You guys can sit down if you'd like.  I actually have a question for our city attorney or Mr. Orme if you would.  I think Leslie had something to say.  You had something you wanted to add?  I did because I wasn't sure I was being clear.  But if there were to be a motion for this CDBG money or otherwise, I was wanting to ask that it be a little bit more broad than just to say that it has to be for the lease.  That could be for lease and operations.  And then I don't believe that it's specified in terms of what I wanted to ask for.  Thank you.  Is that correct, Mr. City Manager?  It's whatever the council motions have.  Yeah, I think we're good.  Yeah, it was a general.  Okay.  Understood.  All right.  And Mr. Orme or Mr. Jarrod, either of you can answer this or together.  So I have some real hesitations about the safe parking proposal just because of the liability that actually was on the proposal.  I think that's what I actually encourage.  But could you tell us a little bit about that process with our friends over at Caltrans and how that would actually function and how long that would take?  So I can have Ms. Cockham speak to that.  She spoke with Caltrans and has the latest and greatest information on that front.  Okay.  Perfect.  Yes.  So although probably many of your comments said that this is a solution that could be up and running rather quickly, that is a false statement.  And speaking with the regional manager, there is a massive process whereby the Federal Highway Administration has to approve the use of the space.  And right now they are not approving any of those.  They don't necessarily agree with the governor's executive order to use those properties.  So there's been one in the entire state that's made it through the process.  Okay.  And it's been approved.  Obviously not in our area.  It's in Southern California.  So every other one is getting squashed.  So there is obviously some lengthy process that needs to take place.  And the final answer may still be no.  Okay.  So it sounds like it's probably not a viable option, at least at this time with the state and the feds going back and forth on it.  Mr. City Attorney Andrew Jarrett, what's your comments on said findings and whether something like that would be something we should move forward on?  Okay.  Well, I mean, besides the issue of the timing of it and the bureaucratic hurdles, there could be liability issues.  We need to look into those.  I am not – there are other solutions that are presented here that have certain immunities provided.  I am not aware of any immunities that are provided in this park and ride shelter use.  All right.  Thank you.  Just to kind of further our discussion here so everybody is aware of this because I want the community aware of this too.  So there has been discussions with some Butte County supervisors who feel that they can move the discussion forward with the supervisors to perhaps put some money towards, you know, campsite or tiny house or something along those lines that they could look at possibly doing behavioral health, wraparound behavioral health services.  I mean, that's where I get all of that, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, with  discussing that. You know, certainly I'm not crazy about the general fund  dollars. I think everybody knows that. But I think it would make sense to do  one of two things and that would be either to use the community block  grant to, as Mr. Morgan suggests, to go straight to authorizing chat because  that's the fastest it seems to actually getting people into rooms and about the  same number we'd be looking at at a campsite. Or to explore the campsite,  bring in the county a little more, use that money for that, but then you're back  to what are we going to do with chat. So I think I'd like to see some of our  discussion center around that. But I don't know what anyone else's opinion is.  I have some more questions if now is a good time. Fire away. Okay, I think these are  probably going to be for you, Susie, if that's okay. Sorry, up, down, up, down. I was  just curious. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the  community block grant. I'm curious. I've heard a lot of questions about this and I was also curious. I was kind of hoping to see something on here. Is there any possibility, okay, I guess I can start with this. When does the Jesus Center start construction on their facility? Do you know?  So, two different projects. One project is opening April 1st is the last I heard. And then the other site will happen later on, obviously. And last I spoke to Laura at the Jesus Center, some of their  upstairs was still being designed on the other side. So, April 1. Okay. So, from your conversations with them, do you hear any kind of feedback that may be on that side that's farther delayed in the process? Since they're still in planning, it sounds like, would they be willing to open a parking lot or tent facility on their property and operate it since they're not currently doing something on that side?  Several community members did CC me on emails that they sent to Laura Kutson.  Okay.  The executive director. And she articulated very nicely why that's not going to happen and why they're not considering it. I don't recall exactly every word that she said, but basically that property is already spoken for and they're, you know, making plans for it that bringing people in to stay there is not part of the plan.  Okay. All right. Well, thank you. I think that was the only one I had for you. My next question was mostly for the attorney, I believe.  Okay.  I was curious.  Okay.  If we could hear, I've heard a lot of weight behind the Martin Luther King BMX site camping environment. Could you share any kind of insight into liabilities we might be accruing by opening an outdoor sheltering environment there, being that the goal would be more than likely that it would be temporary and we may be ending that at some point?  Depending on what process we used to facilitate that.  Okay.  And make it happen. Certain immunities might apply. So the housing crisis declaration in particular. The emergency shelter or the emergency declaration as well. But, yeah, anytime the city touches something, there is the potential for the city to be sued for something that happens.  Okay.  The liability is always a concern.  Yeah. And then the one last thing and then I'll pass the mic.  So based on the kind of liability discussion with BMX, I was curious if City Manager Orm, if you could kind of educate us on the status of easements for the BMX. Since, again, that kind of brings me back to the liabilities as far as emergency route access kind of ties into the liability aspect.  Yeah. So I'll kind of give a little bit of a jump back, a little bit of history on that.  So one of the properties that the city evaluated as a potential opportunity.  Yeah.  And the one that was a potential opportunity site was the state fairgrounds. And so when we engaged with the state fairgrounds, we asked them if there would be an opportunity to have campers there. And that was one of those that the community kind of coalesced around and saying, hey, look, this might be a good opportunity. Obviously, they had some experience with that through the campfire. And so they had reason to say it can't work this time. There were fires underway. There was a lot going on. And their facilities were overburdened, candidly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so what we did is we transitioned into the secondary question of, well, if we can't seize an opportunity to collaborate on that to help with the homelessness population, then is there an opportunity maybe to grant us an easement onto their property, which is paved and it goes along the fence line, so that if there is emergency access necessary, that we could have the legal right to go on there and access that point if there's an emergency.  That was back in November. We had that dialogue, I believe.  And unfortunately, they have not discussed that as a board yet.  However, they are going to be potentially discussing it in February now.  And there were a lot of things that were kind of thrown back at me as to, well, we could do this.  We could do an intergovernmental agreement, or we could potentially do this.  So they're throwing a lot of different options out there.  But at this point in time, we do not have an easement secured on the backside of that property.  Currently, there's a point of access from Martin Luther King Jr. to the property.  And there's a point of access from Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway.  And then there is also potentially, which is not a throughfare right now, through two leaseholds that the city owns the land on, with obviously the tourist shelter being the first, and there's a secondary use behind it.  Potentially, there is a point of access there, but that's not feasible at this time.  So you only have one feasible point of entry off of Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway.  Without the easement on the other side, the emergency access is made more difficult.  So that's what we're doing on the easement right now.  It makes it tricky.  And I do know that Silver Dollar Fairgrounds, they want to work with us, but I know that working through the state of California isn't the easiest thing.  And they're a local board, but they have to work through the state in order to get those types of things.  So I'm patiently working through that with them.  So, mm-hmm.  .  Sure.  All right.  All right.  Follow-up, council?  I have a little comment.  Okay.  Any questions?  No, it's just an observation and comment on it.  I do understand that we do need a temporary alternate campsite facility at this point, but definitely not going to use the general fund money.  It would be preferred if we can help from the county, and as I understand that our mayor and vice mayor have worked with the county representatives, and we should be able to find a solution.  And also I want to bring it to the attention that we do have 734 affordable units in the pipeline, which should be ready in the next two years.  And these have 60 beds which should be available hopefully by the first week of April.  I spoke with Laura today, and I wanted to check if those beds are already accounted for, or if they will be open when they open in the first week of April.  And it seems like that those beds are already in the first week of April.  So I would strongly encourage that if we do that, we should make sure that those beds would be available for take-ins as soon as they open in April at their new location.  And we are also aware that Taurus Shelter has 50 beds expansion approved already, but of course we do not know the timeline on that.  So I would highly encourage that if we do the BMX track outdoor campsite, we should strictly make it a temporary project so we can connect with the local community.  And we should also make sure that we connect the people with the required services instead of making it a long-term solution, and people should not feel that they can come and camp there indefinitely.  That they should come there, address their issues, connect with the right service providers, and exit the system at some point.  I mean, we've been listening to this over the years, that this much money is spent, this much money is spent.  So I think that's a good thing.  But are we bringing people out of the homelessness and making themselves sufficient?  Or getting them the care they need?  Discussion of spending the money is great, but where is the results?  It breaks my heart to see.  The reason I say that, because back home, we do not have anything like that.  If you don't work, you cannot provide food on the table.  You do not have clothes on your body.  You do not have belongings to carry around with you if you're poor.  We have a wonderful, great system.  I would like us to work together and find some solutions.  These people, I mean, we all know they're humans.  We all want to see, help them.  But you know how much?  How much thought we put in by a present for somebody we love?  It's another human we're talking about.  So I would really like to see us all come together and find the solutions,  instead of trying to see who should get the win that we did this for the homeless people.  You guys are not doing it, or I'm not doing it.  It really breaks my heart when I see that.  We should all be motivating everybody to get into the shelters one way or the other,  instead of supporting that camping in the parks is the best option right now.  It is not.  It is not for any human being to live in that situation.  So I would encourage all of us to work together and find a solution,  which I know is not an easy one.  But what I would like to recommend is, first we need to put them together in a place, if we can,  whether it's with CHATS help.  We have so many great service providers.  We should be talking what we have done in this month or year,  because to take it to the next steps.  But instead we are just blaming each other, is what I see.  That's what was my experience at the last EOC meeting,  is how to blame each other as a service provider.  So I hope we can bring some serious thought into this  and try to work together as a team to fight this.  That's it. Thank you.  Thank you.  Alice, before you comment, I just wanted to say,  I had a question for Ms. Kochums again.  So Everhart Village, I know we haven't heard a lot about it because it's a county project.  And I know we have a CHAT representative here.  And you don't have to approach.  You could just tell me.  I know the county said they're expecting it possibly to come online,  around November.  Is that correct, more or less?  I don't know when it's going to come online.  We're still working on contracts and there are a lot of requirements.  But I would think by then, yes.  Okay.  And how many units is that?  That's 20 units for people that are now clients.  Is that right?  Yes.  Okay.  So 20 units, just 20 people, are some of those double occupancy?  You know, a few of them might have couples, but most likely they're all,  but mostly these singles.  Okay. Thank you.  Council Member Brown, go ahead.  Yeah, thank you.  And thank you, Council Member Tandon, for your comments.  I think it's a good lead-in to the conversation that a sanctioned campground,  there are a couple of things.  One, in my time on Council, I've seen and found that a sanctioned, safe sanctioned campground  is a solution that a vast, a broad array of community members can get behind and support.  I'm seeing a little bit of differentiation in terms of where that funding comes from,  and I think we can pick that apart all night.  But a safe sanctioned campground is a service on a continuum of services for people to access  to enter other services.  And so the goal of creating a safe sanctioned campground where people are all in one place  and it's maintained and there's service providers available and services being provided to those folks  is to move them through the process and move them on through that continuum.  I think it is the, it is an option that we have been asking for for months and months and months.  We had a proposal brought to us by the city manager to utilize the airport and to implement a solution,  and it's been a long time coming.  We have a new proposal on the table right now, and I think it's an essential piece to this puzzle  and an essential component to the continuum.  Hopefully, it's temporary.  We're moving people through this process.  We have service providers that are finally stepping up to offer services in the safe sanctioned campground,  and they need the space to do it.  So I'm fully supportive of utilizing general fund dollars to fund that process,  and I feel confident that the continuum of care,  there's an argument to be made with the continuum of care that we can fund this project with additional funding.  So it's sad to hear any inkling that this particular project wouldn't move forward  because we can't find the dollars in the appropriate place.  I really am hopeful that this council will consider a safe sanctioned campground  as a key piece to moving people out of living in the public space  and getting them connected to service providers so that they can move through that continuum.  All right. Anyone else?  Mr. Morgan.  Thank you.  So the BMX site is problematic.  We started looking at it, or we brought it to the city at the Chamber of Commerce State of the City meeting three years ago.  For whatever reason, the G Center moved on and did something else, but that's where we found it.  And to Alex's point, you know, we searched all these places looking for a site.  We could do something immediately, and then another service provider pulled out the last minute,  and then they've come back in, and that's all been wonderful.  As confusing as this conversation is, and including the staff report, and by confusing I don't mean bad.  It's just there's all these different – it's dynamic, right?  And that's why it was literally impossible.  Okay, let's go through this one at a time because it doesn't work.  I mean, that's how I would have preferred to do it too if it would have worked.  So there's people watching at home.  There's 8 million people that have said don't do anything, and another 8 million said do everything.  And I don't know about the rest of you,  but the emails I was getting, there must have been a quirk in the system because I was getting opposite emails from the same people.  I support everything on 5.2.  I support nothing on 5.2.  It was like the same person.  And I realize some of those people have split personalities, but that was a lot.  That's going to come back to bite me.  On the BMX track, $600,000 to move the BMX people to a location they're excited about.  Okay, that's fine.  And there's some economic development.  There's some good stuff if that goes on.  But we've got to get that money, or at least another $300,000.  I may be the only person in the room that knows where the original $300,000 came from.  So if you make that happen, and then you've got another $600,000 that's got to come from the general fund to get that site up and ready to be some kind of temporary thing.  And then there's a question of is somebody going to come and run this thing?  Are we going to run it?  That's a hard no for me.  So then we're wondering after we've raised another $300,000 to the $300,000,  and we've spent another $600,000, can we find someone to come do this to maybe have people want to go there?  So the Torrey Shelter, which now has some of the rooms at that motel, I'm not going to tell you the number, but I know what it is.  I know how many people they've asked to go to the motel that have said yes, they want to go.  It's a really small number.  I suspect that's going to be the same number when we are doing enforcement and ask them to go to a sanctioned campground.  Because people don't want to go to these places.  I was in a meeting with some county officials the other day that we were in,  and one of them said it's a great thing to try to set up these sites to have these people go there,  but that's not the way they want to live.  And for the most part, they don't have the thinking process to do it.  It wasn't because he was being critical of those people, whether it was a mental illness or a drug addiction, he couldn't do it.  I have always, I haven't always, I've been trying to say for the last six months we need to do one thing.  Part of the problem and the challenge for years and years and years as far as us dealing with homelessness,  is what we're trying to do is we're trying to do one thing.  We're trying to do this, this, this, this, this, this.  We're trying to do all this stuff.  We're never going to do it.  That's what the COC does.  That's why I can't look at the COC and find one instance of, I mean there's some of the organizations do some good stuff,  but it's like overall has the COC done a good job?  No.  They try to do everything.  And if we try to do everything, we're going to be nowhere.  And coming into this meeting, I was like we need to be laser focused.  BMX track.  Get it moved.  Get the money.  Put up the tiny houses, maybe campground, maybe, if we can do that, and put all this other stuff aside.  Because if we can't do that, we're going to be nowhere.  If we keep trying to do it and spend money in all these different places, nothing's going to happen.  I fear that's where, and that's why all this other stuff, I'm like I don't even know where the car parking thing and all these things came from.  So I think we need one thing, not 50.  I also think we need to stay out of the provider business.  The second we get in the provider business, it will be ours forever.  So I'm going to make this motion.  And we can pick it apart or make friendly amendments or whatever because we can talk about this ad nauseum.  And understand.  I told Vice Mayor Reynolds yesterday we were talking about this.  She said what do you think is going to happen tomorrow night, tonight?  I said well we're not going to solve homelessness tomorrow night.  I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen.  Okay.  But if we can take a step forward as a council, it will be huge.  Because the only thing that we've done thus far is made things worse.  Not this council.  So I would say we do this.  This is my loose motion.  Allocate the CDBG funding.  The $282,000 and change to chat for the motel and operations to the extent that that can be made possible.  And we're going to continue to wait and see what's happening with the Jesus and the Torrey shelter expansion.  Whatever.  That will give us some immediate space.  But at the same time, we continue fundraising for the BMX and working with the county, which is a new thing.  Literally, it's a new thing.  You've got county supervisors and city council members and staff members from both places.  Saying, well we can do this and we can do this and we can do this.  It's never happened in eight years.  Eight years.  It's never happened.  Staff members, city council, elected, appointed, it was like, wow, we're going to get somewhere.  But if we try to do everything, it's not going to happen.  So I'm not saying shut the door on the BMX.  I'm saying the BMX thing is problematic.  Even if Scott gave me a check for 300 grand tomorrow and we had the whole 600, we still have 800,000 and who's going to run and all these other things.  The only known quantity we have on here is we can take that CDBG money.  We can take that CDBG money.  We can give it to CHAT, who, Dopeca mentioned we have a lot of service providers.  CHAT is one of the quietest and best run.  I mean, they just deliver, deliver.  People have no idea, unless you talk to Bob or Leslie, how effective they are.  It's fantastic.  And one thing I like about them, they're not always coming here banging on the dice asking for more money.  I told the news the other day, they said, why is there so much stuff on here?  I said, because this council asked.  And people were frustrated.  They said, why?  I said, what is, nothing personal, what is the mayor and the city manager putting all this stuff on the agenda for?  I said, because this council said we're willing to open the door and start to do some things and maybe spend some general fund money, which is something we've never really discussed before.  So the homeless solutions coordinator was tasked with, okay, if that's what's going to happen and this is a new direction, her job is to give us options.  And it's really hard to put that all in one bite-sized morsel.  So I just couldn't do it.  I couldn't have done it.  But they said, here's all this stuff.  The last time I saw this was right after the campfire.  Walmart came and said, hey, we've got a million dollars for homeless, right?  It was like putting blood in the water.  All the sharks came.  Homeless providers I'd never heard of.  People that shouldn't be running anything.  Hey, we want to do this.  We want to do this.  Where's the money?  It's like crazy, crazy, crazy.  There's a little bit of that going on.  But we have a chance.  So tonight, let's do one thing.  Let's work with chat.  Let's get them this money.  Let's continue on that road.  I'm not saying close the door to the other stuff.  I'm saying continue to pursue that and see how it plays out.  But if it doesn't play out, and I don't think it's going to, at least we've moved in one direction.  And if they end up buying the hotel or the state buys it for them or there's something else we can do, we can do that as well.  But we're starting to move forward.  It's never happened before.  So I will summarize this after my longest monologue ever.  It's a long motion, too.  That's why I'm summarizing it.  All right.  So here's my motion.  Allocate the $282,000 and change to chat for use of the motel and operations to the extent that that is possible while continuing the discussions on fundraising and with the county, what would they be willing to provide program-wise?  The county has been very upfront.  We don't provide housing.  That's not what we do.  We do programming.  So whether it's at the motel or somewhere else, how are we going to continue?  We're going to continue to do that.  And I suspect some of that discussion will come tomorrow at the horrible committee that you assigned me to.  So point of clarification, because I'm interested, I think, in seconding your motion.  But that won't preclude us from additional motions on additional topics if we vote on this one.  Correct.  Is that correct?  Okay.  I'd like to second your motion.  I would like one answer for clarification from Mr. Orme or perhaps Susie if she could provide it.  How fast, if in fact we move forward on this, do you think we could have?  And perhaps it's a question for chat, too.  Well, let's put it this way.  What's our turnaround time for getting them the money?  It takes a process.  And I think it was outlined in here, but it was the council's going to have to see this item come back to modify.  And if you have all those details.  Yeah.  So because it's CDBG money, there's a plan amendment and things that have to happen.  Okay.  And in my conversations with Marie about use of this money for another project, she defined the process as like 30 to 45 days.  Okay.  Is that 30 to 45 days legally required, 30 to 45 days?  Absolutely.  It's federal money.  Okay.  Not that we can't have a meeting next week and do the second reading or whatever.  We will find the fastest path forward.  But I believe it's legally mandated requirements to have public hearing, noticing, and all these kind of things to modify.  But we'll double check that.  Okay.  And does this claim to be incarcerated and ask for unemployment?  Would that help us get the money back?  If we can look at, you know, if we need to move forward on an emergency meeting prior, I think everybody would be willing to do that.  Can I just interject before we go to a vote?  Because I heard a second and I just need a moment.  And I'll make it very brief.  I heard in the motion, the monologue, we shouldn't ever get involved in providing homeless services.  But you self-identified it.  So I heard in this motion that we shouldn't ever get involved in providing homeless services.  But let's get involved in homeless services.  So are we or are we not in the business of providing shelter?  Does the City of Chico take responsibility for social services?  Has the county exhausted all efforts to create solutions?  Have service providers exhausted every avenue for projects with their resources?  Has the continuum of care exhausted their funding on these solutions?  These questions should make voting on this motion very, very simple.  CDBG-CV funds should first and foremost go towards following through on our responsibilities as a municipality.  And that would include retrofitting the chambers for public attendance because the public deserves to be here.  And with these funds, we could do that while lessening the transmission of COVID.  Let's take care of our responsibilities before we spend dollars on picking up the pieces for other organizations whose responsibility is homeless services.  I expect this stance will be met with the typical counterargument of homeless hater.  However, I simply seek to hold accountable those organizations whose jobs are in the hands of the public.  It is their duty to provide social services.  So that will explain my vote.  So if I can respond, I completely agree.  On the CDBG funds, if that's COVID related, so we could use that to like outfit the council chambers?  It doesn't have to go to homeless stuff?  It's not homeless COVID, it's just COVID COVID?  Yeah, so CDBG funding can be, there's requirements to using the funding.  But it can be used for public services, public infrastructure.  There's two buckets.  One's called community development.  One called community development.  One's called economic development.  In the community development bucket, there's the community or public services, public infrastructure.  And then in economic development, it could, those funding could go to small businesses that were impacted by COVID.  Okay, thank you.  So I agree with everything Ms. Denway said.  The challenge is, this is going to sound super critical, not of you, but of the county.  We're waiting for somebody to lead, and it ain't coming from there.  I did see something that gave me some optimism the other day when some of the electeds and the staff members came together.  And then, I don't know how many people know about this part, a bunch of the appointed officials got together and went, wow, the elected officials are getting together.  I think they're really serious about this.  We might, we should like have a meeting of our own without all of them.  Which is problematic.  But even they started to come together and go, how do we start doing this?  Nothing against the county.  I love the county.  I don't know the county administrator.  I know all the supervisors.  There's been a lack of good, strong, specific leadership, and that includes the COC and some of the service providers, in this realm forever.  Here's, I'm not going to say what I'm afraid to have.  I'm willing to take the first step.  I'm not willing to spend general fund money.  So, I am willing to come halfway, but I understand where Ms. Denley is coming from.  All right.  Any further comments?  Madam Assistant Clerk, when you take the roll.  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Denley?  No.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  No.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  So, since we can still move on and move forward with this conversation, we can do so.  So, are there any other further motions to entertain?  Yes.  So, based on Council Member Tandon's comments, which I really appreciated, it sounded like  there is a willingness in at least the county to have a council meeting.  So, we're starting the process of identifying a place that we can have a campground.  It sounds like the challenge really is that we don't have probably a majority here that  supports spending general fund money to do that.  So, my question is, and I'll turn this into a motion, but my question is, can we approach,  if we approve or authorize the use of that city-owned land to establish an outdoor shelter  subject to or contingent upon receiving those funds from the COC?  I know that we'd like to have it sooner than that, but realistically, it probably won't  happen sooner than that if we're waiting for everyone to agree on where those funds come  from.  So, that is my motion.  That we start by authorizing, by this council authorizing the use of 2352 Martin Luther  King Jr. Parkway to establish an outdoor shelter subject to obtaining funding from the continuum  of care, the $400,000 and the $200,000, respectively.  I'll happily second that motion.  I would wonder if you'd accept a friendly amendment to explore other funding sources  should they arise.  Just to clarify.  So, that there's a little bit more of a broader scope.  Certainly.  Yeah, wholly supportive of that.  I think us letting staff know that this is our intention and that if the dollars were  available, we would want to move forward with the decision on this gives them a little bit  of flexibility to pursue those options.  So, I'm hopeful we can make that statement.  So, Mr. Huber, if I can just clarify.  So, you're saying non-general fund money, if it comes from the COC, could we move forward  if they were to actually provide this?  I don't know.  I mean, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's,  that's, that's, that's, that's, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,  that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,  that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,  that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,  that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,  staff can, mostly Susie, could continue to do the work that she needs to do to find out what our roadblocks are and what we would need to do if we want to use that for some sort of a sheltering environment.  Yes.  Thank you.  So was that not in my original motion?  No.  To continue looking at that spot?  Well, this motion was better.  I don't know if it was specifically in there.  It was not in your motion, but I explicitly caught that we wanted to pursue this for that particular use.  It's because he doesn't talk a lot.  It's true.  I was just giving you a bad time.  This is a long meeting.  You wax poetic.  We've got to do that a little bit.  So, okay.  Can you repeat that, Scott?  I'm sorry.  Sure.  That this council authorized the use of the city-owned land at 2352 Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway to establish an outdoor shelter subject to or contingent upon  obtaining the total of $600,000 from the COC or from some other source to move forward.  So not moving forward with development of that plan until we have secured that money.  I would like to add the word temporary outside camping because we don't want to make it a long term.  We just need it until we...  I would be better if we have temporary housing than permanent.  So that would be up to Mr. Huber and then Ms. Brown to accept that as a secondary.  As long as we don't define what temporary means, then I'm fine with it.  Temporary can mean a lot of things.  For some people, temporary is...  Do you have a clearer definition of the word temporary?  I mean, that is something maybe where Susie can help us.  What is a transition?  If we have some people who come there, that's where probably the accountability piece will fit into.  We can work with them, have them work with the caseworkers, and a plan that you have in place, hopefully, or a service provider can help us define that term.  That it takes eight to ten weeks or an X amount of time for us to coordinate and get people from temporary housing to shelter to transitional housing to permanent housing or what the complete process is.  I'm trying to understand the process myself right now.  So I would really appreciate if you can help with that.  So he'd have to either accept or decline that.  Okay.  So my answer to go to your question, which I really appreciate engaging with you on this, thank you,  is that almost all the service providers that I have spoken to or worked with or around,  their goal, their long-term goal, is to get people out of homelessness and into housing.  For some people, that...  It takes place much quicker than others.  So, yeah, absolutely, the goal of...  I believe the goal of any shelter, whether it's a campground or a congregate shelter or a non-congregate shelter,  should be helping people move towards independence.  But I think specifying a number just doesn't work for everybody.  Right.  Right.  Different people have different abilities to move from one phase to the next.  Okay.  So that sounds like not accepting the motion.  Can I add a quick...  The amendment.  ...question for clarification as the second on the motion?  Council Member Tandon, based on what I'm hearing you say, and correct me if I'm wrong,  it sounds like if wraparound services were included with the sanctioned campground,  where service providers are working on an ongoing basis with these folks and doing case management,  right?  Yes.  ...case management, that that might assuage some of the concern that folks aren't moving toward...  moving further down the...  or up the continuum toward more permanent housing options.  If the friendly amendment included collaboration with a service provider to provide case management services,  would that be amenable to you?  No.  No.  No.  I just need a minute to think about it.  While you're thinking, can I bring up something?  Go ahead.  I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think we're borderlining on making this very, very narrow  because we just gave away all our operational costs.  So now you're saying we're going to make this a shelter if the COC comes through with the $600,000.  That was just hard cost in getting stuff up and going.  And we just lost $282 of whatever of operational costs that was supposed to go to whatever service provider.  So I'm going to be a little bit more comfortable putting this back on Susie  and saying now that you know the direction that we are wanting to go, can you sharpen your pencil?  Can you reach out with the other service providers?  I know personally of two other things that are in the works for potential service providers  that might be willing to come in and help that have money.  So I just, I think saying we're going to turn this into a campground if we get $600,000 from the COC  is just to me way too narrow.  So I'm going to be a no on that.  Somehow I just would like to give the power back to you.  How would you modify?  Can I interrupt for one second?  So I know Council Member Tandon wants to add that clause about temporary,  which if we're talking about the full BMX property,  there could be an outdoor sheltering environment.  Which is designed to be temporary.  But then the tiny houses are going to be more of a longer term step up, if you will,  graduation from a tent to a tiny home.  So I don't want to label the whole BMX property as temporary  because one is going to be more longer term than the tent environment.  And I want to just refresh everybody's memories that this population that we're serving  that's in our parks and in our greenways is the most difficult,  hardest.  And that's the first to serve population.  So they're going to need a little bit more time than three to six weeks  to get from chronic homelessness on the street to a point where they want to agree  to seek treatment or seek a more permanent housing environment.  So I too am a little leery on the really defining things.  Just know that our goal is to provide wraparound services, whatever the environment is,  and to move folks as quickly as we possibly can through progressive programs.  And I think that's a really important part of our program engagement.  So from a tent to a tiny house to a single room and on to permanent housing,  however that works for them.  All right.  Maybe I can do one better.  I know.  So but I want to point a clarification here.  So if in fact we had the COC provide funds, Mr. Arm, and then they were to come back to us,  we'd still have to approve that, correct?  Yeah.  What I would do is if they did have funding coming through and we were successful in doing that,  we would come back for a final approval.  So that's a good point.  One of the things that I think and I think I see a lot of different angles being taken here  on trying to see if there's an openness to allowing that property to be used for something.  And if that is the case, whether it be camping or tiny homes or something,  if somebody could come in and do that, that would enable staff to be able to continue to proceed  to try to get the funds raised to get the BMX relocated, anticipating that that use,  that council's open to that use being used for homelessness issues.  And so I think that's a good point.  That's all we're doing.  We're exploring your ability to go and look for the use rather than to put the full brakes on looking  for the use, which.  And we would come back with the project.  Which you would actually have to come back to the project for the actual specifics,  for the actual dollar funds, whether it's continuing care or anything else.  So I think this just opens the door to the fact that we might be amenable to that property at some point in time.  And if that is your intention, correct, Mr. Hibbert?  Yes, absolutely.  All right.  So Councilmember Reynolds, if you were to, what would you do?  Wordsmith an amendment to what is on the table now so that it sort of fit with what you're thinking.  What would that be?  My direction would be to direct staff to continue to work on a, providing us with more information  on how we could potentially turn the Martin Luther King site into some sort of a shelter.  Sheltering type situation because I'm again, not sure.  Anyways, it would give the staff permission to continue to work down that road.  So if you bring us back and so we can go.  Huh?  I mean, I think the main part of the motion is exactly what Mr. Orme referred to, which is sort of gives them permission to move forward with things.  So keeping the authorized, authorizing the use of the city owned land at 2352 Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway.  To establish an outdoor shelter.  And then what would the rest of the sentence be?  We don't know if we can authorize it to be a shelter.  We don't know if we can authorize it to be a shelter until we have the.  It just, it sets it aside so that they can work on it.  But we can provide some direction to them for just what you were saying, which is research and look into more funding sources and look into other ways that we can.  Finance it and et cetera, et cetera.  Okay, so.  I think that was already in your motion.  Direct staff to continue to move forward on Martin Luther King Parkway.  Correct?  Towards all sheltering options available.  Yeah, so let me help.  What I'm hearing from council is.  There is an openness.  To continuing to evaluate this site for a potential use to help support those who are un-sheltered.  And at this point in time, it's not defined as to what that potential use would be.  And then once the CDBG or whatever funds through the COC.  Additional funds come through staff would return with potential projects that could be used on this site.  I'm hearing that non-general fund dollars.  And that staff would need to work on the type of service provider.  In order to enable those services to be provided, whatever they are.  We would have to come back with a plan.  But it sounds like there is at least an interest in ensuring that staff can continue to relocate the BMX.  To enable this property to become available for a potential project.  That's not really a motion, but I think that's what I'm hearing.  I think that's what you're hearing from multiple folks.  Okay.  I'm not going to say.  That was in my monologue.  I know that was in your monologue.  All right.  So, Mr. Hubert, do you want to one more time restate your motion?  Well, I'm still going to.  Do we need to vote again?  Was that covered in the original motion?  So, was that in the original motion?  The original motion being?  Not Mr. Hubert, but the one that we voted.  Council Member Morgan.  As I heard that one, it was to allocate the CBG money to chat for the hotel purpose.  And.  To continue to raise BMX monies towards the BMX user relocation.  And cooperate.  Do cooperative activities with the county.  There's a little more to that.  Okay.  So, it didn't necessarily name the site.  I don't see these two motions.  Now, the motion on the table from Council Member Hubert, I'm hearing, is essentially item one on the recommendation.  Is that correct?  That's correct.  And.  For staff to research additional uses at the site, essentially.  Yes, and funding.  Yeah.  Uses and funding.  Yeah, not using non-general fund money.  So, that's the motion.  Don't see.  Item number one, and authorize the staff to research additional uses and funding.  So, Council Member, or Vice Mayor Reynolds, your question seems to be, are those two motions, the Morgan motion and the Hubert motion, are they incongruent?  I don't see them as incongruent.  Okay.  So, I'm going to ask you to answer that question.  I think that they deal with a similar, the same site, but in two different ways.  I don't think that they're contradictory.  But that's up to the Council.  Okay.  But ultimately, if we pass his motion, we'd have ultimate authority anyway.  You'd have to bring it back to us.  Is what I understood.  And that's correct.  Right.  All right.  Mrs. Rogers.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  No.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  No.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  No.  Mayor Coolidge.  Oh, what fun.  Yes.  And the reason why I'm voting yes on this is because anything would have to come back to us.  And I do believe we should continue to speak about that site.  The motion carries 4-3.  All right.  Let's take a 10-minute recess so we can all relax a little bit.  To point of order.  Or what do we have to do?  It's almost 10 p.m.  And my question is, I don't know if you have a question.  I have a curiosity actually as to if we might table the next item on the agenda so that we can look at it with fresh eyes at a future council meeting given that we are almost at the 10 p.m. mark.  So my only challenge to that is I think there is a great many people at home watching to see how we deal with the adoption of the City of Chico Signal System Plan.  And I would hate to disappoint, you know, the masses of...  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Is this time sensitive?  That's why I came tonight.  And is it 2 minutes or 10?  It can be anywhere between.  Give it to me.  We can push it off.  I just thought it would be something.  I appreciate you clarifying.  Okay.  So have we concluded 5.2?  So actually, we were in a 10-minute recess.  If you want to come back to that item in 10 minutes, I think that's agreeable.  But if you come back after 10...  I'm hearing...  We can consider 5.3.  I'm hearing that we probably shouldn't do that.  And we should take this item so we can actually get to it.  So let's take this item and move as quickly as we can but to just...  Can we continue 5.2 to the next meeting to see if there's any additional items that people want to discuss?  I think we could have 5.2 just, you know, the two motions come back to us when there is something additional to discuss.  So our point of clarification, Mr. Huber, do you have additional comments on 5.2?  And the reason I'm not trying to put you on the spot is if there are, we should finish 5.2, which will push us past 10 o'clock, which will move 5.3.  We're not allowed to consider it.  We still have the city management report.  And I think that we don't have a small amount of things on closed session.  Okay.  Very good.  Then I'd like to make one more motion.  And that is...  Okay.  The city has a motion that in regards to the safe car park proposal that the city, because it's a very long-term process that can take up to a year, that the city allow or direct the homeless solutions coordinator to begin negotiations with Caltrans on that process.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Is there a second?  Yeah, I'll second that.  I think it's appropriate to exhaust all options.  And there's plenty of models for safe car camping that we could reference.  And so to continue those conversations seems appropriate to me.  If we reach a dead end, we reach a dead end.  But I'd like to know what the process is.  All right.  Any further discussion?  Mrs. Rogers, if you would.  Councilmember Brown?  Aye.  Councilmember Denley?  No.  Councilmember Huber?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  No.  Councilmember Tandon?  No.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  No.  Mayor Coolidge?  No.  But I am going to clarify my vote because I am going to say it's because we were told that the process is near impossible to say very few actually exist.  And then that would put a huge burden of liability potentially on the city.  So no.  And it also doesn't keep us on that focus.  Okay.  All right.  Got one minute.  Get up here.  All right.  Scott, you need to learn how to make longer motions.  I try to give you examples.  I'm trying to help you.  All right.  You don't want to talk about traffic signals?  So let me introduce a 5.3 consideration adoption of the city signal system plan, Mr.  Ottoboni.  Thank you.  I have to remember what I said.  I have to remember what I said.  Remember my password.  Password is not working.  2% of your data.  All right.  Whoo!  That was live TV and my password.  Your computer is not working anymore.  They went to sleep.  a little bit. I apologize. You all have hard copies on this one. Yeah, we can charge you this one.  So traffic signal system plan is to enhance the city's traffic signal system into a resilient,  adaptable, and responsive system that works to safely accommodate all modes of travel.  Mr. Ottoboni, I'm just going to interrupt you just for the sake of the public. So do we have  this online? Okay. So we would refer the public to the, it's not online? Roger. All right.  I'll summarize the whole thing. Okay. Thank you. Just keep in mind the public can't see it.  Absolutely. So I'll just go off the cuff then. Basically, after the campfire, we all realized  the traffic network was severely overrun and congested throughout the entire city.  We saw  significant increases in daily traffic. And what it really highlighted was the inefficiency and  ineffectiveness of our existing traffic signal network. We have 105 traffic signals in the city  of Chico. For the most part, those are 25 to 30-year-old controller cabinets. So basically  the brains of the signal system. Very limited in their capabilities. Technology has come a long  ways in the last 25, 30 years. And a lot of the modern technology allows for responsive,  adaptive, and responsive traffic. So we're going to have to keep that in mind. So I'll just go off  here, Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer Officer  management center at City Hall, and we can do it basically from an office in five minutes and  reprogram and create more efficient circulation patterns. So it reduces congestion, obviously  has as a byproduct of that you have less greenhouse gas emissions from idling vehicles.  So we're looking at kind of completely doing an overhaul of our entire network with the technology  and equipment, and so what we're hoping for is with approval from the council we would take this  plan and go apply for grants, and it's about an $11 million grant for the bare minimum all-new  signal equipment plus wireless telecommunication, wireless communication technology.  Optimally we would do fiber optic to all the signals in town, but that comes at a much steeper  price of, you know, a ballpark of $30 million. So we're going to start with the infrastructure,  it would be our intent, and go after grants. One grant opportunity coming up is the  you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know,  the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, you know,  post-campfire opportunity is the community development block grant disaster recovery efforts  in the infrastructure component. So with approval we would take this plan and implement that hopefully  through a grant-funded project. If there's any questions I can answer.  All right, any questions? Public comment?  There were two comments in Engage Chico from Alicia Trider and Ruth Sarnoff.  Does anyone need any time to look over those?  Take a minute. Thank you, Mr. Albaugh.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Albaugh.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, we're ready?  Will the council?  Second.  A motion and a second.  Mr. Rogers would you take the roll?  Council Member Brown?  Aye.  Council Member Denley?  Aye.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right, we will move on then to Item 6, Reports and Communications.  City Manager's Report.  Mr. O'Neill?  Due to the lateness of the meeting, I have nothing to report.  All right, Council Member requests.  And actually, I want to start here by saying that in terms of the housing options and directives,  which Vice Mayor Reynolds brought back, she actually voted against that motion, so she's  not able to carry that item forward.  So, I'd like to make the request that we look at the housing options and directives  that were approved by Council, I believe it was in October.  So, that's a motion.  Second.  Mr. O'Reilly?  Motion and a second.  Ms. O'Reilly?  Can you clarify what you're requesting?  Mr. O'Reilly?  Yes, so that we reconsider the housing options and directions that were approved by Council  in October.  Anything specific?  Mr. O'Reilly?  the original motion wasn't for necessarily anything specific, but I'd like to look over it in terms  of its entirety.  Okay.  So, Mrs. Rogers.  Council Member Brown? Sure. Council Member Denley?  Aye. Council Member Huber? Sure. Council Member  Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Just for clarity's sake, from a staff perspective, that was the  recommendations from the Housing Committee, if I recall correctly? Correct.  Thank you. I have a request.  Can I go? Council Member Denley, go ahead. I wanted to request  to agendize a discussion to consider amending the Greater  Chico Homeless Task Force to make it an official commission of the City of Chico.  I don't know if we have that in the second.  Alright. So is that a second?  It's the motion, alright.  Can I second my own motion? Or my own agenda? Okay.  Second. You can make it, too.  Alright. So we have a first and a second. Mrs. Rogers? Who was the second?  Me. Cammy. Denley.  Council Member Denley?  So without getting too deep into the weeds of the conversation, I'm not going to support  the motion, particularly because that group has operated as an independent  kind of think tank group for as long as it's existed.  And so I think that the independence  that that group has to have the types of conversations that they need  to have about the issue of homelessness needs to be preserved.  So I'm not going to support it.  Alright. Then it's just a motion to talk about the particular subject.  So it's probably a good time to do it. Mrs. Rogers?  One second.  Council Member Brown?  No.  Council Member Denley?  Yes.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  Alright. Any further requests from Council Memberss?  I just have a quick one and we can, doesn't need to be on the next meeting.  Obviously we're loading up with some stuff, but I would like to do a review and a discussion of some particular items on the Chief of  the Municipal Code, which I will bring forth later.  But it's primarily having to do with some things that are happening in, with our buildings downtown and sidewalks and awnings and, you know,  different things and just some various and sundry different things.  So I'd just like to bring a discussion back at some point to talk about our codes and make sure they are where they need to be.  I'll make that motion too.  Well, that was your motion.  Okay. I'll second.  Alright.  And I assume when you do your written narrative, you'll be a little more specific?  Yes, I'll be much more succinct and I'll give you all the information.  I just don't want to sit here and go through all of the code.  No.  This is not a review of the entire Chico Municipal Code.  I almost did it earlier with my monologue.  Alright.  So we have a motion and a second.  When you're ready, Mrs. Rogers.  Council Member Brown?  Sure.  Council Member Denley?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Yes.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Alright. Any further requests?  Alright. Seeing none, we'll move on to Item 6.3, 2019-20 Development Impact Fee Report.  Mr. Audubon?  Just the receiving file?  Yep.  So that's all we have to do, right?  That's all we got.  Informational only. Okay.  Thank you.  So with that, we'll adjourn in the closed session.  And take a 10-minute recess prior.  Thank you.
