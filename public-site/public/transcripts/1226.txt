I will be presenting the staff  report on this item. The project  site is located on the northern  corner of esplanade and garner  lane west of highway 99. The  site was previously used as a  golf course and still contains  the existing building and parking  lot.  The project site is located on  the northern corner of esplanade  99. The project site is zoned  community commercial with an  airport overflight zone D and  is designated commercial mixed  use on the general plan land use  diagram.  Surrounding land uses include  animal shelter to the north,  car dealership and service center  to the east, automotive center  and unincorporated rural  residential and agricultural  land to the west. The project  site is1010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010  I would like to address an  error in the staff report that  was distributed via memo to the  commission. There is active  agriculture directly to the east  of the site that was an error on  my part.  The proposed aquatic center  would be used for an outdoor  commercial recreation facility  which is applied to a range of  outdoor sports and recreational  recreational use and operational  uses where a fee is typically  charged. The facility is  proposed to be in operations  from 530 a.m. To 9 p.m. During  peak seasons with reduced hours  during the off seasons. The  proposed buildings would include  concession stand party rooms and  facilities buildings. The design  would be modern and utilitarian  all roof mounted and ground  flooring and a large !  There would be two main swimming  pools that would include competition  size 50 meter swimming pool and a  warm up pool. Facilities would  include a water slide tower with  multiple slides and a third pool  that would serve as a dedicated  aquatic play space.  The parking lot would provide 187  vehicle parking spaces. Five vehicle  parking spaces would be used  for maintenance and freight delivery  and 20 bicycle parking spaces.  Preliminary estimates from CARD  indicate that typical summer day  may see as much 90 to 100 or 120  co-current vehicle spaces used.  While swim meets are estimated to  occupy 130 to 180 spaces. CARD  estimates having a swim meet at  this location two to three times  per year. The parking lot does meet  the minimum 50% shading and the  maximum 50% shade. The parking lot  large pool and provides an  expansive walkways for exceptional  pedestrian circulation. Bicycle parking  spaces would be located at the front  entrance of the facility with 11  uncovered spaces and nine covered by  a roof overhang.  The landscaping plan would include  a variety of new trees including  red maples, California buckeyes,  western redbud, desert willow,  magnolia, Chinese pistache, valley  oaks, and interior live oaks.  Throughout the site there would also  be many multiple shade structures to  provide coverage for visitors.  In the case of the development intensity  of the aquatic park it is well below  the development intensity associated  with potential mixed-use commercial  community commercial development at  the subject site. CARD's exemption  California Environmental Quality Act  CEQA exemption is supported by an  attachment. The development intensity of the  site is a  of the 2020-2024 zoning  verification letter from the city  containing analysis regarding the  development density of these estimated  site for CMU sites. So originally when  we looked at this with the general plan  we were imagining something like a  large commercial shopping center  originally here. This is much lower  intensity versus a larger commercial  shopping center. Staff also would like  to recommend that the commercial  community planning commission adopt  resolution 2508 including the required  findings and determine the project  categorically exempt from further  environmental review pursuant to  CEQA section 15183 projects consistent  with community plan or zoning approving  use permit 2501 and architectural review  2501.  Subject to the recommended conditions  therein. I'm available for any questions  that the commission may have.  All right any questions?  Yeah I have one. I'm a  school of design. Are there any  projected alcohol sales going to be  here?  Not to my knowledge no.  I have a question about  sidewalks on esplanade and garner  lane. It looked from the drawings  like the sidewalks would be directly  adjacent to the street with no  landscape in between is that correct  or did I not read the drawings correctly?  I think it is.  I would like to ask about  the size of the site.  We are looking at about  nine acres.  It is a larger site.  I know eventually it will be required.  I would ask confirmation.  It is separated sidewalk.  It has a seven foot parkway strip  and five foot sidewalk.  Both esplanade and garner lane.  Along garner.  The city is intending to do a  capital improvement project along  garner.  So the garner lane corridor will be  completely improved when the city  comes in with that project.  Esplanade is a little bit different.  There is going to be a modification  to cards MOU to include esplanade  in the existing MOU.  And currently the access off esplanade  is just a gated emergency access.  So that is a little different.  So when that is opened up to full  vehicle access, the card will be  required to improve all of esplanade.  But as part of the current plan,  esplanade will not be improved.  Okay.  So it will be improved?  At a later date.  Yes.  Okay.  And we would look at the plans then?  Yes.  That would go through the normal review process  through engineering through the city and  that would be submitted to us for review and approval.  No.  No.  It would not.  So is there how can we recommend that?  It would follow normal city standards which is  separated sidewalk.  Five foot sidewalk, seven foot  parkway strip.  So you would have the assurance that it  would have a separated sidewalk along  that corridor as that is per city  standard.  Thank you.  And I have a similar question just on  the timing of the improvements.  I think it is condition six for the  design review on this.  I was trying to find it.  I think it calls for the improvements to  be completed prior to occupancy of the  project.  Or alternately we do this modification of  the MOU.  It seems to make sense.  When you look at the kind of the lineal  frontage involved here, it is considerable  cost.  Almost project killer level of cost to  do all this stuff especially with all  the utilities need to be relocated and  all that.  But the timing is going to be underway  without any improvements in place?  Or will the improvements be in place  only partially?  The intention is that the capital  improvement project will be completed  prior to card opening at stores.  Or at least close.  card opening.  The MOU will pay their proportional share  for the completion of the frontage.  That is why you see the MOU modification in  there.  It will define the timing and the cost.  I have another question.  As part of this improvement project  that is going to happen on the esplanade  does that include a bicycle lane on the  esplanade?  I believe yes.  That is correct.  That does.  As it is now it is basically  impossible to ride a bicycle to this  site without.  I don't recall quite what the  cross section will be but it does  include a bike lane.  Sean can speak more to that.  It would have our bike lane with  five foot minimum with the two foot buffer.  All right.  Anything else?  Is the conflict between the 47 acres  of walnuts to the west across the  esplanade and the aquatic park has  that been totally resolved?  At least with that this project  will not hamper on any right to  continue agricultural uses to the  west.  They will still remain that use.  This project follows the city  guidelines of that 100 foot  separation.  We do not have necessarily conditions  to10101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010  we will continue to have that  right.  anything else?  thank you. I guess it'  s time to  hear from the applicant on this.  if I may first I guess my first  step here is to open the public  hearing. The public hearing is  now open may we hear from the  applicant please?  thank you.  good evening. Thank you  commissioners for allowing us to  be here my name is annabelle  grim I'  m here on behalf of chico area  recreation and park district we  appreciate the chance to be here  tonight and want to thank staff  and the commission for their time  and care you put in evaluating  these proposals. We'  re excited to present two  projects tonight and I'  ll speak on the aquatic center  we are very proud to present  this facility. A long  envisioned project first  conceptualized in 2008. A  feasibility study was completed  in 2016 and the project took a  major step forward in 2023 with  the generous land donation that  secured the location. Since  then the project has been shaped  by years of planning community  engagement and close  collaboration with our design  department and the project  partners at confluence. We  want to express our sincere  appreciation to the members of  our aquatic advisory group and  the technical advisory group and  the thousands of community members  who shared their input ideas and  support throughout this process.  Their involvement has been invaluable.  Our vision is to create a modern  inclusive aquatic center that  meets a broad range of community  needs from swimming  activities to  swimming lessons which are in  our opinion a basic life skill.  Water safety education to lap  swimming, therapeutic uses and  recreational fun. Just overall  wellness. This project is closely  aligned with the city's general  plan and will be a vital resource  for north Chico. Through  partnerships with local schools,  healthcare providers, nonprofits,  small businesses, we are ensuring  the facility reflects the values  and needs of our diverse community.  Ongoing input from the advisory  committee and volunteers will help  keep the center responsive,  welcoming and community driven.  This is more than just a pool.  This is a space built for  community. We appreciate the  planning division's time and  consideration. We are here happy  to answer any questions. Thank  you for your time.  any questions for the  opportunity to speak?  I will take the floor.  I had a question about  landscaping.  Sure.  So one of the trees that is  proposed to be planted is the  Chinese pistache. That is an  invasive species. They have been  found in bidwell park where they  have not been planted. Just  wondering if there is a way we  can substitute some of the other  trees that you are planning to  plant in the area.  Absolutely, I would  probably suggest1010  the Chinese pistache is one of the trees that's identified on the urban forestry management plan  and so we're working closely with Ruti Bamlett and the urban forestry management plan and the  urban forester for the city of Chico to make sure that all those species are well selected and  appropriate for this zone and so particularly we use the Keith Harvey species which is less likely  to have something that's going to drop and it's more maintenance friendly to be honest but that  pistache tree is actually on the the approved plan for the city of Chico we're happy to have a  subsequent conversation with the urban forester about if that's an appropriate species or not but  that's how we came to that selection okay so it's possible to give some input to the forestry  if I  if I  if I may sir just just to maintain some order as far as the public hearing is concerned I think  we're just about through hearing from the applicant then we'll get to the the speakers across the  speaker cars I'm sure my apologies thank you thank you thank you okay anything else all right  Nicole what do we what do we have our first speaker is Jeff Cripe and then following Jeff  will be Nicole Farley  okay  I'm Jeff1010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010  along with others, agriculture properties in the area  for a number of years, raised our family  there. I'm not here to argue. I think  the park's a great idea, so full  on with it.  The concern that I have  in agriculture  is the kind of minimization  of the impact of this park on  the agriculture directly  across the Esplanade. I realize that we  have a right to farm.  That's great in principle,  but nobody's going to fire up a spray  rig or do harvest right  across from a water park.  They are going to be incompatible.  I think the end result of this is  going to be that there will be acres. I wouldn't  know how many, but there will be acres  of farmland that don't become  farmable any longer,  at least not during  the park season, which is probably going to  be the same as farming season.  As this progresses,  I wouldn't argue against it. Like I said,  I think it's a good  project. If my kids were still in the house,  they would be full on in favor of it.  As it goes  along, I just ask that the planning  take into account that there is  actually active agriculture.  These are green line properties.  They're 20 acre minimums  directly across the street that will be  impacted by the park one way or  the other. Thank you.  Nicole Farley,  then following Nicole Bethad  Winsense.  Good evening, commissioners. My name is Nicole  Farley, executive director of Explore  Butte County, and I'm here to strongly  express my support  for the Chico Aquatic and Recreation Facility.  This project is  more than just a community asset. It's  a smart investment in Chico sports  tourism opportunities. Chico  currently lacks a modern  competition-ready aquatics facility,  and this project will fill that gap,  positioning our city to host regional  water sports tournaments, which will drive  overnight stays, result in restaurant  and retail sales. Beyond  the competitions, the facility  design offering  the inclusive play area,  shaded seating, family  amenities makes it a year-round destination  for both residents and visitors alike.  So this project delivers on Chico's  general plan goals of tourism,  economic development, and public recreation,  so I urge your support. Thank you.  Sad  Winsense, followed by Patricia  Harmonis.  Hello. My name is Sad Winsense,  and I'm here to speak in  very strong favor of the  aquatics complex going in.  As a Chico native, I grew up  here, and  the lack of swimming  pools during  my youth was pretty  apparent, and then when my kids started  competitive swimming and realized  that there were very limited  public pool facilities,  and the competitive swim teams  in town really  had to fight for  space at private facilities,  and then subsequently as  they became competitive  swimmers and  started doing very well,  the number of times we had to travel out of town  for extended  weekends to spend  the entire weekend in Redding, spend the entire  weekend in the Bay Area, spend the entire weekend  in Sacramento  or the surrounding area, and then spend the entire weekend in the Bay Area.  I can also speak to how much money  that drives into those local communities and how much money we spent outside of Chico to support their swimming endeavors.  So I would really like to voice support from the competitive swim community, as this would be  only the second 50-meter pool north of the Sacramento area.  The only other one is in Redding, and many Sacramento and many Bay Area teams simply won't make that long of a drive, but talking about the !  I've been in the community for many years with my kids, and I can really say this is something that the North State needs. This is something that's long overdue for Chico. Thank you.  Patricia Harmonis, followed by Cynthia Perrine.  It's Hieronymus. Thank you so much.  No, you're close. E for effort.  Thank you so much for letting us speak. I am not speaking on behalf of Butte Environmental Council. I'm here to speak on behalf of the 1010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010  on agricultural wells because of the subsidence that's occurring.  And I don't know how familiar you are with our groundwater sustainability plan, which  needs to be updated by 2027 for SGMA, but I'm hoping that you're working with the Butte  County Water and Resources Conservation District to account for this water because it looks  very grandiose.  And I don't know if you remember being in Chico back in the 80s.  We did have a water park on the south side of town by Calsgate.  And in the summer, even then, it was scorchingly hot and your skin would burn if it was on  the plastic and not on the water.  So I have some concerns about the shade structures or lack thereof that I can see in these very  fancy renderings.  And Miranda wanted to tell me, she's an arborist, the Chinese pistache is very climate adaptive.  So a plug for the Chinese pistache.  My other concerns about the water.  Our use for this park has to do with, is it LEED certified?  Will it be recycled?  Are you counting for this in our water table?  Are you going to be looking at subsidence?  I have major concerns about the ag land right next to it and the pollutants in the groundwater  from those, what are they called when they spray the trees so they don't get diseases  from bugs?  Just, thank you, everybody.  Pesticides.  Look how smart I am.  I have a lot of experiences.  So, yeah, I have a lot of concerns and I don't know how they're addressed because I thought  I saw that it was exempt from CEQA or environmental review and I really hope that's not the case.  But if you could let me know in, after I'm done speaking, where I can find the answers  to some of these questions and if it's still in the design review to maybe implement some  of these water concerns in some way or have you thought about how to incorporate public  comment into these designs?  I think that would be my curiosity. Thank you so much for your time and for hearing me out  Cynthia  Okay, like like Patricia said I'm also not here representing Northern California Regional Land Trust  I'm actually representing my daughter. She gave me some cards to read. Hello. My name is Charlotte Perrine  And I'm a graduating senior at Chico High School as a swimmer on the Chico High School team and as a lifeguard with card  I believe that building a new aquatics facility is essential for three reasons one  It provides an opportunity for deep water sports like diving and water polo  Which I was forced to quit after moving to Chico because of inadequate facilities  It provides more employment. Oh number two  And apply it provides more employment opportunities by requiring  lifeguard  For a new facility and helps card and training their aquatics employees for deep water rescue  Instead of training in the frankly disgusting Sycamore pool at one mile. I just did that last week and  three  And three it provides several opportunities for community engagement through both sports and recreation  Thank you. So that's the end of Charlotte's comments  But as a mother again not as the example  I had a director of the land trust  I have a few thoughts as a kid  I had three pools to choose from Shapiro PV and University pool the pool at this Chico State cost  25 cents to get in that door. I spent every hour of every summer day. I wasn't doing chores in that pool  When I moved here, I was frankly completely shocked and unprepared  Or maybe I wouldn't have chosen the place where my kids couldn't continue their their two favorite sports  and but I also want to speak from experience  In San Luis Obispo where I moved from they did a great bond major and they made a wonderful aquatics facility that definitely  Superseded what was previously there?  however because of  budget increases and all kinds of things that were not foreseen they they really  marginalized the capacity for things like water polo and diving to occur simultaneously and they  Impacted the ability for a lot swimming to occur at the same time  So I just really urged in the planning process  That we don't let the limitations of the finances the land has been the most  The largest impediment to this project going forward. So I just want to speak in support of a fully  Functional very well designed facility as as strong. Thank you very much  And our last speaker Clark Edgeworth  I  Want to respect the  Format here, but this is a misadventure. I  Am here to speak about the bicycle park that is being proposed  if I may sir, we're  That's coming up. I had an incidental comment. Oh  about the  invasive alien species  Well, no, just as long as it's pertinent to this agenda item the aquatic part  The issue of invasive alien species is completely  Different in the context of landscaping than it is in the wild this place is rife with invasive alien species  Himalayan blackberries in every Creek but  Unless there's a danger of a  Gating I don't think there's the same concern with invasive alien species  so  thank you and  also the  This is where the rest of the state gets their water with the exception of the Sacramento  The  Great Lake was north was I can't remember all the sudden but we are we are where the rest of the state gets?  s our water.  The lady speaking previously with  her concerns about groundwater I  don'  t think groundwater would be  the logical place to go for water  here.  We have a lot of other sources of  water that are abundant.  thank you.  does that wrap it up?  yes.  thank you.  back to the commission for any  discussion?  I will close the public hearing.  thank you.  back to the commission.  that brings up a question.  where does the water come from for  the water park?  there'  s two sources of water for the  water park.  the potable water and the water  that'  s used for the pools will come  from cow water.  cow water served on the technical  advisory committee for this  project since its beginning a  couple of years ago.  we have a strong relationship  with our partners there.  they'  re very supportive of the  project.  irrigation will come from an  existing well on the property  and has been used historically  for  irrigating landscape at the  previous sunset hills golf course  that was on the site prior to  being donated to card.  it'  s all ground water?  no.  domestic water for the pool and  the potable water and then  groundwater from the existing  well for the landscape  irrigation.  okay.  but that'  s all ground water?  yes.  that'  s correct.  any other comments or  questions?  i should have said this  earlier but one thing i was  wondering is if the sidewalk  along garner lane could be made  wider than the standard sidewalk  so that it could be used as a  multi-use area?  path shared with bicycles and  also if people want to take the  bus to this park the nearest bus  stop is at the corner of garner  lane and esplanade.  people would have to walk on the  sidewalk to get to the entrance  and i'  m envisioning families  trying to walk side by side on  a very narrow sidewalk so just  wondering if the sidewalk could be  a little wider than a standard  one?  we'  re a bit constrained with the  amount of ride away.  the five foot sidewalk that they  have proposed that the city is  actually going to be doing part  of their project is five foot.  i believe those plans have  already been done.  so it'  s something that we could  evaluate with our capital  improvement projects department  but i don'  t know if it would  necessarily be a condition of  this project as it'  s a capital improvement  project.  so we can'  t request that there be made  enough space in this project to  make a wider sidewalk?  we can definitely evaluate  the amount of ride away that is  out there to see if we can  accommodate a larger width  sidewalk.  well there is already land  being ceded to the city for.  yeah there'  s an additional ceded  to the city.  so we can add another five feet  so we can have a wider sidewalk  on garner lane.  i'  m not entirely sure how that  would constrain the on site plan  that they have submitted here  today.  but it'  s definitely something that  we could take a look at.  the other thing that we'  d run into is the six foot  dedication makes it more of a  uniform ride away with the other  adjacent properties.  so even if we widened it for  this project it would just  become a larger  space.  if we would have to  necessary to make it a  little bit more of a  standard for the next project  because we wouldn'  t get additional  ride away from them they'  re already built.  no but the part that'  s really needed is  from esplanade to the entrance  of the aquatic park.  if that bus stop stays  where it is currently it could  very well move because there'  s plans for a round about at  that intersection and the  logical place for that bus stop  would probably be closer to the  entrance here where people would  have a straighter shot.  tbd we would have to figure out  where the bus stop would be  out where bay cag wants that bus  stop to make the most use out  of it.  and this project will help them  guide where it goes.  then there'  s still the bicyclists who  need to get from the esplanade  to the entrance.  so to have a multiuse path there  would be much safer than having  them ride down garner lane and  have to turn left.  yeah i understand what  you'  re saying it would also be an  increase in costs from a city  capital improvement.  i think that'  project perspective because  you'  re taking a standard  five-foot sidewalk width and  doubling it or increasing it by  another four feet depending on  how wide you were inquiring  about.  well standard is 10 to 12  feet for a multiuse.  yes and then standard  sidewalk is five feet.  i think the more appropriate  venue to take that up would be  the internal affairs committee  if you'  d like to attend one of  their meetings and broach that  subject.  thank you.  any other question?  probably10101010101010101010  consider the feasibility of  widening the sidewalk from  esplanade to the main entrance  as part of the final plan review  process. You'  d have  that as a let'  s see if  we can possibly get this and if  we can yes but it'  s not  going to work from a practical  standpoint.  that might be an  agreeable approach the cross  section was  solidified in the courtesy  motors da so that'  s what we'  re basing our  ultimate design on. I'  m not sure how much  wiggle room we have with  modifying that because the right  of way has been set that'  s why we did a six foot  dedication for the card side.  I would say you can proceed  with a condition like that.  understood.  that would work for me.  I have a question about the  environmental review on this.  s an unusual one  for us in the city isn'  t acting as the lead  agency with respect to the  sequa card did that. Card is  adopted with a categorical  exemption for the project not a  categorical exemption but an  exemption. Maybe just a little  bit of information on how that  process works and what our  action is here this evening with  the general plan.  in regard to that yes card  was the lead agency who filed the  categorical exemption for the  project. This is based off of  the exemption section 15183  projects consistent with community  plan or zoning. This is  consistent with the general plan as a  use itself.  .  As the exemption reads  sequa mandates that the project  which are consistent with  development density established by  existing zoning community plan or  general plan policies of which the  eir was certified shall not require  additional environmental review except  as might be necessary to examine  whether the project specific  significant effects which are  peculiar to the project site or  its site. We did go through the  checklist to see if there was any  peculiarities with the site. Again as a  mentioned in my staff report we  are taking something which is a  larger use. What was projected on  the general plan was something of a  shopping center size. Something with  more significant impact. I believe it  was almost up to 100,000 square feet  of was projected for 100,000 square  feet of commercial use. This would  be a smaller impact to it. Since  that was considered with the general  plan that'  s where it falls into the  exemption. Hopefully I was able to  answer your question.  thank you. I will note that the work that  was done on the site included a  review of some environmental review  documents on the site. There was a  biological resources assessment. There  was a cultural resources assessment.  There was a traffic study. There was a  lot that went into that. It wasn'  t just a well it'  s just exempt. There was more to  it than that.  anything else?  thank you.  is there a motion?  I will make a motion.  I move that planning commission  adopt resolution 25-08 approving  use permit 25-01 and architectural  review 25-01 parent chico aquatic  and recreation facility subject to  the recommended conditions contained  therein.  can we add the condition that  I talked about?  yes.  widening of the sidewalk?  yes.  specifically widening the  sidewalk between esplanade and the  entrance?  yes. What I read was I  considered the feasibility of  widening the sidewalk from esplanade  to the project entrance during the  final plan review phase.  then I will second the motion.  thank you.  we have a vote.  commissioner wolf?  yes.  commissioner wall?  yes.  commissioner sharp?  yes.  commissioner kirk-koffman?  yes.  all right.  that passes 4-0.  4-0.  thank you.  the city attorney is  encouraging me to do something.  what is it you want to do?  just a point of order.  we will now get our chairwoman to  come in.  thank you, tony, for coming  back.  I appreciate that.  .  all right.  we will move on to item 4.2,  chico bike park use permit 25-02.  if you would like to speak on this  item, please make sure you get a  speaker card in over to nicole.  we will turn this over to  associate planner madison  driscoll.  point of order.  we just need to ask if there is  any ex parte communications.  yes.  are there any ex parte  communications on this?  no.  none.  thank you.  .  welcome back, chair  scott.  this next project is for the  chico bike park proposal.  the project site is located on  the south side of humboldt road  between the two cities.  it is located on the north side  of humboldt road between  notre dame boulevard and forest  avenue.  the proposed bike park site  backs up to little chico creek  corridor.  last year the city did transfer  the site to card for the purpose  of development of a new bicycle  and mountain bike theme park,  dog park and other park facilities  on property.  can i have you pause for a  quick second?  do i need to recuse myself on this as well?  i will take a pause for five minutes  and i will speak with you.  sorry guys.  there is lovely facilities out there  and really cold water  if anybody would like any. [inaudible] ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! !  i do have to recuse myself on this  item as well.  i am very sorry. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! [inaudible] [inaudible]  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  you would please continue. Thank you. Yes, of course. So like I said, the project site is  located on the south side of Humboldt Road between Notre Dame Boulevard and Forest Avenue.  Project site backs up to Little Chico Creek. The project site is designated a combination of  secondary open space and primary open space on the general land use diagram. It is zoned a  combination of secondary open space and primary open space. The site is also identified on  figure PPFS2 of the Chico 2030 general plan as undeveloped parkland and marked as a potential  site for a new aquatic facility. A bit ironic we're here tonight together with both of them.  The general plan does note that the city of Chico is underserved in terms of community parkland and  would need to...  Okay.  To add one to two more community parks by 2030.  The project site...  The bike park includes a variety of features including a pump track, jump flow lines,  mulch jumps, which forgiving services for novice riders, food truck and concession plaza,  pavilions for picnic tables, a playground, perimeter loops, parking, bathrooms, signage,  lights, and more.  For10  For10  For10  For10  For10  For10 [inaudible]  For10  For10 ! !  k  adjacent apartment complex, Creekside Senior Apartments.  And a new bike path from Notre Dame Boulevard would connect to the park with users arriving  by bus from the neighborhood or located to the east.  Also, just another update to let the commission aware of, we are this summer constructing  the Notre Dame Bridge, which will connect both Notre Dame from the south and north.  So that will also provide an additional connection for bikeways.  And then, so we're going to go ahead and go into the main entrance of the park.  The main entry would be situated between the parking lot and the main bike track area.  And we'll include a covered entry, entry pavilion that is 2,500 square feet with seat walls,  picnic tables, playground areas, a turf area for viewing, and a building containing bathrooms  and future bike rentals.  So you can kind of see what the elevation.  So that bike rental restroom elevation here and the entry pavilion.  The dominant feature of the park would be three bike tracks from within the central  basin, which would include a pump track, a flow track for beginners, and a flow trail  for intermediate and advanced riders.  The start hub would feature an intermediate and advanced flow trail and would be an open  air pavilion.  So it would allow users to kind of dip in, almost kind of like a motorhome.  So that's the main entry.  And then the main entry would be a cross start.  West of the bike track would be a row of four picnic pavilions for watching.  Each pavilion would be approximately 24 feet by 30 feet in size and connected to the food  truck concessionaire area with a walkway.  Vehicular access to the area would be gate controlled with a new driveway from Humboldt  Road.  The perimeter loop also links to the food truck concession area with additional bike  parking and a walkway.  And a bike path connected out to Humboldt Road.  And then you can kind of see the examples of the elevations here for the concessions  and the picnic pavilions.  For the purposes of the bike park, the bike park is exempt from further environmental  review.  Oops, I got a little messed up there.  But yeah, it's consistent with environmental review.  Pursuant to CEQA section 1583, projects consistent with the community plan or zoning, just as  the other one.  Like we said, this area was earmarked as a park area on our general plan.  The project benefits from a substantial pre-design constraints and analysis specifically regarding  bio resources, cultural resources, and the project design.  They also purposely designed the project to avoid the creek and to have minimal impact  upon that greenway.  For the purpose of the101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010  exempt from further environmental review subject to CEQA section 15183 projects consistent with  the community plan or zoning approving use permit 2502 and architecture review 2505 subjects the  recommended conditions i am available to answer any questions for the commission any questions  of staff will any of the tracks be dirt or are they all going to be some kind of finished material  that does not generate dust i believe they will be mainly paved but i am going to default to  our representative here trevor miller with that just to confirm off the top because i cannot  remember off the top of my head unfortunately but yes trevor will be up to speak on the project as  well who designed the project  okay so we'll hear from them later yes okay all right any other yeah another question about the  parking lot yes um will that be available for use after hours or only when the park is open  so um i believe uh it does not have a gated entrance so um but it would be up to the  um  vendor of the site which would be card to regulate that parking lot itself just as any other park in  town is there someone from card who could answer that question we have scott here  we anticipated having a gate at the vehicle entrances just like any typical park  in town certainly gates at hooker oak or gates of wildwood basically opening and closing the park  uh  you know what you're saying  okay so you wouldn't be able to drive in at 11 p.m say  okay  any other questions of staff  all right i guess i'm sorry i have one more i'm sorry you can't that was two  so um yeah looking at the um species that are planned to be planted um i was just wondering  it says to to plant cobalt and i'm not sure if that's the right word but i'm just wondering if 1010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010  the other side.  I will let the  applicant speak to that one as  well. As far as I know they also  consulted with the chico urban  forester on these plans and he  did give his blessing on it.  Again maybe they could speak a  little more directly I do not  have information if they are  fruitless or not on the olive  trees at least.  thank you.  I will let the  they are fruitless.  Any other questions?  is that it?  we are going to get answers?  we will hear from the  applicant next and they will  probably be able to answer any  other questions you might have.  I am good.  anybody else?  thanks.  can we hear from the applicant  please?  the public hearing is now open.  my apologies.  thank you.  good evening commissioners my  name is scott schumann I am the  director of parks and facilities  at card.  I have a few words here.  we are equally excited to present  the chico bike park proposal as  we are the aquatic center  proposal this evening.  in partnership with chico velo and our board also initiated this process in august of 2023.  since then we have worked closely with many community partners to bring this bike park  theme park to life.  we would like to extend our gratitude to the major  collaborators on the project specifically  chico velo, the lupine legacy  foundation and their design team including  outlier architecture and edema  environmental who are both represented here  tonight as well.  in addition we appreciate the numerous community members who provided  input and collaboration into  this project who are also here  as well.  this park is designed with youth and  families in mind.  this facility will feature elements for beginners and  experienced riders alike.  sometimes when you look at the pictures you are like can I ride that?  and the answer might be no.  we want to make sure that every opportunity  is there for anybody to access  the park and to experience the state of flow  that is appropriate for them.  so if you are a beginner and you have never ridden a bike park  like this there is great opportunities to access  new features that will introduce you  to this type of riding and then  if you visit the park  over time or you come with existing skills  there is also going to be something that is very exciting  for you as well.  this will not only provide a safe place to ride  but also a gathering space  that promotes physical activity and community connection.  this is one of those true third spaces  that is identified as one of the goals of the master plan.  seeing bikers and community members  not necessarily knowing where to gather  currently we have lots of folks  that are going up into upper park  often times they will gather at the pump track  which is also managed by CARD.  but that is a temporary place  for people to spend time.  this is the kind of place that people will be able to  come to on the weekends  after work, after school  maybe kids will be there already  and parents will come and join them  and ride together.  maintaining the natural beauty of Chico and the foothills  is an important aspect of this project.  healthy trees will be preserved  and incorporated into the design of the park  those are the existing trees that are there  as much as possible  as well as an emphasis on natural and native landscaping.  this park is going to be as beautiful  as it is functional  with low lighting to emphasize the landscape  and reduce light pollution for the surrounding community  we are also excited to incorporate  a playground, picnic areas  shade structures  into the site design  so there is something for everyone at this innovative park.  that is the long version  the short version is that Chico is a bike town  and we are very excited to bring  additional biking opportunities to our community.  specific to your questions  about the riding surfaces  those will be sealed surfaces  so all of those pathways  would produce additional dust  and that is somewhat selfish of CARD  because that is low maintenance for us  as well  and also will last that much longer  I forgot your second question  it was just about the parking lot  whether it was going to be open late  you already answered that  and then about the  coast live oak as opposed to the interior live oak  so we can certainly  take a closer look at that  and if it makes sense  to swap out the species where there is no advantage  one way or the other we are happy to  incorporate the interior live oak  thank you  any further questions?  I am curious about the concession bike shop  is there space or capacity  to make that into a small  light maintenance shop as well  if someone was interested  so that is a great idea  we are looking to really activate  that area and so having  an opportunity to have a vendor  or a relationship with Chico Velo  to support bike repair on site would be great  one more  about Chico Velo too actually  I know bicyclists  I have been one for quite a while now  and we love events  and where bicyclists come to events  there is a need for bike parking  is there space to identify  where Chico Velo would be able to set up a bike valet stand  if they wanted to?  sure so that entrance pavilion would be a good opportunity  it is intentionally designed so that  large groups can come and gather  we may run camps or classes there  and if we are running an event that would be a great place  for Chico Velo to set up the bike valet as well  thank you  any further questions?  I see where you are anticipating  having a vendor  as a brewery there  is that part of the plan?  so there will be a concessions area  that kind of large  blue triangle shaped in the center  for serving food  as well as beverages  well I have a problem with the alcohol  because it is a kid centric park  and I am not so sure  serving alcohol  at that place is a good idea  and since he wants a bike repair shop  and I don't want alcohol  to be sold there  how about we make a deal  so that  area would be certainly within the  allowances of the alcohol and beverage commission  and then it would be a contained area  and so the whole area  would not be in the area  and we would be allowed to  access alcohol  I don't think you ought to be selling alcohol  at a place like that to begin with  in any part of the acreage  we should reconsider that  yes commissioner wall  we have looked at  several other project sites  that are similar to this  and modeled this project after those  very successful places  now I am not a mountain bike rider  I know my colleagues here are  and they can share with you  the examples of other projects  that have this very similar set up  and the idea is  that it is for everybody in the family  so it is not just for kids  and so sometimes  you know  you come to a site  and you have got kids that like to eat  different foods so we have a food truck lot  the parents maybe  want to have a beer on a hot day  and so we are just really trying to cater  to everybody in the family  so there is something for everybody  so we are  quite confident that this model  is very successful  I hear you with the concerns  about  having alcohol  but the truth of the matter is  people bring their own to the park right now  and this way  we have some control over  how much is being consumed  on our property  so  any other thoughts  for me  I just don't think it is a good idea  and I don't care what the other ones  are doing  and I don't  not much control have over  people bringing their own  but it is too easy  for kids to get a hold of it  in a venue like this  so I won't vote in favor of it  as long as you plan to put alcohol in there  and I think it is a good idea  to have a !  any other questions for the applicant  on that  do we have examples of other cities  in California that have similar features  because they would have gone through  alcohol control  yes  so I will have Trevor come speak to those other projects  hi my name is Trevor Miller  I am the project architect  and  yeah I mean just off the top of my head  North Star in Tahoe  is a resort  they have extensive mountain bike trails  and yeah  you can enjoy a beer  after your ride  at a  you know handful of restaurants  down at the bottom of the hill  and then you know go back up and ride  and it is just like any other restaurant  any other bar  they have controls  built in to the licensing  process where they will  lose their license to serve alcohol  if they are not serving it responsibly  so  it is just like any other  any other venue  you have to  be responsible for how you are serving  your product  and  maybe just to ask Larry  so maybe we can get into the  real point of this  Larry is your concern that  it might make it easier for  younger people to get alcohol or is it  that people would consume alcohol and  cause problems at the site  yes and yes  ok both  another good example honestly here  locally is the commons  you know it is not bike related  but if you go to the commons  I don' t know if you are familiar with the commons  out on park ave  but you go there on pretty much any night  of the week and they are  serving beer  and 90% of the people that are there  are families and so it is you know  it is a family's responsibility to kind of  it is a teachable moment for kids  you know to drink responsibly  and you know  enjoy time with your family  and yeah so I think  the perspective is  kind of what Scott communicated  this isn' t you know  it is an opportunity for  people of all walks of life  to come enjoy the park  and those don' t you can come to the park  and enjoy it without being on a bike  um  so yeah that' s kind of  been our perspective as we developed  the design  in order to use the park what is the age limit  how old do you have to be  and do you have to be accompanied by an adult  to get in  we don' t have any  it' s a free open park  for the public  ok  that would be similar  to any other public park  in the card district  where parents can show up  to hooker oak park  with their children  and play and relax  and then head home  so you would have gates at the entrances  for opening in the morning and closing in the evening  and then this particular concessions area  would be controlled  similar to a restaurant  I think that' s maybe  an important point  is how the sale is going to be conducted  and where it' s going to be consumed  I don' t think it' s the case  that we' re going to have people riding around the park drinking beer  and then going to the restaurant  it' s going to be a very focused area  probably signed  and maybe some physical barriers  I don' t know  there would be physical controls  and then also staffing controls  very similar to a restaurant  similar to a family  and their children going into a restaurant  to have a dinner  and the parents might order a drink  but they' re not able to walk out of that restaurant  and they' re not involved with that as well  ok  well it looks like the big kids  will get to decide this one  I have a question  I didn' t notice bicycle racks  where people are going to  lock their bikes up  when they' re  so maybe they' re not clear  but there are several bicycle racks  on the plan  lots of bikes coming  and lots of bikes being left by people  to gather and allow people to ride around  outside  outside ! ! ! ! ! !  Thank you, commissioners. Again, Nicole Farley, executive director of Explore Butte County, and I'd like to strongly support the Chico Bike Park proposal.  This project really emphasizes Chico's reputation as an outdoor recreation destination, offering a compelling new visitor-serving amenity as well as a resident-serving amenity.  Bike parks and mountain biking facilities draw families and riders who spend money, again, on lodging, restaurants, dining, including what's being proposed on site.  National research shows that the average mountain biking tourist will spend over $400 per trip, which is a significant boost to our local economy and our sales tax revenues.  The Chico Bike Park offers a unique skill-based destination for families, youth, and cyclists at all levels.  As a...  resident of four or five years ago of Park City and Salt Lake City, bike parks like this were highly used and highly...
