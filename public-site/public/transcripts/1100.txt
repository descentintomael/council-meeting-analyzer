 How do you guys feel about the new project?  It's a little bit more difficult.  I'm not sure how long we're trying to make it.  It's a bit more difficult.

Welcome, everybody, to the adjourned regular city council meeting of the Chico City Council, December 20, 2022.  We will call the meeting to order and start with an invocation from Police Chapman Raymond Shelton.  Welcome.  Thank you, sir.  Let us pray.  Father, I thank you that we are able to offer prayer in this house this evening.  We thank you, God, that you have shown us what's good.  What do you require of us but that we act justly and love mercy and walk humbly before you.  May that be so in our families, in the marketplace, and in these chambers.  Lord, may we raise our own value levels to yours.  To remember tonight, justice, and mercy, and humility.  We thank you for this grace.  We pray that it will be upon this meeting and upon everyone who's attending.  We thank you in your wonderful and holy name.  Amen.  Amen.  Thank you very much.  Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Pledge of Allegiance.  Pledge of Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,  and to the republic,  All right.  Madam Clerk, if you could do roll.  Council Member Bennett.  Here.  Council Member Morgan.  Here.  Council Member Tandon.  Here.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Here.  Council Member Winslow.  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Here.  Mayor Coolidge.  Present.  All right.  If you please make a note, item 1.9 and 1.7 have been pushed to a further meeting, so  they will not take place today.  That's the proclamation for Dino Corbin.  I don't believe he was able to make it tonight.  And then the presentation on the Jesus Center, they asked for more time.  So with that, we will start with the December 20th closed session announcement from City Clerk.  Thank you, Mayor and Council.  The Council met in closed session.  We will be back in action at 5.30 today regarding two items.  It was actually labor negotiations and pending litigation.  The first item was heard with no action taken, direction.  It was actually just an update provided, and the second item was not heard regarding litigation  and will be continued to the next meeting.  That's the end of the report.  All right.  And then we will start with item 1.8, the presentation of the Arts and Culture Grant Award Program.  And I believe we have Monica McDaniel, who was the...  is the chair of the Arts Commission. Hello, thank you. It's been a while since we presented to  Council, but we wanted to put together a little video. There's been, it's been about five years  of grant funding for the 1% of TOT, which started in 2018. The Arts Commission is very grateful to  have funding to allocate to arts and cultural organizations, and so we created a presentation  to kind of show you what we've been up to for the last few years, and I'm happy to answer any  questions. And there's a printout of the same presentation in your packets, I believe, so you  can kind of preview it.  There it is.  While we're waiting for the video to play, do any members of Council have any questions?  All right, do we want to take an item and then come back to it?  Sure.  Okay, let's start with that.  Okay, thank you.  So, yeah, let's try to repair the technical difficulties. Also, as a note,  City Attorney is ill, but cannot make it to this meeting, but he is on Zoom, so  some members of the public know. So, all right, we will move on and come back to that when they're  ready, or we've solved that maybe after a break. And we will start with the consent agenda. All  matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and can be enacted in one  motion. I also wanted to make sure that we have the speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to  speak on it?  I do.  Okay, so the item should first complete a speaker card and turn it into the city clerk. To my left, to your right. Once the first speaker begins to speak, no additional cards will be accepted. So, make sure if you want to speak on an item, you turn in the card prior to us starting it. So, and do we have any speakers on the consent agenda?  No.  All right. Council disqualifications or no votes?  All right, seeing none, entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  I have a motion from Vice Mayor Rounds, a second from Council Member Mark.  I call this motion to approve this item.  is difficult for the computer for a few items and we'll just take an early break and go from there  okay all right let's start with business from the floor members of the public may address the  council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited  to three minutes or based on the number of speakers a council cannot take any action at  this meeting on items made under this section of the agenda do we have any speakers we have two  all right three for first one is James Hutchinson followed by Julia Kenner okay let's see if I can  get this correct the last meeting when councilman Winslow put several items of forward that he  wished to have agendized there was issue raised that he could not reissue re-approach  these issues for one year I went back to your rules of procedure if you look take a careful  look under them you find that under c15 which is records and communications it defines it says this  section is available for any council member member wishing to agendize an item for the  the  future meetings okay agendize but under section c7 the only place where the one year penalty is  mentioned in fact says that the consideration of an agenda item the council will neither  rehear nor reconsider an issue within one year  the council will neither rehear nor reconsider an issue within one year  after a decision has been made unless it is a member of the prevailing side request reconsideration  within the time the request will be made replaced on reports and communication if the council  votes to reconsider the matter it can be reconsidered but here's the problem  it says reconsider of an agenda item the first statement said to agendize  what he was attempting to do was to reconsider the matter and the council was not willing to reconsider the matter  but this was something that was written through this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this  forward based on the rules that were stated here and should be allowed to bring these items forward  again. I think reasonably to take time to think about it this time and put it out there, but I  think he's entitled. Your own rules state that. There is no one-year penalty for failure to  agendize. Thank you for your time. Our next speaker is Julia Kenner.  Hello, board. My name is Julia Keener, and I am here to speak for Upper Bidwell Park again,  and I am still requesting that you, as a board,  approach the Parks Department and ask them to keep the gate closed at Diversion Dam.  And there are many reasons for that, but one of them is the destruction in the park. So we are  not able to maintain our parks. It is, as everyone says, the crown jewel. It is what we advertise  the city on. It is what we sell subdivisions for, everything else, and we are not able to maintain  our parks. And we are not caring for it, and we have no ability to open up more land to cars for  that. The road is always accessible to people on bikes or walking. It just needs to be closed to  cars. So I just heard recently that the city turned down the offer of Valley's Edge for more open  space, for 400 acres of more open space, because not everyone can get in. So I think it is a great  opportunity to buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride,  buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride,  buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride,  buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride,  buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride,  buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride, buy this ride,  services we don't have the ability in the city to care for that land for  vehicles and mass amounts of people please put it on whatever you do to talk  to the city to change that place thank you Julia could I ask would you mind  adding your phone numbers because staff wanted to reach out to you after the  last time so she has your card back there thank you all right thank you  and with council concurrence I was hoping to move item 5.2 up which is the  confirmation of the police chief to the beginning of the meeting agenda if  anyone has an issue we all good okay so we're gonna take out in 5.2 first and  someone she goes finest in the back there that we want to get on to the rest  of things so mr. city manager take it away Thank You mayor and council the  city charter states that the city has a right to have a public office and a  public service that connects all public service to public service our public  service service our public service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service service service  annual salary of $189,000. With over 20 years of law enforcement experience, including nearly 18  years at Chico Police Department, serving in a wide variety of assignments, Chief Aldridge has  demonstrated the leadership qualities, the professionalism, and the integrity to lead the  department into the future. And with that, I recommend council confirmation of the appointment  of Billy Aldridge as our next Chief of Police. All right. Do we have any questions?  Do we have any speakers? No speakers. All right. I believe there's a...  I would happily move to approve to have Billy Aldridge as our next Chief of Police.  Second. Second from Council Member Tandon.  So. Okay. Council Member Bennett.

Congratulations.  I just want to say thank you to everyone  for the support over the last couple of months.  I want to say thank you to my wife  who has been supporting me for 23 years now  in this job, or 23 years in marriage  and almost 23 years in this job.  So my two boys who have been here,  been through it all since they were born.

And I just want to say thank you to each one of you  because without your efforts,  I wouldn't be where I am today.  So I greatly appreciate everything you do every day.  And it's my honor to stand up here as the next chief  and say that I'm going to do everything I can  to help support you.  I'm going to support you every day.  And then everything I can to help make this a great community  to live, work, and recreate.  So I thank every one of you.  And I look forward to serving you for many years now.  Thank you.  All right.  Why don't we take a short five-minute recess,  see if we can handle our technical difficulty  and get back on track.  OK.  Thank you.  I am Mike Glasper,  our senior public service administrator  for our shared shared shared shared  shared  shared  shared  shared  Yeah, that's beautiful.  Yeah, that's beautiful.

Yeah, that's beautiful.  All right, so apparently our technical difficulty will remain and we will pick it back up at  the next meeting and do the Arts and Culture Grant Program awards then, so we're very sorry  about that.  But we will look forward to doing it at our next meeting perhaps.  All right, so moving on now for public hearings, we have item 4.1, Appeal of Pet Shop Permit  Denial, Wags and Whiskers Pet Rescue.  And I believe we, I don't even have to say chief anymore, Billy Aldridge, but thank you.  I'm going to turn this over to Animal Services Manager Tracy Moore.  All right.  Come on in.  We're up.  Come on in.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the City Council.  My apologies, I am literally just gotten here from having flown in.  So my apologies.  I've got to get a couple things out.  So yeah, so we should be turning this over to who?  City staff at this point.  You're not up yet.  We're not up yet.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're not up yet.  You're not up yet.  My apologies.  Yeah.  We'll let you know when to come on now.  Very good.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening, everyone.  You know, before we do that, let's do the announcement of ex-parte communications, so  if anyone has any, so, just as part of the formal public hearing, so does anyone have  any communications with any of the parties involved?  I've communicated with staff, but nobody other than staff, and we have Wags and Whiskers.  Alright, no, okay, sorry about that, go ahead.  Well, that's quite all right, so we passed an ordinance over the summer, and we we we  to define pet shops and kennels and to require pet shops and kennels to get a permit in order to operate within the city.  One of the applications we received was from Wags and Whiskers Pet Rescue to operate as a pet shop.  Animal Control and our code enforcement did an inspection, sort of a pre-application or a pre-approval inspection,  and we determined that Wags and Whiskers is not operating as a pet shop, but rather operating as a kennel.  And so we denied the permit based on operations.  These are violations of what their current operations are.  So I am open to any questions that you have.  We did submit a report that kind of outlines our reasoning.  There's a lot of concerns about disease control.  We've had a lot of complaints from the public who have adopted animals from Wags and Whiskers,  and there's a huge number of...  cases of diseases like parvo and distemper, but then also there's a lot of different diseases  that we're seeing that are kind of unusual to the area. I can kind of give you a real quick  rundown of what some of those diseases are besides parvo and distemper, which are generally  fatal, unfortunately. Kennel cough seems to be very common. Giardia, which is a zoonotic, which  people can also get. Coccidia, pneumonia, valley fever, mycoplasma, pithiosis, which is also called  swamp fever, ehrlichia, and coronavirus. So those are some of the complaints we have received  over the last seven years when people have been adopting animals, and we have numerous complaints.  I have a file here of complaints of people who have adopted animals,  and unfortunately those animals became very ill, and even after spending literally thousands  of dollars, those animals still succumb to the diseases. So part of that is because of the setup  of the facility. It's not really designed as a kennel. It's not really designed to prevent  disease transmission, and all of that is kind of outlined in our report. Just the structure of the  kennel is kind of outlined in our report. It's kind of outlined in our report. It's kind of outlined  in the facility. The space is adequate for a pet shop, but it is not adequate to house 100  animals in a space that is only 3,400 square feet. In comparison, our adoptable dog building  is 4,500 square feet, and we house approximately 38 or 40 animals in that space. So they're putting  more than double the animals in a space that is smaller than one of our kennel buildings, which is  a building separate from incoming animals. We have a system where we're keeping incoming animals,  isolating them, making sure they're healthy before we put them up for adoption. So having so many  animals in such a small space, it just doesn't work. You know, Wags and Whiskers obviously is  trying to  rescue animals, and we commend them for that. Unfortunately, they're trying to do it in a space  that really is not designed for what they're trying to do. So, okay. All right, questions for staff?  Just for the good of the public, this all started because we've asked every single  rescue and or existing kennel or shelter to apply and determine where they are, and they need to do  it. So you either determine they're a pet shop or a kennel, correct? Correct. Yes. And can you define  what a pet shop or a kennel would be just for the good of the public? Yeah. So a pet shop is a retail  space. So several years ago, the state changed the codes, the state codes, so that pet shops could  not sell dogs, cats, or rabbits. So in the past, you could go to a pet shop and buy a puppy. It  could have been from a breeder. It could have been from a puppy mill.  And the state decided they didn't want pet shops selling animals anymore. So they changed the laws  and they said pet shops can't sell dogs, cats, or rabbits, but they can provide space to showcase  animals for adoption through rescue groups, humane societies, animal control agencies.  And again, sort of like if you've ever been into PetSmart, and they have the little display in the  front where you can house some cats.  And TECO Animal Shelter has utilized that space in the past. And PetSmart rotates animals in and  out. So you have two weeks, you put some cats in there, and if they get adopted, great. If not,  then you take them back. And then another organization has a chance to showcase animals.  So that really was the intent of the law, was to allow pet shops to provide space  for groups to come in and adopt animals out. Or some pet co. lets you come in and set up a pet shop.  And adopt animals out. So that's kind of what a pet shop is. A kennel is really a facility that houses animals.  All right, perfect. Thank you. No more questions? Thank you very much.  All right. And then from here, we'll open the public hearing. And we have the applicant. That's 15 minutes.  Okay. And that is Lucy.  Lucy Parks, who's the appellant. Okay. And I'll put on 15 minutes.  I'll stop. I'll get to this side of you. Either way. All right. That's my better side.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the City Council. My name is Arthur Trevieso. I'm the attorney for Wags and Whiskers.  I'm a licensed attorney in California. I've been retained by Ms. Parks to speak on behalf of Wags and Whiskers,  which is a nonprofit.  entity that has been in operation for seven years. Seven years without incident. Seven years without a single returned animal.  Seven years without a single complaint back to Ms. Parks or any of the board of directors of Wags and Whiskers.  I can't speak to the claims that I believe it's Ms. Moore's made with respect to these allegations.  I can't speak to the claims that I believe it's Ms. Moore's made with respect to these allegations.  that there is a disease issue with this property.  Because when we asked for her to provide us with the alleged complaints, it was refused.  So we simply could not even see what it was that was being asserted.  Now, the problem that we have here is, as you guys may be very well aware,  when an animal is adopted, it is in a condition to be adopted.  It won't be given up for adoption if it isn't in the condition to be adopted.  Once control of that animal is given to the new owner, it is the responsibility of that new owner to keep that animal healthy.  If a month later, two months later, six months later, a year later, this animal gets ill,  it cannot be put back on the rescue that literally nursed this animal back to health to the point where it could be adopted.  On that point, it's important to note that Wags and Whiskers is neither a kennel,  nor a  pet shop. It is not a retail store. It is a rescue.  In fact, it is the only rescue in the city of Chica.  Its purpose is to take in animals. Its primary purpose is to take in animals that are injured, ill, in some other way.  Literally, its purpose is to prevent the very thing that the aforementioned inspector is indicating Wags and Whiskers is causing.  It's taking animals off the street that are ill, that may be diseased, taking them off the street,  taking them out of the public, taking them where they could potentially pose a risk of harm to other people's pets,  or even to humans, and nurturing these animals back to health so that they can be adopted.  That is the purpose of Wags and Whiskers here.  And I would contend that this entity, Wags and Whiskers, doesn't fall within either of the definitions that is delineated within this ordinance.  If it does, it's closer to that of a kennel in the sense that animals are stored there,  but unlike a kennel where primarily people put their dogs while they go on vacation,  put their dogs while they're otherwise occupied and can't care for the animal,  this operation has a completely different purpose.  And that purpose is not contemplated by what I consider to be a simultaneously overbroad and yet,  uh,  uh,  overly specific,  such that it doesn't really cover the kind of operation that this pet rescue operates.  When the city inspector is arguing that,  oh, look at the 4,500 square foot operation that we have for our,  for our,  um,  for our pet adoption center and how many animals we have in it,  that is not an implication that that is a correct number or that that is a correct ratio.  In fact,  there,  Ms.  Parks and Wags and Whiskers is not violating any state ordinance by the number of animals they are keeping in the space that they are keeping it,  nor is it a violation of this municipal code because this municipal code does not specify such parameters.  It simply indicates that these kinds of operations,  a pet shop store or a kennel need a permit.  Now,  let's talk about the genuine singular thing that does need to be fixed at this,  at this property.  And how fixable it is.  Because when,  when the inspection occurred,  we were provided with a list of the reasons why the permit was being denied.  In fact,  only one of them is a legitimate concern.  And that is the issue concerning resurfacing the flooring area.  Now,  Ms.  Parks has ordered the,  um,  the substance that needs to cover the flooring area.  But thanks to supply chain issues,  it's been delayed in recovery.  The second issue is,  it arrives,  which should be within the next month.  Today.  It arrived today.  Well,  it actually arrived today.  There we go.  I was,  I was told it was going to be January.  Um,  but it's arrived today.  Wags and whiskers can easily get in compliance,  even if in fact it needs to be in compliance with this municipal code.  And all we are asking for today from the,  from the city council is time to do it.  Wags and whiskers cannot cease operations,  get into compliance,  and then say,  come back out and check out we're doing.  If you shut down a rescue,  those dogs and those animals have to go somewhere,  which means they're going to end up being euthanized or whatever.  Don't get adopted.  I don't even know what happens to them after that point.  It's an operation that must continue to operate and a variance must be given to exit whiskers while they are getting into compliance with whatever physical,  physical,  um, !  Modifications must be made to the property to have it pass inspection of the things that were listed with respect to,  um,  this,  this,  this,  thing that we acknowledge needs to be fixed is the flooring surface. Ms. Parks has ordered and  has now received the materials to be able to coat the flooring surface so that that deficiency will  be mitigated, will be ameliorated, in fact. As a result, all we need is the time to do it.  And as this body earlier this year, when it was discussing back in, I believe it was February,  I saw the entire video that had some different faces that are here now,  although I do remember Police Chief Aldridge was there. Even Police Chief Aldridge said  there needs to be some time given so that businesses that fall under this can be in  compliance. It'd be only fair. And that's ultimately what we're asking for here. We're  asking for fairness in the way the City Council allows an operation that has operated without  incident for over seven years.  Has adopted over 1,200 animals. Sorry, I'm off again by a number. 12,000 animals during those  seven years. And we're talking about a few complaints. It baffles the mind, in my opinion,  that this Council is contemplating shutting down Wags and Whiskers given the prominent good it has  done the community for over a decade.  We're asking for fairness in the way the City Council allows an operation that has  been under the control of the City Council for over seven years in terms of getting these animals  healthy and get them back into their forever homes, as they use the term, with pet rescues.  Pet rescues are a unique thing. They are different from other kinds of adoption centers because  they have a specific medical, actually a veterinary purpose with respect to dealing with these  diseased sick animals and getting them to the point where they don't have to be euthanized, where they  can recover.  It is one of the most humane things that can be done for these animals. And speaking personally as a dog  owner, and I'm sure many in the City Council as well as in the audience can attest to, lots of rescue animals  end up living long, very productive lives. The circumstances that got them in need of rescue are circumstances  that are fixable. They're treatable. And that's in fact why there have been over 12,000 successful adoptions.  And at most, if we want to believe that there's been a handful of complaints, what does that number measure  against 12,000? Percentage-wise, numerically. We're not even told how many complaints there have been.  We're not even told what the complaints are. And I have seen no documentation showing a single incident of an animal  carrying a disease that they carried to the public from Wags and Whiskers. Lots of animals that never see the inside of a  pet rescue get kennel cough. It's not something that is unique to that physical location. And the same goes for a  variety of these other diseases that were mentioned. There is simply no causal relationship between those few complaints,  alludged complaints, because I'm not even sure that they're real, but assuming that they are real, that they have any  connection to something being done wrong here. There's nothing being done wrong here, and there's no connection on the  outside of the property, otherwise. We're asking the City Council to provide my client with a variance permitting my  client, Wags and Whiskers, to continue to operate temporarily under a timetable that this body considers to be reasonable  in order to mitigate the current deficiencies that physically exist at that property. This property is perfectly appropriate  from a size standpoint.  Neither the municipal court nor the city council can do that.  I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct,  but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct,  but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct,  but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct,  but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct, but I am guilty of this misconduct,  for the inspector to go back out there.  But shutting down the kennel, excuse me,  shutting down the rescue is effectively putting it out of business  because it would literally have to start over again.  It would have to get rid of its existing animals,  do what it has to do,  then have to start over again in its rescue missions.  What we're asking is for this body to do the humane thing,  the very thing that Wags and Whiskers does on a daily basis,  and keep these animals under Wags and Whiskers care  to help them get healthy,  to help them find their forever homes,  and provide Wags and Whiskers with a clearly defined timetable  to get into compliance, an opportunity to inspect,  and if there's any remaining deficiencies,  an opportunity to address those deficiencies within the timetable  so that Wags and Whiskers can continue to operate  and provide another seven years or even longer of service to this community  as it is done for the population.  I thank you for your time, I'll reserve it.  I believe you have some questions from the council,  if you don't mind.  Council Member Morgan.  Thank you, Mayor.  So a letter was sent to Wags and Whiskers.  It specifically listed all the violations associated with the Chico Municipal Code,  the California Code of Regulations, California Penal Code,  California Code of Food and Agriculture,  and California Health and Safety Code.  Are you saying you didn't get that letter?  This letter, you're talking about the letter dated November 2nd?  That was going to be my next question, what was it dated?  The date of the letter, the only letter that we received  was a letter dated November 2nd, 2022.  Is that the letter that lists out specifically all the violations  from the different organizations I just listed?  It does delineate, it delineates a variety of alleged violations.  So here we are two months later and what's changed?  Well, part of the problem, as it just indicated, is that one of the issues,  one of the issues, is that the  flooring substance that needed to be obtained was literally only obtained today.  It was ordered immediately, but because of supply chain issues, it's been delayed.  Okay, I heard you say that.  And you're saying that that's going to cover all the violations here?  What we're saying is there are several of these alleged violations that aren't violations, in fact.  So we're contending that we're disputing these violations.  Okay?  The only one of these that I've seen...  You answered the question, thank you.  Sure.  All right, further questions from council?  If I could, if I, one thing that if I could, if I can add to my...  You still have time in your hand.  Yeah, thank you very much.  Welcome to continue.  Yeah, with respect to the November 2nd, 2022 letter...  And I believe that letter is November 1st, but yeah.  I have it.  Mine says November 2nd.  Be that as it may.  Okay.  We have gone through, and I had it looked at by a veterinary expert who indicated that,  as to these violations, the only one of these that actually holds water,  the citation actually references what it is that the alleged violation is,  concerns this issue concerning the flooring.  That the rest of these, that the rest of these simply are,  are essentially, are a misapplication of the law at best.  With that, with that, if there's any other questions.  All right.  No other questions.  And you'll get a rebuttal time on what the public...  Very good.  Comments.  Thank you for your time.  Yep.  All right.  Do we have additional speakers from the public?  We do.  We have nine.  Okay.  Three minutes.  All right.  And I'm going to call the first two names, and if you could line up in the middle,  if you hear your name.  And I apologize.  I couldn't read most of the writing on the cards from the same person.  So, Kylie is our first speaker, followed by Dasha.  Kylie.  And if Dasha could go ahead and line up in the back.  That would be great.  Hi.  First of all, I want to thank you for letting me speak.  This is Sadie Mae.  This is a very hard topic for me.  On January 29th, my boyfriend Nathaniel and I decided to go adopt a puppy.  We started our new lives here in Chico.  And that was the 29th.  And this is one of the last pictures I got with her.  Is her sick.  Her last couple days, I couldn't even be with her.  I wrote something to say because there's so much to say.  And such little time.  I said, to whom it may concern, it has come to our attention that Wags and Whiskers Pet Rescue  is appealing a denial for a new business permit to continue the operation.  Please, do not issue a business permit to Wags and Whiskers of any kind.  Our story is one that I know is shared with many people in our community.  A story of falling in love with a new adoptive.  We can only urge the City Council members to deny Wags and Whiskers any kind of business permit at all.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  The pain and suffering that we endured was so unbearable and unnecessary.  I can summarize our sad story like this.  On January 29th, we adopted our beloved Sadie, who we were told about 10 weeks.  We enjoyed our first couple of days very much with her, with our new little addition.  But it took...  It took a turn very quickly.  With approximately two days, she was seen by Chico Pet Vet,  which we were advised to go to them for Wags and Whiskers if with any concerns.  And she was...  She was diagnosed with discharge as an oncoming sinus infection.  The next day, I took her back and I said, something's really wrong.  She was then given medication for kennel cough.  They told us...  I'm sorry.  Another two days later,  I insisted on bringing her back to the vet because I knew something was wrong.  Sadie increased symptoms, reverse sneezing, running nose,  struggled to breathe properly, diarrhea, and she refused to eat or drink.  We returned to Chico Pet Vet where she was told...  We were told she had parvo and it was very serious.  Chico Pet Vet recommended that we transfer her to VCA right away,  where she was taken into emergency care.  She was then diagnosed with kennel cough, parvo, pneumonia, and parasites.  We were shocked and in complete disbelief.  They had told us that she's been sick for some time.  That in that small amount, she could not have gotten that sick.  We tried everything possible to keep Sadie alive,  but ultimately her illness could not be beat.  On February 8th, our baby died.  After $7,000 of vet bills, we had no baby.  No one else should go through this pain that we went through.  Wags and Whiskers should be ashamed of themselves for adopting out sick puppies.  Many professionals who have spoken to us said,  that there's no way we could have gotten Sadie sick.  When we approached Wags and Whiskers, they showed no remorse and shut the door in our face.  Thank you.  Dasha followed by Tanya.  I just want to say thank you for letting me speak.  So I came up here to speak about Wags and Whiskers,  and why I strongly believe they should not be able to operate and stay open.  You all know the joy of getting a new puppy and bringing it home and having that excitement.  But think about that.  That being taken away within a day, two days, three days.  So my best friend just spoke and I was the other person who got a puppy with her.  We were extremely excited to be raising two dogs together.  And very quickly her dog became sick.  When we adopted my dog, they also told me that it was totally fine for our dogs to be together,  which was the first sign of something I knew was wrong.  Puppies, when they're at that stage, should not be mixed litters.  They should not be with another litter that they didn't grow up with.  None of our puppies had shots yet, but they said it was going to be completely fine.  Like my best friend said, she ended up having to put her puppy down,  who later had to, or later had parvo bronchitis, pneumonia, and a lot more.  She paid thousands of dollars to keep their puppy alive and sadly had to put her down.  I also ended up getting a puppy from Wags and Whiskers and paid $650,  not knowing what kind of place they were.  No adoption fees should be $650.  I worked at the SPCA back in my hometown in Burlingame,  and the most we would charge is about $100.  You walk into a store and you see all these adorable puppies,  and who wouldn't want to get one?  You send in an application and they tell you that you have to be 21.  Both my friend and I are not 21 and they still allowed us to adopt,  but later turned away other people saying that they couldn't adopt because they weren't 21.  Their rules were completely different.  They would switch up their answers on the story of my puppy, her puppy, and a bunch of other people's dogs.  The next day I got a call and told that she wasn't able to be adopted because she wasn't spayed.  The day after that I got a message saying that she was able to be adopted since they spayed her.  They spayed her at a month and a half old, which is not okay for any dog to be spayed that young.  For a lot of female dogs, then they won't have the hormones to be able to grow properly.  When I walked in there, different litters of puppies were mixed together with poop and pee all over the floors,  which is what causes so many diseases to spread.  They gave me a bag full of medicine without telling me what it was for,  and they have to disclose what medicine is being given and why.  When I asked, they told me that it was to treat normal conditions such as kennel cough.  I had a bag full of about 15 different medicines that they were giving my puppy with no explanation at all.  They have a big sign on their door that says no refunds at all,  and if you're at a real rescue such as Butte Humane or Chico Inn,  they give you a certain amount of period to come back and bring in your dog for whatever reason.  Chico Pet Vet as well has a no refund policy.  I'm asking that you guys please help shut down this place  because they are taking away so many puppies' lives  and not doing the right proper cleanup conditions for these places.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tanya followed by Art.  Hi.  Hi.  My daughters and I decided to, we had a dog that had a false pregnancy,  and we brought her in, and she was, the vet suggested there was four puppies that she could nurse,  and we took the puppies home.  Nobody vetted us.  They just dropped the puppies off at our house and gave us dollar store bottles and some powder formula.  And then on top of that, she ended up selling the dogs out of her backyard, essentially,  took the puppies, at five and a half weeks, spayed them.  One of the dogs we were able to keep, which I paid $650 or $700  because my daughters didn't want to see that animal go back there.  Because they spayed her so soon, she has a hooded vulva, which means she gets UTIs all the time.  As far as communication with Lucy, there is no communication.  She will scream at you and rip you a new one.  She's very aggressive with her dogs.  She's a very aggressive woman.  Willow, when she was there for the 48 hours, she came back with parvo, a bacterial infection,  and ooze coming out of her and had to be treated.  Since she was taken at that young age, it helped, from what the vet said,  it's a critical area of their development.  She's now aggressive to other people and afraid of them.  So we've still been keeping Willow, trying to find a home for her also.  And it's been, what, two years later?  Lucy is running as a non-profit, but it's a puppy mill.  It's a puppy mill that's there.  It's horrible.  I ask that you guys to make sure that her license is taken away.  I'm sorry, I'm shaking.  But thank you.  Thank you.  And I understand Art was the attorney.  So Pearl followed by Roberta.  Do I use the microphone?  No.  The microphone's built into the podium, so you don't need that.  Okay, perfect.  Okay.  I'm here to speak on behalf of Wags and Whiskers.  Wags and Whiskers, as you have already heard,  has saved over 12,000 animals in the past seven years.  No one in the world wants there to be this problem for there to be so many homeless animals.  Wags and Whiskers would not want this to be a problem.  It's a problem that they don't choose to have.  It's a problem that the world has put onto these animals.  The animals don't deserve to die, be with the knives and shelters every year.  I understand that the new ordinance was put into place to regulate pet shops, and since  Wags and Whiskers has to be coded as a pet shop because there's no other way to code,  for a rescue, their permit was denied.  And it says that they have to wait 12 months to reapply.  That's not fair to the animals that live there.  It's not fair to the many, many people that have adopted and found their family members  through adopt-close.  I am sure that this is something that our public service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service service service  service service service service service service service service service service service service service service  and be given a chance to fix them before just being outright denied. The things  listed in that letter are repairable. The disease spreading aspect of things have  been put into place to ameliorate that. As I stated, you know, no one in the world  wants this to be a problem. We wish that people would all spay and neuter their  pets and this would not be a problem, but it is. There are homeless cats and dogs all  over the world and many, many, many of them are euthanized every day. Wags and Whiskers  just wants to try to help those animals because there aren't a lot of places that do. Thank  you. Thank you, Roberta, followed by Rachel. I'm a staff member at Wags and Whiskers.  I've been  there for six years. There's many things that I can say, but one thing is  we have probably spayed and neutered thousands of animals,  thousands. I'm on the surgical team. We put in that work so that these animals,  so this isn't an issue. I'm somebody that stays up with these animals at night when they're sick.  I don't see any other shelters doing this.  I don't, we get calls every  single day. I don't see any other shelters doing this. I don't, we get calls every single  day. I have cats. I have dogs. I have this. Nobody else is stepping up to take care of these animals.  I've seen these animals be put down at Stanislaus, Bakersfield, all these shelters. If we didn't step  up, who's going to step up? Like I said, I've been here six years. We've done nothing but get better,  improve our facilities. We have a great vet that takes care of all these animals 24-7  on our days off. We're there taking care of these animals because we care.  People say it's a puppy mill, but we don't have just puppies. We get calls from shelters saying  we have this animal. We're going to euthanize it because we don't have a vet that's going to  take care of it. So we take these animals in and we take care of them and give them a second chance  in life. And none of that would be possible without Lucy.  There's not really much to say other than if nobody else is going to step up for these animals  and shut us down and then they all get put down. That's pretty much it.  Thank you. Rachel followed by Diane Lewis.  Hello, my name is Raquel. I am actually just wanting to explain a little bit of our intake  process. I don't think there's enough information. I'm not sure if you can hear me. I'm not sure if  we have any information on that. Every animal that comes into us is examined, vaccinated,  microchipped. We are not just taking animals off the street and flipping them over for $600,  $700 without any kind of vetting. There's a vetting process. There's a quarantine period  involved as well. And just like any other shelter in this country, kennel cough and disease is a  risk, just like it would be at Chico Animal Shelter, Butte Humane Society, the Northwest  House House House House House House House House House House House House House House  it is a risk and I know everybody does their absolute best to prevent that.  We all likely use the same cleaning solution.  So it's not like, I just want to make it clear that we don't,  we're not out here sprinkling kennel cough on anything or distemper or parvo.  And anytime there is a case of that,  we make sure to do all of the appropriate testing.  I myself have communicated with adopters.  I believe I communicated with some of the adopters that were here.  Um, it was the person who, um,  went to Tanya's house and took bottles and supplies to her as a foster.  I communicated with her.  I talked to her.  I didn't just show up to her house and drop off puppies and bottles from the dollar store.  I don't think the bottles has anything to do with it, honestly.  And I communicated with her often.  She communicated with all of us.  Um, we don't spay animals before they're eight weeks old.  They get spayed at eight weeks old or even after, you know, if they don't get adopted before then.  So I do just want to clarify that we are always looking to improve.  We're always looking for suggestions.  We welcome volunteers.  We welcome input.  Um, I don't think it's fair that we, you know, are having all of these complaints  when we have the same issues with some of the other organizations in town.  We get countless calls, um, about people who feel they're not getting the approval.  We're not getting the appropriate help from either the local agencies or other rescues in this area.  So, um, I will say that we are one of the rescues that steps us, steps up, steps up, steps up the most  because we have an amazing doctor.  We have an amazing team.  We have a great foster program and a great volunteer system.  And I feel really proud to have that in this organization.  Thank you, Diane Lewis, followed by Katrina Woodcocks.  Good evening.  My name is Dr. Lewis.  I'm a veterinarian that began working closely with Wags and Whiskers, um, six months ago.  Uh, Wags and Whiskers called me from Texas.  I was a relief vet in Texas, um, and came to, uh, check out the rescue organization.  And I chose to stay with Wags and Whiskers mainly because I've never seen  a, um, a group of people and a rescue organization that cared as much about animals as this rescue.  And they deserved my help.  Um, so I started there six months ago.  Since I began working with Wags and Whiskers, um, I have worked closely with the, with the, um, support staff  and the management staff.  And every single protocol I've, I've, uh, suggested, they've put in place immediately.  Um, I have written numerous infectious disease control protocols, um, and, uh, intake protocols, quarantine, isolation, everything.  They've followed to a T.  They accept help.  They accept any criticism.  Um.  And all they want to do is help animals.  I was a relief vet before I worked at Wags and Whiskers, which meant I worked at many different, many different vet clinics, rescues, um, and shelters.  I've never seen a rescue or shelter that did not have, um, issues with infectious diseases.  And the reason for this is because they get animals.  They rescue animals from the street.  They get them from high kill shelters.  They get them from, uh, owner surrenders that didn't take care of their animals properly or didn't have the means to.  So they're getting animals from everywhere.  Um.  Another important thing to mention is that all, the majority of infectious diseases have an average of anywhere from three to 30 days of a quarantine.  So that's a, uh, of a incubation period.  So nobody knows what they're coming in with.  They just have to deal with it once it's there.  Um.  Wags and Whiskers has developed the, the growth that I've seen, um, with their infectious disease control and, um, isolation and quarantine, uh, has improved dramatically.  And they have a veterinarian that works with those animals 24-7.  So they can only improve from here.  And if you, and you're going to shut them down right when they're making their biggest improvements and saving the most animals.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Katrina Woodcocks followed by Karen Holcomb.  Hi. Katrina Woodcocks.  I'm the director of Beat Humane Society.  Um.  Beat Humane Society is also a rescue.  We don't have a city or county contract.  So we are also a rescue as well.  So there isn't just one rescue in town.  Um.  I, I think as I'm listening to everything I heard as I walked in that Wags and Whiskers wasn't considered either a pet store or a shelter.  It was a rescue.  Um.  And I heard of fairness tonight as well.  And I'm just speaking from Beat Humane Society's point of view of fairness.  Uh.  When we were on Fair Street for 25 years, we held the city contract.  The city, the city took that contract back over in 2010.  Forcing Beat Humane Society to find different locations.  Um.  We moved our veterinary clinic and our animal housing, our cat animal housing over on Country Drive which required us to get a conditional use permit to be able to function in that location.  Um.  After the campfire we had to move from that location and we moved over to Longfellow.  Uh.  We moved our veterinary hospital and our cat boarding facility over there as well.  It cost us over $10,000 and a lot of time but we had to get conditional use permits to do business in that location as well.  Um.  We started building our new facility out on Garner Lane.  We had to get a multitude of conditional use permits which cost us a lot of money and a lot of energy and time to do the vetting process in the neighborhood and talking to everybody.  Um.  But to do that business, to be an animal shelter, to be a veterinary clinic, to house animals in that location, we had to get a conditional use permit.  So if Wags and Whiskers is not a pet shop and they are a rescue and they're sheltering animals, I feel it only fair to Beat Humane Society and to any other business that they go through the same conditional use permit process and get the appropriate conditional use permit.  So we had to get a conditional use permit to do business in that location.  Um.  Secondly, I just want to speak to, um, it's great, 12,000 animals, fantastic, wonderful.  I'd like to know how many of those 12,000 animals have stayed in those homes.  Um.  It's great to say that you have 12,000 animals adopted.  That's fantastic.  I love that number.  But let's make sure that we're talking real numbers here.  Is it 12,000 animals that have come into Chico from outlying areas, from the Bay Area, from Southern California, from Texas, from Texas?  Okay.  So, um, I know there's a lot of Chihuahua and 12,000 animals coming into Chico and then being adopted out.  Are they successfully adopted out?  Are they dying?  Are they returned to other animal shelters?  I know they're being returned to, um, Chico Animal Shelter.  They're being returned to Beat Humane Society, to Haven Humane Society.  They're being returned because they're not being taken back into Wags and Whiskers.  And that is a best practice standard in animal sheltering.  If you adopt out an animal, if that animal doesn't work out for whatever reason, you try very hard to bring that animal back into Oregon.  You shouldn't be charging people to bring animals back.  So, speaking from fairness, um, and mostly importantly, speaking about the conditions of the animals,  I know that there isn't any state statute that says how an animal should be sheltered or housed,  but there is the UC Davis-Crit, um, shelter, um, medicine, and they set the standard for that.  And I would just ask if they're going to house 100 animals in a location that those animals have ample room to move around.  Thank you.  Katrina, can I ask you a quick question?  Sure.  How many square feet is your new facility?  Um, 25,000, but our actual space for our animals, for our cats and dogs, is around 10,000, 12,000.  So about 10,000.  And on average, can you say about how many you house there?  Um, we, we have, um...  I know it goes up and down, obviously.  We have 50 dog kennels.  30 of them are adoption and 10 are hold, and that's not including our quarantine and sick rooms for dogs.  And we can house up to 70 to 100 cats in kennels.  Um, one cat a day.  And we can house up to 100 cats or a litter of kittens per kennel.  And likewise for dogs.  One dog, um, maximum two dogs in a kennel, unless it's in the puppy rooms, which are much larger for litters of puppies.  So about 50 dogs and 60, 70-ish cats, plus other holding animals.  Mm-hmm.  And about 10,000 square feet.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Ms. Westcott?  Yes.  Hi.  Hi.  So, if I understand correctly, um, you're requesting that Wags and Whiskers go through the same process, the same, um, uh, permitting process,  as any other, uh, entity of its type here in Chico.  Could you give me some kind of idea how long that might take to, um, occur?  I, I don't know.  I mean, I remember it was several weeks.  Um, I don't know actually.  But, I mean, going through the conditional use permit process to be a shelter, they would still have to comply and adhere to the permitting process to have, to house animals, right, that, that you passed several months ago.  Um, so, I mean, it's one thing to get the conditional use, but it's also you have to meet the requirements to house the animals humanely and safely.  In your opinion, is it possible to do that?  It's, it's a matter of, uh, probably money, time.  Money, time, space.  And you had to go through that process several times, as I understand it.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  And successfully.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Our last speaker is Karen Holcomb.  Yes.  Good evening.  I wasn't planning on speaking, um, so I'm gonna try to keep it focused, and, um, try to stay on topic.  I think we can all agree that people in Chico love their pets, a lot.  I, myself, I have a 5-year-old Rottweiler mix that I got, from Wags & Whiskers, and I feel so blessed to have that dog.  I feel particularly blessed after hearing this story.  all the stories that I have heard from the general public about the horror stories they have experienced at Wags and Whiskers.  I feel blessed to have a healthy dog.  I feel blessed to have a healthy dog that didn't get my other dog sick to where I had to euthanize everybody in the house.  I work in animal rescue.  I'm sorry, I volunteer in animal rescue.  I have heard story after story after story of how they do not follow best practices, of how my neighbor's nephew brought home a dog.  That dog was sick, got their dog sick, and they ended up euthanizing both dogs.  I would ask you to please uphold this denial.  I don't think they follow best practices.  I have no...  I have no doubt that the people who work there have the best of intentions.  Anybody who works in any type of animal rescue has the best of intentions.  It's a tough job.  But if you don't follow best practices and keep your pets healthy and keep the general public healthy, that is not a good thing.  And I don't think they follow best practices.  I think it's very difficult for somebody to come up here tonight and to tell you that they don't follow best practices.  I am here to tell you this story of what they've gone through with a loss, but they took the time to come down here and appeal to you, and tell you that story, and ask you to uphold this denial.  I am here to tell you this story of what they've gone through with a loss, but they took the time to come down here and appeal to you, and tell you that story, and ask you to uphold this denial.  I am here to tell you this story of what they've gone through with a loss, but they took the time to come down here and appeal to you, and tell you that story, and ask you to uphold this denial.  I am here to tell you this story of what they've gone through with a loss, but they took the time to come down here and appeal to you, and tell you that story, and ask you to uphold this denial.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, everybody.  I appreciate your input.  And now we will move on to the appellant rebuttal.  Three minutes.  Thank you again, ladies and gentlemen of the City Council.  We heard from several people today.  Specifically, we heard from three people that had a negative experience at Wax and Whiskers.  Direct testimony from those people with knowledge of exactly what happened to them.  That's three people out of over 12,000 people.  And I'm not suggesting that this body could possibly hear all 12,000.  But it's notable to hear the deafening silence.  Of the thousands of people who did not have a problem.  And the fact that there's literally at this point only three people that have come before this body.  And I feel for these people.  As a dog owner myself, it's sad to hear.  But there is no evidence that Wax and Whiskers did anything wrong in causing these particular animals' deaths.  What is three out of 12,000?  As a percentage, it's .025%.  That is not grounds to be shutting this operation down.  And that is not the motivation behind the denial of this permit.  The motivation behind the denial of this permit has nothing to do with these allegations.  It has to do with an inspection that we contend has one valid point that is being addressed by Ms. Parks and her operation.  What we heard as well were people that were...  That are...  That are directly involved with Wax and Whiskers.  And most importantly, I think the person that was...  I really appreciated both Pearl and Roberta's comments that gave sort of a ground level view of what Wax and Whiskers does on a daily basis.  And the value they have to the community.  But I think Dr. Diane Lewis was literally the only expert that testified today.  That talked to this body about the reality.  Not supposition, like Ms. Holcomb presented.  Who...  Who basically said, I didn't have any problem with Wax and Whiskers.  But I've heard things.  Well, we have a word for that in my body of work.  It's called hearsay.  And hearsay is inadmissible in court in general.  And the reason it is, is because it's unreliable.  And this body should no more listen to allegations based on hearsay than any court of law would.  The reality is, all that was testified to here were some opinions by...  Three people who had a negative experience with Wax and Whiskers.  And a person who had a positive experience.  But expressed having heard rumors about others having had negative experiences.  That is at most opinion.  What we heard in terms of facts came from Dr. Lewis.  And Dr. Lewis says, this operation is in compliance.  And in fact, even Ms. Woodcock acknowledged that there is no law that Wax and Whiskers is...  Violating by virtue...  That's not...  Thank you.  All right, thank you, Doug.  We'll close the public here.  I have one question.  Oh, okay.  Sir.  Sure.  There's one final sentence in the document that was provided.  And I've got it November 1st.  I don't know about November 2.  Is that a new permit application will not be accepted for 12 months.  From the date...  From this date.  Unless the applicant shows that the grounds for the denial no longer exists.  Has your client made any formal written request to the Animal Services Office to take corrective measure on all of the items listed on this report or this conditional?  My apologies, Mr. Bennett.  By that question, are you asking whether or not they've requested for a re-inspection to show...  To show corrective measures?  Oh, to show corrective measures.  Oh, as we indicated...  A time frame to make corrective measures.  And I apologize for interrupting you.  No, no, no.  I appreciate the clarification.  My understanding is literally from today with having just heard as we were at the podium about the sealant having been received by Wax and Whiskers.  And my expectation that it's going to be implemented essentially immediately or as immediately as the holidays will allow.  The concern here is...  The concern specifically...  Specifically here is that Wax and Whiskers is taking immediate steps to get the line items that are in fact valid and that in fact need correction to be corrected so that the property can be re-inspected.  The concern we have is that my understanding given the impending implementation of this rule would require their closure by January 1st.  And if I'm mistaken in that, my apologies.  That's my understanding.  If...  If...  If... And that absent them being able to show, essentially they could not reapply. This is something that was a little bit vague to me, that they could not reapply for 12 months unless the applicant showed the grounds for the denial long exist. So essentially what would happen- Point of order, Mr. Bennett, did he answer your question?  If...  If...  If...  If...  If...  If...  If...  If... Point of order, Mr. Bennett, did he answer your question? He's proceeding, but-  If...  If...  If...  If...  answering your question. Not yet. No. Can I clarify on our letter? It says a new permit  application will not be accepted for 12 months from this date. So the problem was that we  couldn't find anything other than the flooring because we went through every item on this  list. Some of them, the municipal codes that were expressed are not correct for what it  says. So we didn't know what to do other than the flooring. This is our first time. We've  never been written up with a citation for anything in seven years. So this was our first  experience with this. Thank you. Thank you. I think we have another question too. Council  Member Morgan, do you have a question? I have a question. I have a question. I have a question.  I have another question. I have some thoughts. First of all, your logic of three out of 12,000  is completely false logic. This is three people that could find their way here to the council  member chambers tonight. People do this to us all the time. They come and they go, look,  the majority of people in Chico want this, this, this. I'm like, no, it's the majority  of the people in the room. And you know better. You're using a bunch of different fancy words.  I'm using, I'm using evidence. You interrupt me again and you're not going to speak again.  You're condescending. I don't appreciate it. You're calling me condescending. I am.  Okay. So here's my question for staff. I'm assuming that you've been, your immediate  steps to fix a list of specific problems brought on by the staff is to fix the flooring after  two months. I don't buy it, but I'm asking if there is any consideration of staff.  To give some amount of time, a week, two weeks, whatever, on behalf of the animals to see if this  is fixable. And if there's not, I'm, my personal recommendation is to go with the staff's  recommendation. But because of we're dealing with the animals that God knows where they'll end up,  is there any leeway possible to come back after they've glued the floor down or whatever it is  they think is going to fix the... Well, first off, I would say that our,  our report that was generated was sent to the city attorney to be validated. So I'm not quite sure  where they're saying the sections don't apply. Given that there are a multitude of things, I,  I saw on a body camera video that during the inspection that were absolute concerns to me,  and not even being an animal services person, just being a cop in general, and knowing how these,  these are supposed to be fixed. So I'm not quite sure where they're saying the sections don't apply.  But given that there are a multitude of things, I, I saw on a body camera video that during the inspection that  these are supposed to be fixed. So I'm not quite sure where they're saying the sections don't apply.  So I'm a little confused on this discussion on just flooring, how that fixes anything.  It doesn't reduce the amount of animals that are in that small space. It doesn't reduce the amount  of disease that's being transmitted back and forth due to the small spaces and these animals  not having quarantine areas when they're being taken in by the intake process. So to me,  throwing some stuff down on the floor that,  that is an easier way to clean up, you know, after an animal doesn't correct the,  the outlying issue of, or the underlying issue of the overall overcrowding, kindling of animals.  And then the other things that we've had to deal with for years with wags and whiskers,  and that's the nonstop complaints that are coming in based on all these other issues. So  to me, you know, I don't know quite where they're coming from with this, this floor sealant,  how that solves the problem. And so to me, it's a moot point. And giving them two more weeks to fix  the flooring issue doesn't correct everything else.  Okay. So based on the answer I got from the chief, I'll make a motion to deny the appeal.  Okay. We do have another question from .  Well, it wasn't a, it was more to just complete the sentence will not be accepted for 12 months.  Okay.  unless the applicant shows that the grounds for the denial no longer exists.  So those things could have been, which I think goes back to what Mr. Bennett was trying to say,  if you could show right now that the grounds for the denial no longer exist,  then you could keep operating.  So I will second the motion to deny the OEL.  So we can show all, I'm sorry, we could show all those things,  but like I said, some of these are not,  how do we show something that is a wrong audience?  Yeah, we're going to close the public hearing at this point  because your time has expired  and we don't have any further questions for you, I believe, unless Mr. Winslow, you had one.  Yeah, for staff, there's a lot of...  So it's a staff question, you can go ahead.  ...allegations in the letter sent by Animal Service Manager Tracy Moore,  which I wouldn't exactly qualify as,  hearsay.  The question is, because there are so many things that at least border on negligence  and even profiteering here,  the recommendation to the appellant here  is to work with staff to find a new location for the animal shelter.  So I'd like to ask, if they found a viable location,  would you, could they operate as a kennel or an animal shelter?  Yes.  Is there any way that the current facility could be viable  for a different scale of operations as a kennel or animal shelter?  They would have to run it as a...  So let's come up to the microphone so you can actually be heard by the public.  That's not just viewing the chamber.  So go ahead and answer the first question first.  Okay, so to answer your first question,  yes, if they found a suitable place and set it up appropriately,  then...  They could certainly operate a kennel within the city.  And then to answer your second question,  what would they need to do to operate in the current space,  they would actually have to operate as a pet shop.  We have been working with Wags and Whiskers since 2015  to try to get them into compliance.  The planning department expressed concern in 2015  that they were...  When they were building...  When they were building out the space that they're currently using,  that that space did not look like it was a pet shop,  that it looked more like a kennel.  And so this is nothing new.  We have been trying to work with Wags and Whiskers.  They have definitely made some improvements,  but they can certainly control the number of animals  that come into their facility.  They don't have to house as many animals as they have in that space.  So they could limit the number of animals that came in,  but they could limit the number of animals that came in,  They also have use of a kennel facility in Orland.  So they do have some place they could potentially house animals,  not here in Chico.  So there's things they can do,  but they haven't even approached us to ask,  excuse me,  what else they could do to come into compliance.  If we were to deny the appeal,  would they have an opportunity to work with you  in order to make the facility functional on some level  without doing whatever happens,  do whatever they have to do to all the animals that are currently there?  Well, I mean, they're running a kennel,  and the space is not appropriate for a kennel.  So, I mean, we are always,  and we have said from the very beginning  when we first saw them start up,  that we would try to work with them to help them come into compliance.  And it has been somewhat of an uphill battle.  Thank you.  Tracy, one more quick question.  Can you tell me approximately,  you held up a little binder or something earlier that said  these are all verifiable complaints that have come in.  Can you tell me about how many those are?  Well, all together I have complaints,  and there are various complaints.  I've got a total of 71 complaints,  and at least 21 of them are strictly animals  that became gravely ill right after adoption.  Great.  Thank you.  And then the last question is,  I didn't see that this has to cease by January 1st in this.  Is that correct?  And the only thing I'm thinking is we may need to give them a wind-down time  if that's the direction that we're going.  Yes, the permits actually go into effect January 2nd.  So, the idea was that we asked kennels and pet shops  to put their applications in so that we kind of had a grace period  that we could work with them,  between the time the ordinance was passed  and the time that we would start collecting fees  for the kennels and pet shops.  So, that is really the process we're in,  is trying to work with each organization  to make sure they're in compliance.  So, that's kind of where we're at.  Okay.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Ready?  Further discussion?  All right.  Madam Clerk?  Council Member Bennett?  Denied of appeal.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan?  Aye.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 7-0 to deny the appeal and uphold staff's recommendation.  All right.  Thank you very much.  We are going to take a short break at this point in time.  I'm going to recommend.  Thank you.  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike  Council, Bruce Hambo.  Mr. Mayor, I need to recuse myself on the advice of the city attorney on this matter.  Okay.  Give me just a minute to leave the room, and then we'll start from there.  Is that you have to state why, and is that because you have a property in the area?  Okay, thank you.  I'll make that note.  Thank you.  Thank you, Council.  Mayor, these amendments include three groups of three different areas.  The first is called Senate Bill 9.  That's required of communities to be compliant with California housing law, and we have to codify that.  So there are other cities in the state.  So that's one piece that's called SB 9.  That includes two components, one of which is two-unit developments, and the other one's urban lot splits.  I'll discuss those later.  The second component.  The second component is general code cleanup.  These are corrections items for consistency and clarifications.  Those are just annual items that we need to clean up for general zoning code cleanup.  The last item is a private proposal for a code amendment to allow card rooms in the downtown north zone with approval of a use permit.  Thank you.  In terms of background, the Planning Commission recommended approval.  On November 3rd of the code amendments and the SB 9 codification by a vote of 7 to 0, and they were split on these two items, and they recommended to adopt the card room amendments by a vote of 5 to 2.  Some of the Planning Commissioners were concerned that there was inadequate noticing.  There was also some concern that there wasn't enough analysis with the card room amendments.  To address those concerns, we provided supplemental noticing to the property owners within the downtown north zone and the surrounding area of 500 feet.  Then the other thing I'd like to mention is that more detailed site-specific analysis would be forthcoming with every use permit proposal.  So what I'm saying is allowing a card room with approval of a use permit doesn't mean every use permit is going to be approved.  It just means they're allowed to apply for one.  And then when an application is forthcoming, then you can get into the analysis of whether that meets the requirements of the merits for the use permit.  So two unit developments, what it means now is on every R1 lot, and this is applicable in R1 and the RS zone.  So on our single family zones, you're allowed now to have a duplex outright.  So you can do every house.  And now you can add another house.  You're allowed two main units on the house on a single family lot.  These are the new requirements, all of California.  It's prohibited in environmentally sensitive areas, earthquake areas where there's contamination.  You're not allowed to convert affordable housing.  It's a long list of areas where it's prohibited, but it's generally environmentally sensitive areas.  But it's allowed in every single family residence zone in California.  Right now.  The second piece of that is called an urban lot split.  So for every single family residence lot in the R1 zone, now you're allowed to subdivide it in two.  So in theory, and what you're able to do is you're allowed because you're allowed to have a duplex on one or two detached single family residents.  Now you can have another lot created out of your existing single family lot and have two more residences, a duplex or a main residence, etc.  And then you're allowed to subdivide it in two.  So that's the difference in the change in the landscape.  Same prohibitions apply on environmentally sensitive areas and so forth.  So let's put it this way.  If you want to subdivide, if you want to do an R1 urban lot split, and some people have asked us this question where they've got a single family residence and an accessory dwelling.  They want to create another lot where the accessory dwelling unit is.  If you want to do that, you've got to convert that accessory dwelling unit to a main residence because it's accessory to the primary.  So that means if you want to create it and put it on its own lot through an urban lot split, you've got to pay the conversion fees to make it from an accessory building to a main residence, which means pay the development impact fees and also comply with the parking requirements.  Because an accessory unit, if it was small enough to pay any impact fees, it isn't required to provide parking.  Just wanted to mention that because we get a lot of questions about that.  There are no public frontage improvements with an urban lot split.  That's why they're popular.  The minimum lot size is, what we're recommending is as small as 1,200 square feet.  That's the state that allows that.  And if you're going to create a lot, you've got to.  The minimum lot proportion has got to be 40%.  This is very permissive.  We've got to approve one of these as long as they're able to put 800 square feet of a unit of 800 square feet or 1,200 square feet.  It's not that big bunch of an area to create a whole lot on literally.  And then I would like to mention that owner occupancy is required.  If you do an urban lot split, that means the property owner must sign a statement indicating that the owner intends to occupy.  One of the units is their principal residence for a minimum of three years from the time that they record that urban lot split.  The whole idea here is to create missing middle housing.  So in a given block now, we're used to have just single family residences.  Now you'll have duplexes.  And on a lot, you could have instead of one house, you could have four now.  So that's the whole idea is to create more of this missing middle housing.  The general code cleanup just includes some definitions.  These are the title areas where we've had to go in and fix things.  There's not a lot of a lot of that's just clarifications and consistencies and things that we had to fix.  The code amendment was submitted.  It was a privately initiated request that was originally came before the council in September 2020.  Council record referred this to the Internal Affairs Committee in June.  Of 2021, the Internal Affairs Committee heard the proposal for card rooms and then referred that back to the city to the full city council.  And on January of 2022, council heard the Internal Affairs Committee report out and recommended to the applicant that they proceed through the amendment process.  And then most recently, on November 3rd, 2022, the applicant submitted their request and was recommended for approval.  The planning commission by a vote of five to two.  So.  Our recommendation is to hold the public hearing.  Find that all these applications are consistent with the California Environmental Quality Act and then introduce the amendment by reading the title only.  That concludes my presentation.  If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.  Questions.  No.  Okay.  Ms. Winner.  Regarding the urban lot split, Chico doesn't allow lots to be facing an alley.  You have to have street front into Main Street, right?  You can't have an address on an alley?  I think, no.  We're going to have to allow them now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  So, currently there are no alley addresses, but now people will be able to set.  Well, they're going to have to have access to a street.  Mm-hmm.  If they have access to a street, they're going to have to have access to a street.  And that's going to be something we'll refer to public works, but.  So, I would say there are currently addresses off of alleys, but there's been no proliferation  of those.  No, as you mentioned, we're not allowing, but under this new state mandated requirement,  yeah, there will be instances where if they make that split, that they will have to be  able to take an address off of an alley.  Okay.  I was going to say we have some.  Yeah.  We have a lot of ADUs like that now.  Yeah.  I live in one.  I think they're supposed to have access to the street and they don't.  It's supposed to be a gate there.  But now you actually would have Hobart alley would be the address where that unit is located.  Currently their mail comes in the front, so they have to walk around to get it.  Well, they'd be creating a separate lot, and so we're going to make sure that they have  adequate access.  So, we'll look at that.  We'll go through that process, but that's the difference is that they're creating a  whole new, that other lot would be transferable.  Thank you.  All right.  Vice-chairman.  So, I can fill in my pool and I can subdivide my lot and I can put three units on it, but  I don't have to worry at all about where everybody's going to park.  And my neighbors are going to love me.  You're required to have through, you're required to have one parking space for the duplex conversion.  Okay.  And let me, so all you're allowed to have, if you have one lot now, you're allowed to  have two.  And if you do an urban lot split, you're allowed to have two more.  So, a total of four on what was normally one lot before.  Good Lord.  Okay.  Thanks, State of California.  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At this point, if we have any ex parte communications, and then I have a clarification for Steve.  Do we have any ex parte communications?  I have met with Mr. Chairman.  I have met with Mr. Scott to discuss the card room.  He explained the concept and I listened to him.  All right.  Anyone else?  I've talked to Mr. Scott in the past too.  Not about downtown, but in previous, when we were doing, talking about internal affairs.  We have talked in the past.  All right.  I had multiple meetings with Mr. Scott and I didn't listen to anything he said.  I had meetings with Mr. Scott in my previous term on council, but not on this particular location.  Okay.  Same with me too.  In the past I had discussion with him about the card room.  Nothing recent, but like a couple years ago.  A couple years ago.  Okay.  A couple of years ago she had discussions.  None?  All right.  Okay.  So, in terms of this, and Council Member Arunabhai begs...  Disqualification.  Disqualification.  Disqualification is it is it on both of the issues are we taking them separately or should we take them as one? What's your recommendation? I?  Would probably have to have Vince weigh in on that  If his  Thank you, and  Mr. Mr.  Union do you believe that mr. Van over rec could could vote on one but not the other because the card room is relatively  They close to a property that he owns but the other is obviously  in terms of accessory to owning units and lot of sweats  So  Take each item separately and my conversation with council member  Or be pertain to the 500 foot rule in proximity  The building that he has an ownership interest in with respect to an item that is coming before him  to make a  decision  my conversation  Was along the lines of while there there's not a direct financial benefit to council member van over big  When the abundance of caution it was my recommendation that to avoid the appearance of impropriety that he recused himself  Did not have a direct  financial benefit if he votes on a particular item and it results and it passes and  That that's not the concern here the the concern was  The fact that the council member is not the one who is responsible for the ! !  The  The It's if someone brings to the attention ! and advise council members to avoid any question about whether or not they have a conflict of interest and avoid the appearance of impropriety. Okay, but do you think he needs to be absent on both of the votes or just one?  now listening. Right. I'm just  concerned because the Planning Commission took it into motion.  Pardon me? The Planning Commission took it into separate votes.  But it's one ordinance. It is. You're either passing the ordinance or you're not  passing the ordinance. Right, that's what's before you.  Okay, that makes sense.  Alright, so we'll open the public hearing and  the applicant gets 15 minutes.  Okay, and that would be, well, actually  is it John Scott that is the applicant in one part of it?  So John Scott is first, so you want me to give him 15 minutes?  Well, that's what our public hearing policy  states. Right, right.  Yeah, and because it's all consolidated, I didn't know how  we would proceed with this.  So, Mr. Ewing, what's your  thought on this, or Mr. V?  I can't imagine Mr. Scott will need 15 minutes.  And that was actually for an appeal  and this isn't an appeal.  This is actually a zoning and subdivision amendment  that includes a card room use permit.  Since there's three items, would he get a third of 15 minutes?  Mr. Ewing, what do you suggest in terms of handling this  for the applicant?  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  Mr. Mayor, it's within the discretion of the chair,  which is you, is the mayor.  So you'll have to make the call.  Considering that there's one, I believe there's one applicant,  seriously one speaker, I defer to the mayor  to make the discretionary decision as to how much time  you want to allow this particular applicant  if he wants to speak at all.  All right.  I'm assuming you want to say something, Mr. Scott.  I want to say something.  Okay, let's have you come forward and say something.  Okay.  And we'd prefer it to be five minutes,  but we'll give you the benefit of 15 if you want.  City staff, chair, all right.  Thank you.  and thank you to the chief, council.  Most of you know me and I know most of you.  My name's John Scott and I've lived in Chico since 1978.  I came here with not very much money and a whole lot of hair  and things have kind of switched around a little bit  where I've really done well in Chico.  I've done okay economically, but more importantly,  I met my wife here, I've had my children here  and nothing has changed.  I think it'd be better than that.  This is no better place to have a family than this community  and I'm really thrilled about that.  This has been a project of mine really for about 35 years.  Although in the most recent version,  the last seven or eight years.  Downtown Chico to me is a special gem  and we're going through a lot of changes right now.  And those changes are primarily because of the world.  We buy most of our goods these days on the internet,  not at retail stores anymore.  And we're seeing the results of that in downtown.  7-Eleven, gone.  I just heard today that Jamba Juice downtown, gone.  Our most important corners in downtown Chico,  most of them are boarded up.  And I think that needs to change.  It's often been said, I've heard it,  I may not be able to put it out right,  but it's the old busted windows thing.  If you go through a neighborhood  and there's a busted window pretty soon,  you end up with a lot more.  And so from my standpoint,  anything that we can do to do the opposite of that,  to have money and development and jobs and people  coming downtown is going to be a benefit.  And my particular business, the card room,  scares people that aren't familiar with car grips.  So, you know, for years I've had to deal with conversations  with people that aren't familiar with it, and they're frightened.  I've had my current club open inside of Quacker's  for about four and a half years now.  And we have operated, I believe, exemplary.  We have a lot of employees, and these are really good jobs.  The best part about these jobs is I'm able to pay them, you know,  a reasonable wage, but they make a ton off of tips.  In fact, oftentimes I wish that I didn't own the place,  that I worked at it instead.  In a downtown environment, I know that I can triple the amount of jobs.  And money, when it comes into an area,  tends to circulate several times around.  I'm not an economist,  but I've seen a lot of people who have been in the business  and I've heard that if a dollar is spent in town,  that, you know, eventually it can be $5  because the dollar comes here, then somebody buys a hamburger  and they take those wages and they buy a taco.  In short, I think I can be a significant benefactor  and contributor to downtown Chico.  And I look forward to have an opportunity to show that  to the city that I'm in love with.  So I don't have a whole lot more to say to that.  I mean, I could go on for hours and hours and hours,  but I'd probably bore you.  But I do make myself available tonight for any questions  that anybody might have, and I'll do my best to answer them  in a way that is descriptive and informational.  And I'll leave it at that at this point.  Four minutes, look at that.  Thank you.  All right.  Any questions?  I have a quick question for you.  Sure.  Can you tell me in your current location  how many times the police have been to your building  and how many problems you've had?  Well, we'd probably have to ask the chief of precise numbers,  but I can tell you from the card room standpoint,  I don't believe we've ever had a direct problem.  Now, there is a bar.  I don't own the bar.  I just have the card room inside the Quackers restaurant and bar.  But I've seen the police four, five, six, seven times  over the last four years.  You know, for example, a couple of weeks ago,  somebody quite brazenly during the day smashed a truck window,  grabbed a person, ran away.  The police were very fast to respond.  And the benefit of our particular business is the state requires us  to have cameras pretty much every square inch times two.  And so we were able to instantly provide our local law enforcement  photographs of the culprit.  And it wasn't long.  I think an hour or two later, we were able to actually ascertain  who this culprit was with the benefit of Facebook  and a few other things.  So, yes, do the police come?  Well, they come to that location.  Do they come because there's problems in the card room?  I'm not aware that there's ever been a single problem.  You know, occasionally people walk out and they're pretty excited  if they've won some money.  And once in a while, they walk out with a couple of F-bombs.  You can do that here.  Yeah.  This is similar.  Thank you.  That was for the benefit of the public because I know it is scary.  It's different.  It's something that we haven't had downtown before.  So I just wanted to...  I think we'd actually be beneficial in terms of law enforcement  because, I mean, other than the fact that personally having a well-policed  community is important to me and my family.  We have lots of cameras and we want to be able to get people misbehaving  out of our building, out of the building, out of the building, out of the building.  We want to be able to get people out of the area.  And so, you know, if the police come to us and they...  Whether it's our building or any building up and down the street,  our cameras are wide open to law enforcement anytime  because if it benefits the community, it benefits me and it benefits my family.  Yeah.  Thank you very much, Mr.  I'm not going to ask you to make any comments on behalf of someone else,  but I'm sure you have discussed this concept with...  DCBA?  Okay.  The DCBA...  And I spoke to David Halimi today.  Okay.  And he said that the DCBA was taking no position at all,  neither for or against the project.  So...  And he called me four or five hours ago to inform me of that.  And that's how I found out that Jamba Juice was leaving.  All right.  Any other questions?  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  So...  Our last speaker is Will Brady.  How much time would you like?  Three minutes?  Three minutes.  Okay.  Hello.  I was here to speak on something else,  but I thought I'd throw in my two cents.  I'll make it quick because earlier items seemed to have taken a little bit longer  than we thought they would.  I would say, considering the spate of closings that we've been experiencing in downtown  due to, you know, economic circumstances,  we've lost four restaurants in three months.  I just heard about Jamba Juice.  That makes five.  I would do...  I would support Mr. Scott's application  and anything that brings tenants to downtown  and a...  I guess a willingness to adapt code to present circumstances  rather than past.  I think we need to look...  look at all sorts of things that we've said we shouldn't do  and maybe take some fresh eyes on them.  And that's all.  Thank you.  All right.  Mr. Scott, any desire to rebut Mr. Brady?  No.  All right.  Okay.  So we will close the public hearing  and then council discussion and entertain a motion.  You do, in fact, have to read the whole thing.  Just the ordinance title.  I'll make...  Just the title.  I just want to make sure I'm not speaking over anybody.  Go ahead.  Make a motion.  Approving ordinance of the City of Chico City Council  and Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code  to codify Senate Bill 9,  clean up provisions of the zoning code  and to allow carbon use with approval of use permit  in the downtown north zone attachment A.  Second.  All right.  We have a motion on second.  I would like to make a comment.  So Mr. Scott came before this body before in my previous term.  I voted no.  On this particular issue.  I wasn't crazy about the location.  This one is a little different.  I think the location makes a lot more sense.  I think it utilizes a building that needs to be utilized.  So I'll probably be voting in favor.  But with that, any other comments from council?  All right.  Madam Clerk?  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck?  Yes.  Is disqualified on this one?  Council Member Winslow?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  I'm going to say yes with the caveat of I would love to only vote yes on the card room,  but unfortunately I don't have that option.  Okay.  Mayor Coolidge?  I would second that option, but aye.  Okay.  And it carries 6-0 with one recusal.  All right.  Okay.  So now moving on to our regular agenda.  We have Mr. Van Overbeck back.  He's the chair of the board.  He's here.  Mr. Van Overbeck?  He's here.  There.  Aye.  Nope.  I think he went out to get you.  We'll send the search card.  Okay.  All right.  Item 5.1, consideration of grant of license for Chico Military Heroes Banner.  Mr. Cufferson, welcome.  Thank you.  He's not around.  Yeah.  Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council members.  Pleasure to speak to you tonight.  At the October 20th, 2015 meeting, City Council approved Resolution 60-15 granting Chico Military  Heroes a grant of license to display banners along East Avenue from Highway 32 to Wildwood  Avenue.  The banners displayed were 30 inches by 60 inches, displayed on city street light poles,  and honored current active duty members.  military personnel from Chico. Chico Military Heroes is a non-profit organization, met all the  conditions of the previous grant of license, and there were no issues during the multiple years  the banners were displayed. Due to previous grant of license expiration, Chico Military Heroes is  requesting a renewed grant of license with a term of 10 years. A license under APMP 11-15 provides  a method and procedure for processing this type of right-of-way encroachment request through a  grant of license. It's the best conduit and method that we have found thus far. Regulates the  encroachment by placing a term limit, ensuring recommended conditions are met, and confirming  city insurance and liability requirements are secured. All conditions are included in the staff  report and attached resolution. A copy of the resolution and location plat is attached as  attachment C in the staff report as well. That concludes my report. I recommend city council  adopt the resolution authorized.  Thank you.  And so I think if there's anybody that wants to do something positive and acknowledging our  veterans, we should support that and certainly not get in their way. Thank you very much.  Thank you. Chris Nelson.  Yeah, my father was a veteran, too, in World War II. But I'm here to speak more about this.  My husband was a Vietnam vet. His name was Michael Pike.  He stood before this city council in 2014, a month before he died from an ancient orange cancer at the age of 67.  He wanted to argue against these recruitment posters and to, excuse me, and to remind council that an economic draft of kids at our high schools did not make them heroes.  This charade has played out now for about a decade.  A decade.  A decade in which the United States lost wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, as well as failed campaigns in Somalia, Libya, and Yemen.  38 million people have been displaced by war since 9-11.  38 million people.  Poverty, hunger, disease, and homelessness plague our own country because of misplaced priorities.  While Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and Arthur Grumman  have said that we are not alone in this war.  We have seen obscene profits.  Sacrificing the vulnerable children of Chico, California to the military does a disservice to our capacity to plan for and celebrate a civilian future that isn't desperate or dystopian.  Putting up these banners is cruel and heartless and also undermines the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the conventions of the rights of the child,  which prohibits child recruitment for the age of 18.  I urge you to deny any further pro-war jingoism to get these banners down.  Don't make this a popularity contest.  Don't exploit these people's images.  Let young people make decisions about their futures without pro-war prejudice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  She's our last speaker.  All right.  Council discussion.  Move to approve.  Second.  Motion from Council.  Council Member Morgan, second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Any discussion?  I would like to discuss.  Maybe I'm alone up here thinking that, but I want everybody to get home safe, and I want the world to be a more peaceful place.  And I don't think that displaying banners celebrating the military advances either of those goals.  When I saw these banners show up, I wasn't privy to the discussions going on in the Council,  and I did assume that they were all valid.  But I think it's a matter of time before we get to the point where we can get these banners down.  And I think that, for one, I appreciate that there is within this policy that we allow property owners  who do not like the banners to issue, like, a protest, and they'll take down those banners.  But that's a flawed method, because East Avenue, this is, like, four miles of East Avenue, something like that.  It's used probably by 10,000 people.  It's used by thousands of people who don't own property along East Avenue.  It's primarily commercial thoroughfare with a lot of schools on it.  So most of the people who are going to see this regularly in their daily lives don't have any opportunity to have any input  in what this looks like or the fact that we have these or not anyway.  I think we should at least have, like, be in the ballpark of consensus to make sweeping aesthetic decisions  on our public property.  I don't feel like this is something that has consensus in the community,  and I think the previous discussions showed that.  And there's a, like, I respect veterans, and I respect the respect for veterans  in the work that the group has brought this forward does.  There's a lot of people that should be celebrated.  The kids should be looking at from the back of their parents' SUVs when they're on the way to school.  And we support public art for the purpose of expressing our shared history and values.  We've been honoring the legacy of indigenous people in this area with murals.  I think, in my opinion, by far the most elegant, pleasant statue in the city of Chico  is the statue of the Union soldier in the back of the cemetery.  But this isn't exactly an art project.  Point of order.  Can we stay on the subject?  So I'm referring to the issue of having banners along East Avenue.  It's not exactly an art project.  I don't know if anybody disagrees.  However, it is something that people have to see all the time.  It is something that we are allowing our public right of way to be used to display for ten years here.  We have an arts commission that looks at these sort of things.  We have volunteers who are, like, ready to make calls about that,  and I think it would be more appropriate before just giving full licenses to this organization  to put up these banners for ten years that we allow the arts commission to have input in it.  Thoughts?  That could be a substitute motion.  With your permission, Mr. Mayor.  Go ahead, Mr. Mayor.  So I was part of the Internal Affairs Committee for the two very long years that this was debated.  And then, thank God, I got on to finance, which is far more exciting.  And there was a lot of public debate about this.  Do they go up? Do they not go up?  What does it mean?  Some of the stuff is ridiculous.  So people are going to be looking up at that and crash their, as you said, taking their,  their kid to school in the SUV, whatever.  The agenda item before us has nothing to do with the arts commission,  and this doesn't have anything to do with art.  And as a matter of what the public thinks about having the banners up or not having the banners up,  the public has spoken.  They're the people that put the people on the dais.  And I appreciate every single one of your comments, Councilmember Winslow,  and the very fact that you could make them.  It's because people volunteered to fight for this country.  And if they're willing to go do it, I have two sons that are not in the military.  I'm not a veteran.  I was born on Veterans Day.  I don't know if that counts.  Probably not.  I come from military families.  I've been terrified if my sons had gone into the military.  But had they done it, I would have been super proud of them,  and I would have wanted nothing more than to see one of their banners hanging above their city that they love,  that they were willing to fight to defend.  And one thing we need to do is uphold the institutions of the military,  the institutions and the ideals that made this country what it is,  and why people will go do that,  which is why I made that motion, and I'll support it.  Thank you, Councillor Morgan.  Appreciate your thoughts.  I have a couple questions before we take roll.  Mr. Kepson, just for clarification.  So this is for active military only, correct?  Correct.  All right.  And then the area is, I know it's over by 565, because I've seen them,  but about how much area does it take up?  My guess is a couple hundred yards.  Oh, it's the stretch, approve the stretch of East Avenue from Highway 32 all the way to Wildwood.  So it would be the entire stretch of East Avenue outside of Caltrans right away that's adjacent to State Route 99.  But I mean how much area do we actually need to do to have the banners currently?  Well, it depends on how many active duty military personnel  and the pursuit of either family or friends that request those banners to Chico Military Heroes.  So we gave them the whole, the right of way on the streetlights for East Avenue.  I think previously they didn't take up the whole route.  I think maybe...  No, that's what I'm trying to get at.  Gotcha. Okay.  How much did it in the past take up?  My guess would be a couple hundred yards.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So that's fair on both sides.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, all right.  Did we have anything further?  I'll offer a substitute motion that we submit the matter to the Arts Commission for feedback.  All right.  Do we have a second?  And motion dies for lack of a second.  I'm clear to take the roll on the first motion, please.  Okay.  I need to get back there.  Mr. Mayor, don't we need a second on the first motion?  We do.  Oh, it was seconded.  I'm sorry.  Let me just get back there.  It was a motion by Councilmember Morgan, seconded by Vice Mayor Reynolds,  to adopt resolution.  I am sure this resolution that will authorize this program.  And let's see, I am trying to see.  The vote, Councilmember Bennet?  Yes.  Councilmember Morgan?  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon?  Yes.  Councilmember Van Overbeke?  Yes.  Councilmember Winslow?  Nope.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  Moving on our next item, Item 5.3, Internal Affairs, and please note that Item 5.2  was handled to Brigadier Mike Sherman.  of this meeting with the confirmation of the chief police item 5.3 internal affairs 11722  recommendation related to parklets and we will turn this over to chair vice mayor casey miles  thank you um so iac met and we voted 3-0 that we direct staff to analyze the downtown  parking needs and we made a recommendation to possibly expand that program and bring it back  however there's been um five reiterations and 27 different conversations that have happened  since our internal affairs meeting including um talking to directly with businesses trying to do  a grant of license i'm trying to ensure that we're being sensitive to the needs of the businesses but  also looking at the greater good and wanting things to look better downtown and everything  else so i'm going to turn it over to leanne to kind of tell you where what has happened since  iac and then we'll gladly answer any questions at the end of her presentation  that's !  i can assist with  thank you good evening mayor vice mayor and council members can you hear me okay  because you cannot i'll turn it up keep going so i have a soft voice so i'll have to lean into the  microphone um so i just wanted to kind of give every get everybody up to speed on exactly where  we are with the parklets the temporary parklets that we've had um downtown during covid19 which  are barricaded with k rails construction k rails  um and so this map has been updated to show that we have we currently have three temporary parklets  on the streets downtown right now and i'll be talking a little bit more about those three but  others have been removed already um and so um the the temporary parklets the the thought during  covid was that we would um and that this was approved $300,000 was pulled out of the arpa  funding american rescue plan funding $300,000 $300,000 $300,000 $300,000 $300,000 $300,000 $300,000  to improve upon the temporary parklets  that were in downtown.  But as me and my consultant found out,  as we drilled down into the costs of this,  that it was way more expensive than the 300,000  that we had budgeted.  So we still have the 285,000 remaining  in the ARPA funding to use for whatever purpose  council wants to use it for.  And we have stopped any activity on that aspect of things.  And I'll tell you, I'll talk a little bit more about  that in a minute.  But just to get you up to speed on some of the internal  affairs and council actions that happened.  After we found out that we couldn't do,  we couldn't update the parklets for the 300,000  that was budgeted, we sought direction from internal affairs  on 9-12, September 12th.  And we also came to council on October 4th,  where the emergency orders were lifted  and the temporary parklets were extended to December 1st.  And then on October 18th,  council voted based on some input they received  from DCBA and others that the parklets were unattractive  and that they needed, and they were taking up parking spaces  and they needed to be removed by December 1st.  So we have removed about half of them  and there are three still left on the streets in downtown.  So, and the council also voted on October 18th  to send the topic of discussion of extending a temporary,  like a permanent temporary parklet  to the program downtown to internal affairs.  So I'll give you an update on that.  At internal affairs, I mentioned some considerations  that we would want to think about if we were going  to expand the outdoor cafe program to include temporary  or to include parklets, permanent parklets.  So, and some of these considerations included  that back in 2019, our parking demand was 85%.  We don't know exactly where that is now,  but if we start giving up parking spaces, we want to,  just kind of make sure that we're not getting  into a situation where we're at a hundred percent  parking demand.  And then the 2019 downtown action access plan recommended  that limits be placed on outdoor cafes.  And that was based on the consultant's recommendation  and feedback from the community.  Also, I recommended at internal affairs that we're putting  in a new automated license plate reader system  and that we use that.  So we can use that system to capture data  for the next three to six months and figure out exactly  where we are post COVID in terms of parking demand.  And then I also recommended that we hire a consultant  or work in house to develop what the future parking demand  would be in downtown and when we would need, for example,  a parking structure project before we start giving up  a lot of spaces for parklets.  And then I also mentioned that with the sewer rate study  that's happening right now and the potential for a new  revenue stream of up to $6 million per year  for pipeline replacements,  a portion of that money is going to be for paving  and it's going to be for downtown because a lot of the  pipelines in downtown are installed in 1908.  So we're going to have to be developing a downtown program  to replace pipelines and update the right way for the  public to ride away in downtown.  And then I also mentioned that munico 14.70 is available  for the businesses to build outdoor cafes  and sidewalk cafes, which are on the sidewalk next  to their building, which public works feels  is a better, safer location for outdoor dining.  And then I also mentioned that if any of the businesses  wanted to submit a parklets project using parking spaces,  that they could use the grant of license process,  but this doesn't mean that this doesn't mean that this doesn't  which we have a template agreement for that.  And so after, and let me back up.  So internal affairs made the recommendation,  followed my recommendations and made the recommendation to expand the  outdoor cafe program to include parklets and authorize the use of the ARPA  funding for the parking study.  But I actually, just to clarify,  I don't need that funding for the parking study.  We would do the parking study anyway, using the parking revenue.  So that funding is available for whatever purpose you want to use it for.  And that falls in line with the ARPA funding.  And then internal affairs also recommended that we approve the use of a  modified grant of license process to allow the current businesses that wish  to apply for a permanent parklets to continue to operate them.  And then as I was,  as council member,  rental stated,  this has kind of evolved since the internal affairs meeting.  I'm sorry,  can you go back and slide for a second?  Yes.  On November 7th,  internal affairs directed staff to analyze downtown parking needs.  They recommend they provided that they voted on that recommendation to bring  to here to council.  That's an important point.  Yeah.  And that was because we were talking about data from 2019.  Internal affairs was directing staff and I want to make sure that.  Wasn't happening.  No, they were provided.  That's part of the recommendation.  Okay.  And so this has evolved.  As I was talking to the businesses,  I found out that temporary parklets,  which are disconnected from the frontage of the building are not necessarily  the preferred option for the businesses because of operational concerns,  issues,  and ABC licensing complexities.  And so then I started talking with them about,  you know,  using,  you know,  our outdoor cafe program.  And I,  what I found out is that these three businesses that are,  that still have temporary parklets on the streets have not been able to use the  outdoor cafe program for a couple of reasons.  One is two of them are on a street with diagonal parking and the code doesn't  allow them to convert diagonal parking spaces to widen sidewalk for outdoor  cafes.  And also one of them is restricted because of the way they operate alcohol  only and no food.  And so,  our code is stricter than the ABC requirements and it requires pretty much a  restaurant operation where you have servers and you pay the bill after you eat and you can have alcohol as a side item with your food,  but you can't operate with,  you know,  you can't go in and order a beer and go out to an outdoor cafe or you can't go into a restaurant and get a meal with a,  with a beer and walk out to an outdoor cafe because our current muni code restricts that use.  And so,  and also there's a very,  very large financial barrier with the outdoor cafe program.  It's very expensive to widen the sidewalks.  And so,  thinking about all this and knowing we're going to have to work on a,  on a downtown pipeline program and updating the streets and,  you know,  um,  the general plan requiring complete streets,  we need to add bicycle lanes.  The thought is that we,  we have 1.2 million of our funding set aside right now for widening sidewalks.  And when I went,  went back and pulled the staff report from that,  which happened before I got here,  by the way.  So I didn't really know this was sitting there until a few weeks ago when I was looking into it.  Um,  the quote in the staff report,  the purpose for this funding was widen the downtown sidewalks to allow for more outdoor dining and outdoor retail spaces.  So I thought,  okay,  well,  we could use this funding to widen the sidewalk on second between main and Broadway,  either a portion of it or all of it.  And the cost would be a hundred,  $380,000 to 320,000 for that.  And we could widen the sidewalk on the east side of Maine from fourth to third.  And,  um,  that would allow up to,  if we did both of those locations,  um,  that would cost us somewhere between 300 and what,  $650,000.  And it would add,  it would allow 14 more businesses to have outdoor space that don't have it now.  And so in the world of COVID,  um,  the three businesses and others that I talked to,  um,  definitely shared their concerns of going back to an all indoor operation,  because,  you know,  they were concerned that that would affect their,  their business.  Um,  cause some people want to sit outside for their health,  um,  in this world that we live in with COVID now.  And one final consideration,  um,  tonight is the Muni code.  And,  and I already mentioned this is the Muni code currently,  um,  only allows,  um,  businesses to use outdoor,  outdoor cafes if they have servers and it's a restaurant style operation where  you're eating food and then you can order a drink on the side and you have to  be sitting down and it's very strict.  It's like three or four sentences long.  So if we were going to widen the sidewalk on main street,  Duffy's is there and we would need to update the Muni code in order to allow  Duffy's to operate an outdoor cafe with alcohol only sit down alcohol only.  So with all of that,  um,  given you a lot to think about,  but some of the direction I was wanting to get or hoping to get is,  um,  obviously this is the first one's a no brainer.  We would do that anyway in engineering.  We don't need council direction,  but analyze downtown parking needs and update the parking study,  which we're going to do use of remaining ARPA funding for temporary parklets of  285,000.  What I've heard,  um,  uh,  request to use that for trash cans and different things downtown.  We don't really have a use for that.  And in engineering,  if we're not going to do the temporary parklets,  um,  and then use of the remaining ARPA funding for widening sidewalks of 1.2  million,  are you in support of widening the sidewalks on second name?  And that would include the Banshee naked lounge Duffy's and other businesses.  Um,  and do we want to update the Muni code to allow alcohol consumption without  food and without servers in outdoor cafes that is allowed by the ABC and we  would just have to make it perfectly clear.  In the Muni code that any change in operations of outdoor cafes would have to  be ABC would have to meet ABC requirements.  And then last question is,  do we want to uphold our,  our,  your previous decision on December 1st to remove the parklets or do we want to  allow the temporary parklets for Banshee naked lounge and Duffy's to stay while  we're figuring out what we're going to do,  widen their sidewalks or,  have them apply and widen their own sidewalks.  And that concludes my presentation.  Okay.  You mentioned the garbage cans.  What go,  go back to that point in this slide.  Like where am I saying that I didn't put anything in there about that.  I was just recommending that I was,  I was just saying that,  um,  as I was talking to people in downtown,  they were asking that I had,  they had mentioned that use of the 285,000,  why does that have to be used for a parking study?  Can we use it for trash cans?  And so I was just bringing that to your attention and I just was letting you know that we  already allocated funds for garbage cans in the downtown.  Okay.  Correct.  She goes previous.  Yeah.  Through this fiscal year budget,  we have 50,  55,000 for a renewing downtown trash cans.  I think the conversation in,  in,  uh,  internal affairs was something for the greater good as example.  I got it.  So it was something for the greater good downtown.  All right.  Uh,  questions.  Yeah.  Um,  was there,  was there a proposal initially to use that 285,000 of ARP funding for the parking study?  That that's not what's currently being proposed.  Um,  how that came about was from internal affairs.  The recommendation that came back to council was to use the 285,000 for a parking study.  But I'm just clarifying,  we don't need to use the term.  Mm-hmm.  And the 85 for parking study.  We have other funding that we can use for the parking study.  But all the revenue from the parking meters is fixed for parking,  right?  It's an enterprise fund and it will,  and that will fund the parking study anyway.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Thank you.  All right.  Um,  Ms.  Sutton,  uh,  how many spaces are parking spaces are being occupied by the temporary parklets currently?  13.  The,  the three that are left about 13.  Right.  And,  and do you know how many parking meters there are in downtown Chico?  No.  1300.  So in order for us to do something,  uh,  and by the way,  2019 action plan said that we should have less than 25% of the parking occupied by outdoor cafes.  And that's way too much 20 less than 25,  but we're not,  we're not talking about seriously impacting parking at this point.  No.  Okay.  Okay.  All right,  Mr.  Bennett,  you had a question.  So I just to,  um,  two items in the conceptual material cost analysis,  the area referred to is 5,374 square feet.  Is that those parklets cannot be 5,374 square feet each.  So what is that referring to?  No,  the 5,374 was all of them that were installed downtown.  Okay.  And then going over,  over to the material costs of 9,900,000.  900,000.  That's for three.  Where's that?  No, that was for the whole 5,374 square feet.  So at the time we were looking at this,  we were looking at replacing all of the existing parklets that were in place.  Mom's bare garden.  That was seven.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So those are old figures that don't exist.  Okay.  Thank you.  That's what it was confusing.  Sorry.  I was thinking, is each one is going to cost that much?  And it would be impossible.  So thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Further questions from council?  So I have a question for you.  Can you stop?  Sorry.  Mr. Mayor, how do you want to attack this?  We have to take public comment first.  I still ask the question.  I think in sections.  So, I mean, obviously, that would be dependent upon what motion.  I think the code question needs to come separately.  Okay.  Obviously.  Thanks.  So, but we can have, Madam Clerk, we can have two motions within a single item, correct?  Yes, absolutely.  So why don't we go to public comment and go from there?  Okay.  We have two speakers, Will Brady followed by Doug Roberts.  All right.  Hello, again.  I think it follows on the theme that I started earlier.  This is all kind of a holistic approach to downtown that we need to start being more flexible with our codes  in as much that the people who talk about it the most, we should maybe.  I've been talking to staff and I've been able to glean some knowledge from them that, you know, just through this,  it seems that we have $285,000 that's left over.  We're.  Obviously not going to use that, I don't think, to improve three places.  We don't want any part of it.  Personally, we want the downtown to have better things such as trash cans, better lighting.  As long as that stuff that we were promised and it all went through a thing, the $300,000 that was going to do this job that it could have never achieved anyway.  If that could go back and stay in the downtown to focus all of that money that was promised to stay in the downtown to beautify it, that would be great.  I think that's very important for us as businesses.  We don't want to get anything for free.  We want to make sure that we pay for any if we do keep some while the streets are being widened.  I would note that Second Street, which includes us and Naked Lounge, does not have a sewer on it.  So the widening of the sidewalks would not require going back and retrofitting the sewer runs for they run on, I believe, Broadway in Maine.  So this is the 1908 pipes don't necessarily apply.  They do apply inside of my building.  So this might be 1880.  But yeah, that's most of all of my buildings, I'm afraid.  I think it's important to see the remaining sidewalk widening.  I think just generally speaking, I'd like to see the ability to be flexible within the within our.  Decision making to allow us to talk to them.  I didn't see that.  Okay, just started.  It's fine.  Well ahead of time.  I'd like to be able to sit down with staff, you know, through them, speak to you guys and kind of do something for the betterment of downtown.  And I think that if $6 million per year, I think it was for putting in the sewers.  I think that that will run in line with what we do for the widening of sidewalks that don't impact.  The sewer replacement.  So I think that'd be a good use of funds.  And I think it's also probably good to note that this has been incredibly popular with our clients as generate a lot of revenue for the city.  And with the additional 1% tax revenue, I believe we can outpace any revenue that in addition to the 600 or $700 per space that we may end up taking.  We can outpace any meter amounts of money that we're going to be spending.  And we can also take the tax revenue that we were previously made.  And we have numbers to back that up.  But thank you very much.  All right.  Doug Roberts is our last speaker.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Reynolds, and City Council.  My name is Doug Roberts.  I own Duffy's Tavern across the street.  And, you know, we've gone through this for quite a while, going back and forth with the parklets.  And I was really happy to spend a little bit of time with Leanne and dip into looking at the permit process for the outdoor cafe.  It's there's a bit to it.  And it is pretty spendy.  But in the end, it's probably the best way to end it.  It's the best way to go.  Right now, getting back to the how many parking spaces we're using, we had we're using four currently.  We would lose two.  Like, I'd get rid of this one across the street, like, this week.  We can get that one out of here and focus on the front, which is two parking spaces.  And if we were to do the outdoor cafe, we would, you know, reroute the sidewalk around the front of the building.  And the sidewalk is going to be the front of the building.  And the sidewalk in front of the building would become our seating area.  It's not that big of a space.  It measures 12 by 20.  So it's like 240 square feet.  It's not that big.  But even so, jackhammering up the sidewalk exposes gas lines, water lines, drainage lines.  It's probably I don't know that it's within our budget.  And so I would love to see any help we could get from the city.  In terms of the getting funding for the infrastructure with the sidewalk, the bulb going out.  And potentially, you know, once we get in there, once the engineers look at it, there's the problem also of the drainage with the storm drain.  Hopefully we don't have to reengineer it because that means digging up the street.  And that's a whole other, you know, a lot of money.  But what I would also really love is, you know, if we could get the infrastructure, you know, to be able to get the water out of the street.  And I would also really love is if we could, you know, as we're moving forward with the outdoor cafe, if we could potentially keep our outdoor parklet until we complete the outdoor cafe.  And I would say if we were able to do that, we would certainly clean it up and fix it and make it look nice as, you know, a lot of the drawings that were presented to us.  We haven't done anything because we don't really know what the future holds.  But I would say, you know, we're going to have to see what the future of it is yet.  You know, I don't know if they're going to yank it tomorrow or next week or, you know, so we're just kind of waiting.  I apologize that it's been so ugly for so long.  Anyway, thanks for your time.  Mr. Roberts?  Yes, sir.  So obviously the change in code would help you.  I know you've had, you and I have had some discussions about possibly the pizza place next door joining you in a food operation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So in terms of the front, is there any, you know, any other questions?  You know, do you think you need that code change to be able to, because otherwise you're providing waitress service?  Well, yeah.  The problem there is it would require another, I'd have to hire another person to do the work that the customer does.  In our business model, the customer comes in, orders the beverage, and walks to their table or wherever they're going with it, you know.  And as we get busy at like 9 o'clock in the morning, we're like, oh, we're going to have to do this.  And then at 9 o'clock, we always have a door person.  So that's somebody that stands at the door, which would really be at the entrance.  So that person, as we get busy, would be able to keep an eye on any activity in the little outdoor cafe, which literally measures 12 by 20.  It's not that big.  Well, that's why ABC requires the additional.  So you'd have to have the person actually at the gate of the cafe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then the added problem was if we were to cross.  Yeah.  Which makes sense is, you know, a person has a drink and they're crossing the sidewalk.  Right.  To get to the parklet.  Right.  And so what we're doing by having the outdoor cafe is eliminating, you know, we're enclosing the entire area.  And there's, you know, a little, like they have at Raw Bar or Trace, you know, there's a little 30-inch high metal fence there.  You know, it's more or less a barricade.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks.  Thank you very much.  Further questions for staff or?  I have a question for staff, Mr. Mayor.  Ms. Sutton, from the time, if somebody wants to build an outdoor cafe and they submit a set of plans, how long does it take typically for them to get a permit?  It's about a six to nine month process.  Why can't, why couldn't you do that in 30 days if we had a, we had a, we decided it was a priority.  We had a priority to convert these parklets to outdoor cafes.  Could we do an expedited permit process?  If we're running it as a city job, we'll try to get it done as fast as possible.  But usually when we're working with the permit applicants, it takes them a while to, the stuff comes in in phases.  And that's why I'm saying it takes six to nine months.  What I'm saying is they've submitted a set of plans.  And RGA has a reference design, as I understand it.  So they come to you.  They're with something that's already been vetted, presumably the RGA design.  Why can't that happen in 30 days?  It could happen in 30 days.  There's nothing in our process that would restrict it to be longer than 30 days.  It's just I'm saying in reality, it takes six to nine months when they, to get everything, all the insurance and all the submittals to us that are required.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Any other questions?  Council Member Winslow.  There's been some mentions of the sewer lines being replaced and how that could like facilitate creating some of these outdoor cafes.  On Main and Broadway, there are sewer lines.  But have those been replaced or are those scheduled to be replaced soon?  I believe Main and Broadway was replaced back in the 90s or late 80s.  So some of our newer sewer lines?  Yes.  Just so we're clear.  So when we're looking at the cost of expanding the sidewalks, it's not going to be taken up in a project like that unless we had a different resurfacing project going on.  What's the question?  That was just a comment, I suppose, in terms of the need for the funding in order to make the outdoor cafes happen.  Can we have the recommendations on your last slide brought back up here?  Thank you.  We think alike.  All right.  So I'm just going to dive into this to give you guys something to whatever.  Analyze downtown parking needs, update the parking study.  No.  You guys will go get Mike Trollender.  He'll come in here.  Someone will say this.  Someone else will say something else.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We've been talking about parking for 12 years.  And some people want to be able to park right in front of a sidewalk.  They want to be able to park in a store.  And if they can't, they go somewhere else.  I can't do anything about that.  We don't need to spend any money.  It's just insane.  ARP funding for temporary parklets.  No.  I just think it's unfair.  Use of remaining ARP funding for widening the sidewalks.  That's got some problems as we're talking about diagonal parking and all these other things.  That's going to require a lot more staff time.  This council is not going to figure it out.  May I add a comment to your comment?  As soon as I'm finished, I would appreciate it very much.  I would like your comment.  Update the municipal code.  We can talk about that.  Here's the important one.  Extend the operation of three temporary parklets on 2nd and Main.  We've already told them to stop.  We'd have to undo our own motion.  And from what I just heard from Ms. Sutton, best case scenario of doing anything like this is six to nine months.  I don't believe it.  I think it's two years.  Council member Van Overbeck, you talked about RGA has a template.  But that hasn't been approved by the council.  Somebody came up and went, here's something.  It's going to be good.  I love RGA.  It's probably fantastic.  But it's not something, it's nothing we've adopted.  So we're doing a lot to improve the downtown.  It's looking better than it has in a long time.  I think the parklets need to go because there's also no, the temporary ones, there's no guarantee that anybody will actually go try to get the permit when we come up with the process.  So how do we keep someone from doing, I mean, I'm sure these two gentlemen wouldn't do that.  But there are people that operate in town that would.  Your comments, sir?  Mr. Van Overbeck.  Yeah.  So the widening of the sidewalks on 2nd and Main.  So 2nd Street between Main and Broadway, widening that sidewalk makes a lot of sense.  That's where Banshee is.  That's where Naked Lounge is.  And who else?  But widening it on Main, I'm really opposed to that.  The only two operations are.  Duffy's on one corner and then the home on the range, which is on the 3rd and Main.  And in between, I can't see anybody else doing it.  And then it eliminates the ability to go to diagonal parking on Main.  So I think it makes sense for 2nd, but it doesn't make sense for Main.  So the, I don't have, my only, I don't have a problem with any of that other than we're presupposing the diagonal parking, which gets into the sewer lines and some other things.  That we've debated in internal affairs and for a long time in this city.  And I'm not, not sold on diagonal parking.  It's just that taking, and maybe Mr. Vigel disagree with me, maybe not.  Taking Main or Broadway to two lanes effectively makes it one lane.  At all hours of the day because of the deliveries and the people that park and run in and go.  So that's a hard sell for me.  I'm not saying no, but I don't think we can figure that out.  So if you do diagonal parking.  On one side of the street on Main and Broadway, you do parallel parking on the other side.  The current, current ordinances, the delivery trucks need to be finished by 1030.  You make loading zones on the parallel parking side of the street is, and, and traffic downtown doesn't pick up until after just before lunchtime.  It's busy in the afternoon.  It's not busy in the morning.  I've seen the whole block.  I don't, I don't, I don't disagree with the ordinance, but we also have a speed limit.  On the Esplanade that I know you don't pay attention to.  I do a bad to obey.  Oh, yeah.  That's why that's, that's why.  And I think at some point I'm going to defer a little bit to the skipper and go, Mark, what's the best way to attack this?  Given the dynamics of all the things that we're talking about, the diagonal parking, the expanding of the sidewalks.  I don't know.  I mean, the low lying fruit is, do we want to allow more parklets and give up more parking?  Which I'm fine with as long as we have a template that's fair for everybody.  And I don't think that we should necessarily be picking the winners.  And I do get, I get nervous when we talk about expanding sidewalks or doing things specifically in front of specific businesses because we shouldn't be looking at it that way.  It was, it was an invitation.  Okay.  I'll take that invitation.  We would really have to have some council direction to pursue a redesign of Main and Broadway because we're going to have to look at it holistically, including taking into consideration requirements for bike lanes, what those bike lanes look like.  You know, the bike plan says class, class four.  And is that bidirectional class four, single directional class four?  How's it designed?  How's it separated?  You know, they can range anywhere from eight to 12 feet by Caltrans standards.  That's a lot of right of way that gets removed from the potential for consideration for all of these other competing uses.  So we're going to have to look at it holistically.  I don't think we can come up with an answer for Main and Broadway here tonight.  But it sounds like we have to look at it holistically anyway in regards to Main and Broadway regardless.  In the near future, correct?  Yeah.  So how, how do we move forward on some of this?  So can I put in, I think Vice Mayor Reynolds has a comment too.  So can we get in that direction?  Go ahead, Mr. Winslow, and then I'll.  If we don't direct staff to use this ARP funding for Widengside Rocks or for temporary parklets, then what's the next steps with that funding?  We do have to get it dedicated and spent by a fairly short period of time, two more years.  Yeah.  And we do have an item later that deals with some of that.  We have to have it committed by the end of 2024 and then actually spent by 2026.  2026.  That's a little bit of time.  Okay.  So we can revisit uses for those funds.  Well, I'll say for the current item.  These.  The parklets have been very successful, at least in certain cases.  We have businesses representing those cases.  It's good employment downtown.  It adds street life, which means more people are outside, which makes everybody feel safer walking at night.  And these are things that we should absolutely support.  I, maybe I'm in different circles, never hear people complain about how ugly the parklets are, especially versus parked cars.  And I think that we should.  All the input that I've heard says that we should.  We should be trying to preserve these at that very least, if not support them with this grant funding that we have for things like that.  That's certainly what I would like to see us do, if not tonight and a later occasion.  Okay.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  So one of the things that we found when we went through all this is the use of the $285,000 is just super problematic because we run into prevailing wage and everything like that.  So by the time that's where we got to one point, whatever it is.  $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000, $255,000  something that we can take a move on and we can do that now. If ABC allows it, we don't need to  be more restrict than ABC. Trust me, ABC is a freaking nightmare to deal with from everything  I've heard from all my restaurant owners, which is why the use of the plans from RGA don't work  because January of next year or a year from now, January 2024, this temporary permit is going to  expand. So any money that they put into doing the plans that RGA did are only going to be good for  less than 12 months by the time you guys all get it built and alcohol can't cross the sidewalk.  So that doesn't work. So now we're back to our original plan of we currently have a code that  allows people to do an outdoor sidewalk cafe and permit. However, we can't do it on diagonal  parking. So in my opinion, we need to look at updating.  our code to potentially allow that in outdoor in diagonal parking. And if your business is like  this and the parking spots go like this, turn this corner that you're not using into a bike  parking area or something. Get creative. I don't know. Put yoga mats out there. Do something  creative with it. So think outside the box here. And the expense, as much as I would love to keep  the temporary permit parklets going the way that they are, I think we're going to have an issue  doing that since we're not doing that. So I think we're going to have an issue doing that.  We already did vote to get rid of that. So I don't know how we deal with that. But allow the alcohol,  allow temporary, the outdoor food and cafes on diagonal parking and send staff off and running.  And then let's use the $285,000 for a project that we can continue to discuss later that's for  the greater good of downtown. That's not garbage cans because we already have money for that.  So that's the direction I would like to see us go if at all possible.  All right. So I'm happy to make it get one of these things out of the way.  And make a motion to update the municipal code to allow alcohol consumption without food or  servers in outdoor cafes as outlined per ABC laws.  Second.  All right. Further discussion? All right. Madam Clerk.  Thank you.  Council Member Bennett. Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes. Council Member Tandon.  Yes. Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes. Council Member Winslow.  Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes. Mayor Coolidge.  Aye. Carries 7-0.  All right. With that one out of the way, I have one quick question.  So if we were to develop, I like Mr. Van Overbeck's push to try to do this in a short-term process,  30 days or 60 days, something along those lines so we can actually have these individuals who have the right to use the food and the  parking lot, have the temporary parking lot, look at permanent parking lots.  I like the change, of course, on the, you know, the, and maybe that's where we start on the next motion is the change for diagonal parking to be considered for parking lots.  But the RGA specs, which, I mean, they've done most of the downtown, as my understanding, right, that most of the downtown has been designed by RGA with the moms and things along those lines.  So, I mean, we know what they're supposed to look like in general.  So, it is...  Are you talking about an outdoor cafe for these three locations?  Yeah, I'm talking about these three locations moving forward with some kind of plan to doing it in a quick process.  And I guess I'm just frustrated with the six to nine months.  Well, I have a question.  Even if we did it as a city project, it would still take time because we have to, you know, we're in the middle of the city, right?  And we haven't been coordinating with the utility companies on any work on these locations.  So, we, not only does the permit process take a little time, but even if we were going to do it as a city project and we expedited it as fast as we could, it would still take, we probably wouldn't get it in until this summer.  So, my follow-up to that question.  And so, you guys, remember, if we asked staff to do it, we would have to do it in the summer.  So, we have to expedite this.  This is like the most important thing, right?  They're not all sitting around with nothing to do.  So, you just said these other things you're doing are not as important.  And we haven't even addressed that.  We're just saying this is the most important thing, number one.  And we need to know if that's true.  Number two, Mr. Mayor, and I'm not sure you meant, I can't see you.  I don't know if you meant this, but is there some reason we want to grandfather the temporary parklets that are there that don't belong there into this?  Or should we not be looking at a policy that is fair for, you know, the city?  I don't think there's a policy that is fair for anybody that wants to put a parklet, once we have an approved template in place.  I don't think because the ones that are there that haven't been taken down are still there, they should have any more right than anyone else.  Oh, I don't disagree with you on that one.  Okay.  Which gets us back to we need a process and an agreed plan and an agreed format.  It's going to take staff some time to do that.  And until we have that,  unless we change our prior decision, we have to follow through on where our prior decision was, and the current ones need to go.  Until there is a fair process that can be followed that deals with the utilities and all these things in Diagon Park.  Don't we have a process?  So we agreed in October that the temporary parklets have to go because they're in eyesore.  Okay.  Okay. That's a given.  And 14.7 provides the code for outdoor cafes.  If we can find a way to expedite the permit process, and right now people aren't sitting outside, then, you know, we're talking about pouring a slab of concrete and putting up a railing.  These guys should be able to get this done in six months, the whole thing.  Are they taking out parking spaces?  Yes.  What they're paying for.  What they're paying for.  Well, that sounds simple.  So if I've got storage, I'm going to have to pay for it.  So I'm going to have to pay for it.  And I want to pay the City, because they come up with a number, for the four spaces in front of me, because I want this parklet, and I want to generate all this revenue and all these things.  And so I've paid the City this, and the City gets its parking revenue, can do whatever.  But right next door to me is Business B.  It is not mine.  That they've lost the chance to have that parking.  I get all the benefit from it, and they've lost it.  So it's just more dynamic than going, who's going to do it.  So at some point we have to, so what if everybody in town says, I want one in front of my business.  Well, we need to have a budget for parklets.  So in my mind, we've got two issues.  One is we've got the Banshee and Duffy's who currently have parklets, and they've seen that that's effective.  And we need to try to get them to a permanent solution as quickly as we can.  The second point is we have people who in the future may want to put one in.  I think we all agree that outdoor dining is done.  The right way looks fantastic and adds to the streetscape and makes downtown more interesting.  But we need to be thoughtful about the impact on parking, the parking inventory.  One of the reasons that we need to look carefully at diagonal parking because it adds 50 spaces on Main and Broadway.  So I absolutely agree with everything you said.  It adds spaces.  It's going to cause a traffic problem.  No one believes me, but I'm willing to be proven wrong.  So I absolutely agree with everything you said.  I don't like to use business names because I don't think where the temporary parklets are now guarantees that those people will get a permit.  It needs to be across the board equal.  Could I make a suggestion that anybody who likes to keep a temporary parklet needs to maybe with a deadline, maybe end of the...  I'm just making a number.  We have a deadline.  It's passed.  Which I understand.  But it seems like that there is a desire to keep those temporary parklets.  If we allow to keep the temporary parklets, we, whatever they staff thinks, that maybe by the end of 31st of January, they need to submit a plan to make it permanent.  There has to be a deadline for them, not at the cost of the city to do it for them.  But if they choose, if they're making substantial amount of revenue, they need to come up with a plan on how to keep it going.  But sitting in the city, I don't think that's the right time.  I think it needs to come up with a deadline that, okay, you can keep them on till 31st of January.  You need to submit a plan or take a permit from the city, and then you can continue it till you can put it together on a permanent basis.  I disagree with that, and I'll tell you why.  Because some people already lost their temporary parklets.  And what would we do when they come and say, well, gosh, if I knew you had done that, I would have kept it.  So we're being wishy-washy, which is exactly what the public doesn't need.  We already said these things need to be done.  We don't know.  And I trust and admire the staff, but I guarantee you whatever number they come up with, it'll take us this month to come up with a process that works.  The number's wrong.  Not because they're bad.  It's just a forecast.  We don't know.  And they have other things in here.  Go on.  You know what?  Two weeks from now, we're going to come over and give them a whole other list of things that are more important than whatever this was, because that's what we do.  So how do we...  So technically, are we suggesting that we would not do any more parklets in the city?  No, no, no.  I think Council Member Overruck, and I think we agree, let's come up with a budget for how many spaces we're willing to give up and what we're going to do with diagonal parking and how many parklets that warrants without saying the two or three that are left get grandfathered in, because that's not fair to anybody, except the two or three people.  Well, I guess I don't agree.  I think the people that are operating right now deserve...  I think the people that are operating right now deserve consideration beyond somebody in the future who may submit an application.  We don't know who that is.  Why?  Right?  Because they have proven that it adds attractiveness and interest to the streetscape.  I mean, that's...  But they haven't.  Mr. Van Overruck, they haven't proven it.  They've put a barrier in front, and it's ugly.  They haven't proven it.  No, no, it's ugly.  But people are there.  They're there buying drinks and hamburgers, right?  And that's a good thing.  So I want to get them to a permanent solution as quickly as we can.  And so I...  Mr. Mayor, may I make a motion?  Yes, absolutely.  I'd like to make a motion that the temporary parklets go away immediately, January 31st.  The temporary parklets go away January 31st.  The second element is of 2020.  Can I do that, Debbie?  No.  Because we already have...  We've already done that.  We've already done that.  Okay.  And then the second...  So the second piece of it is that I want to see an expedited permitting process that the city puts together  that says that the people who have temporary parklets can get a permit 60 days after they submit plans  so that we can turn this thing quickly.  Or what?  Well, I mean, it's going to be on the city to do it.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  The problem is just because somebody submits plans doesn't mean they're complete plans.  It doesn't mean they meet all the city requirements.  It doesn't mean that they've satisfied all the utilities, sewer, water, gas, electricity, on and on and on, that there are no conflicts.  Right, but Mr. City Manager, we're talking about a slab and a railing.  There's no mechanical.  It's a very simple building project.  I build things.  All I'm saying is simply delivering a set of plans does not necessarily mean they're going to be acceptable.  Right out of the gate.  But if we have to make these people wait nine months to get to a permit.  It's not us making them take nine months.  Usually it is them refining their plans.  Plus the fact, before they can build it, they're probably going to have to get it in front of ABC to get an approval for the expansion of their area.  And that has nothing.  It all to do with the city.  So all I'm saying is there's some things outside of the city's control.  It's not like we have complete control over the situation.  I'm not asking you to control things you can't control.  But I think where we have a situation where somebody has a business and they're deriving revenue from a temporary temporary seating.  And we all I think most of us agree we want to make it permanent.  So it's aesthetically pleasing.  We should try to do everything we can.  The city should try to do everything it can to accommodate that.  No argument there.  So sorry, Ms.  Sutton.  We have a program in place right now that either the Banshee, the Duffy's, Schubert's, Mamone, anybody could walk in with a plan to you tomorrow and apply for a sidewalk permit.  Correct?  Except if it's Second Street because of the diagonal parking.  Except that you can't.  On second because you can't do it on diagonal parking, which is why I said earlier what we need to prioritize is allowing the permits where there is diagonal parking.  And that's what we need to be researching because that's the only thing that is stopping somebody.  No name to be mentioned that has great mac and cheese to be able to apply because you can't do it on parallel parking.  And if I remember right, what you told me earlier today is they can do a bump out and do their sidewalk.  Cafe there and we could still have compact car parking.  So we're not even losing the parking place.  Correct?  Yes.  So who tells us a compact car?  I don't know.  Not me.  I'm one of those SUVs.  Okay.  So I'm having.  So my motion is to direct staff to look at bringing us back a code that will allow cafe and outdoor cafes and on parallel parking.  That's what we need.  On diagonal.  Sorry.  Diagonal parking.  Diagonal parking.  Seconded.  Is that a substitute motion?  No, it's an extra motion.  We already passed one in regards to the ABC stuff.  And then Council Member Van Overbeck made one, but I didn't get a second.  Okay.  I have a question on the motion.  Yes.  Okay.  Before his motion dies, let's re-hear his motion so I actually know what it is.  So you want to tell us what your motion was?  His motion was.  There we go.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Let me just get back there.  Let me see.  Temporary parklets go.  He originally said temporary parklets go away January 31st.  Council Member Morgan said, well, that already occurred with the prior Council action.  Second piece would be an expedited process that people could get their permit 60 days  after submission or quickly thereafter.  City should do everything to make this happen.  That was the motion that was on the table and there was no second.  Withdraw or move forward?  Well, you didn't ask for a second.  Okay.  No, I haven't.  Right.  Do you want to withdraw or do you want to continue with that motion?  No, I want to continue with that motion.  Okay.  I'm just not sure that we've, the expedited process would work.  Repeat the motion, please.  Yeah.  Debbie.  Okay.  Frasier.  So, well, what I had was temporary parklets go away January 31st.  That already happened according to Council Member Morgan, which was a Council action.  Second piece, expedited process that people will get permits 60 days after submission or  quickly thereafter.  Okay.  Withdraw or move forward?  I am guilty of this motion.  Okay.  I am guilty of this motion.  Okay.  I am guilty of this motion.  I am guilty of this motion.  I am guilty of this motion.  I am guilty of this motion.  Okay.  I am guilty of this motion.  I am guilty of this motion.  Okay.  I am guilty of this motion.  Okay.  I am guilty of this motion.  Okay.  I am guilty of this motion.  Okay.  Sorry.  So, why are you being so difficult?  All right, let's.  Because, do you want me to delete and answer that?  Because you're being unfair.  I have no problem with asking staff to come up with  some kind of, we're saying staff put aside other things  and to the extent that you can make it possible.  Help restaurants that want to have these outdoor cafes  get permitted to do it.  Now we can't control ABC, we can't control bad plans,  we can't control any of that, we all know that.  And I have no problem with your motion  until you get to the last part.  When you say, give priority to the people  that have the temporary ones now.  But people have, have there not been areas  that have taken their temporary ones away already?  Why don't you make a friendly amendment  and we'll drop the last part.  Well, if I would make a friendly amendment,  I would second, I would actually second your motion  as long as we can drop the last part  and it's level playing field.  I'll go with that.  You want the second?  Sure.  All right, we'll drop the second.  And that is removing the, let me get it back to the screen.  Removing the prior prioritizing of the existing parklets.  You're removing that section.  And with Council Member Morgan second.  Is that correct?  Okay.  Could I have you please repeat the motion?  Last time.  To direct staff to use its best efforts  in streamlining a permitting process.  And originally it said expedite prioritizing  the existing parklets.  And then.  Just the prioritizing.  Right, so just the best effort to streamline the process  for outdoor cafes is what I'm hearing.  If I were to sum up.  Motion and second, Madam Chair can take over.  May I have a comment? Sure.  I think it was a mistake to say that the parklets  should go away without having planned for  there to be some kind of continuity.  And I think most people in the community  would prefer that there were some kind of continuity.  We don't have this extended, who knows how long period  of the parklets going away when people like them.  I'm looking for the best way we can approach that continuity  and maybe this is it.  So thanks.  Well, I actually agree with you,  but I was in the minority on the vote.  So.  So I couldn't bring it back up.  I think we're getting there.  We're closer than last time.  Council Member Bennett.  I'm very uncomfortable with the fuzziness of this.  It just doesn't feel right,  but I do want to support the motion.  So it will be yes.  Council Member Morgan.  So to follow up on Mr. Bennett,  who I always enjoy agreeing with.  It is fuzzy.  But at the end of the day, it comes from the staff,  the professionals that are gonna deal with this  to make this as expedited as possible  and expedited maybe nine months instead of two years  or four months instead of nine.  There's just too many other dynamics at play.  And as the skipper pointed out,  we can't control what the people turn in  as a possible application.  But I do trust the staff will do everything they can  to make that happen.  And maybe it'll be in time for spring and maybe not.  But yes, I support the motion.  Thank you.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries seven zero.  All right.  Any other motion?  So I'm back to.  Yeah, we've got another motion.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  You have the floor.  I would like to make a motion that we direct staff  to come back with an ordinance that will allow us  to consider outdoor cafes in parallel,  diagonal, jeez, diagonal parking areas.  Like a second.  So just basically updating code?  Yes.  Okay.  Like a second, the motion.  Vice Mayor, you're referring to existing diagonal parking.  Oh, good question.  Because there's been conversations about this and that  and diagonal here and there and I know diagonal.  Well, until we have those future conversations  and until there's future diagonal parking,  yes, it is only to on what we have right now.  Okay. Thank you.  So it would only be current diagonal.  Is this your main motion?  Yes, there's a motion and a second.  Okay.  Okay.  Which was for staff to bring back an ordinance  that would allow the council to consider amending  the requirements related to existing diagonal parking.  Is that correct?  Yes.  Okay. Thank you.  Do we get a second?  Do you need a second?  There was a second.  Okay. We're good.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan. Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries seven zero.  All right.  And unless anyone else has anything else on this item.  I would like to make one comment  and I do support Council Member Morgan's comment.  You made a few minutes ago about,  I know diagonal parking on Main and Broadway doesn't work.  I agree with you.  I believe.  I don't think I said it.  Sorry.  I don't normally speak that clearly and directly,  Mr. Bennett.  I think I was more vague about it.  Well, then I withdraw the compliment.  All right. We're going to take a short recess.  Thank you.  .  All right.  We'll reconvene.  .

The Council meeting of December 6th provided a two-week sunshining period for the draft  confidentials MOU, which was also negotiated via a successor MOU process.  This evening, we're seeking final ratification.  For the remainder of fiscal year 2022-23, the fiscal impact of this contract is anticipated  at $30,000 to the general fund for pay increases and $7,100 for bonuses and cash-out options.  Over the life of the contract, the total cost will be $90,000 for pay increases and  $35,100 for bonus and cash-out options.  I do want to note that the updated confidentials MOU has been significantly revised to reflect  much of what is considered standard MOU language for our clerical and technical unit, very  similar to what UPEC has.  Key updates for this contract include a contract term of July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2025,  a 6% jump.  General salary increased retroactive to July 2022 with no other increases during the term  of the contract.  However, the reopener does remain active.  One-time incentive bonus payments of $1,000 per member upon ratification.  The ability to double bump for certain staff at their annual evaluation.  General and administrative call-out provisions.

The council meeting of December 6th provided a two-week sunshining period for the draft CPOA MOU,  which was negotiated during a re-opener provision.  This evening, we are seeking ratification of the finalized document.  Fiscal impact for the contract is anticipated at $14,000 to the general fund  and a total cost over the life of the contract of $28,000.  This re-opener encompasses only two items, which were both requested by CPOA.  The first is a multi-step advancement for approximately 10 CPOA members  who were disadvantaged during a lapsed letter agreement and the new MOU starting in 2021,  and then changes to the shift differential start times  to better accommodate scheduling and staffing within the department.  I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  Question?  No. None.  Entertain a motion.  Motion approved.  Second.  We have a motion from Vice Mayor Alonzo, second from Council Member Bennett.  Council Member Bennett.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  Yeah.  Item 5.7, approval of the letter of agreement.  Missionary Engineers Local 39.  Good evening again, Council.  Before you tonight for approval is a letter agreement between the City and Local 39,  which resulted from a recent meet and confer process.  This letter agreement provides a salary scale change to one position at our wastewater treatment plant  and will place the electrical environmental supervisor equivalent in base compensation range  to our lead operator position.  The estimated annual cost of this action is $10,000,  plus a one-time cost.  The total cost of this action is $11,000 to the sewer fund.  I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  Questions?  Speakers?  None.  Motion.  So moved.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Tandon and second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Okay.  When you're ready.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Item 5.8.  Council Member Tandon requests additional dog park locations.  Council Member Tandon.  So we only have one dog park, which is at DeGarma Park.  I'm aware that there is a lot of off-leash locations at Bidwell Park, too,  but I would like to explore more dog parks in different times,  especially in the south side of town, if possible.  Because we only have one in the north side.  And it will really help the residents to not travel all the way towards the DeGarma Park,  and it's going to be definitely more environmental friendly as well.  So I would like to get the support of my fellow Council members on that.  All right.  Any questions for Council Member Tandon?  Do we have any speakers on this topic?  None.  Okay.  Entertain a motion, unless you guys don't have one.  I do.  Maybe to suggest staff to look for the locations and bring it to us.  I don't know.  One location or more than one?  What would be the direction?  I mean, one at least for sure.  But if staff feels like that we have more appropriate locations,  would like to hear that as well.  Okay.  Move to approve.  Sorry.  Motion and second.  Council Member Bennet and Council Member Van Overbeck second.  Council Member Bennet.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  Item 5.9 is my request to use the ARPA funds for a shop local campaign last Council Member  meeting.  We actually heard when this was brought up that some of the, not last, but two meetings  ago, I believe, heard that some of the funds still remain.  And I believe Jennifer McCarthy has some additional information in general on this idea.  I think actually Director Martin would be able to address this.  But you heard today of two projects which may have additional funds in that.  So if the Council does decide to move forward with a local campaign, we'll be able to use  the shop local campaign.  We can identify those exact American Rescue Plan dollars, one-time funds that can be used  for this.  We would just need directions for how much money that you would be looking for.  I think the original, Barbara, you have something to add?  No, I was just going to concur.  And it was more about the projects that we haven't started yet that we have more discretion  to move funds around should we decide to.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yeah, personally, I'd like to see like $240,000 towards an advertising campaign to encourage  people to shop locally.  That's my thought process.  I'm definitely open to any opinions or thoughts that anyone else would have.  I think encouraging people to shop local, particularly during certain times of the year,  makes a lot of sense.  I think it makes sense for multiple reasons, but the local shopping promotion that we do  after Christmas.  You know, shop local works.  It has benefits.  It has tangible benefits, not only to our tax base, but also for local businesses and  their profits as well.  So I think the community could be included and businesses can be included to put in additional  funds.  I'd like to see an option for that.  I know there's businesses out there.  My conversation started with some business owners in the area who were actually looking  at organizing something like this on their own.  But we're really looking for some additional funds.  I think they could be able to get some additional funding through the city ARPA funds if they  could have it.  So...  In what time frame are you...  A year.  One year?  It's a great idea.  Where did that money...  Or where did the dollar amount come from?  Do we have a proposal or you're just...  No, it's just relative to I think some of the costs that we had or some of the things  that we had available through the parklet fund I think was $300,000.  Something in that respect.  I think there were others that were broke, and I know we have we detailed that out at  that meeting, that we're quite a few funds that we're not necessarily going to utilize  all their...  Their dollars.  I love the idea of promoting, you know, shopping local.  I'm just not sure that we as the city government are going to be great at doing that, so I'm  open to listening to proposals and finding out and maybe getting some bids on something  to show that we can actually do that.  show, but I don't think  putting $240,000 into one  company advertising  person's pocket to  promote Chico when we have the chamber, the  DCBA, business owners, we're all...  Anyways, I'd want to see a little bit more  before... No, I think we  probably would just ask staff to bring  back, you know,  an outline of a program around  that number and see how  they think that should be utilized. Obviously  a lot of those dollars would be spent on advertising.  I'd like the product to be spent on  advertising rather than someone organizing the  advertising, but obviously someone  will need to organize the advertising.  So we got  an email from Jennifer McCarthy  about the small business Saturday  promotion effort. It's just  obviously much smaller scale than what  you're talking, but $4,300 is all  the line items that we were  given. And I'm just curious, because you deal with  a lot of these things, if you just want to weigh in generally  on the idea and the budget  we're talking about. Sir, I'm happy  to thank you, Council Member Winslow.  The small business Saturday campaign  was a joint campaign that was done  with Team Chico Partners,  really taking the lead with DCBA, the  Chamber, and the City.  It was a two-week program. We spent about  $4,300 in total.  That includes flyers,  social media, videos  that you saw on TV  and radio, and print  as well.  We had some really good feedback  about that program. Business  is really appreciated  being able to have  the city support small and support  these types of businesses.  And we heard, at least  from downtown, a couple of the businesses say  it was the best small  business Saturday that they have had.  We don't have concrete  examples that this is from this campaign,  but I would like to think that we certainly did  help aid in their success.  And I think if we do it as a city-wide program,  it could have lots of benefits.  That's what's awesome.  For all those businesses  out there, whether it's, you know, whether you're  building something, whether you're buying a car,  whatever it might be,  the importance of shopping.  My only question,  and this is probably for Jen and Bart,  is this the same money that we're  talking about potentially, possibly,  maybe, giving  to the DCBA?  Then  I'll vote no.  Because what we're doing, again,  is here's the dollar amount,  here's the neat thing to spend it on, but we're not  looking at the other alternatives.  Council Member Morgan, we may have  some additional funds, and I think that's  what Director Martin was saying, is we have  a couple of projects that, because of timelines,  we might not be able to get to  within the spending deadlines.  So, wait, don't turn  your mic back on.  Can I support  both?  Yes, so staff could look at that and see.  I mean, if the $240, you know,  it's not...  No, I didn't want, and I don't know what we're going to do  with the DCBA, but I don't want the DCBA to come  forward and be like, look, we're going to help downtown Chico,  and be like, sorry, we spent it on a shop local  while we got rid of you.  I'm trying to avoid that.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And I would just like to add on to that,  as when we are planning this campaign,  I think we should  focus on all of the  city small businesses, not just  the downtown.  So, please,  when we get the proposals, let's  make sure that  we make them aware.  Yeah, kind of  on that note,  I'm thinking also of, like, small  producers who don't have storefronts  too, and making sure that if we're  putting all this money in to support  certain businesses, it's not just the ones that have  established locations and are able to  be more inclusive.  Yeah, so I think that's a fair point across.  The board, we need to consider all our local  businesses when we do this.  Maybe Chico produces  quality products across the board,  has services that can do whatever  you need done, rather than  going out of town for it.  I'll make that a motion.  Second.  All right.  Okay.  Do we have any public comment? Nope.  Just have to ask. Go ahead.  Councilmember Bennett?  Yes. Councilmember Morgan?  Yes. Councilmember Tandon?  Yes. Councilmember Van Overbeck?  Yes. Councilmember Winslow?  Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes.  Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carry 7-0.  All right. Item 6,  reports and communications. Following reports and  communication items are provided for the council's  information. No action can be taken under this section  unless the  council agrees to include it on a  subsequent agenda. City Manager's report.  No report. All right.  We have the  shelter crisis declaration status.  We have the shelter crisis report, which is informational only.  Do we have any item 6.3, council member requests?  Pursuant to AP and P1010, council members may verbally request an item to be  agendized at a future council meeting after stating what the item would be  if a majority of the councils are needed.  In order for staff to agendize, council members may also submit their  requests in writing. Do we have any council member requests?  All right. Seeing none, we'll move to adjournment. Thank you.  Thank you.
