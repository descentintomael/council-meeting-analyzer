Almighty God, we come before you today,  and I ask that you would give this council wisdom  and discernment and understanding  in every decision that they're going to make today,  every matter that they're going to consider.

Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll let you guys say a few words.  Okay.  If you want.  Okay.  I'll make it quicker than I thought I was going to.  Okay.  Thank you very much for seeing us this evening, and thank you so much, Andrew, for this proclamation.  I have to read, otherwise I get distracted, so bear with me.  So, as the executive director of Chico Start, which is a nonprofit organization that hosts this as the local chapter as well, I'm also the director for the Center of Entrepreneurship at CSU Chico.  So, I get to do this all day.  It's fabulous.  I don't know how I got so lucky.  We want to thank the city of Chico for issuing this proclamation recognizing Global Entrepreneurship Week, which takes place during this week every year.  Global Entrepreneurship.  Global Entrepreneurship Week showcases the talents and creativity of local entrepreneurs and innovators here in Chico and throughout Butte County.  It serves as an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of small business, startup culture, and the impact of entrepreneurship on our local economy.  I like to say, what is entrepreneurship a lot?  Because it's kind of a fancy word, right?  And it's often misspelled and often misunderstood.  But it's a lot.  We help people listen to their culture.  We help people create.  So, behind every doctor, lawyer, roofer, restaurateur, et cetera, is a business that's run by an entrepreneur.  So, it doesn't always come with other fancy things.  This call to create has been with us since the beginning.  This call to create, build, or care, or as Chico Start's motto is, start, grow, and thrive.  It's from Legos to lemonade stands to the creative economy.  It's more than hard work, passion, and perseverance.  Our NorCal businesses don't just work.  They create jobs.  They boost GDP.  They lower inequality, grow community wealth, stop or slow attrition of young talent, and reduces poverty.  That's why we are on a mission to change policies, shift mindsets, and build communities where anyone can grow their entrepreneurial dreams without barriers.  Thank you again, Andrew.  And thank you so much, City Council, for hosting us this evening.  We appreciate it. All right, and next we will have a presentation on care court from director Butte County behavioral health Scott Kennelly There he is Welcome back. It's been a while. Good evening Mayor Coolidge members of the council Scott Kennelly director for Butte County behavioral health  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  m here tonight to  talk to you about care court  it'  s a new  initiative that california has  to put in place as of december  1 which is next month. Care  court stands for community  assistance recovery and  empowerment. I don'  t have a power  point up sorry I just realized  I was going to say  t know what it'  s called.  Care court power point.  Is it already up there?  I might send it in to you guys.  Do you guys know which one it is?  That'  s mine.  Well at least you'  e going to be all ready to go.  Actually if it'  s not installed on there if you  would want to take the next presentation we can get that and get it uploaded.  I apologize for that.  All right.  All right so we'  ll skip ahead to  the curator from janet  churner museum.  Welcome.  Rachel I'  m not even going to try to pronounce your last name correctly.  That'  s okay it'  s Rachel skakowski.  Thanks so much mayor coolidge for inviting me to speak to all of you today.  Let me introduce myself.  I'  m Rachel skakowski.  m the curator for janet churner print museum at chico state.  I started in this role in august 2022.  So it'  s my third year on campus.  And I'  m really excited to have the opportunity to share a little bit about the museum today.  So my goals with this short presentation are to introduce or reintroduce you to the turner, who we are, what we do.  And then really to talk about our goals for better collaborating with our community and the city of chico.  And I'  ll also leave a little bit of time for questions.  If you have any.  Let'  s see.  Of course I now can't.  Go ahead.  There we go.  I would love to ask the council members with a show of hands.  How many of you have ever been to the turner?  Okay.  And have you been in the last year?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, hopefully this will convince some of you who have never been to give it a try.  We are very proud to represent the legacy of Janet turner.  She was chico state's first printmaking professor.  And she was an artist and an educator and a collector.  So when she died in 1988, she left her personal collection of over 2,000 prints to the university with the goal of creating a museum.  And we've had a couple different homes on campus.  We were in laxon auditorium and merriam-larkin.  And we were in laxon library.  But in 2016, we moved into this beautiful new arts and humanities building.  And we have a professional gallery.  And a collection archive space.  And many people are curious about what we have in the collection.  And so in spite of our name, we don't just have prints by Janet turner.  Since 1988, we have doubled the size of the collection.  We have over 4,000 prints from more than 400 years ago.  of art history over 40 countries. So we have some household names that you might recognize,  Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso, but our collection is still growing. We're really committed to  diversifying our collection through purchasing prints by contemporary artists, and we've got  to buy important Native American artists and African American artists here on view.  And we're really here for the public. So we do three to four exhibitions a year. They are  completely free. They're open to everyone. We showcase prints from our collection. We have an  annual student exhibition every spring, and we also do really exciting contemporary visiting  artist shows. So our current exhibition, if you haven't been yet, it's a really fun one.  It's open until December 13th, and it features  20,000  to 23 different artists from all over the U.S. who've sent their work to Chico,  and they're all working in really experimental ways with screen print.  And in addition to our exhibitions, we do a lot of programming and events that are really designed,  again, they're free, they're open to everyone. So we have artist lectures, we do opening  receptions for our exhibition. Today we had a pizza and print party where we were,  screen printing tote bags, and we have another event coming up this Thursday. We're doing a pop-up  gallery tour from 5 to 5.30 p.m. if any of you want to give the Turner a try. And I think a lot of  people don't necessarily know where to find information about what we have available. So  we're on social media. We're on the Butte 365 calendar. You can also look at our website.  And then I wanted to just conclude by thinking a little bit about the work that we're doing here.  And I wanted to just conclude by thinking a little bit about opportunities for collaboration with the  community. Because I think because we're on campus, there's maybe a perception that our  primary goal is to serve the university. And while we love our students, our faculty and staff at  Chico State, we're really for everyone. So we love participating in community events like the  Art and Wine Walk. That's where I met Mayor Coolidge. We'll also be participating in the  Butte County Museum Weekend coming up in the spring.  And I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I'm going to hand it over to you,  and I want to highlight our next show as well, because that is really generously supported by a  City of Chico Arts and Culture grant. We're going to be showcasing Asian American artists in our  collection. And this arts funding is so important for organizations like us, because it allows us to  tell really diverse stories that resonate with our community here in Chico. And the final thing that  we do, we also do a lot of educational programming. You might not know that we offer a completely  free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free,  free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free  in our community. We are really open to partnering with businesses, organizations. We would love to  host events at the museum, to collaborate on educational partnerships, to get more sponsors  for our exhibitions. So I'm really excited to just be able to share a little bit more,  you know, about who we are and what we're doing. And I'll just finish with a slide here,  just highlighting our website. You can follow us on Instagram. And our open hours were open  Tuesday through Saturday, 12 to 4, and on Thursday evenings until 8 p.m. And one other opportunity  that I wanted to highlight is that we are really looking to add to our advisory board of directors.  You don't have to have museum or art experience. We would love to invite more diverse voices from  the community. We would love to have more diverse voices from the community. We would love to have  more diverse voices from the community. We would love to have more diverse voices from the community  with nonprofit or business experience. It's a really wonderful way to give back to the Turner  and to the arts in Chico. So thank you so much for the time. If anyone has any questions, I'd be very  happy to answer. But I hope to see many of you at an exhibition or an event soon.  All right. Thank you very much. Questions? I have a quick one. What's your main source of  funding and our funds?  Need right now? Or are you guys doing okay?  Yeah. So we receive some funding from the university, from the state. But actually,  most of our funding is from donors. We're very lucky to have several endowments.  But we're supported by our memberships. So we love getting new members. And we also do a couple  of crowdfunding campaigns. So in the spring, we have Giving Day, where you can give directly and  support the museum. Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much for being here.  All right.  Mr. Cannelli.  I'm going to get him set up here real quick.  All right.  Maybe.  Maybe. !  Were you able to see it, Mark, on yours?  Yes.  It's thinking. It just keeps dying. Let's do this. Yes, I'm going to do it. Aha! What do you think of them apples?  There we go. Oh It just keeps going away I know I know  That is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  I was thinking about something.  Can you, through your computer, and then just forward it for Scott?  Is it linked in?  No?  I'm going to re-forward the email.  So while you guys are doing that real quick, why don't we just go ahead with consent agenda.  So, Madam Clerk, if that's okay.  All right.  Consent agenda.  All matters listed on the consent agenda are considered routine in nature and therefore can be enacted in one motion.  Do we have any speakers on the consent agenda?  We do not.  Okay.  All right.  Any counsel disqualifications on consent agenda?  All right.  Seeing none, entertain a motion.  Move to approve.  Second.  That's a motion by the Vice Mayor.  Second from Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Okay.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeck.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  Closer, maybe.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  we'  going to go to the next  .  .  .  .  .  . I won't even ask you how old he's at the point in life where he's trying to forget Perhaps perhaps  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  the  mayor.  I'  m just wondering if  we'  re close over there.  We will go with the  unglamorous version. Sorry to  disappoint folks. If you want to  try to work on it while he'  speaking we could always catch  it up. Fire away.  I'  m here to talk to you  about care court. As you'  re all  aware there'  s a focus from the  state on serious mental illness  particularly the homeless population but also in general on mental illness and getting  people into treatment. Care court represents one of the state'  s attempts to add another tool to behavior health departments to serve individuals who are in need of treatment. Care court stands for community assistance recovery and  empowerment. Care court is a  funded by the state and it is a  new civil court process to provide  early action support and community  based behavioral health services. It'  s a state funded program which is  rare lately. We have a lot of  mandates from the state that don'  t come down with funding and care  court does have some funding attached to it. It'  s considered voluntary and its primary  focus is on individuals adults with  schizophrenia and other psychotic  disorders associated with  schizophrenia. It'  s available to anyone regardless of  their income or insurance status which is  also unusual for county behavioral health because we typically serve individuals with  medical or people who have no insurance. Care court doesn'  t discriminate about insurance status or anything so you can be privately insured,  you can be rich, you can be poor. If you meet the criteria you can get into care court. There'  s no cost to the individual who goes to care court who moving forward I will be calling a  respondent because that'  s the language they use in the care court program. Highlights of care court is it focuses on  individuals needs regarding their mental illness. Legal counsel is offered to the respondent at no cost. An advocate or a  supporter advocate is offered to the individual to help them navigate the whole court process from the beginning all the way through their care plan and to the end of the court process. As far as behavioral health goes we offer mental health treatment, housing resources, stabilization medications and substance use treatment for individuals in care court. The other unique thing about care court is there'  s a high amount of accountability and  accountability on counties. There'  re regularly scheduled status hearings for individuals in care court. The court can also order sanctions, financial sanctions to the county if we'  re not doing what we'  re supposed to be doing to get people engaged, assess them and provide treatment. There'  s regular collections of data that are reported out to the state. There'  s quite a bit of data reporting. The state looks at the trends and analyzes how care court'  s going. You may have heard of care court before. There was a cohort one, a number of cases. It'  s effectively a podem effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  or another associated psychotic disorder.  You have to be not clinically stabilized in ongoing voluntary treatment.  This is a very deliberate court that says if you're homeless and seriously mentally ill  and you're schizophrenic, you could qualify for care court.  However, you don't have to be homeless.  You can be living in the home with your parents and not taking medications and noncompliant  and qualify for care court, or you can be in some form of treatment but not doing well  and decompensating pretty badly, and this is a last-ditch effort to get you help.  Participation in care court, though, is also considered the least restrictive option for  the individual.  They don't need to be hospitalized.  They don't need a higher level of care like conservatorship.  This is just another low-level intervention that is voluntary in nature, and you have  to be determined likely to benefit from care court, so that is part of the assessment process  to see if that's something that we believe the individual could benefit from, and at  least one of the two following things have to happen.  You have to be deemed unlikely to safely survive in the community without supervision  and your condition, your mental illness, is substantially deteriorating in the eyes  of the assessor, or you need services and supports to prevent a relapse or deterioration  that would likely result in grave disability or serious harm to yourself or others.  Some of the eligible diagnoses are schizophrenia and a number of the schizophrenic diagnoses  that are related to it, like schizophreniform and other psychotic disorders.  There's a whole list of them on my PowerPoint.  It's fascinating.  You're not going to see it right now.  However, when care court was created, for some reason, they focused on schizophrenia,  and if you look at the research, research varies depending on who you're talking to,  but some people believe that 40% of the homeless population has some form of schizophrenia.  Some people believe that's too high.  Some people believe it's too low.  There are also other people in our community who have psychotic disorders that do not qualify  for care court under the current model, and two of the most common ones that are concerning  are major depression with psychotic features.  Those two individuals or types of individuals with those diagnoses are not eligible for care  court at this time for whatever reason.  There's been feedback from cohort one counties about they've had to deny people care court  services even though they have psychotic individuals who meet all the other criteria.  They just don't have that diagnosis of schizophrenia.  So there is dialogue at the state level about trailer bill language, perhaps expand the  definition of eligible people for care court, which I think would be a good thing.  So how does care court start?  It starts with a petition.  A petition has to be filed about the individual who you have concern about.  And the unique part about care court is if you're in adult services, typically the individual  with the mental illness volunteers for services and comes in for services or is referred through  the court or someone else, or if they're on a 5150, they're involuntarily in treatment.  Care court allows other people of concern to refer people to care court, such as a spouse,  a registered domestic partner, a parent, a sibling, a child, or a grandparent of the  respondent, the director of certain county agencies such as adult protective services,  behavioral health, or public guardians office, directors of hospitals in which the individual  is recently treated, a person who stands in place of a parent or a respondent, or an interesting  one, a person who lives with the respondent.  So a roommate can refer someone to care court.  The list goes on and on, including licensed behavioral health staff, emergency medical  technicians who have had repeated individuals.  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem It can be in the county where the respondent is a defendant or respondent in a pending criminal or civil action or proceeding and The petitions can begin can be filed beginning December 2nd 2024 and they can be filed at the North County Butte County  the petition is filed in the  house and the petitions can be  filed beginning December 2, 2024  and they can be filed at the  north county butte county  courthouse at 1775 concord  avenue and the sharp self-help  assistance referral program is  available that entity to help  people file petitions because  petition filing is a little bit  complicated and you have to meet  certain criteria. Petitions must  California must have two forms  care 100 form which is the  actual petition and care 101  form which is the mental health  declaration saying this person  has a mental illness and we  believe it is schizophrenia if  you don' t have those you can  provide written evidence the  respondent was detained for more  than two periods of intensive  mental health treatment with the  most recent encounter within the  last two years.  The court has two options the  court can look at the petition and  say this sounds like it is  appropriate we believe the person  should benefit from care court and  order our team to go out and do a  more comprehensive assessment of the  individual we have to do that  assessment within 14 days and report  back to the court our findings to  determine whether or not we believe  they are seriously mentally ill  schizophrenic and those criteria  they are at risk of decompensating without care court services. If that happens the care court sets an initial  hearing date and the care process  begins and a care court plan is  established with the individual and  they go through a court process.  If they don' t meet criteria  according to the court' s definition  the petition is dismissed and the  court says they are not eligible for  care court. The other way in which  someone is not followed through with  care court is they voluntarily accept  treatment we engage them we talk  to them about services we talk to them about the fact they are  being referred to care court and they  say I don' t want to go through care court I want to deal with this I will go and get behavioral health services  effectively.  If effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively care court is good for up to one year and at that point if everything's going as planned the individual graduates and  the individual graduates and  they are considered stable and  doing well and hopefully follow  up their treatment. In certain  cases individuals can be  continued on care court for a  second year if they meet certain  criteria but for the most part  people go in for one year. As I  mentioned there'  s accountability  with regard to our  responsibilities and facing  financial sanctions. The court  also as I mentioned attach  someone throughout the process  with the respondent to have  someone to help them navigate  through the care court process  and if the respondent does not  participate in the court process  the court can choose to dismiss  them from care court. Here'  s the challenge for some  people is we'  ll wait this is court  order mental health treatment  and the person doesn'  t comply why  are you going to dismiss them?  Because care court is considered  a voluntary service. Failure to  complete care court however or  to participate can lead to a  referral by the court or the  appropriate entity to a  conservatorship hearing which is  a much higher priority for the  necessarily a standard where the  individual would have someone  assigned to make decisions for  them and choose where they live  and what kind of treatment  medication they take. It'  s not a guarantee that  failure to care court means you  get conserved you still have to  meet a high bar to be conserved.  The challenge for people is care  court is completely voluntary  counties in which there have  been a lot of interest in care  court what'  s we'  re finding is care  court in cohort one not a lot of  counties have actually had  people go into the care court  proceedings for three reasons.  One is they don'  t meet criteria  because their diagnosis. Two is  the individual finds out they'  re being referred to care court  and they disappear. Three is the  best scenario they voluntarily  accept services and say I will  go to behavioral health and get  treatment. The reason I'  m bringing care  court to you is this is  something the governor is  pushing very hard on cities and  counties and wants to see. It'  s the first step out of three  towards addressing mental  illness. Step two is senate bill  43 which starts in January 2026  which redefines grave disability  to include serious addiction  issues and untreated medical  issues that can cause serious  harm and the revision of mental  health services act to the  behavioral health services act  which also begins in 2026 and  has a significant impact on  the health care system. The  second is the !  What can we do for you?  nothing as far as care court  we have our team put together we  expect to hit the ground running  in december. I guess the only  thing would be if you know  someone who you believe is  schizophrenic and not getting  treatment there'  s a lot of  people in our community you can  make the referral for care court  or you can reach out to behavioral  health and we can go out and  assess them to potentially see if  they qualify. We already have  the rest team which is homeless  outreach team we have the coat  team we have a number of teams  that go out in the community now  so we have a pretty good idea of  who we think would be  potentially qualifying. Cohort  one counties a lot of them  didn'  t have the  equivalent of rest team so they  were starting from scratch doing  homeless outreach so I think we'  re in a better place than  cohort one to some degree we  know the players but if you know  anyone who could benefit by all  means let us know.  all right.  this is a great development by  the way are the judges mental  health professionals or are they  judge judges?  there'  s one judge judge  benson part of care court he'  s familiar with mental health  issues and intimately aware of  what the court process is and  believes in the collaborative  nature of care court and  understands the mental health  issues.  your answer my first question  was I was wondering how it went  in cohort one and if the system  was overwhelmed but it sounds  like that definitely was not the  issue there so I was worried  about us being able to handle  the how many come in the second  is other than giving  presentations at council and  things like this how is the  county getting the word out there  that this is now available?  we'  ve got information on our  website I'  ve done the board of  supervisors presentation earlier  in the month I'  ll be doing orville city  council presentation I'  ve reached out to paradise and  gridley about presenting we have  also talked to the media action  news has covered us channel seven  news we'  ll be talking to anyone  who'  s interested in knowing  more about it and we'  ll be doing some advertising  about care court as well.  yes as far as your first question  goes I'  transportation people braced for  a huge onslaught of referrals and  while there might have been a  lot of petitions as I mentioned  some were inappropriate and the  actual people that ended up in  care court were very few.  We don'  t anticipate a lot of  people at least in butte county  that will qualify because we'  ve combed through the  streets and we'  ve engaged  many people and there'  re still people out there  untreated who don'  t want care but the  unfortunate piece of care court  is there'  s a lot of people  transportation process but it'  s another mechanism we can try  to get people into care and if  they feel that it'  s another  potential reason we can go down  the  conservatorship route if we have  to.  thank you very much for your  time we appreciate it.  thank you.  since we have already done the  consent agenda we will move now  to public comments.  So members of the public may  address the council at this  time on any matter not already  listed on the agenda and within  the jurisdiction's authority the  council cannot take any action at  this meeting on request made under  this section of the agenda.  How many speakers?  we have nine.  nine?  three minutes.  okay.  and I'  m going to call the first  two names and if you could go  ahead and line up in the middle  aisle that would be great.  our first speaker is barbara  botaut followed by vic sabaro and  I know I probably didn'  t say that correct.  I think I  pronounced her name wrong.  that would be great.  right in the center.  that'  s great.  go ahead barbara and come up.  You'  re the first speaker.  You might want to pull the  microphone a little closer to  your mouth.  there you go.  okay.  first I want to thank the  mayor and the council members  for their time and for listening  to my plea that I have.  This is regarding the property  that I own at 374 east 23rd  Street.  on the suggestion of the planning department,  particularly Tina Wilson, who is an associate planner,  and Mike Solley, who is the principal planner.  I am reaching an age where I need to sell this.  This has been a rental property for us for many, many years now.  And I listed with a very competent and experienced real estate company.  They found a buyer for me in August,  and there was a pre-approved, pre-qualified buyer coming in.  And once they tried to get a loan on this property,  it was denied by them.  They were underwriters.  And then they moved on to the government,  the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans,  and that was also denied.  The reason for the denial was not due to them necessarily,  but to the fact that this is Zone CS,  which is commercial services.  Underwriters will not lend to this property  because of the zoning issue.  The zoning issue,  is for four houses in my immediate area  on either side of me and the one behind me.  The one straight across the street from me  is zoned residential,  as all the rest of the houses, to my knowledge,  are also zoned residential.  And that is getting the loans today  have really changed from what they were.  So as a result, I also had been told  that there is another buyer that I need to sell.  but they will not submit their request for the property  until they know what the zoning issue is going to be.  So I have some of the specific municipal codes  that the planning department has given me.  And as a result of that, I see I have a timer.  And as a result of that, that'  s why I'  m here today.  And hopefully that the council can listen  and understand and appreciate this zoning.  Perhaps it was an error.  The house was built in 1920.  So it'  s over 100 years old.  And so is the neighborhood.  So...  that'  s time, ma'am.  thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  Well, thank you very much for your time.  May I need copies of the map showing the property?  You can leave it with the clerk, yes.  Okay, thank you.  All right, next speaker.  Thank you, Vic, followed by Michael Dinsmore.  So go ahead, Vic.  Thank you.  Hello, again.  My name is Vic Zabarbaro.  And I appreciate the opportunity to address  safety on our streets, specifically Sheridan Avenue,  Palmetto, and other sites.  I would like to acknowledge the people at home  aren't going to be able to hear you speak.  I apologize.  If you like where you stood, hand it over to you.  You woke up to where you were.  Hand it over to your mouth.  I would first like to acknowledge Addison Winslow  and two of his supporters for being proactive  and instrumental.  Please note that many neighbors and residents  that I have spoken to  have a high respect for Addison.  Addison reached out to me  the following day  two weeks ago  through an email  from this meeting  and sent me a large document  about 25 pages  that I have read through.  However, the document was from 2008.  And this is 2024,  16 years later.  And many safety issues have come about since then.  How did I come to get here  and speak?  I was volunteering at Butte Humane Society  last year  and a little dog, Mimi, chose me to adopt her.  And I did not realize  at the time that this little dog  had a special mission in life.  I take her for three to four walks  every single day for a couple miles  through nearby neighborhoods  which brought to my attention  the safety factors that need to be addressed.  Speeding, rolling through stop signs,  motorists on cell phones,  and the need for surveillance cameras  at these heavy, traveled streets.  I have noticed  this past one and one half weeks  that certain wire strips  with counters  are now on Palmetto and Sheridan  and have  on both sides of Palmetto.  I appreciate this,  which is a step in the right direction.  Sheridan Avenue still needs  speed bumps and white stripes  going down on both sides  of Palmetto all the way through.  Another issue  that I came about this past week  were the potholes that need to be addressed  on all of these streets nearby.  This has been brought to my attention  by numerous, numerous neighbors  throughout a lot of side streets, folks.  There are at least 26 potholes  on one portion  from Palmetto  to East 1st Avenue  on Sheridan Avenue.  I know because I have counted them.  And it was interesting  a neighbor  on Sheridan Avenue  will fix the potholes  if the potholes  are not on the other side.  I know that  the City Council  would like to donate  10 to 20 bags of black asphalt  because right now  just filling them intermittently  they come apart.  That's just a band-aid on it.  That's a plus in the right direction.  It was also brought to my attention  from nearby residents  that how did Stillson Canyon Road  get paid  when so many other thoroughfares are on the side.  that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  Thank you.  Next speaker, please.  Next speaker is Michael Dinsmore  followed by Nick Allison.  Is this okay?  Good evening.  My name is Michael Dinsmore  and I am a resident and renter  here in Chico.  I'm a husband and father  to an almost two-year-old daughter  with another baby on the way as we speak.  and act on our internally displaced neighbors  aka homeless people.  When we discuss solutions such as building new housing  we must ask ourselves  for whom are we building this housing?  This is not merely a supply and demand issue  It is fundamentally an issue of affordability.  Without properly identifying  the root causes of any given problem  we cannot hope to resolve it effectively.  Building more housing that remains  out of reach for most people  does not solve the issue  As of January 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that over 650,000 people were internally displaced across the United States.  And California continues to have the highest numbers in the nation and also has the highest rate of unsheltered individuals,  which means a significant portion of our population is living in places not meant for habitation, such as streets or abandoned buildings.  We must also consider broader social implications.  For instance, if both parents have to work full-time or even multiple jobs just to afford rent, utilities, and groceries, who is taking care of the children?  Too many kids are being raised without supervision because the adults in their lives are working overtime just to make ends meet.  And these families don't earn enough to save or invest in their futures because most are only paid enough to cover rent and substandard groceries,  leading to chronic stress and other long-term health issues.  First, we can collaborate with California.  We can help developers to create housing that is truly affordable for low- to moderate-income residents.  Second, we can reevaluate zoning laws to allow for alternative housing options like tiny homes, accessory dwelling units, and cooperative housing, which can provide more affordable choices.  And finally, we can advocate for fair wages that allow residents to afford housing without sacrificing their families' well-being.  All people deserve access to safe, affordable housing and a quality standard of living.  Addressing this issue is not just a moral issue.  It is a moral imperative, but also essential for the economic and social well-being of our community.  There is no community that can thrive when so many are struggling.  Our current crisis is a manifestation of a society lacking in justice.  We can and must do the right thing.  Thank you very much for your time.  Thank you.  Nick Allison, followed by Katie Posey.  Folks, we don't clap or boo in this chamber.  That way we do not.  And we don't make out.  We don't make out.  Thank you.  So it's Nick Allison, followed by Katie Posey.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I'm Nick Gouledge, member of the council.  My name is Nick Allison.  I'm here.  I'm a resident in Chico, and I work as a real estate agent.  I'm actually here to provide some amplifying information on what Ms. Boutot came to talk about today.  And it's about, it also speaks to what the last speaker was discussing as well, and it's about affordable housing.  So the media.  The median household income here in Chico is about $90,000.  Based on today's mortgage interest rates, that puts a cap at about $300,000 for affordability.  So about half the people living in Chico can only afford a house up to $300,000.  As of this afternoon, there are only five homes on the market available to purchase under $300,000.  One of those homes is the property that Ms. Boutot was talking about.  And that means that that home cannot obtain financing.  It's removing 20% of the affordable inventory from the housing market.  And a lot of these things are way outside of our control, some of the macroeconomic things.  But when we're seeing situations where arbitrary zoning regulations and unnecessary red tape are denying affordable housing,  I think that's well within the capabilities of this council.  We're going to have to see if we can get the council to take action on that.  That's all.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Katie Posey followed by Mike Johnson.  Good evening, council.  Thank you for your consistent support of our police department and our public works department.  I wanted to highlight these two due to their role in fulfilling the charge you supported  in the January Holocaust Remembrance Day proclamation.  To stand against anti-Semitism in our city.  As we know, anti-Semitism isn't just a Jewish problem, it's a whole society problem.  First, the public works department plays an important role in responding quickly to calls about graffiti in the city.  We've seen some vandalism in graffiti with anti-Semitic messages, and these are often not about advocating for Palestinians,  but attacking Jews anonymously.  Our public works department responding so efficiently is a valuable thing for our community.  Second, thank you to the police department.  For providing support to the Jewish community when there is need to be vigilant about potential attacks or threats.  I'm thankful our city council is supportive of a police department that can protect its Jewish citizens.  According to a 2023 report, 46% of American Jews say they alter their behavior out of fear of anti-Semitism.  Jews are the largest target of all religiously motivated hate crimes, though they make up just 2.4% of the U.S. population.  Yet the majority do not support anti-Semitism.  One reason for that is that they believe nothing will change, or it is not serious enough.  This is why law enforcement is encouraged to engage with the Jewish community and encourage reporting.  Also on the topic of public safety, I'd like to thank the council for voting to support Prop 36 and reforming Prop 47.  As Councilmember Bennett stated at that meeting, there were unintended consequences to Prop 47.  Despite the positive attention, analysis and evidence point to many negative outcomes of that.  The recent election was a great opportunity for the council to work together.  The election saw 70% of voters in California and a majority in San Francisco back Prop 36.  Public safety and rising costs are two areas of concern for many residents of Chico.  You're probably aware that since 2008, electricity rates in the state have increased 3.2 times faster than the national average, far outpacing inflation.  One explanation could be the soaring costs of misguided and poorly conceived climate policies delivered to us by Sacramento's politicians over the past two decades.  One analysis is that the government has been very careful about the impact of climate change on the state.  The last analysis I read argued that there's a reluctance to raise electricity rates further due to the already high costs imposed by renewable mandates.  That has led to underinvestment in critical infrastructure.  This analysis argued that the state's climate policies have driven up costs, stifled economic growth, and hurt the most vulnerable populations.  These areas of concern may explain the shift towards the center that we saw in the state in the last election.  So Prop 36 was supported.  But Prop 32 and Prop 47 were not.  Prop 33 was supported.  57% of Californians think the state is headed in the wrong direction, up from 37% in 2020.  Just something to keep in mind going forward.  Thank you, City Council.  I can't say my last sentence.  Good evening.  Thank you.  Mike Johnson followed by David Welch.  Good evening, Mr. Mayor and Council members.  Thank you for having me out tonight.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that we have nearly 1,000,000 people living in the state.  Even with all of our partner organizations across town combined, we have nothing close to the number of available shelter beds needed to address this.  We've got many hundreds of people on the streets tonight, even as the first winter storm of the season is blowing through.  And we all know this is just the first of many such storms that we'll be seeing in the coming months.  Within the past few weeks, the local group Safe Space Winter Shelter was able to secure a prospective site for its noble efforts to provide a cold weather lifeline to our homeless citizens.  Unfortunately, the site that they located will require a conditional use permit that is both the future and the future of the city.  The cost of this is a cost that's going to be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.  Even worse, regrettably, some of our citizens and community leaders have chosen to outright mock or deride Safe Space for somehow not having resolved this matter sooner.  People were claiming the process itself is the most important factor of all.  Charitable organizations like Safe Space Winter Shelter are at the mercy of the charitable donations of money and facilities that they receive and when they receive them.  The fact that this facility was only recently made available to them is not the fault of either Safe Space nor of those that are on the streets tonight.  People at Safe Space are so desperate to get back into the city.  trying to save from injury or death. They're working with what they have.  Bureaucracy is important. Due process is important. But such matters will be no comfort  to hundreds of citizens and residents of Chico who are at risk of injury or death as the winter  months begin. Nor will humanitarian disaster that is entirely preventable be of much comfort to the  community as a whole for what it would say about what kind of people we are here in Chico.  Folks, there is simply no time for blame, judgment, or inaction here. Lives are on the line,  right now, and people may well live or die based upon what you do or don't do here,  what the city does. The city needs to find a way to clear out the red tape, to expedite this process  for safe space with all speed, and to reduce or eliminate the cost of the conditional use permit.  That is simply the right thing to do. For those that believe in a higher power,  most faiths around the world command their followers and their leaders to act in matters  of faith, hope, and charity. Your action or inaction in the days and weeks ahead may well  be the difference between life or death for many on our streets. I would implore  the city of Chico to act in matters of faith, hope, and charity. Your action or inaction in the  city and our elected leaders on the council to keep this in mind, to show compassion now to those  desperately in need, and especially so in the light of public and potentially divine judgment  upon all of us, upon the decisions before you, and frankly, upon the city of Chico. Thank you.  Thank you. David Welch, followed by Charles Withoon.  Good evening. I think most anyone who operates a business in the part of downtown affected by them  would tell us that the parking lot is not safe. I think most anyone who operates a business in the  part of downtown affected by them would tell us that the parking lot is not safe. I think most  kiosks have been damaging to their business. That's not news to anybody. But something has come up  recently that I think adds an element of urgency to that, and that is the announcement that  Recreational Equipment Incorporated, REI, will be opening a store in South Chico shortly. That's  going to be formidable competition for a whole swath of downtown businesses, most especially  mountain sports, but also fleet feet and several bike shops. These are businesses that have been  here a long time. Some of them were here when I came to the city of Chico. I think most anyone who  has been here 45 years ago. And they're really kind of anchor businesses in downtown. I believe  that those businesses with their local knowledge, their customer base, their customer service, can  compete successfully with REI if they're competing on a level playing field. But as long as those  parking kiosks remain in place, it's not a level playing field. And if those parking kiosks remain,  some of those businesses will be gone.  We're going to have to wait and see how long that will go on within the next couple of years. I think we can just about guarantee that.  And I gather that there's a plan to offer free parking in the downtown for a short period between Thanksgiving and Christmas for the shopping season. If you can do it for that long, you can do it permanently and should.  I've had the opportunity in the last couple of years to visit quite a number of medium-sized cities, kind of somewhat comparable to Chico, both in terms of the  podem effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  the complexity of these kiosks that so many people personally I don't find them difficult to navigate  But an amazing number of people I know tell me they don't go downtown anymore  Specifically because of those kiosks and I think that's something that this council needs to take seriously or downtown is going to continue  To deteriorate. Thank you. Thank you Charles with whom followed by Chico resident number one  Staff council, thank you very much for your time today  I'm going to turn it over to the mayor of Enloe  Research has shown that many programs actually can save the city money  Safe space gets people into shelter during the worst part of the weather worst part of the year  This lightens the load on Enloe's emergency room  It lightens the load on our  Police department if you look at the documents I sent you  You will see Cal Policy Labs research  People in a shelter  Interact with police 1 tenth as much as people not in a shelter  People in a shelter go to the hospital half as often as  People not in a shelter  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively Look at San Rafael They wanted to start a homeless program they did it with an administrative order this council  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively tonight can  effectively  effectively  effectively  the use permit tomorrow to be able to operate  and to get some people off the street a little bit sooner.  That would save taxpayer money.  We are in a deadly and yet preventable shelter crisis.  We have recorded over 67 deaths in recent history  that is unprecedented and it appears to be accelerating.  And in front of this remarkable storm  that we shall see starting tomorrow,  we need all the shelter going on we can get.  It would save us money.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you.  Chico resident number one is our last speaker.  I couldn't agree more with what Charles just said.  It's embarrassing that it has to be explained.  Today I want to address  the number one concern that we have  is the limitations and censorship  that I've been seeing the council members.  This council tape, there's lots of videos online  and I can watch those and I see time and time again  people being censored.  Statements like we don't single out individual council members  that we don't criticize council members.  And to me, to not accept criticism,  even not as a council member,  but just as an individual that seeks to want personal growth.  To be a better person.  And to have a constituent,  somebody that you represent,  come up to you  and try to offer their criticism.  It's designed to help you govern better.  To engage in an interactive process  where you're listening to the people  that you're supposed to represent.  And the sheet has,  you can't say any profanity,  anything boyish,  anything that would discause order.  Those,  the power that the mayor has,  those are usually for,  to govern how you guys act.  It's to prevent cross talk,  it's to prevent people arguing,  and it's to like encourage like a flow of a meeting  to make sure there's no disruptions.  But if somebody wants to use profanity,  like that is their first amendment right.  The only time,  the only thing that limits your first amendment right,  your freedom of speech is if it invokes violence.  Right?  And unless somebody is physically threatening you,  you should listen to what they have to say.  They shouldn't be,  they shouldn't be censored.  And just because you don't like what they have to say.  So that's all I have on that topic.  Moving on to like policing.  It would be nice to see a community policing effort.  And it is not like,  before you give a cop a gun,  he could walk a beat for 30 days,  for 90 days in his local community  to get to know his local community,  to be invested in it,  and to learn how to solve problems  before you give him a gun.  It would just,  it floors me that that's not taken into consideration.  You can't just arrest the problem away.  And now we have another council member  that was a police chief,  somebody who's,  I have no,  I have known nothing about,  but I can imagine a police chief,  every problem that he's ever had in his professional life,  is that it's been,  it's been solved,  like it's been solved punitively or with violence.  There's not like a compassion or an understanding,  it's his way or the highway.  You take that into consideration with the city's,  written or not policy of just carte blanche,  like giving a blank check to the police department,  it's a recipe for disaster.  Community policing.  Thank you.  He was our last speaker.  All right.  Let me ask a question.  I'm going to ask a question of the clerk,  Mr. Mayor.  Absolutely.  Go ahead.  Why is anybody allowed to speak  that doesn't put their name down on the speaker card?  The speaker card specifically asks for people's names.  That is actually,  that is correct.  We do have speaker cards in the back.  However,  the Brown Act prohibits the council from demanding  that they include their name.  So it is a courtesy.  So we can log in who said what,  but it's not a requirement.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Yeah. Previous years,  you actually had to write, you know,  You had to write your,  not only your full name,  but your address as well,  before you were able to speak at almost every city  and county in the nation.  Well, it has since gone away.  All right.  Item 5.1 is consideration and approval of amendments  to the fiscal year 24-25,  public works engineering, department,  salary and staffing tables.  And we have a report from public works director, yes,  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem  podem !  podem  podem  podem  the budget process but given the nature of the request we're coming here mid-cycle as it relates  to construction staffing so trying to get approval so we can go through the recruitment process and  have those staff if approved on board ready for the 2025 construction season so some highlights  of the request just highlighting that 2024 is one of our largest construction years  in our history here at the City of Chico over 82 and a half million dollars in contracts and  managing that through both in-house staff and contract services this request does not require  any additional budgeting the positions associated with this request are already budgeted in our  capital projects future year CIPs 2025 2026 and 2027 are shaping up to be just as big of years  in terms of the numbers of projects  if not bigger and then our staffing cleanup there's a couple elements associated with this  request that are some cleanup items from the previous or the current budget year and then  lastly the the second request part of the item tonight is a side letter for a UPEC to make  adjustments to the salary schedule for the engineering career ladder progression there  was some gaps in it so what we're doing is requesting changes to that  salary schedule so that there's consistency and continuity from the progresssion from effectively  an entry level engineer to a senior engineer position.  So for context the Engineering Department is comprised of multiple divisions most  Most notably, we're going to be focusing on the construction division, the one-third from the left.  It's a little hard to see, but in the top left there, you see the existing organizational structure within our construction division.  Currently, there are six in-house staff members and approximately 14 other contract staff positions.  There's 14 projects that have contracted staff that report directly through our senior civil engineer in construction.  On the bottom right is essentially what we're requesting, the two positions there in yellow,  so we can have a better span of control for our senior civil engineer  and properly manage the significant output of capital projects anticipated in the future years.  From a fiscal standpoint,  as mentioned, we've awarded over $82.5 million in contracts already this year alone, this calendar year.  For context, that's more than twice the budget of our second highest department, the police department, their entire budget.  We're doing that with 38 staff currently.  Technically, we actually only have about 32 in-house hired.  We're looking to better balance that.  How we make that difference up, again, is we significantly,  significantly rely on contract services to make up that difference.  So on the top pie chart there, you can see $26.2 million essentially is actual charges to date for our construction capital.  That's contractor costs.  The $7.4 million is our design costs, and just under $2.7 million is the construction management costs associated with our projects.  The pie chart on the bottom left breaks it down.  A little bit further.  So essentially of that $2.7 million in construction management costs,  you can see there over 2.3 million of that is associated with consultants and  roughly just over 300,000 is our in-house staff salary and benefit costs.  On the bottom right there, further kind of clarifying  the percentage of  construction management costs to actual construction capital.  So just over $26 million.  And effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively  effectively [inaudible]  effectively  I believe this is b1.  There are some cleanups we'  re deleting two positions one  is a public information officer  and one is a right of way agent  we don'  t have a need for that in the  engineering department that was  a previous staffing plan we'  re requesting elimination of  those two positions and cleaning  that up by having adding one  associate planner that is already  hired and then the addition of  the two associate engineer  positions.  Appendix b3 is where you see the  engineering track to pay  adjustments so again we'  re trying to better align from  the entry level of an engineering  aid progressing through essentially  associate engineer and aligning  that better with the industry but  also the engineering department  Again continuity from  classification to classification  there'  s no gaps there.  That completes my presentation I'  m available for any questions.  questions?  no questions.  speakers?  none.  entertain a motion.  move to approve.  councilmember morgan.  they motioned at the same time.  councilmember bennet.  yes.  councilmember morgan.  yes.  councilmember tandon.  yes.  councilmember van overbeck.  yes.  councilmember winslow.  yes.  vice mayor reynolds.  aye.  mayor coledge.  aye.  carries 7-0.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Mr. Brennan.  So you will be receiving  a lot of money from the  fire victims trust fund,  correct?  Correct.  I'm focused on district 3,  so the funds in district 3  for the fuel reduction program  will continue.  Those funds are still intact.  Oh, correct.  Yes.  That was part of the budget  approval process,  and we're moving forward  with those completely separate  items.  Focused on that.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Anyone else?  I have a couple.  What was the additional  prorated share?  It was the 4% share.  That was recently paid?  1.4 million.  Plus, I think we already had  a fund balance.  I want to say 1.9.  Yes.  Okay.  I received an email on this  from a constituent.  I can't say they were  necessarily wrong, too.  It's hard for me to go,  look, we have these funds  that came in from the  obviously the campfire,  and then we're using them  on something that's not  necessarily  part fire recovery efforts.  We're using them on a separate  fire, which may in fact be  reimbursed at a later date.  What are our chances of having  some of these costs reimbursed  at a later date?  I mean, through FEMA or  anything?  Well, fire engine, zero.  Yeah, obviously not the fire  engine.  Yeah, we don't know.  We don't have any reason to  believe we'll be able to recover  tree removal costs.  Okay.  Even though they were damaged in  the fire?  Yeah.  I mean, if we do, that will be  a while.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess the only thing  is because we originally  designated a lot of those funds  for road improvement because  that was the impact of those.  And I think we even created a  budget policy to make sure we  did that.  Yes.  Well, primarily what the  purpose of the budget policy  was to very carefully clarify  that we were not using it for  things that we had already been  reimbursed for.  Right.  Because we were trying to avoid  So we decided to  reimbursed for any two funding  sources.  Disavow our ability to collect  or invalidate our reason for  getting the money because we got  paid for the same loss twice.  So that was the purpose of that  budget policy was to clarify  that that wasn't happening.  Yeah, makes sense.  All right.  How many speakers?  We have one.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. Dayton Road Council said it was none of it's out of their jurisdiction not the business well school students go there Council said it was none of it's out of their jurisdiction not the business well school students go there Go to Chico schools and Chico fire comes out to where I live  fire comes out to where I live.  They come out there more and more as my neighbors get older and older.  And they're building new homes.  It's about the cost of the fire engine.  Mr. Gofferson saw me after  he was keynote speaker at the retired  Butte County employees CalPERS meetings out there.  Elks Lodge.  Where five years I tried to get the retired employees  to stand up for the firefighters and the kids.  And the president of the group was an ex-fire marshal, Chico.  I'm not here to drop names or anything.  But five months after I came here,  the county supervisors overrode the agricultural setback for spraying.  So why?  While the state moved it from 300 feet to 400 feet,  Butte County moved it from 300 feet to 25 feet.  Literally making our public right-of-ways  the most toxic part of the county.  The firemen are getting paid.  They just passed Proposition H  for all this money to go to the county firefighters.  I know I can't make you guys,  all of a sudden,  respect your neighbors or your children or your family.  But you can be physically responsible,  physically, whatever you want to call it.  Thank you.  All right.  Further discussion, entertain motion.  Move to approve.  Motion from Council Member Van Overbeek.  A second from Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk, when you're ready.  Turn my mic on.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Council Member Van Overbeek.  Yes.  Council Member Winslow.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  No.  Okay.  Carries 6-1.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Item 5.3, Internal Affairs Committee Recommendation,  Massage Disestablishments.  I have a report from Council Member Van Overbeek,  Chair of the Interior.  The Attorney General's Affairs Committee.  Mr. Van Overbeek.  So, Councilperson Tandon brought forth this item.  And this is about regulating massage establishments.  So, I called the police chief and asked him if we had a problem.  And he said we did not.  But I am persuaded by the argument that without having a licensing process for the masseuses,  it makes it too easy for young  women to fall into this into  non-legitimate massage activities.  What the internal affairs committee  recommends is that council direct  staff to create an ordinance  following the california massage  therapy council guidelines which  basically requires the masseuses  to be  licensed and  we  approve that  3-0  in internal affairs.  questions for mr. van overbeck  or any committee members?  what are the hour requirements  again?  i forget.  the hour requirements?  in terms of the training?  no in terms of what hours?  operating hours?  yes.  i think charlene has been doing  some on our code enforcement  director has been doing ongoing  classes on this for about a year  now i think.  so the direction we had talked  about was having her bring  forward a tentative agreement  work with our city attorney have  them review it for legality and  then it would come back to council.  i think the one that was a sample  we looked at was around 9 o'clock  maybe 10 o'clock something like that.  further questions?  it was a little ambiguous as far  as what we were requesting because  we had an ordnance that was an  example from somewhere in southern  california that was really intensive  had all kinds of specific regulations  on there and we heard that there  can be even more intensive  regulations but what i understood  we were going forward with is just  requiring that practitioners within  the city of chico have this certification  which means they need to go through  this training but also the california massage therapy council has some  guidance in making sure that the  people who are practicing or the people  that have the license and some things that are  some protections against issues  like human trafficking we've heard of in other communities  not necessarily adopting an ordnance  that's going to have all kinds of  stringent regulations on these businesses.  i agree.  because the california  massage therapy council already does  all of that so once code  enforcement goes in and says let me see your  license and they don't have it then it gives  code enforcement just a clean path so it takes  a lot of the work out of our hands  by them adhering to those regulations.  how many speakers?  all right.  i can say i don't know mark maybe  you remember better than i do i think  we actually breached this issue on  council or sean 2015 or 14?  i think we did but i don't recall  the outcome but i think what the  primary objective or the primary  recommendation here is that we create  an ordnance that requires that  the public is able to get the  permission to use it.  i think we need to  make sure that we have a  state license.  yeah.  makes sense.  all right.  so entertain a motion.  move to approve.  second.  all right.  we have a motion from vice mayor  reynolds.  do you want to give her the motion?  take your motion.  council member winslow.  vice mayor reynolds.  mayor coolidge.  carry 7-0.  all right.  item 5.4 internal affairs committee  recommendation on occupied buildings  and once again a report from  councilman van overbach chair of the  internal affairs committee where we  have sent a lot of things your way  lately.  so around the beginning of the  year we revised the code as it  related to vacant buildings and i felt  so we discussed it in internal  affairs and what we agreed to  was a tightening of the code and  this is section i don'  t have it in front of me but  it'  s in 19.  that specifies window openings  need to have windows and doors  and the roof needs to be in good  it was the opinion of charlene  durkin who runs code enforcement  there was no downside for her and  although she didn' t feel we  needed it i would like to see it  there so there'  s no ambiguity if we have  future situations like we had  downtown with landlords who  simply don' t care about their  buildings.  any speakers?  we have one.  greg scott.  i was going to say he'  s getting up out of his chair.  welcome mr.  scott.  thank you council and mr.  mayor.  this is coming from not as my  position as dcb president or  vice president this is as a  building owner and business owner  in downtown.  i came to chico in 2006.  there were buildings with tarps on  the windows.  i left and moved to boston for 10  years and came back with boards on  the windows and now there'  s nothing on the windows.  it'  s time to stop with the carrot  and get the stick.  code enforcement has the ability  it needs to happen we need to  clean this place up.  absentee building owners that  just board up out to the edge of  the sidewalk and paint murals and  graffiti magnets basically that  needs to stop we need to get it  fixed and i need to fix it tonight.  thank you.  so minister van overbeek do you  think this fixes that problem?  i think it gives the code  enforcement a tool and it removes  any ambiguity about what the  standards are that are  appropriate and what the  standards are.  for buildings downtown.  and that was the intent of it.  yeah.  absolutely.  is this just for the buildings  downtown or buildings all over the  city?  all over the city.  but the real problem i believe  is downtown.  that'  s what precipitated it.  and we'  re looking at a  couple sentences that can be  hashed up sees no downside I  don'  t see much effect to it  either I think we really want to  be addressing this issue should  be looking at other strategies  like vacancy taxes haven'  t really  entered the conversation at  this time but no problem with  it.  anyone else?  I would just say whatever  stick we can add I'  m more  than happy to get it.  it'  s another stick in the bundle.  entertain a motion.  I'  ll move to approve.  second.  we'  ll give it to Mr.  Winslow.  councilmember van overbeck with  the motion.  councilmember bennett.  yes.  councilmember morgan.  yes.  councilmember tandon.  yes.  councilmember van overbeck.  yes.  councilmember winslow.  yes.  vice mayor reynolds.  aye.  mayor coolidge.  aye.  carries 7-0.  all right.  item 5.5 was tabled.  item 5.6 councilmember van  overbeck requests amendment to  cmc 19.44-010.  so 19.44.010 deals with the  it is not required to put  offices on the ground floor in  downtown north unless there'  s been  prior use.  let me ask a question to the  city attorney john.  I own a building at 300 main  which is in downtown north but  it had previously been used as  office on the ground floor.  so I presume I'  m okay to proceed with  this because it doesn'  t impact me.  you.  you'  re treated  differently because your  property is grandfathered in  with respect to that use?  thank you.  I had a conversation with one  of the commercial real estate  people and also with greg scott  and his capacity as president  of the dcba and he said gee we'  ve got these vacant buildings  downtown and yes retail would be  a better use because it  generates more traffic but after  ten years we all know the  problems that retail have it'  s better to have an office  occupant than no occupant at  all so I would like to amend the  code to remove the need for a  use permit to put an office on  the ground floor in downtown  north.  all right and just downtown  north?  just downtown north.  all right further questions?  I would like to pitch it to  our community development  director and I will mention I  had a conversation with a  person who owns a building in a  shop downtown she had some  concern that the loss of  especially what she described as  anchor spots from ever having a  restaurant or retail that would  significantly affect the foot  traffic and it can in the long  run change the character of  downtown there.  Currently I will mention also  it'  s a conditional use permit  which would require a plan  commission meeting larger fees  while we can just downgrade it  to administrative use permit  that staff can still have some  they can still exercise some  discretion over which use permit  which areas are allowed to  transition offices.  Mr. Veague if you would comment  your thoughts.  I see the request is to have  a good internal affairs and I  think there could be a good  discussion it'  s intentional  that it'  s a use permit the  downtown north is supposed to be  our entertainment active zone  you want to have in downtown'  s active uses.  If there was a slip to have a  whole bunch of office uses in  would be a good idea. I don'  t think that would be a great  idea personally. Then again  tom has made some good points  council member ben overbeck has  made some good points about  having some storefronts that  aren'  t filling up we'  ve made some  concessions in the past for  things like the dcba and chamber  of commerce because they'  re active like a  visitor center. Wonderful was  also something where we made a  determination that'  s 24-7 it'  s not just your basic  office use there'  s a lot of activity  bringing people downtown it'  s a lot of overlapping  turnovers so we'  ve worked  within those constraints to make  determinations that certain  office uses are appropriate.  Other things to think about  that this group is always  talking about are parking do you  want people coming down and  office workers taking up the  parking downtown. I guess my  point is there are things to  think about and it'  s reasonable to have  this conversation for the  internal affairs to bring  something back to the council  that could then be a good  conversation. I think it'  s a good conversation to have  with the downtown alcoholic  beverage establishments by the  time it gets back to council  there might be more input from  more downtown business owners  about their beliefs. I think  it'  s a good  conversation to have.  just to clarify I'  m correct right now it'  s a conditional use  permit not an administrative  use permit when you said the  determinations were made with  the dcba was that through a  planning commission vote?  no I can do a zoning  planning director interpretation  depending on unique  circumstances again it wasn'  I think it was a decision  there was peer office again  there was visitor center so it  met a different criteria.  do we have any speakers?  we do we have one  greg scott.  I could have guessed.  got the hat on this time or  not?  no again not as the dcba  president.  real estate realtors and while  I agree with anika we don'  t want to create a just  office center downtown I would  tell you that we have 70 plus  bars and eateries and coffee  shops in downtown most of them  located in the north we have  lots of retail downtown we have  lots of service. It'  s imperative that we fill the  vacancies. I don' t believe there  are enough vacancies to facilitate  a change to make downtown look  like for example anybody has been  to midland texas it'  s all downtown it'  s all offices. I don' t think we  have enough vacancies to do that  we do have enough vacancies to  create a problem that if you  watch channel 12 or 7 and read  the e.r. we have a blight of  vacancies in downtown which I  sincerely believe.  t disagree with that. I  believe the answer is to get  vibrant downtown businesses the  people that work in offices are  going to eat downtown and shop  downtown they can park in the  lots where ten hour parking is  dirt cheap and it makes sense  trying to minimize office space  space downtown runs  counterproductive I believe in  trying to fill those vacancies  and we do sell merchandise at  the dcb office. thank you.  thank you. Further  discussion?  I have some thoughts I wanted  to share. I had the same  thoughts you had.  I think the thing helping our  downtown is mostly the  university increasing enrollment  and adding 800 students over  last year has certainly helped  our downtown this year I think  that'  s been a big impact as  they continue to grow our  downtown will continue to thrive  and they'  ve always had a  symbiotic relationship I think  that'  s equally important I'  m not against discussing the  department but in a limited  fashion of course our  development department using  their noggin when it comes to  this thing like wonderful was or  wonderful I should say was a  good use of that space it made  sense but I think it'  s unique to the  situation.  I entertain a motion  unless anyone else has any  thoughts.  move to approve.  second.  I would make a substitute motion  that rather than removing  entirely the use permit  requirement we would downgrade  it to administrative use  permit.  all we'  re talking about is  referring it to internal affairs.  is that actually?  yes.  looking at it.  return it and then you can  make that argument there.  down.  thank you.  we will move to a motion  we will wipe out the  substitute motion.  substitute.  got it.  move forward with the  original motion.  okay.  when you'  re ready.  all right.  council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  council member tandon.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor reynolds.  aye.  mayor coolidge.  aye.  carries 7-0.  all right.  we will move to a motion  we will move on to item 5.7.  that'  s my request for the  formation of a coalition of  governments.  it was actually the last item  in my state of the city  address.  I think it'  s well worth the  discussion as we move into the  next council.  north state governments  basically want to create a  coalition of the largest  municipalities in the north  state.  chico, orville, red bluff,  marysville, yuba city, redding  all the corresponding counties  in a joint powers agreement.  the purpose would be to use this  voice to lobby for increased  funding, grant funding.  it might be for fire protection  resources.  it might be for road  improvements.  road improvements to highway 99  interstate 5, airport surfaces,  water and power resources, etc.  really just having that jpa to  do that.  bcag has been very successful in  terms of getting the highway 70  project approved and moving  forward through their grant  process.  they obviously have other duties  in terms of running our bus line  and things along those lines.  sacog to our south which is the  sacramento area council of  governments has been hugely  successful almost to the  detriment of anyone beyond them  in the north state.  their success has sometimes been  to our detriment.  this is really not necessarily  to fight back against them but  to move forward with securing  some grant funding and getting  some of the attention to the  issues that are important to the  north state.  the idea would be to have the  organization be called the north  state council of governments to  just entertain city staff going  out and finding some additional  information and seeing what would  be involved in establishing  something like this.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  that was my proposal.  questions?  I have a question.  city staff has a full plate so  who on the city staff that was  maybe a question for the city  manager if we approve this who  on the city staff would you task  with there'  s so many unanswered  questions but at least  formulating the questions so we  can have a better discussion.  I don'  t know offhand but at this  point it says bring back an  analysis and a plan to facilitate  the creation of the organization  so that would be the first step.  I suppose part of that would be  feasibility.  what good is a jpa if nobody  joins?  because clearly membership means  cost share.  I think we would have to reach  out to other jurisdictions to see  what the level of interest was.  keeping in mind these people are  also our competitors for grant  money so that'  s another issue we  would need to think through.  I suppose but I think the vision  is more trying to get attention  for the rural north state  government agencies at least  that'  s what I think the intent is.  two of the projects that stick  out in my mind is highway 99  north the red bluff it'  s an issue for citizens in red  bluff and the red bluff is  the red bluff is a  the red bluff everybody in  between as well as citizens in  chico has been absolutely  ignored.  it'  s a very dangerous highway  similarly highway 32 out to i-5  something through glen county  that should have been done years  ago probably before highway 70  was in my opinion.  getting us connected to i-5 has  a lot of benefits but also has a  lot of potential for the city  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  anyway so that was the idea.  is this something we would  have the city staff come back  with or would you push it to  internal affairs?  no I would think city staff  could come back in terms of  analysis see if there'  s any interest from  other cities and it could be  done relatively low with very  minimal impact.  there'  s obviously ways you can step  through this but at some point in  time yes would it cost money  absolutely would the benefit  outshine that I believe so.  similar to b cag obviously we  get more bang for our buck from  b cag than we get putting into  it.  so essentially we'  re asking to get an analysis  from staff to bring it back to  tell us whether this is  something worth doing or not  which isn'  t something that should take  hours and hours and hours I don'  t think.  maybe several hours but not  weeks and months.  not weeks and months.  so do we have any speakers?  I just want to throw out a  little bit of logic on this  sorry if you want to run through  it.  because I agree with the need  for this and one of the reasons  I see primarily what we'  re missing here is in  relation to public transit.  so each individual we have b cag  that runs our public transit.  the only reason you can get to  orland by bus is because glen  county runs the bus in.  and you have this in other  counties where you can get from  portola to quincy to you can get  a bus to chester.  you can even a couple times a  week one will go to reno susan  ville and reno from there.  but we don'  t have that kind of service out  here.  we have a gap from taking local  transit to sacramento from seven  miles from gridley to live oak.  but nobody operates that bus.  we have this north state super  region transit working group  that exists but it does not  include yuba and sutter county.  and the primary reason is that  they are in sacog and they have  and they see themselves more  southern looking.  we also are we are petitioning  for a rail project to come up  here which passes through  marysville.  there are a lot of things like  that where they are kind of our  gateway into the metropolitan  rail system of sacramento.  but we don'  t have any kind of formalized  coordination with yuba and  sutter county.  i think this is an opportunity  for us to try to bring them in  so they can be one foot in sacog  and one foot in with us.  and i think we need that in  order to have the best  coordination to make these  projects happen.  well and the thought of  including them is i think that  is a great thing.  because obviously with  reading chico has a great  relationship with reading but  by including the yuba and sutter  area too we have a lot of our  businesses that operate in both  areas.  and it'  s certainly something that  makes sense.  one other thing reading has  a great bus system.  the rabba is really good.  they are also planning a bus to  sacramento which would bypass  chico on the i-5 which sounds  kind of silly us being the  largest population center but i  also think this is partly a  result of the lack of  coordination that happens between  these areas.  i think that'  s a great thing.  i'm just questioning your use  of the i-5 versus 5.  my parents are from southern  california.  there you go.  okay.  just wondering.  all right.  sorry.  sorry.  so we have a motion and a  second.  council member bennett.  yes.  council member morgan.  yes.  council member tandon.  yes.  council member van overbeck.  yes.  council member winslow.  yes.  vice mayor reynolds.  aye.  mayor coolidge.  aye.  council member mcconnell.  carries 7-0.  all right.  items added after the posting  of the agenda we have none.  reports and communications  following reports and  communications items are  provided for the council's  information.  no action can be taken on items  under this section of the  agenda unless council agrees to  include it on a subsequent  agenda.  city manager's report.  mr.  sorensen.  just one update.  just as we'  re about to get a bit of a  demonstration on how the burn  scar is going to respond to  some precipitation.  in january we'  ll have butte  county public works director  josh pack come and provide an  update on the various efforts  that are going on right now with  not only winter flood  preparations but the longer term  vision to correct the issues at  five-mile and et cetera.  so something to look forward to.  all right.  thank you very much.  item 6.2 annual rebudget  fiscal year and reports  confirming supplemental  appropriations were attached to  this agenda.  item 6.3 council member requests  the following reports and  communication items are provided  for the council's information.  no action can be taken on these  items under this section of the  agenda unless council agrees to  include it on a subsequent agenda.  to my left?  no?  am i right?  i have one.  debbie'  s looking at me like you'  re crazy.  you'  re going to be gone.  i didn'  t look at you.  i think it'  s important.  okay.  well listen to what i have to  say and then you can vote no  against the motion.  m going to vote against safe  routes to school for children.  so actually i think this is an  issue that'  s long overdue.  i really felt it was necessary  to bring it up before i left  this dais.  so there is certain  consternation in the community  and obviously some issues that  we'  ve faced in our community  about safe routes to school.  improvements are being made but  i think more needs to be done to  have a communication between the  city and the school district as  well as all our child care  the charter schools and smaller  schools as well as the butte  college in chico state. We'  done that but never done it in  a fashion that'  s unified completely with the  council getting information as  well. That would be the agenda  item. If you want to vote  against it Mr. Morgan.  that'  s a motion.  I'  ll go ahead and second that  seeing how my son was hit by  somebody driving running a red  light today and didn'  t even stop to help him after he  got hit by a car. Sure I'  ll do anything for safety in our  community.  Council member Bennett.  Yes.  Council member Morgan.  Yes.  Council member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  We will see you back here  Wednesday December 4 at 5 p.m.  or 5 30.  Madam clerk 5 or 5 30?  6.  6.  Regular agenda at 6 which will  be the switchamaroo.  Thank you everyone.  Thank you.
