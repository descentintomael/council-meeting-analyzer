 All right, welcome everybody to the April 19, 2022, regular city council meeting.  We will call the meeting to order and we will start with an invocation from police chaplain Bud Shavin.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome. . . .   .  Council Member Bennett. Here. Council Member Brown. Here. Council Member Morgan. Here. Council  Member O'Brien. Here. Council Member Tandon. Here. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Here. Mayor Coolidge.  Present. Speaker card announcement. Anyone wishing to address the council on any items listed on the  agenda should first complete a speaker card which can be found at the back of the chamber  on the wall there and once completed please turn your card into the city clerk located up here to  my left to your right. Speakers are taken in the order the cards are received. Additional cards  will not be accepted once the first speaker is called. And I'd like to ask council to move item  5.1 regarding the contract for interim city manager up to be heard first if everybody's  comfortable with that. It's because it makes a little more sense and we can do a speaker card  announcement again. So and this might not be the proper time but since we're moving stuff on the  agenda around and I can bring this up later as well.  This is your call. I would move to table item 5.3 on the classification study.  This didn't leave closed session with questions answered. The person responsible for it isn't here  nor is that person scheduled to do the report. I think Ms. McCarthy would do a fine job but  I'm not sure this belongs here yet because in closed session I remember my questions weren't  all answered. I know the classification study is going to be done in a few minutes. I'm not sure  what the classification needs to be done. I'm acutely aware of what's going on in the city but I think  this is probably not the best timing. I'd like a third set of eyes on it whether that be Mr. Hahn  or someone else. So I'm asking that we table that discussion. All right. Thoughts? I'm good on both.  Move up and table. Mr. Hahn, have you seen that or had time to review it?  Very briefly.  If it's the will of the council, I'd be happy to take a look at it and try and get it back to the  council as soon as possible because it is important that we get these classifications done. But if  that's a desire of the council, absolutely we'll get it back as soon as possible.  All right. I feel likewise. I think everybody shares that we want to move forward as soon as  we can on that aspect. I think the point's well noted. So we'll go ahead and table that and then  move on to item 5.3.  Okay.  And we'll go ahead and put in a card now. We'll still give you a few minutes as we start speakers here because we're taking it out of order.  Okay.  And do we have any speakers on this item?  We do not.  Oh, okay. Anyone want to speak on this particular item? All right. So will the council?  So actually it would be Vince. Vince needs to read.  Oh, we need a report. Sure. Sorry.  I'm stepping on your toes there. Go ahead.  Not a problem. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. This is the agenda item 5.1, confirmation of Paul Hahn as the interim city manager.  Pursuant to the authority as set forth in section 605 of the city charter, the council shall have the power and authority to appoint a city manager.  At a special closed session meeting held on Wednesday, April 13th, 2022, the council voted unanimously to appoint Paul Hahn,  effective April 18th, 2022, as the interim city manager with the proposed agreement to be finalized at this meeting.  The city council is being presented with the employment agreement for the hiring of Paul Hahn to serve as the at-will interim city manager.  In compliance with government code section 54953C3, the city attorney shall first orally report a summary of the recommendation for final action related to the interim city manager agreement as follows.  The city council is proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Paul Hahn as interim city manager.  And the city council is proposing to appoint Paul Hahn with an annual base salary of $207,500.  Paul Hahn is a retiree of PERS and will thus not be enrolled in PERS nor have any PERS retirement benefits deducted from his salary or made on his behalf by the city.  Mr. Hahn.  Mr. Hahn hereby waives all benefits provided to city employees, including retirement contributions, health, medical, vision, dental insurance, life and disability insurance, sick leave, vacation, and similar benefits.  It is my recommendation that the city council confirm the appointment of Paul Hahn as interim city manager and authorize the mayor to sign the agreement.  That concludes my report.  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Yan.  Will the council?  Move to approve.  Second.  Second.  Motion from Council Member Morgan.  A second from Council Member Tandon.  Madam Clerk.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  We'll move on to...  And I just want to thank you for your faith in me.  And I want to thank Matt for the last couple of days.  He's been great.  Debbie and Vince have been wonderful.  But just thank you.  And I'll be here for as long as you need me.  I appreciate you joining the team.  Thanks so much.  All right.  We'll move on to the consent agenda.  All matters listed under the consent agenda are to consider routine nature and act in one motion.  Do we have any abstentions or no votes?  All right.  We have one speaker for consent.  Okay.  And that's Ed Mayer.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. . . . . . . .  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Council Member Morgan. Okay. Council Member Brown. Excuse me. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council  Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon.  Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. And Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carry 7-0. All right. Business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter not already listed on the  agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the mayor based  upon the number of speakers. The councilman cannot take any action at this meeting on a request  major under this section of the agenda. How many speakers? We have nine speakers. All right. Three  minutes. And if I can, I'll call two names. And if you're the second name being called, please go  ahead and step to the middle aisle. Our first speaker is Jeff Creed, followed by Nicole Nava.  Well, I was going to say something totally mean and scathing, but I decided not to.  Uh, I'll wait a couple of weeks and see what happens. But, you know, the issue that was brought  up a couple of meetings ago and carried on to the last meeting, you know, you want civility and you  want professionalism and you want cooperation. But I was going back watching meetings and, you know,  one of the first meetings I really spoke at was over in the other building. And I did a lot of  research, weeks and weeks of research before I came and took the time to interrupt your  busy meeting to offer some advice.  And the only comment back was, good timing.  So did they hear me when I spoke?  I don't know, but they were impressed that I finished right at three minutes.  And the second time I spoke, or the next time I spoke after that, I was standing here.  And ironically enough, I was talking about homelessness and the lack of a plan.  You know, back then, the whole whack-a-mole was the plan, right?  And everything I said came true.  That was, I think, 2016, 2018.  And nobody was really paying attention.  I watched one council member on the video sitting in the corner, and I don't think he  looked up once.  And he's still sitting up there, not in the corner.  But my point is, you get what you ask for, and I've said this a few times, right?  So when you're the mayor, and you're sitting up there grazing like it's, you know, you're  playing D&D in your mom's basement, that doesn't instill confidence in people.  That doesn't instill the idea of professionalism, that this is a professional meeting to be  taken seriously.  If you want people to take you seriously, you need to act seriously, and you need to  perform.  You know, speak thoughtful or don't speak at all.  A lot of times it's better not to speak at all, right?  I mean, just listen to me.  You know, I'd do 10 times better if I just didn't speak.  But, you know, I just wanted to kind of touch on that because, you know, my time in Chico  is short.  Not short enough, but it's short.  And you're going to look at a whole list of people that came up here and berated you for  years, and you're going to add me to that list, and we're all going to be gone.  And you're still going to be here in Chico.  There's still going to be a torn face.  There's still going to be a flag flying in front of this building like it was in 2016  when I mentioned it.  And your legacy is being created right now.  You have the opportunity to do things differently, not try and do what was done better, because  what was done was bad.  Do things differently.  Set a new standard for yourself.  Dive in deeper to these issues.  And when people stand here and offer their time and their research and their expertise,  pay attention and vet what they're saying.  Look forward to a positive future.  NICOLE NABBA, FOLLOWED BY JULIE THREAT.  NICOLE NABBA, GOOD EVENING.  SO, TONIGHT IS THE NABBA NEWS EDITION, NEXT EDITION.  SO I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE FOLLOWING CRIMES ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY TRANSIENCE IN THE SINCE  THE PAST TIME I WAS HERE.  WE HAD THE TRAIN TRUSSELL FIRE.  WE HAD THE NORTH AVENUE BRIDGE FIRE.  THE FIRST FIRE WAS IN FRANCE.  caused millions of dollars in damages for Union Pacific due to the negligence of Comanche Creek  transants having an illegal fire float sparks onto the nearby trestle, and it likely cost our city  thousands of dollars in staff and equipment time. The second fire at the North Avenue Bridge caused  damage to the heavily trafficked bridge and was located next to a massive amount of student  housing and was within very close proximity to a fuel station. Once again, the city has narrowly  avoided a massive loss of life due to the negligence of uncaring transants who are allowed  to languish in our parks and waterways and other public spaces. While Legal Services of Northern  California, LSNC, still continues to reject the proposed pallet-side shelter rules preventing the  of the homeless population for what will equate to 354 beds. Someone needs to get on this.  On my street alone, three doors down, they had a prowler...  and thank you to CPD who made an arrest and of course that transient had an active warrant.  Around the corner within a day or two of that one, we had another transient who occupied property  without consent right around. We are all on high alert after two stabbings that I reported before  on our street. We had a major commercial burglary on Myers again, which is across from Comanche,  and other arrests where the address made it clear it was Comanche Creek or adjacent.  On my street, two doors down, we had two surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus  surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus  surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus  surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus  surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus  surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus surplus  surplus  surplus  surplus  surplus  street to use the restroom in the city plaza and was so disgusted by what he saw inside of it that  he wishes the fence was back up around there. That's not acceptable. These crimes and many  others committed by transients should have people joining us at our rally to lean on legal services  to approve the pallet site rules and open that facility. The rally is slated for this Thursday  the 21st at 4 30 at their site. If it rains we will post the rescheduled information on Save  Our Chico and One Chico on Facebook but truly the goal is get people in the shelter where the  services are, get this community safe, stop the fires. If anybody looked under what happened at  that bridge they should be horrified. It was terrifying the amount of debris under there.  Thank you. Julie Threatt followed by Paul Hare. Hi everyone. I had emergency eye surgery two weeks  ago so I wasn't going to be here but this particular issue got me so outraged.  I got an Uber and I came down here. So and I'm an advocate for the vaccine injured which I'm one of  and I'm an advocate. This is my hill. The children being vaccinated in this county outrageous. So I'm  here to alert everyone this Friday at our own Chico Marketplace Mall. Butte County is rolling out  their vaccination clinic to the mall on Friday when they're having a Disney movie night. Disney  movie night, family movie night, Encanto character and our vaccine clinic. I raised this with Butte  County.  I called the board of public health and the board of supervisors two weeks ago. I'm getting nowhere. I called the mall. The general manager, she doesn't want this. They don't want it there any more than we do. This is too emotional. That marketplace is supposed to be a family friendly place in this community. People where kids can go and not see vaccine all over a van. It's outrageous that we're allowing this to happen. I don't care what your position is. It's outrageous. You can call. It's within those board of supervisors. I don't know why they don't just cancel it. They have it within their right and within their  rights.  no  contract  with  the  mall.  There's  no  law  that  is  rejecting  it.  And  it's  not  lost  on  me  that  our  health  and  human  services  secretary  Bacera  was  in here  on  March  14th  with  a billion  dollars  in  a  war  chest  over  there  locked  in  a  private  session  with  pediatric  t  ric  t  t  t  t  t  t  t  t  supervisors. We don't know what was said, but all of a sudden now I've got a vaccine clinic  at the mall. This is wrong. It's outrageous. Keep it at the medical facilities. We've got  millions of them around. It's not like they can't get their shot somewhere else. Keep it away from  the mall. I implore you guys, go talk to somebody. Go call somebody. Call the mall. Call Danette York.  Call your supervisors. Tell them to just cancel the clinic. We need vaccine-free zones where any  child in this city is. The library. They're going to have one in the library next month.  Keep the kids away from the vaccine. Cancel that clinic. Thank you.  Paul Hare, followed by Alicia Triter.  I'm Paul Hare. I was here last week. I've got a neighbor who doesn't go out anymore.  I asked him why he doesn't go out anymore. It's because Chico's not safe and all he can do is  laugh. I talked to the other elderly.  Most of them don't go out anymore unless they have a car. They don't go here to Chico.  They go to Waterville. They'll go up on the mountain.  They go all the way to Redding. I don't go to the river.  They don't do anything here in Chico because it's not safe. They all say the same thing.  Thanks for making Chico not safe.  We appreciate it. People who live here, the elderly.  The ones that don't have cars, they've got to stay here.  We thank you for that.  You know, you put the tents out there because you said you didn't have a place for homeless.  You did have.  The places down there were half full and stuff.  But you decided, well, tents are a great thing.  Then you got the garbage. You wouldn't pick it up.  You go for phony photo shoots, Brown, with your buddies.  They don't ever pick a bit of that garbage up.  So I walked behind you and took pictures of the garbage.  Put it up on Facebook and you know it.  Now, the garbage is still out there.  Nobody's doing anything.  California state law. It says no littering.  $1,000, $15,000 fines.  That's not the most of the things that you say are called ordinances.  You know, your judge said, well, you can't do ordinances.  It's not an ordinance. It's a state law.  When are you going to enforce it, officer?  When are you going to enforce state law here in Chico?  What the taxpayers have paid for throughout the state of California?  That's not harassing these people and their tents.  But I'll tell you, some of these people out there have been in those tents for over four years before you guys even decided to do it.  They don't pay electricity.  They don't pay gas.  They don't pay rent.  They don't even pay food because these organizations are walking food around to them all.  That means they're banking their social security checks.  They're banking their SSI checks.  They're having the money they get from state welfare.  You shouldn't have to spend your money on it.  Some of them got $40,000 in that damn bank.  But yet you don't have them ready.  Wake up.  You got a shelter place down there.  You can't even open it.  You built all these things.  You can't even open it.  And you probably never will.  And I said that last Christmas that you probably never will.  Thank you.  Alicia Triter followed by Katie Posey.  I've noticed a glaring deviation between what the people of Chico say they want of you and the actions that you actually take.  There are numerous instances in which the people of Chico comment here in the meetings, just like we've heard tonight, and write to you in regards to issues either for or against something.  And you repeatedly ignore them and vote in the opposite direction.  Against the will of the people.  Against your own community and constituents.  I urge everyone in the room to continue to speak up in these meetings.  Write emails to the city council members.  Write letters to the editor.  And comment on the Engage Chico website.  Because all of that is public information.  And we are creating a gold mine of evidence showing how out of touch our council members are with what the people of Chico want.  Thank you.  This public data proves that the current council members do not listen to us.  They do not care about what we want for our community.  And I look forward to using that data against you in the future.  Thank you.  Katie Posey followed by Jessica Giannola.  Good evening, council members.  Recently the city sent out a survey.  Asking for input about which issues Chico residents think are most important.  And residents were also offered the opportunity to share additional comments.  I actually happened to speak with someone over the weekend.  And we were talking about the survey.  He expressed that he was pleasantly surprised to receive this due to this concept of being asked by the city.  About his input on areas where his tax dollars could potentially be spent.  We talked about the importance of elected officials taking time to connect with the people and talk to them.  He felt that this had happened in the past but it wasn't happening as much anymore on multiple levels.  He wasn't just talking about local levels.  But this reminded me of something I had suggested a while back.  That idea of a kind of coffee with the council member.  I think that's one way that people who don't go to city council meetings could potentially connect with and catch the vision and goals of council members.  Which would be a good thing.  This person had also mentioned an experience in the past with the previous mayor.  Where the mayor had been very unkind to him and spoken very disrespectfully.  He wondered why an elected official would treat a member of the community like that and had been very affected by it.  So we talked about this idea that any elected official should treat all people with honor and dignity.  Regardless of their level of income or position in society.  So I wanted to encourage you with that.  And thank you for the opportunities you have taken.  When you've been connected with and engaged people on a personal level in the city.  I know there have been a lot of challenging issues and sometimes that's difficult to do.  But I wanted to encourage you to keep doing that when you can.  Because it means a lot to the people and their impact by that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola followed by Mike Trollander.  Council.  When I first moved to Chico over a six month period.  16 years ago.  The plaza provided me with my first impression.  I felt a magical feeling of kindness and community that seemed unique.  There were many trees back then as this was before the city gave the plaza a facelift.  Including the fountains that many of our kids enjoyed playing in when it was first installed.  I moved here for school and I stayed for my family.  Chico seemed like a kind community full of nature with trees everywhere and bike paths galore to enjoy.  Then as the years went by.  I looked deeper beneath the surface to see an ugliness that grew.  Social media groups familiar today that objected to crime and homelessness were just forming.  I too worried over safety and was confused over rising rates of folks lining sidewalks.  My idea of answers to what's happening and what could be done to help them differs from some in our community.  While some like myself advocate for tangible help for those in need.  Others advocate for exclusionary actions.  Denial of responsibility and access to resources and desires the majority here seem to support.  The plaza has become representative of the abuses of power and that same exclusionary mentality that reflects the decisions made here each month.  It remains fenced off for most of us under false pretenses of repairs.  In order to sidestep litigation allowances for the closing of public spaces and restrooms.  It's fenced off as a symbol of ultimate power.  Simply because you can.  Just as this council has prolonged the allowance of other issues like cannabis that voters voted in to approve.  Other controversial issues that you may support or another side of the partisan line may support.  Those are supported because you voted in friends that would help pass those things along.  Recently we've seen the maps that are diluting partisan power.  And votes to favor one.  And we've seen outright denial of recall substantial efforts to recall efforts.  The talk has go on but the sentiment remains the same.  Our city remains divided and politics have turned ugly and more divisive than ever.  The heart of our city, the plaza remains closed off as a show of power and denies entry to people of our city.  Another round of elections are before us.  And I hope that what's left of our hope.  Is to vote that we see fairness and justice.  That allow for new representation and not the grab for more control.  And ultimate rule over the lives of our community members we see happening in Butte County.  We see more effort put into unity and respect and love.  Thank you.  Thank you Jessica.  Mike Trollander followed by Patrick Newman.  Thank you Mayor Coolidge.  Management and staff.  My name is Mike Trollander, citizen.  I'm here to came down today to thank you for the not holding on the idea of the ice skating rink.  We needed it.  We were in COVID prison for a couple of years.  It would have been easy to back up on that.  But thank you so much for doing something that many of us for 15, 17 years.  And trying to get done.  It was ugly to have a fence around it.  But we know the reason for the fence around it.  Was because the political activists cloaked as advocates.  Would have positioned the homeless around it to snuff it out.  And it's too bad the fence continues today.  And I don't know why.  But I do know that why the fence was there for the skating rink.  I'm hoping by next year.  The skating rink survives without a fence around it.  So my second item is regarding Paul who came to do some work for the city on a homeless strategy.  The one thing he left us with.  And there hasn't been any dialogue on this.  But the one thing he left us with was the idea that some of us have been asking for two or three years.  And that is a task force.  A committee.  A working group.  Put together by the city.  To work on our homeless issues.  That informs you.  That puts the people who want to fight with each other at the table.  Over the goal of what to do.  That can still be done.  I understand that we're in the middle of having a strategy related to the settlement.  But that's only the settlement strategy.  That's not the strategy of the city.  It's the idea of the homelessness in Chico.  Which is really tied to the homelessness in Dukes County.  Which really needs to be one system of shelter.  One idea.  One program.  Between all of the cities and all of the counties.  We can start that conversation.  With a group like that.  But we can't start that conversation without your help.  And so instead of bitching you today about everything that I think is going wrong.  I'm asking you to consider that idea.  So there you go.  Thank you.  Okay.  And our last speaker is Patrick Newman.  Thanks for another three minutes.  As I've said here a million times.  When you have hundreds of thousands more people.  Than you have affordable homes.  The current situation in the United States.  Maybe somewhere between 500,000 and a million.  You are going to have people in your public spaces.  You can either approach this humanely and reasonably.  Or you can demonize them.  And you can turn them into scapegoats.  And we hear this every time.  We conflate crime with homelessness.  We conflate crime with a certain kind of poverty.  And we keep beating that drum.  It's no longer cool to have people in your home.  We have to conflate crime with being black.  Or being an American Indian.  Or being Chinese.  Or being LGBTQ.  Or any of the other groups that have been persecuted in the city.  Going back to the fact that we lynched my new Indians downtown.  We burned Chinatown.  These things are all in our history.  And what we're doing with this homeless population right now.  That goes back to the past.  We're doing it again.  And it's that same voice.  And we're talking again about a national problem.  On a local level.  People who aren't housed.  People who do not have the services they need.  A 40 year failure.  So I stand there Saturday morning like an idiot.  From 10 to 12.  Protesting the existence of that fence.  I look across and there's big articles about the fact that we're going to gild a dome downtown.  We've hired somebody to put gold gilt on a dome.  I stand in a place.  Surrounded by a fence.  It costs money to keep there.  Says it's a rent-a-fence.  We talk about somebody who complains comes over from the post office to use the toilets.  Ah, they're offended.  They're not clean.  What about the four months?  And then three weeks and three weeks before that.  Where those toilets and the only drinking water within a mile was fenced off from people who need it the most.  What kind of violence is that?  It doesn't seem like people are, generally speaking, very willing to look at.  The hurt.  It's caused from the point of view of people.  Who feel this the most.  And that's not me.  With my house.  I know where those trestles are.  I walk there all the time.  I went by when that bridge fire happened.  I don't know who caused them.  They weren't catastrophes.  The city wasn't going to burn down.  We've got people living in our public spaces.  They're hurting.  They're suffering.  Try to look at it from their point of view.  Try to get to know them better.  So that instead of it being an abstraction, they're actual human beings that you're watching die.  And then think about the 40 year history that got us here.  And the fact that now we have a moment where we can either be humane or we can keep this crap going.  And we can keep demonizing people and we can keep making policy on that basis.  Take that fence down.  Thank you.  He was our last speaker.  All right.  Thank you.  And we'll move on to item 4.1, which is a hearing to consider the 2022-23 draft annual action plan for the use of federal community development grant, which you will hear referred to as CDBG funds.  And home investment partnership also referred to as home funds.  And I believe Alonzo will take this topic.  Point of order.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're up.  Okay.  Good evening, mayor, vice mayor, and council members.  I'm Mary Jo Alonzo, the housing specialist for the city.  And I'm before you tonight to present the draft 2022-2023 annual plan.  And this is a public hearing as required for use of our federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which we refer to as HUD.  Chico is an entitlement community, a CDBG entitlement community, and a home participating jurisdiction whereby our funds are annually allocated by a formula based upon a number of demographic and socioeconomic factors.  The funds assist the city in addressing the needs of low-income households and neighborhoods in our community.  I would like to clarify that these funds cannot be used as funding gaps for road rehabilitation or repavement projects.  As noted earlier this week in an article.  Later in my presentation, I will review what eligible activities are for both sources of these fundings.  Every five years, a consolidated plan is developed with broad goals to be achieved over the subsequent five years.  The city's priority needs that were identified in the 2020-2024 plan include affordable housing, homelessness prevention, homeless services, and housing.  Neighborhood revitalization and economic development.  The draft annual plan represents the third year of the current consolidated plan.  The expected resources are not final amounts due to the delay in receiving the final allocation from HUD.  Staff used last year's baseline for CDBG funding and estimated a 7% increase in funding for home.  The total amount of estimated funds are $1,000.  The funding boxes are shown on the screen before you and included an attachment seed to the staff report, which starts on page 60 in your packet.  If funding is above or below the assumptions that staff put forward, staff will adjust the funding to prioritize the 1297 Park Avenue Rental Development Project and Habitat Wisconsin activities.  The administration activity budgets will be adjusted per the allowed caps for each of these funding sources.  Next slide, please.  So the draft annual plan was based on projects and activities and goals that are both in the city's consolidated plan and the city's housing element, which satisfies state priorities.  As detailed in the draft proposed budget, a lion's share of the CDBG and home funding is going towards affordable housing projects, two of which are located on city-owned land and have been in the pipeline in development for several years.  The city has a vested interest in continuing the funding for these projects and activities.  Starting on page 33 of your PDF document, staff outlines the projects that are proposed to be funded for next fiscal year.  Also included are the descriptions of each project, the goal that they are tied to with the consolidated plan, and the estimated number of individuals who will benefit from the proposed activities.  Proposed home funding.  The proposed funds have limited uses and our eligible activities include the tenant-based rental assistance program, construction of rental housing, such as Creekside Place and 1297 Park Avenue, assistance with the development of homeowner units with Habitat for Humanity, and grant administration.  Proposed CDBG activities are as follows.  CDBG has a broader overall range of eligible activities.  The proposed funds are not only for residential activities, but have somewhat restricted housing uses.  Staff's recommendations for this grant are also in accordance with the priorities identified during the city's update to its consolidated plan and the city's housing element.  Utilizing CDBG funds, the draft plan includes funding for housing programs and projects, which includes sewer connections to homeowner units in Chico, site and off-site improvements for Habitat for Humanity on Wisconsin Street,  and the multifamily.  Survey Survey . . . .       .    . . . . . . . . . .   .  .  Survey  Survey  Survey  Survey  Survey  Survey  Survey  Survey  Survey  Survey  Survey  The last plan activity for CDBG funding is public services.  These funding recommendations come from the ad hoc citizens committee whose members are selected by the city's finance committee.  Last month, the citizens advisory committee met to listen to the applicant presentations, then met again to review and rate and rank the public service applications.  The committee came to a unified consensus for funding the top five rated applications.  Those recommendations are detailed on page 64 in your packet, which is actually the very last page of the PDF document, the staff report.  Outreach, the public on the annual plan, has been made through notices in the paper, posting information and dates on the city's website, through community meetings that were held earlier this year, and starting with tonight's public meeting.  The...  Uh...  Draft annual plan is available to review on the city's housing element website, or...  Sorry, not the housing element.  The city's housing website.  There's a link there to the draft document.  We welcome comments.  The easiest way to provide us comments is through this email.  If not, all of our information is on there, and you can call staff, or you can send in written comments as well.  The plan is available for review and comment for...  Uh...  30 days.  And it's actually been available for the past couple weeks on our website.  And we are scheduled for another public hearing where you'll consider the final plan.  So at the conclusion of my presentation, the community development director recommends council schedule a final hearing on the annual plan for May 17th.  And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.  Thank you.  Thank you for the report.  Just a couple of questions.  The code enforcement spending of $120,000, which I know we do almost every year.  I just have a couple questions about it.  Can you explain how an estimated 730 households will benefit from identifying issues required to upgrade housing in neighborhoods as quoted from the report?  Yeah, so the data that we get from code enforcement, we...  Um...  It's extrapolated at the end of the year of all the reports that they've made on substandard housing issues.  And so that data, um...  We look at, and we look at the low-income census tracts, and so we filter out.  And that's what comes up with those 730 addresses, um...  Which we equate to households.  So there...  Um...  Thank you for that, uh...  Context.  There's no funding for supporting improvements to address these, um...  These issues earmarked in the funding, correct?  It's just...  It's just for staff time to address, uh...  To enforce?  Yeah, to...  To enforce and to assist homeowners with maybe needs that they have.  Um...  And it's...  It's focused on, you know, fixing up the blight in the area.  What kind of issue...  Uh...  Issues have we historically responded to using this funding and where?  Um...  That would be a good question for code enforcement.  I'm not exactly sure.  Um...  Maybe Marie might know more detail.  Yeah.  There's...  I'm Marie Demers, housing manager.  Um...  Yeah, there's a variety of different, um...  Issues that come up.  They can be, um...  Accumulation of debris in the yards.  It can be, um...  Things in...  Actually, public right-of-way would be different.  Um...  Vehicles.  Vehicles.  Abandoned vehicles.  Uh...  It could be substandard housing situations.  It could be, um...  Landlords that may be not, um...  Taking care of...  Health and safety issues for their tenants.  Those...  Those issues are addressed.  Um...  Boy.  There's...  There's quite a variety of things.  Um...  But that's...  Those are kind of the primary ones.  Okay.  Thank you for the summary.  That's all my questions.  Sure.  Vice Mayor.  Um...  You stated that 2020 to 2024 goals.  Can you tell us how, just for everybody's benefit,  how those goals were founded and created and who set those goals?  Sure.  Um...  The, uh...  So there was a citizen participation plan.  And so I know that there were several public meetings, um...  Before the plan was in place.  And so they held those at different, um...  Low-income housing sites through town.  Um...  And so we invited...  You just put out information.  You invite citizens.  And they come up with those priorities.  The city, um...  Had a consultant that helped kind of lead the discussions  and asked about what the needs were,  what the wants were.  Um...  And then...  So all of that information is in...  Goes into the document along with a lot of the data that we collect  for the different census tracts.  Great.  Thank you.  And on the Citizens Advisory Committee,  how many people serve on that?  Uh, we had seven members serve on that.  Seven members.  And they spent at least a couple of meetings,  if I'm not mistaken, digging through and...  Yeah, they were great.  They, um...  They volunteered their time.  And so we have kind of an introduction meeting with them.  And then, uh, they meet twice.  First, they...  We have, um, the public service grantees,  or the applicants present to them.  And so they review those presentations.  And then they get the binder with all of the applications.  And they review all those.  And then we have a rate and rank system that we use.  Um, per HUD regulations,  we need a way of, um, equitably doing that review.  And so they do those.  And then we have a discussion.  And then that information is presented, um,  as part of the annual plan.  Great.  So it sounds like there's a pretty,  um, rigid setup process with scoring.  So as we are looking at these numbers,  it's not just random.  Who's the favorite person or pet project of the time?  There's actual rankings.  And they look at financials and what they've turned in  and their presentation and what they're using the money for  and how far the money's going for each client being served  and all that.  Yes, it's actually very detailed.  And, um, the grant applications are actually available  on our website if anyone wants to look at those.  And in my agenda packet,  I have the minutes.  And I have the minutes from the meeting,  which kind of goes through with the funding,  why they made the funding recommendations that they did.  They were really focusing on providing direct services  to individuals.  And so they were looking at, like,  case management type of services,  um, activities, um, for folks.  And so it's, um, we have a whole scoring rubric that we use.  Great. Thank you.  All right. Any other questions?  All right. Thank you.  Okay. With that, I think we're going to wrap up.  With that, we'll open the public hearing.  And how many speakers do we have on this item?  We have three.  Okay. Three minutes.  And our first speaker is Nicole Nava,  followed by Jessica Giannola.  So I know this is an annual grant thing that happens,  and I've been here when you've done it pretty much every year  for some number of years.  And what I'd like to stress is that I really want us to keep up  the collaboration with Butte County,  and I think it's a perfect opportunity now that we have  Mr. Hahn on board to leverage his expertise in connections.  And I think that will be vital moving forward.  I am a little bit concerned about one element of,  you know, there's funding for the admin of the COC.  So one important element of something they do is being the ones  to help drive the homeless point in time survey that was done on January 1st.  And that was done on January 27th of this year.  We have yet to have the outputs of the counts from that survey,  which will help inform what we really need as far as housing for people  that are on our streets right now.  And I find it really disturbing that this is an app that is used,  and I'm very familiar with the app.  You get the aggregate data.  You get the raw data.  It spits out reports.  There's a lot of potential there.  And it makes one think, are we all working on a narrative of what we're doing?  Are we all talking about what the output,  what those numbers are?  I hope not and I would really like to see that.  Just so you know, if anyone's listening from the COC,  I did submit a message on your Facebook page asking when we can all expect to have  that data, it would be important and to have the summary with the raw data, please.  So that's my piece about the admin.  It's like, well, what's happening with the administration other than just overseeing staff  and standing up programs and seeing people at these meetings that meet with them?  And then there's one more question I have and I think I'm going to pass it over to you,  pieces like the outputs, two of the people being gifted the grant funds are the Jesus Center and  True North. True North is parent of tourist shelter, right? One would hope good entities  doing good things for people who really need it. Jesus Center, to me, turned a corner for the better,  and I think that this will be helpful to them, although, of course, they're getting a huge amount  of money with the pallet shelter not open yet, but that's not on them. I know they're working hard  on the rules and all the other outputs. So here's the thing. Let's talk about the tourist shelter  piece. So we have a shelter, sheltering site on the City of Chico website. It is supposed to have  the data on the vacant beds. I don't understand why this one piece of data is so challenging  for the tourist shelter to produce for the City of Chico so we know how many vacant beds are  available per night. Sometimes I do stop and look at the data, and I'm like, oh, my God,  this is a lot of money. So I'm going to stop and have conversations with homeless individuals  and try to point them to services, and it's really distressing when you're trying to do that  because also they don't always pick up their phone. And so I think that we need to kind of  look at who's getting these money because they need to start working really hard on performance  measurement and outputs. Thank you. Thank you. Jessica Giannola, followed by Patrick Newman.  Considering current financial constraints,  the citizens face now as inflation continues to increase, expenses for everybody, record  highs, people face struggles now that will last years into the future. We have an opportunity  with budgeting like this to help prevent homelessness, prevent homelessness and rehouse those that  are already unhoused by allocating funds to critical areas. Money should be directed not  just to the shelters that we have. But to the areas that are already unhoused. So we  think we'll have to think about how we'll think about how we'll think about how we'll . . .  . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  think about how we'll think  think about how we'll think  think about how we'll think  think  for the people out there that need housing that cannot afford it at this time or may not be able  to afford it in the near future. Funds should be identified for assistance with, I'd say,  even utilities because that becomes a part of it. People need to be able to pay their rent  and utilities to survive, not even including eating food or gas to get to work. So anything  that's going to help people is something that where funds should go to help prevent that homeless  piece. I'd also like to see funding identified for their purchase assistance in the form of  down payment assistance like we used to have in Chico, and that'd be for low-income to mid-income  residents wishing to purchase a home. People should have that opportunity to be able to be  homeowners and not forever just stuck with renting as their only hope and dream. Yes, if they're  housed, that's great, but as a city, we could do more for our people in offering that hope, that  opportunity.  If any of these items are addressed in the designated funds, then great, I support them.  If not, I would like to see them in there. Our focus just needs to really stay on keeping people  housed and preventing more homelessness from occurring, and that's where our funds should  be going. Thank you. Thank you. Patrick Newman is our last speaker.  I just want to talk about grant addiction a little bit here. The city of Chico,  Mr. Hahn, you've inherited a failing infrastructure on a magnificent scale.  Streets, the reason I'm addressing this in terms of grants is because there's an article on the front  page of the paper talking about how some of this grant money might be captured for purposes of  infrastructure, repair, upgrade, maintenance, whatever. Okay, so we've had multiple presentations  here talking about our streets. We've had multiple presentations here talking about our streets,  our storm drains, our sewer systems, our sewer treatment plant, our signaling in this city.  For 10 years, some of us have stood here and said, hey, this city needs a sales tax. Year after year  goes by. Almost every city in California has a 1% sales tax or a 2% sales tax or 3% sales tax,  and the city of Chico, we're talking about leaving behind $200 million, $400 million,  $600 million over 10 years. What do we have? We have a failing infrastructure. So now,  there's this kind of,  thing where we try to capture grants, grants here, the federal government, state government's  going to come through with some kind of community development grant, we're going to grab that.  We're happy to do it.  But we're not happy to step up to the plate and do what almost every other California  city has done, which is to fund, to collect some revenue in their own right so that they  could be fiscally responsible.  So lousy streets, lousy treatment of city employees.  You can drive around and see the catastrophic situation on our streets.  I watched them working with no protection.  I worked on highways a lot.  I know what traffic control looks like.  We've got people out there in lanes of traffic filling with potholes with no traffic control  in this city.  The liability associated with this kind of stuff and just the failure of infrastructure  in general, I'm talking about, again, street signaling, all this other stuff, even sewers,  it all has liability connected with it.  So I'm addressing this question of grants in a little bit different way, and I'm saying  we have failed to be responsible to collect revenue in the city which could have been  collected over the last 10 years, and it's all come home to roost.  Every time somebody gets up here and describes the condition of our pavement, which is worth  $500 million, according to the last expert, the most important asset the city owns, he  basically said that it's absolutely failing.  It's like an F grade.  You can't get out of that hole without spending some money.  You're not going to be able to do it with these grants.  Well, this is late in the game.  But at least we could step up to the plate and unify around a 1% sales tax this coming  fall or whenever the hell it's on the ballot.  So that's the context I put this grant stuff in.  It's a magnificent failure.  Thank you.  MR.  He was our last speaker, yes?  All right.  So we'll close the public hearing, and then we'll counsel.  MR.  Thank you.  Thank you.  MR.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Move to approve.  There's no action on this item.  We don't need an action on this?  Well, no.  Just have the hearing.  Okay.  It's just we're scheduling a public hearing for the annual, the final plan.  Okay.  After the 30-day public comment period.  So there's no action needed.  All right.  Then we will move on to item 4.2, public hearing regarding temporary Humboldt Road closure.  And there he is.  Thank you.  Good evening, Council.  Welcome.  Good evening, Council.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight.  This item 4.2 is just opening the public hearing  and requesting approving the resolution to continue the temporary closure of Old Humboldt Road.  This is the first 18-month extension, and we're allowed eight.  So just you've seen this presentation before.  I just quickly updated some of the slides, and we'll move through this rather quickly.  So, of course, some of the features up there, the historic rock walls built in the 1800s  consistently were being compromised, rock stolen, damaged, and vandalized,  and lots of impacts up there.  There are two of those.  The historic wagon wheel ruts, of course, have quite a bit of significance in the local community.  They were commonly impacted, parked over, and vandalized and spray-painted in the whole nine yards.  And then, of course, nefarious activity.  And then the big component that really impacted Public Works Operations and Maintenance Department  was the illegal dumping that would take place on a weekly basis.  We would have to send crews up there to retrieve this type of debris,  which really, it's obviously something we do,  but it was a pretty big opportunity cost for us, too,  when we were having to go up there and dispatch crews all the way up to Old Humboldt Road.  It was taking us out of the city, if you will,  and causing, again, a significant opportunity cost to travel up there and take care of this type of scenario.  So some of the safety issues that we encountered,  and these statistics were from 2020 when we originally temporarily closed Humboldt Road.  PD averaged about 30 calls for service annually,  ranging from minimal to serious crimes,  and again, big component takes officers out of the city to the far outskirts of city limits.  Chico Fire Rescue was, of course, concerned with ongoing fire danger.  That's ever so common up there.  We had a pretty significant fire in 2008 with Humboldt Fire,  and then multiple grass fires thereafter.  Consistent resource drain on Public Works O&M dealing with illegal dumping.  We averaged about 30 cubic yards annually.  There was a pretty significant volunteer effort that was commonly deployed,  which was to take out about 20 cubic yards of trash.  And they would take out about 20 cubic yards monthly.  So combined, 270 cubic yards of trash removed before the 2020 closure.  The road serves, at this point, no essential service.  There is future development that will take place on Old Humboldt Road  with the Oak Valley development and some others.  So it does need to be a temporary measure because that section of the road will be crucial  and part of the infrastructure.  And that's the infrastructure needed to serve those future developments.  So therefore, the temporary closure was the best path forward  and has been successful utilizing the authority under California Vehicle Code.  And then, of course, the Chico Municipal Code 10.53 that we put in place to do so.  So California Vehicle Code 21101.4 authorizes the local authority to temporary close a road  if one of the two items are not in place.  So the local authority can close the road if one of the two items exist,  A, serious and continual criminal activity in the area,  and then B, serious and continual illegal dumping in the area.  And both of those items were occurring quite frequently in the area of Old Humboldt Road.  So the solution moving forward that gives us, the local authority, the option to close.  And we could close it for eight consecutive 18-month periods.  And after each 18-month period, we have to close the road.  And then we have to come back and confirm that conditions still exist  in order to extend it for another 18-month period.  A little bit of history real quickly.  At the February 4, 2020 meeting, Council adopted the ordinance creating Chapter 5,  excuse me, 10.53 in the Chico Municipal Code that gave Council authority  to temporary close a road pursuant to California Vehicle Code 21104.4.  In June of 2020, Council approved a resolution to temporary close Humboldt Road.  And then on September 10, 2020, Council approved a resolution to temporary close Humboldt Road.  The state government, the county, both the city, us, and the county,  installed locked gates, Forest Service-style gates, on either of our jurisdictional boundaries  to temporarily close the road.  The police chief and myself have determined that conditions still exist  and recommend extending the closure for another 18 months.  Just real quickly, that's where the gate is.  Here is the city jurisdiction and county jurisdiction.  kind of at the high-tension power lines that go north to south.  And you can see city limits here.  And this is the approximate location of the existing gate.  That's the city jurisdiction.  The county's gate is up in this area.  And you can see the proposed future connection from the Oak Valley development.  So we placed the gate just east of that future connection  so we don't have to move the gate once that development takes place  and the connection is made.  So to finalize, the recommendation is council approve or open the public hearing  and then approve the resolution to continue the temporary road closure  of a portion of Humboldt Road pursuant to Chico Municipal Code, Chapter 10.53.  That's it.  Thank you very much.  A question?  A quick question.  Do you foresee any reason that the county would not continue their closure on the other end as well?  Okay.  And have there been any major complaints?  It seems like it's begun.  It's been going fairly well.  It's been going extremely well.  We'll hit that on this side.  Yeah.  We've gotten a lot of feedback from the private property owners  that the vandalism to their private property and illegal dumping has really ceased to take place.  Of course, it's still accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists and equestrians.  So you still see quite a bit of traffic.  I was up there last week just kind of doing a quick inspection of the area.  And I saw a lot of people running and jogging.  I was walking down the road and it was completely clean.  So that was nice to see.  We still deal with some dumping issues on our side of the gate.  We still get that from time to time.  There's been a handful of vandalism issues to the lock itself.  We've kind of put some measures in place to prevent that.  So a few minor issues, but otherwise it's been pretty smooth sailing.  Thank you.  All right.  Other questions?  Thank you very much.  Okay.  So we'll open the public hearing.  How many speakers?  We have four speakers.  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  Three minutes apiece.  Tom Van Overbeck, followed by Kim Knott.  Good evening.  Eric, thank you for a terrific presentation.  You took about half of what I was going to say.  So that gives everybody a break.  So let me describe the section of road a little bit more.  It's the second iteration of the historic Humboldt Road.  The section we're talking about starts east of the intersection with Bruce Road.  Okay.  All right.  So the street starts along Bidwell Street. . . . . .  .  . . . . . .  .  . .  .  .   . . . .  .    . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .  and set the grass on fire.  And one of the fires, I think it was the 08 fire, Steve,  do you know?  Was that when we had all the aerial resources up there?  08.  08.  It had tankers.  Yeah, that was before you were here.  Mr. Van Orbeck, if you could just address the council on that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No worries.  Mr. Mayor, I don't want to get in trouble with the mayor.  Okay.  So I live in the Stillson Canyon neighborhood,  and we have some neighbors here who are here to urge you to support this  resolution and continue to close the road.  The campfire burned on three sides of us,  so we're all very sensitized to the fire issue.  And what we don't need are people camping and lighting fires and dry grass.  Our homes are about a half a mile,  three quarters of a mile south of Old Humboldt Road.  But thank you very much.  And I hope you, I know you'll do the right thing.  Kim Knott, followed by Jessica Giannola.  Well, thank you, council.  I just wanted to thank the previous council that passed this initially.  Casey and Alex and Sean remain from that.  I think it's been a fabulous success in terms of both preservation  and safety.  And a little bit of history right after the campfire in 2018.  We had two fires up there in 2019.  One was set by campers.  One was set by somebody who thought it was a great idea to set up fireworks  on the 4th of July and dry grass.  And since then, there's been nothing.  So I think it's been a real, real success.  And I would hope we can continue with this.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola, followed by Patrick Newman.  Council, I was a little bit confused during the presentation  when there was reference with the road.  I support the closure of the road.  I think that it's something that we should kind of like protect  and maintain as historic and have access for foot traffic, biking,  just another natural resource.  And so right off the bat, I support that.  But it sounded like that that road may be used for development down the road.  I hope we can get clarity on that.  Because if anyone's driving on it, I can see how the road's going to be damaged.  And development involves a lot of excavating and big trucks,  heavy tons of vehicles up and down.  And the rock walls.  I think we should be preserving those as well.  I was really saddened to see recently that there was a good portion of the rock walls removed on Bruce.  And that was in conjunction with development that is coming.  So I just would like to see consistency.  If we're protecting our resources and our history, let's just do that instead of picking and choosing,  depending on, I don't know, who's benefiting from it.  But I would like to see that preservation.  And fire conditions?  Yeah, I suppose.  I mean, I do remember the campfire and looking at the ridge.  I'm at that end of town, too, and seeing the fire crest the ridge there.  And as we develop in those foothills, our fire increase, it increases substantially.  I'd like to see more funding towards our fire department for that.  So, yeah, that's it.  Thank you.  Patrick Newman is our last speaker.  Just for the record,  and maybe some historical context for this closure.  So the campfire happened in 2018.  A new council came in, so-called liberal council for two years.  That liberal council closed Humboldt Road in September of 2020.  What was going on there?  We had this fire started by PG&E, by the way, that burned up half the state.  So we can't blame all fires on the homeless, although maybe we'd like to.  But we can't blame all fires on the homeless.  So in that 2018 to 2020 period, you know how many people were allowed to stay on Chico City property  that were refugees from the campfire?  The answer to that question is zero.  We did not provide one parking space during that entire time.  We did not provide any legal camping whatsoever.  When COVID came along, we had shelter in place for a while.  That was lifted in August of 2020.  So we were back to rousting everybody.  My point being, what was missing from this presentation was the fact  that there were a lot of people in motorhomes who were burned out of, in the campfire.  They were people at the bottom of the income scale in places like Paradise  and other places that burned, along with the ongoing poverty we see.  So motorhomes ended up along Humboldt.  The context is there was nowhere else  for people to live.  There was nowhere else for people to go.  And our city policy has been all along to make life as difficult as possible  so people go somewhere else, right?  That's been the drum that we've been beating on for eight years now.  So closing Humboldt Road is in large part another symptomatic sort of response to poverty.  There were people up there who had nowhere else to go.  And lots of them.  And yes, they had impacts.  They always do.  Because when you dump people  on the streets, they have impacts.  But that's why I opposed the closing of Humboldt Road then.  I've walked that road since.  It's become like a nice park.  And how do you defend people driving up there and dumping garbage  and not having enough enforcement to prevent it?  You can't really defend that.  And you can put pictures up.  Again, we're an underfunded city.  So how much enforcement did we have up there?  The answer is to start closing things down.  In a way, I'm on the fence on this a little bit  because it looks like a qualified success  in the sense that it is a nice place for people to walk.  There isn't a bunch of garbage around.  But again, we're not looking at the full historical context  of what's happening here.  This was really at the time driven by poverty  and impacts of people who were living up there.  And that, of course, shouldn't be forgotten.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  And we will close the public hearing.  And on this one, we will ask the will of the council.  Thank you.  Mr. Mayor, I will make a motion to approve a resolution  of the Council of the City of Chico ordering continued temporary closure  of a portion of Old Humboldt Road  pursuant to Chico Municipal Code Chapter 10.53.  All right.  We have a motion by Council Member O'Brien,  a second by Council Member Morgan.  Madam Clerk, can you take the roll?  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carry 7-0.  All right.  We'll move on to Item 4.3,  Public Hearing Regarding Military Equipment Use Policy  and Compliance with Assembly Bill 481,  Final Reading and Adoption.  And Captain Aldridge?  Is it Chief still?  Interim Chief?  Flash.  Flash.  How are you?  Great.  Thank you.  Welcome.  Thank you.  So, good evening.  I come to you tonight, Council, for the final reading of the amendment to Ordinance 2.80.050,  which is the military equipment use policy for the police department.  We have reached the final reading.  We've reached the required 30-day public comment period, and I'm here tonight to answer any  questions or concerns you may have concerning that.  All right.  Questions?  Council Member Bennett?  I'm in favor of it, by the way.  But if this wasn't passed, would you have to stop using the military equipment as it's  phrased in the report?  Would you have to stop using it or give it back?  How does that work?  I'm just curious.  So, give it back.  We only have a few items that we have.  We have a few items that we had acquired through the 1033 program, which we are actually in  the process of returning back to the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office.  As for the remaining equipment, yes, it's all city-owned, city-purchased.  If this is not passed, then anything that falls within the definitions of AB 481, we  would have to immediately stop using.  Okay.  Thank you.  That was it.  All right.  Council Member Remington?  Just a quick technical question.  Um.  This is the first time, I believe, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that it's showing  up on the agenda as public hearing regarding.  Is there a reason why it's framed a little bit differently, or am I forgetting?  Did it already say that?  It's required to be a public hearing at this point, and that's why it's on there.  It was a duly noticed public hearing for this one.  Okay.  Required by law.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  And then just really quickly.  In the report, we've talked about this a few times, so I just want to ask the CPDPSU at  ChicoCA.gov, which is the email address which people can address concerns related to this  policy.  Where can citizens find, is it easy to locate for folks who haven't been tuned into these  meetings particularly, or who want to reach out in the future?  So you're talking about on our website?  Yes.  So on the city website, you just go to the police department.  Okay.  And then on the police department website, there's an icon for regulations, and then  that requires us to put, or that has the required posting of all legislation that says we have  to post for the public comment and things of that nature.  And on that section, you'll see the AB 481 requirements.  Okay.  And the email address is listed right there with that.  Okay.  Thank you for clarifying.  All right.  Further questions?  All right.  I'll put the public hearing.  How many?  We have 11.  11 speakers?  All right.  Three minutes.  Okay.  Our first speaker is Jeff Creed, and if Margaret Swick could line up right after him, that  would be great.  So Jeff?  So this is one of those things where I was talking earlier about you got to vet conversations,  vet ideas, and vet what people say.  So last time this was up here, you know, I listened to all these people, and they talked  about nothing really relevant to this topic.  They came up with some statistics that were misrepresented about Boulder.  They had all these emotional outbursts about police violence, and it just made me laugh  because, you know, it's hard.  I understand.  Organizational management level, which you're at, you have to take in all this input and  filter it, and it's hard.  And especially when you've got these people who, like me, show up every week and may or  may not do their homework and may or may not have any idea what they're talking about.  You know, I look at this.  I trained, you know, a couple days here and there with the police over 20 years in the  National Guard, and I look at this list and I go, wow, there's a lot I would add.  A lot of these weapons that they're saying are military are really classified personal  defense weapons.  And when you look at situations that happen around the state, around the world, and you're  talking about the state of the United States, and even in small towns like Chico, I would  rather have well-trained, well-equipped, and well-defended policemen to step out in front  of danger.  I don't want to step in front of danger anymore.  And these people that get up here, they have no idea what stepping in front of danger looks  like, feels like, or anything.  And I want the police to be as well prepared as reasonably—as reasonable.  And so when they get up here and they talk about their budgets and they're worried about,  oh, we're spending this much on paintballs, you know, they have no idea what they're talking  about.  They have no idea what training costs.  They don't understand the situation.  And they—it really frustrates me when people, especially on the dais, don't do the due diligence  to know the answer to simple questions before they open their mouth.  If you don't know the answer, you have weeks, in this case months, to go do the homework  and find the answer.  And no.  You don't need to be—I understand asking certain questions to inform the public.  But, you know, as these people get up here and they tell you their emotional stories  about police violence—remember, I was in L.A. in 92.  I saw real violence in California.  We sat for six hours waiting to be deployed to L.A. and we had to drive all day from San  Jose to L.A.  So if you think the National Guard's going to show up here in 20 minutes to help you,  I got news for you.  I've been there.  I've been there.  I've done that.  And it ain't happening.  These police need what they have and probably more.  Thank you.  SHARMINI PERIES, CITY COUNCIL MEMBER, L.A.: Margaret Swick, followed by Ann Politka.  ANN POLITKA, CITY COUNCIL MEMBER, L.A.: Good evening, Council.

The law was not written to celebrate either police power or military equipment,  but rather to control it.  Chico needs you to answer,  what is the problem in Chico that requires a militarized police force?  Please identify that problem.  Describe that problem out loud for us.  Studies show that military equipment does not reduce crime.  So, why have you authorized it?  Tell us your reasons.  Are you afraid of something that we can't see?  After all, we are not enemy combatants.  We are voters and taxpayers,  concerned about being policed by officers in military garb  with a military arsenal at hand.  That is not the way it works in a democracy.  We need collaborative community policing.  We want you to establish,  a police culture of de-escalation,  rather than authorizing military equipment to manage our problems.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ann Polifka, followed by Nicole Nava.  Good evening, Council Members and Mayor.  As part of the Chico community,  I urge you to fully implement California's new state law,  AB 481.  I'm military.  During the last 10 years,  the state government has endorsed the prohibition  military equipment ordinance meets the standards set by AB 481 and does not  undermine the transparency and oversight by elected officials that are a central  goal of AB 481. Specifically, ordinance 709 should define authorized uses as  required by AB 481 for several types of equipment. It's not enough that the  policy states that equipment may be authorized for situations that, in quotes,  include but are not limited to, end of quote, a listing of situations. The phrase  not limited to makes the list of authorized uses meaningless since it  suggests that authorized uses are limitless. The vagueness will  make it difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether a particular use of  the equipment complies with the policies. Complying with 481 should mean  describing uses that are not authorized. For example, if use of  drones is not authorized, the use of drones is not authorized. If the use of  drones for criminal investigations is not authorized without a warrant, if use of  rubber bullets and chemical agents is not authorized when young children,  elderly, or other vulnerable persons are present, or for crowd control without a  serious threat to life or bodily harm, or if use of the armored vehicle for  arresting a suspect is not authorized without consideration of alternatives.  Ordinance 709 fails to set such limits on authorized use. Next,  military equipment policies must incorporate new state limitations  contained in AB 48 on the use of chemical agents like tear gas and rubber  bullets considered military equipment under AB 481 for crowd control. AB 48  prohibits the use of chemical agents like tear gas and kinetic impact rounds  in crowd control situations except, in quotes, if the use is objectively  reasonable to defend against a threat to life or serious bodily injury, end of quote,  which is a high standard. This limitation must be incorporated into our  military equipment policy. Military Equipment Ordinance 709 should clearly  define procedures for documenting the use of military equipment, not only uses  of force, to meet AB 481's report requirements. Thank you.  Nicole Nava followed by Sue Ellen Rawlinson. All right, so I really wish we could bring  in the panelists.  Nicole Nava. .  . .  . . . . .  . . . .  . .  .  Nicole Nava.  Nicole Nava.  Nicole Nava. . . .  . . . . . . .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   . . . .  building and shot to death multiple people. I was working that day when a peer of mine was from  those offices and it was terrifying to that person and to all of us because it was like we were all  experiencing it with them in real time waiting to hear about our peers. And then I hear things like  this and it's upsetting. I agree with the first speaker. People need to do their homework better.  There was information that was disseminated in here that gave the definition of military  equipment. I would posit to the people who keep trying to tear this apart and see things that  aren't there that our very experienced police department is doing is think about it like this.  Drones are listed on there. Think about how you can use that to keep people safe that are actually  the person maybe experiencing a mental break. You can use that to fly up over their yard if they're  in a yard and see what's going on.  Give very rapid real-time intel to officers to help keep those people safe. This equipment can  also be used in good ways. And I'll tell you what, if you've got someone who's doing something  violent and is somewhere like our movie theaters where a very real situation was going down and  people didn't know what was happening, I damn skippy would want to be the ones having my loved  ones innocently watching a movie protected over someone trying to harm all of us.  So I find it really offensive that we keep going to the bottom denominator of what we think of these  men, women, and people who identify other words in blue. They are doing their best to assist us  with the tools that they have, and they're articulating per the law what they do have  and what might come to them in the future. I trust that with their high level of training  and experience that they're going to use it appropriately. Some of you speak to anecdotal  situations that have happened where people have been in the military and they've been  killed. They've lost their lives. There's always going to be disagreement. It's been disagreed  about for years. What needs to be understood about those situations is people are doing their level  best. And actually when Councilmember O'Brien was chief, I remember clearly him sitting here  even sharing what the violence rate against other people was. And it was like 0.000 something. I  mean, that's with those situations that you raise repeatedly here. And so I just want you to  understand you're going to have to be careful. You're going to have to be careful. You're going  to the bottom when there's a lot of people to help. Thank you.  Sue Ellen Rowlinson followed by Diane Suzuki.  Good evening, everybody. I'm Sue Ellen Rowlinson. Military equipment. Guns.  Well, as I listened to the Council meeting two weeks ago on this topic, I thought about  my time in the Gilroy City Council in the 1990s when gangs were raging.  And I think that's when I was a little bit more aware of the fact that there was a lot of  gun violence around town and there were frequent drive-by shootings. During that time, one of  our counselors decided to promote a gun turn-in program after a shooting occurred during a  PE class at Gilroy High School. The program was called Gifts for Guns, which proved successful  with lots of publicity and over 100 guns turned in. But on the other side of the coin, to  the right of the screen, is Community and Prevention programs. In the 1990s, in the  same period of time, Gilroy received federal funding for community policing. This, along  with a very active coalition of public health nurses, school nurses, school liaisons, apartment  owners, community groups came together to increase programs to prevent violence in our  town.  A gun-in-turn program might not support the  gun-in-turn program, but it does get guns out of closets in homes where young people  find them and cause harm to themselves or others. Such programs also raise awareness  of parents and the community to the easy availability of guns. Gilroy had another gun-turn-in program  recently in reaction to the 2019 Gilroy Garlic Festival, where three people turned in to  help the community. The children were killed by gunshot, 17 wounded, all by a 19-year-old  local person in Gilroy. After that, with the support of Police Chief Smithy, there came  together a joint effort of the Gilroy and Morgan Hill Police Departments and the Santa  Clara County District Attorney's Office. Both cities contributed money for the effort, but  the bulk of the money came from the DA's office, which took leadership and coordinated the  event.  The !  Thank you.  Diane Suzuki, followed by Alicia Trider.  Public hearings are being held all over the  state thanks to AB 481, which mandated 180 days to consider the military equipment policies.  I  I appreciate that the Chico Police Department and the City Council are abiding by this important law that provides transparency and compliance.  I spoke at the last City Council meeting, and I want to again voice my opposition to any militarization of the Chico Police Department.  I don't understand Chief Lieutenant Aldridge when he says that the policy 709 is a routine list of military equipment.  And I still don't understand what kinds of situations would warrant the need for mine-resistant tanks, tear gas-weaponized aircraft and vessels, and kinetic energy weapons and munitions.  When all Chico PD officers have been trained in de-escalation,  please utilize this training every possible time.  According to AB 41, we will need a similar public notice like you sent out last week or so next year if you decide to add to your military equipment list.  In the policy, it states that there are no fiscal impacts, but I'm wondering about what costs there are to store the equipment and maintain the equipment.  What kind of equipment do you need?  What kind of training is involved?  And what added costs there will be if you add to this list?  The most important concern is the protection of civil rights in regard to this frightening list of weaponry.  This concern is a matter of public safety.  Again, the streets of California are not war zones.  Our citizens are not enemy combatants.  Officers dressed like soldiers at war makes us feel less safe and less free.  Law enforcement are our combatants.  We are not a community in public safety.  They are not military personnel and the weapons and equipment they use should reflect that reality.  Thank you.  Alicia Triter followed by Ryan Sanders.  I 100% disagree with the militarization of the Chico PD for a very personal reason.  I am trying to raise my child here in this community.  However, the more guns and military weapons that you allow Chico PD to bring into this community, the greater the chances are that he will be hurt or murdered by those weapons.  The same goes for your children because I know some of you have children.  And the same goes for the children of the people in the audience tonight.  We are all at risk.  Recent events prove that this is a real threat to our community.  Chico police officers murdered Desmond Phillips.  They murdered Tyler Rushing.  And they murdered Steven Vest.  All three of those men were someone's children.  They are sons.  And now they don't get to experience a long adulthood.  And the cops who murdered them are still roaming our streets with lethal weapons strapped to their bodies.  No consequences for their actions.  Now you want to allow Chico police officers to do more damage.  Cause more harm in our community with more weapons and zero accountability or consequences.  What is going to keep Chico police officers from murdering us with these military weapons if they know they don't face any consequences?  I stand with all the parents in our community who want to protect our children from violence.  From becoming collateral damage by Chico police officers.  I stand with all parents who want to see our children grow into adults.  Not murdered by trigger happy police officers who can't control their own aggression in high stress situations.  I am asking you please not to support the militarization of the Chico police officers.  Doing so endangers us all.  Including you.  Thank you.  Ryan Seyfried.  I am Ryan Seyfried.  I am Ryan Sanders followed by Jessica Giannola.  Hi my name is Ryan.  And I don't often come to these meetings so I appreciate you having me here.  I am speaking today to express my opposition for this agenda item.  I feel like the Chico PD can make use of their 29 million and probably make a different use of it.  Especially considering that the Chico PD does have an issue with murdering people.  Instead of using an anecdote to refute the usefulness of anecdotes I thought I might offer some of my expertise which is online research.  And it appears that you all do some data driven decisioning every now and again.  I am looking at the Chico essential services survey.  And I believe that is used to drive this decision.  I believe.  That survey is designed in such a way that I would consider that data fairly useless.  And it is pretty explainable why.  When citizens are asked do they support X, Y, and Z.  The numerical value they are asked to give is the opposite of their intent.  And so for instance if you support public safety.  And you support the public safety.  You give it a one instead of a six.  So the lowest number means the highest amount of support.  I wanted to point this out to you because I think probably a lot of decisioning that this group does is based on this survey or surveys like this.  That data is very flawed.  And I think you all should really look at addressing that before making any large decision like this.  It is very likely almost guaranteed that the data you are getting from the public is flawed.  And may not be the best.  And maybe not usable.  Thank you.  Jessica Giannola followed by Julie Threat.  Thanks Council.  It would be nice if people could stop laughing at people up here.  They are expressing their concerns.  Last council the defense to keep military equipment was used that we have had it all along.  That those opposing it continue.  That those opposing the continued use are somehow confused, exaggerating fears, were not informed, etc.  That is not a good enough reason to continue using a blank check or issuing a blank check to our officers to stockpile military grade equipment to use against citizens.  That is what it would be used for.  It is not going to just sit there.  Rather than running with fear that we will see some massive war explode in Chico.  We need to redirect resources so that we respond to people.  We need to get people in crisis with compassion and intelligence.  This involves better training.  The communities around the country continue to advocate for.  Around the country.  This is not just Chico.  If they have military equipment, the risk is that they will use it.  Again, we are not in war.  The narrative of fear and danger benefits the support for police department using 50% of our city budget.  Then that narrative supports the votes for the conservative.  It is all tied in.  Be afraid.  Give us more money.  Give us the votes.  We are informed that we cite historic events that prove a need for change in how our officers need to interact and diffuse high stress scenarios in communities.  Our officers should be well prepared to deescalate high intensity situations.  This I support.  For people who have been profiled, this matters to them.  This is a real fear.  Their experiences are valid.  We should do better now that we theoretically know better.  For people who have lost loved ones suffering from mental illness right here in Chico.  To officer involved scenarios.  They were killed.  The investment in psychological tools versus high-powered military weapons used in the community far outweighs that.  The danger to those involved that are standing by.  Can you imagine the risk of the incident?  pulling out all these big high-powered weapons, these projectiles, whatever it might be.  It's in the community, right? There are people who live all around here.  Those weapons, those projectiles, those whatevers are going to impact people, casualties, innocent casualties.  So we just need to approach these scenarios with better trained officers,  using de-escalation tools, better training, and less shooting.  There are police officers, there are peace officers. They're not the military.  Julie Threat, followed by Chris Nelson.  The one I put in here.  Okay, so in order to do my homework, as I do whenever there's a policy that I don't fully understand or know,  I did a Google search, right, and looked at other cities that are writing these up as we speak for the law.  And I always look at the city of Sunnyvale, where I grew up, and the city of Santa Clara, which is about our size.  And they're right down there, kind of in the heart of Santa Clara County.  So the city of Santa Clara is definitely, to me, the gold standard.  After I looked through their policy, excuse me,  A, the community engagement process that they went through was phenomenal.  And I actually went back and watched all those Zoom calls, because that's how I got educated.  So I was like, it would have been nice to have kind of that opportunity here in Chico,  but I think that's just for future knowledge, future reference.  They did have a chief's advisory committee, so I like that idea of continuing to look at ways to have these advisory committees.  Because they literally had like eight different opportunities out in the public to have different sections of the community address the chief.  So in particular, February 2nd, 2022, they had the chief did the presentation to the diversity, equity, and inclusion subcommittee.  And I thought, okay, I'm conservative, and if I'm going to really look at kind of the other side, I'm going to key in on that one.  Oh my gosh, there's no way this group's going to ever want this, because they had a list of military-style equipment.  I mean, let's not forget a year ago, somebody was shooting up the VTA, right, and killed nine people.  So these people are going to be there.  These people know they need something like this.  I watched that call, and that chief, by the end of this call, those people were in full support of this policy.  They actually wanted a few more things to be added to the policy.  And it made me think, we need actually a couple more items on our policy.  And so we kind of missed the boat on that, right, by not having that particular type of opportunity.  And the other key thing that he mentioned, the chief mentioned in that call, he took, he actively took the public's input on every single one of these calls,  and he implemented it into the policy.  So one of the things that I thought was, again, just to give some context, under the specialized weapon area,  for example, they would add some descriptors.  So why would you use a Hornady 223 Remington 75 grain, right?  That's the one that there was a primary duty ammunition deployed during potential lethal encounters.  They used the 62 grain as their secondary ammunition during potential lethal encounters when shooting through barriers.  And then the 55 grain is their primary duty ammunition.  And then the 55 grain is their primary duty ammunition when shooting through barriers.  And then the 55 grain is their primary training ammunition.  So they were able to add some context.  So literally in that call, I'm like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, you need more of that stuff.  I know you're going to have to shoot through barriers in certain cases like we have here.  And then they would talk about, again, like the sniper rifles, the big stuff that gets people scared, the 308s.  They were able to actually say, hey, this is what we need to use if we want to have a projectile capable of penetrating soft body armor worn by the assailant.  By the end of this call, I'm like, we need a few more things.  But what I do know, we need fewer types, fewer brands.  We don't need the breadth.  We need the depth.  And so we know that it's being stored and cleaned and that sort of thing.  And I think that will make people more comfortable.  And then the last piece was, I don't know what the, they had some coordination with other jurisdictions and language about if there were Chico State University, what's the coordination with that, if that's in the policy at all.  Thank you.  Okay.  Our last speaker is Chris Nelson.  Apologize about my phone.  I risked my life to be here.  I'm sorry.  The Law Enforcement Support Program, formerly 1033, was first authorized in 1990 to transfer excess Department of Defense personal property to federal and state agencies for use in counter-drug activities.  This program has grown larger over the years and become institutionalized as lead to widespread dumping of military excess post-deployments, like now post-Afghanistan war, into towns and cities across America.  Authorized portals.  Police departments go to a website.  It's just like filling out an Instacart.  It has driven a deep wedge between citizens and police in every jurisdiction  because with the militarization of the police, someone had to become the enemy,  and this usually is poor and people of color,  but increasingly those who stand up for their civil rights.  You should rescind this outlay of public funds for military surplus  that is far in excess of the needs of normal policing.  Excess funding has not been figured in for training, repairs, storage, maintenance, and disposal.  Cost overruns are given, and the ballpark figures cited are surely not accurate estimates.  The city of Chico already spends 49% of its budget on the police department.  Other cities' police budgets are far lower, like New York City spends 8%, San Jose 10%, Sacramento 13%.  Meanwhile, roadways and infrastructure are crumbling in our town  with a paltry public service.  The city of Chico has a public works budget of 7%.  Police do not need assault rifles, chemical agents, or kinetic impact rounds.  Under Bill 481, assault rifles are not standard issue and need specific policies.  Chemical agents and kinetic impact rounds need policies that say they can only be used  if there's a threat to life or serious bodily harm.  These are not toys.  Vague policies can get vulnerable people killed.  For example, rubber bullets should never be authorized,  if children might be at the scene where such weapons would be deployed.  Lastly, I'm particularly disturbed about the lack of specificity in the drone use policy.  Drone surveillance should only be used if there is a warrant.  Policy 709 almost certainly will lead to the abuse of our privacy rights on behalf of a police state.  I hope that you will audit this program next year.  You will find that you are spending a lot of money  for something that you have not needed.  Thank you.  Council, there was one additional card.  Patrick Newman.  And it's a public hearing, so we missed it in the basket.  So, complicated issue.  Maybe I should start by saying that I'm not someone that screams at the police.  I've had many, many good conversations with  Chico Police Officer,  and I've had many good conversations with officers over the years.  I hope I continue to have more.  I'm not anti-cop.  I have talked a lot up here about what I see as a culture of violence in Chico.  And I think it has everything to do with how we think about the poor in Chico,  and have for years.  Gandhi said that poverty was the worst form of violence.  I wish instead of thinking about violence so literally all the time,  that some of the people who are opposed to it,  and I wish these weapons would also take a look at that fence over there,  it's an act of violence.  But getting back to this military issue,  one question that might be asked is,  would you honestly go out and raise funds for this stuff?  Or is the fact that it's free more compelling?  Once again, we're in grant mode.  Free stuff, dropped by the federal government, let's grab it.  Would you really go out and get two different calibers of submachine guns  on the basis of one or more different boxes?  a plea to the public, I need to collect your tax dollars for this? Well, maybe you would.  I don't know. So the deeper question here in terms of what's happening with the fabric  of our society is that we have increasing injustice economically. It's creating more  tension. At the same time, we have more and more advanced technologies that are coming  along in terms of weaponry. They're being developed by the military and used by the  military. I looked at the Third Amendment again today. James Madison wrote a lot about  this question of standing militaries in our towns and cities, whether or not they could  seize our houses for barracks. That question came up with the founders, and they looked  at the deep history of how military has affected civilizations all the way back to the Romans.  What does it mean when you start bringing your military into the fabric of your  military?  It means that you're going to be a part of society in this way. This is a deep question.  We ought to be looking at it and thinking about it, because there's a thing called technological  determinism, and it has to do with the fact that when you have a piece of technology,  you tend to use it. It tends to creep into your culture. It tends to redefine your values.  So we're in a whole new technological age with all kinds of new weapon systems that  could be developed and brought in. Are we thinking deeply about what this really means,  about who we are and what we want to be? Because it's a really complicated,  complicated question. And I would lean in the direction of trying to humanize our police  forces and looking at them as agents of justice instead of agents of a kind of culture of  violence, and that's where we need to go. And I can't speak to the question of a sub-machine  gun. I don't know who needs one, but that's a technical question. Thank you.  All right. We'll close the public hearing. Will the counsel?  I will make a motion to approve an ordinance of the City of Chico, California,  adopting a military equipment use policy and amending Title II, Chapter 2.28 of the Chico  Municipal Code by adding Section 2.28.050, entitled Military Equipment Use Policy in  Compliance with Assembly Bill 481. I'll second that. All right. I have a motion by Councilmember  O'Brien, a second by Councilmember Tannen. Madam Clerk, take the roll. . .  .   Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye.  Mayor Coolidge? Aye.  Carries 6-1.  All right. So we're going to take a break.  Do you want to have closed session comments? Do you have speakers first?  I'm beginning.  Okay. I thought we were breaking.  Okay.  We'll come back to do the regular agenda. If you have comments on these two items in  the closed session, items 7.6 and 7.7.  Okay. So we have two speakers. Our first speaker.  Are you trying to conduct a meeting, folks?  First speaker is Nicole Nava, followed by Kim.  I'm not.  All right. So I've spoken about this before, so forgive some of the repeat,  but I wanted to comment on the two personnel evaluations that are up,  one for City Clerk Debbie Presson and the other for City Attorney Vincent Ewing.  And I'll speak to Mr. Ewing first.  I just would ask that we all think about, you know, things we don't know about what the City Attorney,  what the City Attorney shared with you.  So all we have is what we've seen in the news that was allowed to come out from either you guys  or the City Attorney through FAQs and other things.  And so it is concerning the road that we went down, I feel.  I feel like a lot of money is happening and we don't have a lot to show for it yet.  My hope is that it will be for a good thing.  So, like, it is hard to make a judgment call, but I will say you have an opportunity from what I understand,  because there was a decision made.  There was a dispute filed for to get in there and really look after the good of this city.  And I would really hope that gets done because we're the ones footing the bill for you and for the shelter.  And so that's what I'll have to say about that.  On to Ms. Presson's performance.  I have been here for many years watching this day in, day out happen.  And there are a lot of contentious meetings.  There are some meetings that are not contentious.  But what is consistent is the comportment of your city clerk.  I feel like it doesn't matter what side of any topic that something falls upon.  She comports herself professionally, kindly, goes out of her way, along with her other city clerks, to provide us information.  I feel like under the last few years, Chico has had a fire lit under it as far as citizen engagement.  It may be the few.  But we come consistently and we come up here a lot.  And it's a lot to track between what you guys ask, what's going down.  And like adroitly, she does things.  And sometimes I'm looking around going, what just happened and whatever.  And I hear her restate.  I'm going, I don't know how she got that from that.  But cool.  I'm glad she was paying attention.  And so it's people like that with the long history they have in this city, the effective role modeling she does for her clerks and for other city staffers that I think you need to look to.  When you're looking at the city, you need to look at the city.  When you're looking at management and things down, this is one of your managers or department heads or whatever over this clerk's office.  And that's what we should be striving for.  Excellent internal and external customer service.  Timely service.  The ability to even pivot live during a meeting when requests are made and it's something about the city website.  Sometimes they're live doing the updates.  I mean, that's pretty incredible.  That's red tape that people cut through to do the right thing for any of our city staff.  And I think that's really important.  And I think that's really important for anybody in this city that is asking for those things and asking for information.  So bravo and I hope you get the stellar review you deserve.  Kim Nott.  I don't see him.  But give him a second.  All right.  He's gone.  Okay.  So with that, we'll take a ten-minute recess and then adjourn into closed session.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, yeah, there it is.  All right.  So we will reconvene from closed session.  We will have a report out by Council Member Morgan,  who was on the head of our performance evaluation committee.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  I'll try to make this brief.  So we started with the evaluation of the city attorney.  In the city attorney's case,  the current city attorney,  did not represent the city last year,  so we didn't have any historical data to compare it to.  We talked about a number of items, as people can imagine.  Obviously, Warren came up, and we can't give you any specifics,  but we also talked about the vast other array of services  the city attorney's office and AGC provide.  And I would say, overall, the council was very pleased.  This council was very pleased with the council that we get.  They are a contract staff member,  so no matters of compensation were discussed.  And no action was taken.  The next evaluation that we did was for the city clerk.  We did have some historical information on that.  And in 2021, the city clerk's office scored dramatically well  on the score out of five.  I'm not gonna tell you what the score was.  The score increased significantly  over what was an incredible score last year,  having gone through council members that had to leave,  resign, be appointed, COVID, and so on.  And I think that's a really important thing  to consider in terms of all matters of Zoom meetings  and all these different things.  It would take me all night to try to cover somehow  the praise the city clerk received from this council  and how pleased they were with the job she is doing.  And with that, she was given a salary increase  to bump her to the level pretty much on average  of where all the other department heads are listed,  because for some time, through no fault of her own,  the council was very pleased with the results.  The title clerk gives the public the wrong impression.  They think, oh, this is like a glorified secretary.  It's this, it's not.  One of the terms that came up in the evaluation  was the term lynchpin,  because our city clerk is so much more  than someone that keeps records.  She runs the elections.  She keeps all of us together.  She knows the ins and outs.  She doesn't control the agenda,  but nothing happens on the agenda without her.  And we wanted to make it very, very clear  that the council valued the  her as much as any department head that we have, and that her counsel to us was valued  as much as any department we had.  And that's where the merit increase came from that.  And then finally, there's no other action on that.  Finally, the counsel asked what we consider the executive team, the city manager, the  city attorney, and the city clerk, if there was a better way for us to hear from the three  of them instead of once yearly in their evaluations.  And it was determined through the counsel of the three of them and some input from the  mayor and vice mayor that we would put staff evaluations on the agendas quarterly so we  could go into closed session and hear from the team exclusively, personnel issues, anything  that if there was any items between them that needed to be discussed or anything they knew  that they thought we needed to know that wasn't getting to us that may or may not have happened  in the past.  So when you see those evaluations come up quarterly in the future, it doesn't mean that  any heads up.  It doesn't mean that any of these are going to roll or anything like that.  It's just a chance for us to understand better what's going on.  And with that, I will turn it over to the city attorney to see what I missed.  You've missed nothing.  Thank you, Council Member Morgan.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, everybody.  I appreciate that.  Thank you, Mr. Morgan.  All right.  We'll move on to item 5.2, special planning areas.  Let's continue from the April 5th, 22 meeting.  And that one is also with Council Member Morgan.  So I've got to see if I get this right.  So this is perfect that I'm looking back to the historian and the city clerk.  I believe that at a prior meeting years ago, the council voted to not consider special  planning areas until there was a general plan amendment.  And I voted in favor of that, knowing that I might be able to bring it back later.  Then a full year passed.  And so now anybody can speak to it.  But right now, I believe that is that not the policy that we don't consider special  planning areas?  That was the last action of the seated council in 2020.  So I think my action would be to overturn that.  But I would like to hear from Mr. Veague about special planning areas and why it may be a  good idea or not a good idea to have a discussion about allowing them.  Mr. Veague, sir.  So I'll be brief, I think.  So the special planning areas are our technical term and our general plan for our new growth  areas.  There is no policy.  There is no policy direction in the general plan to prioritize a certain type of development  over another, whether it's infill, new growth, the special planning areas.  I've heard people at council meetings share with me what they say the general plan says.  It does not give a priority to one type of development over another.  There are areas of new growth, generally.  Greenfield, there's a framework for the type of development that should occur there, both  residential, non-residential.  Kind of.  We're looking for.  The best of new development where you'd have more of a mix of use, whether it's vertical  or horizontal integration of parks and open space and all those great things.  And they'll be memorialized in the form of a specific plan or some type of master plan.  But they're big enough and complicated enough that they'll require an environmental impact  report and some master planning and take some time, generally two years plus.  Doesn't have to be that, but given the EIRs and the time they take.  I shared with this council in December.  When they requested the update on the housing in general that the areas that were entitled  similarly in the past in the early 2000s, Oak Valley, Merriam Park, Northwest Chico specific  plan area are in fact the areas that are being developed today and have been developed since  their approvals through this time.  That they're an important part of the mosaic of land use and opportunities in the city  to meet both residential and non-residential uses.  Um.  The general plan itself did not create a prioritization.  Intentionally, there were folks that said, well, maybe we should only do those when we've  reached a certain level of development and that's not the direction of the general plan.  So I believe they're important to have available and online.  They don't develop quickly.  They are in fact the areas due to their size and location that will develop over time and provide both housing,  which we know is a major issue.  We know we need and also non-residential uses over time.  Thank you, Mr. Rigg.  That was my only comment if you want to.  All right.  Do we have any from the council or the public?  Any questions?  No.  Okay.  Any public comments?  All right.  Well then fire away.  Wait until now.  Yeah.  You know, I fielded some phone calls leading up to this item.  It's obviously 930.  There's a lot of people that are not in the area.  There are two people, three people in the audience right now.  Some of the issues that were brought to me have to do with the lack of information in  this report, which I know was just kind of a summary of the different meetings that were  held and the meeting minutes associated with them.  If you're not intimately familiar with what a special planning area is, if you're not  in the development field or if you don't know what's laid out specifically in the general  plan, this kind of reads as gibberish.  It doesn't really give a lot of context.  Okay.  And so I prefer a much more robust conversation with an informed public.  You know, I appreciate Mr. Veague's content, but given the time of evening and what people  had access to prior to the meeting, it's a little, it leaves a little bit to be desired.  And, you know, that context, without that context, it kind of sells folks short.  The reason that the item Council Member Morgan has brought forward to reverse today even  came about was because of a proposal and report advocating for the use of public information.  So we'll open up the floor to the motion.  So, thank you so much.  So, thank you so much.  So, thank you so much.  So, thank you so much.  So, thank you so much.  significant major developments that may or may not meet those needs.  So if we're truly committed to data-driven decision-making,  then we in the public need that missing information before we can make those future plans.  So I'll be voting no on reversing this.  So I have a question.  Go ahead.  Madam Clerk and Mr. City Attorney,  would the motion tonight be to reverse the delay in special planning areas?  Is that a motion we can make?  Because the title, it just reads funny.  Because of agendizing a discussion of a prior council action taken here.  Or do we have to?  It's not really reconsideration at this point.  And I would obviously rely on the City Attorney for the legal analysis.  But I think that it was a reconsideration of a prior council action.  And had that occurred in a timely manner,  you actually would have already acted on this a year ago.  And so now the year has passed.  So the council, I believe, might be able to give direction to just reverse that.  There was no discussion at the time that the council enacted it in 2020.  Was it direction at the time that it was enacted?  Or was it a motion that was voted on?  It was a motion that was voted.  And that could have been reconsidered had Sean's item of budget.  A member of the majority brought it back up.  Sure.  So I'll leave it up to the City Attorney.  I agree with that analysis.  I think it would be direction at this point.  It would be direction?  Yeah.  So I don't need to make a motion?  Tell me the motion that you're contemplating.  My motion would to remove the delay we put on special planning areas.  You can make that motion.  I will make that motion.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. City Attorney.  All right.  We have a motion.  Do we have a second?  Second.  Second by Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Motion by Council Member Morgan.  Madam Clerk, you can take the roll.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  No.  Short-sighted.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Yes.  To opening back up what spent hours and hours and hours of deliberation to set forward the  first time.  Okay.  Thank you, Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carry 6-1.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Moving on to our much-anticipated pavement management program update, which is informational  only, we have a report by Public Works Director Leanne Sutton.  Welcome.  Thank you.  Thanks for your patience. . . .   .  . .   . .     Thank you.  Thank you. . .  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  contracted with the California Pavement Preservation Center at CSU Chico to update  the condition assessment of the roads. A report was provided last year in 2021 at September  2021 Council, and in February, Mayor Coolidge asked for an update on the condition of the roads. So  I'll be including that update in the presentation tonight. And when I just wanted to go through  real quick, last year when they updated the roads condition assessment, they manually inspected the  road segments and developed a pavement condition index for each segment. And they also developed  the deferred maintenance work that was needed on each segment and added that up system-wide.  And I'm going to go through that data in a minute. And to remind everybody what pavement condition  index is, it's a surface condition rating where when they go out and look at the streets, they  look at all the distresses on the street.  Which include cracking, weathering, and base failure. And then they come up with a score  based on those distresses. And the score can range from zero to 100. 100 being a new road  or new paving, and zero being a failed road. And those PCI scores can be grouped into categories,  condition categories, from very poor to excellent. And to show you some examples of what these  look like, this is an example of an excellent condition road. It's new paving. The PCI is 100.  This is an example of very good condition. You can see one linear crack forming on the road.  This is an example of good condition, believe it or not. Some surface cracking is forming, but this  is still maintainable. And this is an example of poor condition, serious linear cracking, and  pothole repairs.  The road is now 46, so the average condition of our roads is approximately what you're  seeing right here in this picture. And very poor condition looks like this with a lot of  alligator cracking, and this is a pretty much failed road. It's a PCI of 2, which is close  to zero. And you can see the chunks on the side of the road. The road is crumbling apart.  part. To summarize the findings from the road condition assessment that was updated last year,  we have 568 miles of road. The road value is about $400 million. If we were to replace the  whole system, it would cost us around $500 million today. We have a deferred maintenance backlog  right now of about $132 million, and that increased slightly from last year, where it was reported as  $117 million. And as I mentioned, our average overall PCI for all the roads in the entire  system right now is 46, which is in the poor category. Last year, it was reported as 49, and  because we are underfunding the road needs annually, our PCI is currently going down.  So if you look at the condition of our roads in terms of miles, 53 percent or 301 miles is  in good or very good condition. 47 percent or 267 miles is in poor or very poor condition.  Comparing the city of Chico to other agencies in the state, statewide average was 66,  county average was 61, and other cities in the state of California, their average was 68.  All three of those scores are in the good category, good average category, and Chico is,  in fact, 49 last year, and I'm leaving it at 49 because that report was completed last year,  and I'm comparing apples to apples from last year. So as I mentioned, our average PCI right now is at  46, and this curve shows a typical life cycle of a roadway, and as you can see, the first  75 percent of the pavement's life, so the first 15 years or so, you only drop about 40 percent,  but after the roads age by about 15 years or so, the road condition, the PCI starts to decline  at a faster rate. That's called accelerated deterioration, and as you can see, we plotted  our average PCI on the curve, and it's in the accelerated deterioration range of the curve,  and that means our PCI is dropping faster now, and that doesn't mean all roads are in advanced  deterioration. It means that the road condition is in the accelerated deterioration range, and that's  average our roads are in advanced deterioration. So if you look at the data from 2015 to 2021,  our PCI was at average 61 in 2015, which is average good condition, and then it dropped  pretty significantly to today, to 46, which is average poor, and looking at the reasons for that,  there's a couple of contributing factors. One is that the road condition is in advanced deterioration,  and that's one of the main contributing factors, in addition to just the roads receiving neglect  traffic impacts and weathering, the campfire impacts from 2018, when I went back and looked  at the data on that, I found that our traffic volume data showed that we had an average increase  of 28 percent on many of our roadways right after the campfire, which was an increase of 115,000  daily trips on our roads. That impact is equivalent to,  over a decade of growth or more.  Another contributing factor to our PCI decline  is annexing county roads into the city  that were not built to city standards.  Typically county roads are built with paving  on top of native soil with no backfill  or compaction underneath them.  So they don't, the curve that I showed you a few slides ago,  showing the life cycle of a roadway,  county roads don't really follow that life cycle curve.  So these contributing factors along with the age  are causing the roads to deteriorate at a faster rate  right now, resulting in the need  for more expensive pavement treatments.  And so for example, if you have a road in good condition  and you wanna maintain that road to good condition,  you could spend $200,000 per mile to seal the road.  But if the road is allowed to reach very poor condition,  you would have to reconstruct the road  at a cost of $200,000.  So that's a cost of $200,000 per mile,  which is approximately 10 times the cost  of maintaining a good road.  So how much do we need to spend to keep our roads  in good condition?  Well, just to keep our roads at the condition they're at now,  PCI 46, the data shows that we need about $9 million per year  in pavement rehab projects.  And for example, if we wanted to reach a PCI 26,  a target of 65, which is good, within the next 10 years,  it would cost the city $16 million per year  for the next 10 years.  If we wanted to reach a PCI target of 80,  which is average very good condition,  the 10-year plan would cost us $24 million per year.  And it's important to point out that with these targets,  that a PCI target of 65, not all roads  would be in good condition.  Even a PCI 65 would be in good condition.  And a PCI of 80, not all roads would be in good condition.  More roads would be in good condition, but not all.  OK, so our current pavement management program,  we are spending about $2.6 million per year  on a road rehab project that is 2 to 4 miles per year out  of the gas tax funding and out of the public infrastructure  replacement fund.  And we're spending about $3 million for 3 miles per year.  And that is less than the $9 million  that's needed to maintain the PCI at 46.  So that's why the PCI is continuing to go down right now.  So I wanted to highlight some of the maintenance funds that  are expended in the effort to maintain  the roads in safe condition.  Because thanks to them, we're able to drive on roads.  They're keeping the roads together in safe condition.  They complete about 450 roads.  They're keeping the roads together in safe condition.  And they're also doing about 250 repairs per year,  which includes 500 tons of asphalt and 11,000 pounds  of crack sealer.  So thank you to maintenance.  And the maintenance funding required for that effort  is $2.4 million per year out of general fund, gas tax fund,  and public infrastructure replacement fund.  And it's also important to note really quickly  that this isn't all the funding that goes to the streets.  There's other funding, like street cleaning, street trees,  and other things.  But this slide is just highlighting  what is going towards maintaining the PCI of the pavement  or increasing the PCI of the pavement.  And so we have delineated out our current funding level  of $2.6 million per year for pavement rehab projects.  And this is on the city's website.  If you Google City of Chico Pavement Management Program,  you can see this list of projects  that are programmed out for the next two years.  We're working on the top two projects on the list here,  Pine, Mulberry, Cypress Streets and East Avenue.  Those are in planning or design as we speak.  So this graph, this shows graphically  what I mentioned from the chart and a couple slides ago,  but it's also charted with our current funding levels.  So what it's showing is that, yes,  we would need more money, and we would need more funding,  than we're currently spending to bring the PCI up to good or very good condition.  But if we continue at the $3 million per year, our PCI is going to drop to 36 in 10 years.  That's what the data is showing us.  And to sum it up, our current need for a PCI target of 65 to 80 over 10 years  is $16 to $24 million per year for the next 10 years.  After the 10-year plan, if we achieve a PCI target of 80,  our ongoing funding need will be about $12.5 to $25 million per year.  And our current funding is about $3 million per year.  So if we subtract the $3 million per year from the $16 to $24 that's needed for the 10-year plan,  our funding gap is $13 to $21 million per year for roads.  And that concludes my presentation.  All right. Well, that was great.  A lot of information, but very concise. Thank you.  Do we have a question?  I think Vice Mayor Reynolds has a couple of questions.  I might have one.  On page 10, or slide, I guess, 10,  the city average, is that every city in the state of California?  Cities our size? Cities in Northern California?  Yeah.  So that is...  Based on the California statewide local streets and roads needs assessment,  and so that's put on by the California League of Cities,  and what they do is reach out to all the cities and capture as much data as they can.  So it's all the cities that decided to participate in providing data.  And of those cities, their average across the state is 68.  Okay.  Okay. Thank you.  So obviously six years ago, we were in a much better position. . . . . . . . . . . . . .    . . . . . . . . . . .    . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  .  . . . . . . . . .  to 80 within five years it would cost 36.7 million dollars a year and that's in today's money  and it's important to understand with a five-year plan that at the end of the five-year plan we  would have a significant deferred maintenance backlog and you probably have to turn around  and do another five-year plan because if we're looking at the data a lot of the roads are going  to hit the end of their useful life in years five to ten right so okay not a lot of good things here  but i think news that we need the community to hear so all right any other questions from council  it's just informational only we're not doing speakers correct  actually it's um a regular agenda item so we do have three speakers  oh um so are you ready for them thank you very much  so our first speaker is nicole nava followed by mike  traulman  long night you guys must be tired i know i am um so i really feel for our public sports department  and for our community and for you guys on this one i think everybody's equally frustrated no  matter where you land um it's a whole lot of bad that takes a whole lot of money to resolve  um it is very disappointing that many years ago as expressed  you know we're not going to be able to do anything about it but i think it's a whole lot of bad  that we're um you know at such a low pci and then even in 2021 we're at 49 then it came down even  worse than that and that we were needed to be at four mil just to be at what i call crappy  and so i in polite company won't say what i think happens when you take it down by a million annually  because then it's less than crappy which is very crappy and so here we are and we're not evil even  able to do anything about it but i think it's a whole lot of bad that we're not going to be able to do  to maintain very crappy like this is wrong so we need to find a way through this and unfortunately  due to other things going on we have an erosion of trust from the community to look favorably  upon the sales tax that is proposed i wish there was some way you guys could sign in blood or  something that the money is going to go to the roads because i feel like no matter what side  of the aisle people fall on they could get behind that because we are so woeful and we're not going  to be behind the eight ball on this and i know a lot of you have been up there before going we  need this we need this we've had you guys up there and your staff before you know just spouting about  where we are and we all get it like you i was joking that i have my little cup over there i  literally cannot take a drink without like spilling pretty much anywhere in town it's that ridiculous  you have to wait for a dead stop it's like when are we going to have this when can we feel proud  of our streets again that you look down and it looks awesome you got the alligatoring all the  way to the right of the street and i'm literally thinking outside the box going well can we call  the city and go can we get together as neighborhoods and do better hot patching that's  going to last longer and things like this because we've just got to do something and the fact that  we're looking at 25 million to get us on track like that is mind-blowing and scary um i just i  feel for you guys having to do this but you got to find a way to connect with people and get a  point of view so i'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open  net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll  open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the  open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net  so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll  open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the  open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll open up the open net so we'll  Thank you.  Mike Trelander, followed by Jeff Creed.  Hello, Grand Council.  I'm very tired, so I'll try not to mumble my way through this.  Brendan had a concept of a mosaic that the general plan talks about in building patterns.  So the mosaic is residential, commercial types of development.  And if we look at the mosaics that we have now, we have huge tracts of single-family development.  Generally, in the city of Chico, those are net negative when it comes to repairing or maintaining their infrastructure.  When you look at Marion Park, which is a different kind of development,  it's 18 times the property tax.  Back then, it was 18 times the property tax.  It's a different kind of value of, let's say, Sycamore Creek, with one-tenth of the publicway infrastructure.  So Marion Park is a broken slot machine for you.  It is paying huge amounts of roadway repair, where the other developments are sucking you dry.  And so the idea isn't to eliminate single-family, to attack single-family neighborhoods.  The idea is to introduce a mosaic.  That makes you healthy, that keeps your roads maintained.  What does that mosaic look like?  Your general plan talks about the mosaic a little bit.  Your zoning codes do not reinforce that.  And every time a project comes up in front of council, and we're boating it in late at night,  we're never talking about the math that it takes in order for that project to contribute to the health of this city.  We're only talking about the developer making money,  and that the public...  And that the public is able to...  And that they can sell them.  And selling them is the key to everything.  But at the same time, we are going broke in that process.  So the idea is neighborhood, single-family streets and neighborhoods.  We don't have to give up single-family.  We need to get our mosaic so it's working very well.  And so the idea of...  We don't need Marion Park spread across the whole city.  We don't need...  We don't need single-family spread across the whole city.  We need that mosaic.  That mosaic needs to work for you, for us, for maintaining our streets.  And so the conversation really is, is when are we going to have that conversation?  When are we going to talk about developments being net positive for this city?  So there's my...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jeff Creed is our last speaker.  So this is a great topic for me.  I've actually done a little homework on this.  And let's listen.  So the mayor...  Just a little play.  I'm not going to play.  Potential solutions were not explored in 2019 and 2020.  The cost to fully bring our streets up to the state average is now over $100 million,  with some estimates as high as $130 million at rising.  And that's just to be at the state average.  And let me tell you, the state average is certainly...  Right, so that's...  That's the...  State of the city this year, right?  So let's listen to...  So again, by year 2020, based on the different funding alternatives,  what our overall PCI would be looking at by the year 2020.  So again, if we do absolutely nothing, our PCI would be projected to be a 50 by year 2020.  If we stay the course with $1 million towards roadway improvements,  we are looking at pretty close, 51.  Okay, so what Brandon was saying there in 2016, right here,  was that in 2016, they predicted the PCI to be exactly what it is today.  And so when I talk about doing things differently, right,  we've been talking about this issue since 2016.  There's been no plan to sustain the roads.  And then we put up this slide that says PCI decline contributing factors.  Campfire.  Okay, so we increased a 20%, 8% average.  Over how much?  How much time?  How much time was that 20% active?  And then 115,000 more trips.  115,000 more than what?  What was the standard before and what is it reduced to now?  What this doesn't say for...  That I just took, doesn't say about contributing factors,  is you've underfunded, as a city,  you've underfunded maintenance for a long time,  longer than I can even research, right?  The sustainment maintenance has been up...  You've been, as a city, I'm not saying you individuals,  but as a city, they've been underfunding it here.  And the issue is the conversation.  You're not addressing the elephant in the room.  You can blame all these people.  The mayor went on to blame people who,  and the state of the city went on to blame people who come and visit Chico  for damaging our goods and not paying their fair share.  What's their fair share when they come visit?  Do you charge your guests, you know, an entrance fee to your house  to pay for the sidewalk that they damage over time?  It's silly.  The problem is you need to change the way you do business as a city.  You're not on a sustainable plan.  You haven't been on a sustainable plan for years.  And you need more meetings, like you started,  where you guys sit down and hash out,  how do we get back to a sustainable plan?  How do we get back to a budget that is realistic to sustain the city?  Because this is not just roads, right?  This is every department in the city.  Every department in the city is understanding,  understaffed, underfunded, and undermaintained.  Your roads are, and then you're going to go to the airport.  It's like, how are you going to do an airport  when you can't even drive to the mall?  Doesn't make sense.  He was our last speaker.  All right, thank you, and no actions needed.  I think it was very helpful, and I'd love to see us package it some way  so when we get some of these questions, we can send it out and be great.  All right, let me find my agenda here.  Let's see what's next.  Apologies, apologies.  All right.  So item 5.4, no items posted after posting the agenda.  Item 6, reports and communications.  The following reports and communications are provided for council's information.  No action can be taken on items under this section  unless the council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda.  And 6.1, the city manager's report.  Two days in.  Two days in.  I really don't have a whole lot to report.  Other than I just again want to thank the staff.  They have all come together, given me briefings, given me briefing papers.  Chief Madden has spent enormous amounts of time with me trying to get me up to speed.  You have a heck of a staff here.  And the professionalism has been impressive in my two days, and I'm looking forward to working  with them, looking forward to with you.  And Chief Madden, I don't know if there's anything you want to report  as your last city manager report?  No.  Okay.  Thank you.  Welcome.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And welcome.  All right.  Item 6.2, council member request pursuant to AP and P 1010.  Council members may verbally request the item be agendized at a future meeting  after stating what the item would be.  A majority of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize.  Council members may also submit requests in writing.  Do we have any council member requests?  All right.  Seeing none, we'll move into closed session.  Do we have any public comments on closed session?  Or council disqualifications?  All right.  Three minutes.  Marathon.  All right.  Here I am again.  Guess what I'm going to talk about.  Warren v. Chico.  So let's figure out how to get this one done, too.  We have the pallet site ready to rock and roll by all intents and purposes.  We're waiting on operating rules.  Rules are important.  Rules are a framework.  We have rules for our children.  Our children need boundaries.  We have rules for adults as a civil society.  We need boundaries.  We have to respect boundaries living here together.  What we have is a group of people who don't like to follow rules.  And they should not be treated differently than the rest of us with having to operate in the boundaries of a civil society.  We should have legal services of Northern California sitting up at attention and thanking their lucky stars that they were able to negotiate such a deal.  We have a free all inclusive resort.  That is free.  All inclusive resort.  And for some reason we're banging our head against the wall about rules.  Like one can only posit that is it we need to be able to allow people to leave 24-7 from their pallet home that we all pay for?  Is it that they have an issue with guests coming past a certain hour?  Like what is going on?  But guess what?  Even though it's non congregate shelter living, these are pretty close together.  They deserve to be kept safe just like we deserve to be kept safe.  There are rules like that for a reason.  If I'm in my neighborhood and someone is going around that doesn't look like they're coming right back for work, you can bet your bottom dollar my eyes look at the security camera going that person doesn't belong in my neighborhood.  What's going on?  The same could be said of a homeless person in their pallet site being worried that they're hearing stuff going on.  What is going on?  What is going on with legal services that we cannot get on board and open this place already?  I'm hopeful that the city is locking down the social workers that we need for the O and E piece.  That is vital, right?  We can't get out there and do the outreach, do the appropriate noticing if we don't have the people in place that are supposed to make the decision that they're allowed to enter said pallet site.  So this community is like literally dying for this to figure itself out.  We need them to get into this shelter.  We need cooperation.  We've been patient.  We are now at, I believe now finally over a year that we have patiently waited.  We did not get what we hoped out of this.  But when you look at it with sunny side up, there are services there.  There's case management.  It's a clean place to be right now.  It is theirs to keep as it is now.  It can only go downhill from them.  And they would be the ones to bring it downhill.  And they are the ones to bring it down.  Because the city is bent over backwards to ensure that they will have staff there.  It will be clean.  They will have garbage.  They will have food.  They will have Wi-Fi.  They have everything that many others do not.  They just have to agree to some rules.  And so I would really hope that you guys, you can sway the plaintiff's attorneys to get on board and really do the humane thing so that do we want them outside through another storm?  Like let's get them in.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Council, there's no more qualifications.  Seeing none, we'll move into closed session.  Thank you.
