 I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, and with liberty and justice for all. Could we have the roll call, please? Commissioner Wolff? Here. Commissioner Scarpa? Here. Commissioner Poulin? Here. Commissioner Laffins is absent. Commissioner Cooper? Here. Vice Chair Scott? Present. Chair Wall? Here. Thank you. Okay, the first item of business here tonight is the selection of Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board as the new subcommittee of the Planning Commission as per council direction. So, we can go about this any number of ways. I guess the first thing is to ask Bruce to give us a few words of wisdom on the subject. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll go to the chair for a question. You're right. The council has asked for the Planning Commission to form a subcommittee of three, and the board of commissioners here are going to be the chair for the presentation. There will be a subcommittee for the planning commission. Just to review. I just want to remind you, the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board will continue to be first, third, wednesday, and the month before, beginning of the fourth. Yet, the review would be many things that you don't see right now, that you're going to see in the public and the buildings, the commercial buildings, truly on the decided view of the commission, and many of those projects don't come to see. The other projects that would normally go there, which would be more, and they'd go to the planning commission, will now just come to you at once. So there is some efficiency in the process of that thing, because those areas would be combined into one area, or your board. It would be closer to being both here and there. But, in terms of background and qualifications, what we're asking for you folks to do is, amongst yourselves, to decide which members are engaged in visual arts, such as art, visual arts, vehicles, such as architects, landscape architects, artists, designers, or to the extent of planning, which members have that background. These are kind of aspirational goals. Some of the other things that are provided for guidance in terms of background qualifications are experience in disciplines of architecture history, architectural history, planning, archaeology, or other disciplines such as urban planning, American studies, American civilization, cultural geography, cultural anthropology, and similar to those, kind of that area of study, design review professional, or background design community professional. So what we're asking you to do is appoint three primary members, and then while we're here, can we have all turn into, to function in case we have absences? And then we can call this, it's gonna be tight-knit, we can only have three people, two people, it's gonna be a quarrel. So we're asking you to sort through those, or maybe as well here, find out who has an interest. Some of you have done that before. Whatever the purpose of the language. Any questions that we have to answer? Bruce, are they still meeting, as far as the requirements, and what projects go before the ARB? Has that changed at all, or is that still the same? It's just gonna be a function of the planning commission. I'm glad you brought that up. We're meeting on a kind of parallel track, director and some other staff people, meeting with a group of the development community to look at ways to streamline the architecture review process. So this has been an ongoing process, looking to see if there's any ways to, you know, identify some efficiencies and streamline that process. That conversation's going on, and we'll come back to you with whatever changes come out. Okay, this normally wouldn't take a, comments from the audience, but in this case, we'll ask for any comments, if anybody would like to get up and speak to this matter before we actually appoint or select. Our members. Seeing none, first off, I would like to ask how many, or who would like to volunteer for this? Lindsay? Paul? I'd be happy to as well. Okay. So I nominate Commissioner Cooper, Commissioner Wolf, and Commissioner Poulin to serve as the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board. That would be for the primaries. Anybody like to be alternate? I'd be fine being an alternate. I have experience in planning and geography. Okay, can we add that to your, as a friendly amendment to your motion? Sure. Okay. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? None. Okay. Bruce will give you all your information you need to know on what to do, if you haven't been watching that. Okay, consent agenda. We have no items for that. Approval of minutes from June 1st. Okay. Actually, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to pull that for a brief discussion. The minutes. Okay. Just the, I'm wondering if the minutes could indicate with respect to the discussion of the card room, a distinction between those who spoke in favor and those who were opposed to it. There were speakers on kind of both sides there, and that would be, if that wasn't clear in the minutes, I think that would be helpful. And then perhaps to add that the no votes that were cast were based upon the location of the project and concerns over that, not about the project itself, it was more locational. That was it. Okay. Can those be added in, Bruce? Yes, Mr. Chairman. Okay. If you can do that, we'll break it up with the highest minutes. Why don't you go ahead and make that motion and include your comments. Yeah. I move to adopt with the stated amendments to the minutes. Second. All in favor? Aye. Opposed. Are we, sorry, Bruce, did you say you were bringing the minutes back? Yes. Okay. Yeah, it's working. Unless you feel we can make this change the direction. I think I would feel more comfortable seeing what, seeing them on their back. Okay. Sorry. Make the changes and bring them back next meeting for re-approval. Sure. Okay. Thanks. And then can we get the vote again? Pardon? Vote again. Yes. I think we need to call for the vote again, Larry. Okay. All in favor? Aye. Motion is now to bring it back. So make that motion. Yes. I make that motion. I'll second. All in favor? Aye. Okay. They'll come back at the next meeting. Formally, business from the floor, now called public comment. Thank you, Evan. Members of the public may address the commission at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda. With comments being limited to three minutes. Okay. The commission cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. Do we have any public comments? Apparently not. We'll move right along to public hearings. And the first one will be 4.1, mod 23.03 to UP 21-03, Achieve Charter School at 1494 East Avenue. 8 p.m. 016-070022. Hi. Hi. Thank you, Chair Wall, members of the commission. Good evening. My name is Tina Wilson. I'm the associate planner assigned to this project. This project was before the planning commission back last year in May of 2022. And it's at a 4.7-acre site. It's zoned OR with an AOC overlay. It's a 4.7-acre site. It's a 4.7-acre site with an OMU land use designation. It's on the north side of East Avenue, just across the street from Pleasant Valley High School, behind the Life Church, on the same site. The proposal is to modify a previously approved conditional use permit to remove the requirement for a concrete fence on the west side of the property per a neighbor request. Staff had received a petition, and then the applicant came forward on behalf of the neighbors and applied for this modification. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. Soonere questions were asked. the landscape plan to include additional plantings to help screen the school from the residential neighborhood. This is the revised landscape plan. The project's been determined to be categorically exempt and it's pursuant to section 15301 existing facilities. Consistent with the exemption, the modification to the previously approved conditional use permit involves no expansion of an existing use. There is this neighborhood meeting that was conducted earlier this year in June. The project is consistent with all general plan policies, conforms with our municipal code. Staff is recommending approval. There is one minor change that staff is going to recommend that I noticed this evening. The staff report does state additional changes to a condition number one, just for clarity of reference to the appropriate plan set and that wasn't carried over to the exhibit. Staff report recommends that that minor change is also made. We did receive a couple comments from the public that were forwarded to the Planning Commission. Other than that, Planning staff recommends that the Planning Commission consider the staff report, direct any questions to staff, provide comments, hold a public hearing, and adopt Planning Commission Resolution 2306, including the required findings, determine the project is categorically exempt from further environmental review, and approve the modification to the previously approved use permit subject to the recommended conditions. That concludes my report, and I'm happy to answer any questions. We had one of the comments that wanted to change the trees. Where do you come down on that? Regarding that particular comment, the applicant did respond to that, and they had already started some plantings, and pursuant to the approved or the proposed landscape plan, I should say. And if there are additional concerns from the Commission regarding that, staff would be happy to work with the applicant on making sure that any revised landscape plan addresses any of those concerns. And I have a draft condition to add if the Commission would like to do so. Okay. Any other comments? I have one question. And Tina, I might be misremembering this, but I thought the concrete wall was a response to noise and air conditioning units. And so has that been resolved, and now the neighbors don't feel like that's necessary? I think there's a weighing of multiple issues. They don't want to lose the trees that provide the shade and the visual screening, the existing trees. And regarding noise, I think there's a lot of issues that are going to be resolved. I think there's a lot of issues that are going to be resolved. I think there's a lot of issues that are going to be resolved. There are other conditions on that use permit to have those units, the air conditioning units and other noise-producing mechanical equipment to be on a timer. And I know that the school is trying to work that out and has been active in trying to get that going. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. neighborhood meeting. And just to clarify, all of the potentially affected property owners are in agreement with this change to the condition? All of those neighbors have been noticed. So if there are any neighbors that disagreed, they had the opportunity to see the go to the neighborhood meeting or come to this meeting. And I have not heard of any disagreement. Any other comments or questions? Not at this time. All right. Thank you very much, Leah. Thank you. Open the public hearing and take comments from anybody who desires to come up. Okay, we'll close the public hearing and bring it back to the commission for motion and or comments. Somebody jumped in. We have a big agenda. So I will move that the planning commission adopt resolution 23-06 determining the project is categorically exempt from further environmental review pursuant to CEQA section 15301 and approving modification 23-03 to use permit 21-03 subject to the recommended conditions and the additional condition added tonight by the commission. Thank you. Any other comments? All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Okay. That passes unanimously. Next item, 4.2, use permit 21-06, touch roads or brothers coffee drive-thru, 2060 East 20th Street, APN 002 370-025. Which is it, Tina? Dutch Bros or Dutch Brothers? I've been saying Dutch Bros. Dutch Bros. Okay, that's what we're calling tonight then. Thank you. So item 4.2.! It's a zoning design. It's a zoning design. It's a zoning design. It's a zoning design. It's a zoning design. It's a zoning design. It's a zoning design. It's a zoning design. It's a zoning design. parcel on the southern portion of this development that just includes the parking lot itself. This is a proposal to construct a freestanding Dutch Brothers coffee building with drive-through in the existing parking lot for WinCo Foods at 2060 East 20th Street. This is the site plan. The applicant worked with staff on different iterations of the site plan, and this is a result of those changes. This was also approved by the architectural review and historic preservation board earlier in June in terms of the architecture and site design, and it's here for its use permit approval. This is a larger portion or zoomed-in portion of the leased area on the site plan. The two queuing lanes. The two queuing lanes would accommodate up to 22 cars, and it is more than what our standards require for drive-through facilities in terms of the queuing. It meets all of the requirements of the municipal code in terms of the site design for drive-through facilities. It is also found to be categorically exempt. Pursuant to section 15303 for new construction. And consistent with this exemption, the project consists of construction of a new commercial pad and building less than 10,000 square feet. I believe it's about 950 square feet for the building, including drive-through sales not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances where all necessary public services are available and the surrounding area is not environmentally sensitive habitat. Again. The board approved the site design back in June. The project is consistent with the general plan. Meets all municipal code requirements and staff is recommending approval. We did receive one phone call regarding accessibility. And I did let the member of the public know that the ADA requirements would be looked at at the building permit stage if this project were to be approved. That is something that our. Plans examiners take a close look at prior to issuance of any building permit. So in conclusion, planning staff recommends that the planning commission consider the project staff report direct any questions to staff provide comments, hold a public hearing, adopt planning commission resolution 2305, including the required findings, determine the projects categorically exempt pursuant to section 15303 of CEQA and approve use permit 2106 for Dutch Bros coffee drive-through. Subject to the recommended conditions. That concludes my presentation and I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you very much. Anybody got questions or comments? I've got a question and maybe a little bit of a comment too. First the Dutch Bros model just seems to be wildly successful. It's really something and the efficiency of that whole program is impressive and just the opportunities that they're providing for, you know, people to, you know, get good job experience and training and whatnot is a great model. The one thing I've noticed is that they do tend to generate a tremendous amount of traffic. Far more than I think virtually any other use. They're extremely popular in the order of maybe 1500 up to upwards of 2000 cars a day. Most of those trips as I understand are diverted or passed by trips and their people are out doing other things. So that drops the overall. You know, net increase down to a much lower number but it's still quite a bit higher than the standard retail rate. And I'm wondering if under those conditions it would be the city's practice to when they're looking at calculating the traffic impact fees to look at that other category. There's the three categories of, you know, retail, office, industrial and then there's other where they just the fee is based upon the traffic impact. So I'm wondering if that would be part of what staff would envision on this or any input on that. It's just a thought more than anything. In comparison to like development impact fees? Correct. Okay. Typically we would calculate it based off of the retail use and I do believe that the drive-through gets included in some. Facet. Some aspect. Thank you. Anybody else? Tina, would you mind putting on that kind of concentrated site plan again? Yes. I guess if you could speak to this and then potentially the applicant as well. I'm a little bit confused on the traffic flow and how that would work, one, so if you could point that out. And then number two, if you could just elaborate on that. Okay. So number two, on the rendering on 20th Street, I wanted to understand and I went by there the other day and meant to look and didn't, but is the drawing there a median and does the break not line up with where the cars would be exiting? I don't know. I don't know. I'm seeing this issue. The break doesn't line up with the entry. If you come out from Best Buy across the street, you would go straight and then make a left right there. Right now, current conditions, you wouldn't be able to go. There's a median in the way with the current site layout. So Tina, maybe if you could explain where we expect cars to be entering in. Are they only entering off of Forest? They would be entering from 20th Street. Heading west. Heading west. And then exiting, use the cursor here, exiting here and then there would be an opportunity for internal circulation depending on the choice of the driver, this direction, this direction. But I would also recommend asking the driver. Applicant more detailed questions about how they envision that operation. I'm not concerned about west. I'm concerned about east. Okay. And any potential for somebody to try to take that median and go in front of the exit because there's not really a clear option for what somebody going east should do unless it's turned on Forest. So just to clarify, Commissioner Scott, I think you're describing the exit. The potential for an unauthorized movement of a vehicle traveling east on 20th Street trying to get into the either going over the median or going crosswise against traffic to get in there. Yeah. And I may have experiential a lot of experience with this because I drive a Cohasset every day and there's a Dutch Brothers in my path and there's I would say probably a couple of times a week. Probably at least three times a week somebody makes an illegal maneuver to get all the way over to get to that driveway. An enthusiastic customer base. Anybody else? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. We'll move on to public comments. Anybody from the public wish to speak on this item? Okay. Thank you. We just have one. Thank you. Go ahead. Good evening, members of the commission. My name is Sandra Fox. I'm the senior planner for Barghausen Consulting Engineers. We are the engineer record for Dutch Bros Coffee. Thank you for asking. It's a little awkward at times to correct people and say it's not Dutch Brothers. That was my first mistake on the job. So it's pretty hard with me. Regarding the question on the question on the question on the drawing, this might not look to scale on the drawing, but if you do look at Google Earth or DriveIt, the median is actually quite wide across from the driveway. Someone would be very, very, what was your term, sir? I think I said enthusiastic, but I think determined would work also. Yes. That had to be very enthusiastic or in need of caffeine quite badly in order to make that turn. So if you are heading east on 20th Street, you would need to turn north on Forest in order to get into the WinCo driveway, the shared driveway. And then regarding the impact fees, we will abide by what the city does. We do understand that Dutch Bros does have quite the following, and our service rate is quite high, so we do turn over quite a few customers per hour. But we are happy to be another location here. And we have learned. We have learned that because of our following that we do need quite a few more queuing lanes. So this is one of our new prototypes, and we hope that it works well here. And thank you to staff for working with us through all those iterations. Patience was appreciated. I'm happy to answer any questions. Is the existing landscaping that's kind of on the corner there where there's a WinCo sign, is that all going to remain as is? Correct. We are removing some interior, so the parking strips, the end of the islands, we will remove those, but we are also proposing new for replacement, and then we'll have additional landscaping underneath the existing trees. So we're not taking out any of that landscaping along 20th. Could you explain, are there going to be any efforts to ensure that or to coax drivers to not go into shopping lanes? You know, we have a lot of parking in there, but what, I guess, what's the path of travel that you would be encouraging? Each Dutch Bros has a traffic operations management plan that they create for each site for opening days or sticker days or first day of school, those types of things that are more intense. And so they have their directional signs that they will put out in order to encourage people. We also have what's called a runner and a traffic person who will go out and encourage people to move up or not go where they're trying to go. Anything else? I've got just one out of curiosity, a question. With branding being all important these days, I noticed that the color, the blue color is DB blue. Is that right? Is that Dutch Bros blue? It is Dutch Bros blue. So they've got their own particular color, shade of blue? Yes. Thank you. Great. Thank you for your consideration tonight. Thank you. Anybody else from the public wish to speak? Okay, we'll close the public hearing and bring it back to the Commission for comments and vote. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Anybody? Well, if I could just state simply, a move to approve as recommended by staff in the resolution. We have a motion, do we have a second? I'll second. Okay, motion and second. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Passes unanimously, also. I just want to comment, I think this is the third Dutch Bros that I've seen come to the Planning Commission. Since my time on the Commission and the site design on every single one has been very specific to that site and the challenges. So I really appreciate that you really become a community partner and don't give us a cookie cutter kind of representation of what works for that for other facilities, but really look at the site itself. So thank you for designing to that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh cool. Great. Bruce do you know who these people are? Oh Eric may. I'm really interested. Or Mark do you? On the title? 19 update yeah go ahead thank you mr. chair and commissioners Bruce Ambo principal planner tonight we're presenting the subdivision code update we're thankful that we were able to identify grant funds to get this done we've been worried and kind of nervous because it's been over 20 years since we've updated the subdivision ordinance and we found quite a few things through this process that we're going to be able to achieve significant savings and streamlining on and also some things that we weren't that were part to our attention that we need to improve upon and so I'm going to introduce Eric Norris he's with Interwest and he's our consultant and he did a great job and we've been working with the subcommittee Matt and then Mike Solley Tina and Lane in public works so that we've been working with a subcommittee through the past I don't six eight months and a stakeholder group of about 20 folks that were comprised of engineers surveyors land developers and the like we started to review these folks we'll get into some more of that detail but I'm going to turn the presentation over to Eric and then we're gonna kind of tag-team and go through this all right thank you Bruce if I can get your technology working here all right mr. chairman of the Commission thanks again Eric Norris I'm going to turn this on to the board and we'll see you in a minute if we can get this done in the next few minutes thank you very much and we're going to take a few minutes to get this done in the next few minutes and I'm going to say it's been a pleasure working with Bruce and the staff here they've been very engaged and very helpful in getting the product that you have in front of you to you we're gonna do a few things tonight we're going to give you an overview of the code and the update process we have a summary of some of the key updates we'll talk about the outreach that we did there's a section in our presentation on general plan and CEQA and then we'll wrap up with the staff recommendation but since you asked about who are the guys on the cover let's go actually a little bit farther back than this slide land serving is actually kind of fascinating if you go on the internet you'll see mentions of it going back to 3000 BC and you'll see mentions of Pharaoh using it 1400 BC to do what else to tax property to figure out what property you owed so they can tax it so it may actually be the the oldest profession but here's a little bit of a summary of what we've done in the last couple of years and I'm going to go ahead and in the US this whole process goes back well planning actually goes back to the 1900s the real Supreme Court case that provides the underpinnings for what we all do here goes 1926 but serving goes way back even farther so up on the slide here's a couple of things in 1749 George Washington actually was a land surveyor that was his profession he was eight seventeen years old when he was 17 years old when he was 17 years old when he was 17 years old when he was the county surveyor for newly created frontier County of Culpeper County in Virginia 1803 Thomas Jefferson another one of our founding fathers created what's called the public land survey system they bought the Louisiana purchase and they had to figure out what we had and they sent people out to survey it they surveyed one and a half billion acres during the 1800s Lewis and Clark you've heard of where some of the folks who went out and did that surveying and it was a very successful survey and it was a very successful survey and it remains an integral part of our economy today every time you buy or sell property lease property whatever at some point in that process a land surveyor has touched that so with that by way of background oh and just one more thing here this is actually drawn by George Washington in 1749 plan of Alexandria called now called Belhaven but this looks much like what we do today laying out streets and blocks and saying where all the stuff is but that should give you some idea of what we're dealing with here the subdivision map back that forms the basis for all this stuff is a rather old and I think most planners would agree sort of arcane and hard to use section of the government code it's I mean I've dealt with codes for 40 years now the map back there's one of the hardest to deal with it's just terrible so what we've tried to do with your your subdivision code is sort of put an easier to use interface on top of the subdivision map to make things actually easier to find and easier to use. So here in Chico, you have basically two different titles in your city code. Title 18, which is what we're dealing with tonight, which talks about subdivisions and basically the processes involved in sub-dividing land, creating new subdivisions, moving lot lines, merging parcels, all those kinds of things are in Title 18. Title 18R, which is not part of what we're doing tonight, now gets into even more of the kind of nuts and bolts design criteria, improvement standards, and so on that come into play when you design a subdivision. And as Bruce mentioned, Title 18 was last comprehensively updated about 20 years ago. So it's about time for a refresh. So Title 18, governs how land is subdivided into lots and parcels. So parcel maps, tentative maps, things that you'll commonly see here on your agendas, lot line adjustments, parcel mergers, again, kind of everything to do with defining the boundaries of land and creating land that can be sold or leased. As I mentioned, it's based in large part on the California Subdivision Map Act, which the government code sections are up on the screen here for you. And again, if you're looking for something that's not part of the subdivision map, you can go to the California Subdivision Map Act website, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look it up, look to approve more applications. You have a lot of latitude under state law about who can do various kinds of things. What we tried to do in this update is use that latitude and take that authority and bring it down to the staff level wherever we could and wherever we thought it was appropriate. So you'll see a lot of changes in terms of moving things down in the approval hierarchy from, say, the planning commissioner, the map advisory committee, to staff. We tried to make it easier to use. I think one of the questions came up, can we see a redline version from old to new? And the answer really is no, because it's so substantially changed. We really took the whole thing, reorganized it into a more logical way, but things have moved around a lot, but always with the idea of making things easier to find. So if you're looking for certain kinds of processes, it's all in the same place, like appeals and hearings are all now in the same place. In your current code, they're all kind of scattered in a number of different places. We've taken some unused regulations out. As we were looking through the code, we had some questions like, what is this? And we asked Bruce and his staff, and they said, we don't know, we've never done that. So we took a number of those processes out. We've updated the findings for map approval, which are things that you rely on when you're approving subdivision maps. So we've updated those. There are findings that are here now for final map approval. Now, in this code, that goes down to the director level, but basically, as you know, you get a tentative map approved, there are conditions on the map, satisfy all the conditions, you bring it back with a final map and say, okay, I'm ready to have a final map, and you approve that. One of the findings generally is that the map is in substantial conformance in final form to what was presented as a tentative map, and that's the final map. But your code is much like many others. It doesn't really define how you do that. I've worked with a lot of public works directors. It's just like, well, yeah, I know it when I see it. It looks kind of the same. So we've provided some guidelines in here, or some findings, rather, to help make that decision. When that final map comes in, is it in substantial conformance? It's like, I think, a five-part test. If you can make those findings, then you approve the final map. Okay. All right. All right. All right. One of the things we've added in here is what's called a finance map. I'm not sure you see those too often here, but you see them quite often in many other parts of the state. Typically, if a developer is doing, say, a large subdivision, several hundred units, they will typically divide that into different pieces. Then they record that map in phases. What you do then is you either call the finance map or an A map and a B map. So the first map would take that whole area, and divide it up into, say, three or four or five larger parcels that correspond with the phases that they're going to record. And then you take those several hundred lots and record them in chunks of, say, 50, 100, whatever. So it's a common practice in other parts of the state. You simply didn't have it in your code. So that is another tool you'll have now for the development community. And then the last thing, and Bruce is going to get into this in a little more detail, one thing that came up for us, and I think it's a little bit more of a challenge, fairly recently, actually, just in the last day or so, regards letting the city council know about subdivision maps. This gets back to the issue now of staff being able to approve final maps. And it was pointed out to us that there is actually a section in the Map Act, I mentioned it's hard to find stuff in there, so it's not amazing that we overlooked it, that requires now the director to tell the city council, hey, I'm going to approve a final map, in case they have some kind of heartburn with that. Like, oh my God, Bruce, what are you doing? And they can put it on their agenda and take action on it themselves. Do you want me to do this or do you want to do this, Bruce? I can go through it. Okay. So Bruce is going to take over now. I'll be here if you have any questions about anything that we've done. We'll be happy to dive into the weeds of any of this stuff for you and explain why the code is what it is. Thank you. Thank you, George. Thank you. So the changes are highlighted here. The director would now approve lot line adjustment, parcel mergers, and minor land divisions. Those were formerly with the map advisory committee. Now they've been pushed down to the director level. And parcel map has been moved down. That parcel map is a subdivision of four or less lots. So those are minor subdivisions, four or less lots. Those were before used to be approved at the planning commission. And you've seen them before. Those would be pushed down to the map advisory committee. The same protections for appeals. If somebody's agreed by decision to remain in place, those decisions can be appealed to the council. So all of those protections for appeals are still remaining in place. Those... These are the real... The... This just identifies some of the major components of the changes. There aren't any real big changes here that I want to talk about other than just notifying that these are components of extensions. These are normal certificates of compliance. These are minor and major mapping amendments. Here are some changes where we've added finance maps that are approved by the Map Advisory Committee. And then we've delegated the authority for subdivision improvement agreements, which is not in there. But now we've created that the director has the authority to approve subdivision improvement agreements, which are a common occurrence through the subdivision process, to ensure that the bonding and everything else is in place for the improvements, because they are substantial. Moving on, one of the things I want to talk about, this came up fairly recently, is that the MAP Act requires that the director notify the council of maps that are submitted at the next regularly scheduled meeting. So we're going to create a process to do that, and we'll provide them. These notices to council. Similarly, the clerk provides written notice of pending approvals by the director. So we will transmit something to the clerk's office, and that notice will be attached and posted to the council agenda and mailed to the interested parties that request to be on that list for that item. The director, whether it has to approve or disapprove those maps within 10 days of that notice being published on that agenda, council agenda. So everything is going to be keyed to the posting date on those council agendas. And then, of course, the decision of the director can be appealed within 10 days. So this noticing procedure is similar to what we have now for administrative use permits and wireless telecommunication facilities. We send notices 10 days in advance. We tell them, we'd like your comments. Tell us if you have any concerns. Share them with us. Because the director, he has to make a determination on this date. And from that date, there will be 10 days from which you can appeal that decision and who it goes to and so on and so forth. That's how the notices will go out. And that's the same notice that we'll embed into this council notification procedure. Just wanted to highlight that because it's going to be a new thing that we're going to start doing. And we haven't been doing it, but it's required. Okay. One of the upsides, one of the things that we revealed through this process is this is a requirement. It's important. What's the reason for that new requirement? Do you know? I don't really know. It was new to us, and I got a lengthy memo from the city attorney on why we had to do it and why it's important. So it's not a kind of a let's discuss. It was a tell. You have to do this. So as I mentioned at the beginning, we had assembled a group of stakeholders, got some good feedback right at the outset. And, you know, we haven't done this in a long time. So we were happy to get some. These are seasoned professionals. This is highly technical stuff. So there's only a limited group of people, the people that we formed that were able to really help us, that were conversant. These kinds of technicalities of subdivision ordinances and designing subdivisions, they were very helpful. So and we had people from public works and planning. And so we kind of tag teamed on this thing. And we provided notices. And we've got a Web page, excuse me, too, that has this ordinance, some of the backup materials like your conversion table and some of the other things on our Web site for folks to take a look at it. The most current version. The August 1st version is posted on there, the clean version without any red lines. For general plan consistency, these amendments are consistent with the general plan policy framework to establish regulations for the orderly growth, development, and subdivision of property within the community and to simplify and streamlining the permitting process for greater regulatory efficiency. And from a CEQA standpoint, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, obviously, point out, I transmitted two memos to you. One of them forwarded some concerns from the Chico Builders Association. They had concerns about improvements to delaying improvements for parcel maps. We don't think that's, we're not recommending that because fundamentally subdivision is a land development activity versus a property development activity. And we believe the burden should be on the land developer, not the property developer, i.e. the homeowner, to do those improvements. And there's I've explained it in a little bit more detail in my memo. Furthermore, you could have a situation where you could have a subdivision where you'd only have one lot that's developed and the other one next door is vacant, where you could have sidewalks where there are only sidewalks in front of developed properties. And we don't, that's not in the public interest. It's also an ADA issue, too, where you need to have sidewalks that connect. So that's our answer to that. The other things in response to the Builders Association concerns, we can, we don't really, they also had a question about the fee title of dedications. And in my memo, I said that we're not in support of that, but in addition to that, Nate has, he's informed me that the public works director said that they're going to, behind this, they're going to do a process to upgrade Title 18R, which are the development standards and design specifications. And the conversation on the conveyance of land can happen during that process. And during that process, if there's anything that needs to change back at 19 to fine-tune, we can certainly do that, too. So that's not an absolutely no to that. We'll talk about that later through a separate process. One thing we're asking the planning commission to do is, they've asked for noticing to be reduced to 300 feet. We're suggesting 500 feet because it's consistent with use permits, zone changes, and what we've been doing. But it's really up to the planning commission. We have 500 feet noticing for major planning entitlements. 100 foot for minor planning entitlements. And if the planning commission is comfortable with 300, we could live with it. It just makes it easier to have everything noticed at the same radius. It makes it a little differently to have 500, 300, 100, and then the joining neighbors. Whatever the preferences of the planning commission is, we could live with it. And then they also wanted us to codify that we're required, we're required to comply with the Permit Streamlining Act. And we're required to comply with the Permit Streamlining Act no matter what. And we're required to comply with the California Environmental Equality Act too. So there's no need, in our opinion, to identify regulations that are effective life that we have to deal with that supersede all of our ordinances anyway. So we just think we have to do that no matter what. That's not an option. So that addresses the concerns. Concerns from the Builders Association or the staff perspective in response to those concerns. And then you got two pages of quite a few kind of technical changes from the city attorney. Those are technical, legal kinds of things that we didn't think were substantive. The substantive portions were the things about the noticing with the council procedures that I did discuss. And if you want some more, we can talk about that. Other than that, I think we're recommending our recommendation is to approve these amendments with the city attorney's changes completely. And then if you, and then give us direction on what you'd like to do with the noticing radius for maps. That concludes my presentation. If you have any questions, we'd be happy to answer them. I have a question. You touched on the Chico Builders Association's response to, can you maybe just recap North Star Engineering's questions and how those were addressed? Yeah. Maybe Eric, we can, excuse me. Most of the, most recent, we answered and addressed most of those, and those were like here's the answer. We made the change. The, there was some question and confusion over extending time extensions, for vesting track maps. And a vesting map is a different kind of a subdivision map because it vests the entitlement with the regulations that are in place at that time. So for example, it vests, if you've got certain building code regulations or grading regulations, any of the like, it vests with those regulations and they're not subject to those. And they were concerned that those may not go forward with an extension of time and they do. So if we extend, the time extension, the whole map and all the vested rights get extended with it. Thank you. Okay. One question first. If you could go back to the approval authorities. Yeah. And my question is on the changes to an approved tentative subdivision map. Is that on there? So, as Eric touched on, the first layer that we go through is substantial conformance and we've added some findings for substantial conformance. And we've been pretty liberal with substantial conformance. But if you're getting, for example, if you're adding lots or if you're changing the circulation pattern or moving streets out to different places, those are major changes that would trigger an amended map or which is, in fact, a new map. It would shorten the review process somewhat. So it's kind of an amended map as a shorter review, internal review process. Yeah. I think my question was, and I understand that we currently have it as the existing authority with the Map Advisory Committee, but the Planning Commission actually has the decision on an approved tentative subdivision map. So if there's a change, there were significant changes, why wouldn't that come back to the Planning Commission? It would. It would. Yes. Yeah. Unless, yeah, we, go ahead, Eric. But we've got, we've provided some criteria for what substantial conformance is to help guide the decision. To give it some... So when you say changes, it's more minor changes could be. Okay. Substantial conformance, but it's, we tried to take the subjectivity out of it. And give it some more, more of a framework to make those determinations from. Yeah. Bruce is exactly right. The changes here, if you want to just insert the word minor, kind of, it's very minor things. If you go beyond that, you're now in the realm of a new map and this Planning Commission would see it again as a new map. And really, my concern was just that public hearing again and having the opportunity for the public to weigh in on it. It's in their interest to stay in conformance, with the map they got approved. I mean, and they do. They, almost all the time. So, it's rare. But it happens. Okay. Thank you. Bruce, just to be clear, the City of Chico is in compliance with SB 330? Like, that you make sure that they, like, for the Permit Streamlining Act? Yes. Absolutely. Yes. Yeah. That's a real, yes, those go out. And we're very well aware of the first 30 days. And that's, you know, it's a key thing. Yes. Thank you, Bruce. Thank you, Eric. I forgot just a couple questions. Thanks. First, I'd just like to say thanks to staff for putting this all together. This is really esoteric stuff. So, it's pretty dry, but it's really important. It's fun. It's fundamental to the development of our community. And it's kind of the unsung hero of the planning process and project approval. So, thanks. I think overall, it's a great job. I was wondering about the changes insofar as they may affect the level of public noticing and public involvement. Seems like we're, I think, going in the right direction, getting things down to the lowest possible level so we can keep things that aren't a big deal moving along. But would there always be the possibility of the director saying, hey, this is actually looking like a more significant project that might have some controversy where they could, you know, say, well, we're not going to handle it that way. We're going to take it to the planning commission. You know, I've seen parcel maps where it's clearly, it's no big deal. And then some parcel maps become, you know, a knock-down, drag-out fight that goes on for years. So I just want to make sure that there's that kind of, you know, discretion. Absolutely. If need be, there's a code for that so we aren't just shutting that process out. Yes. Okay. And then just on the subject of substantial conformance, I think it's good that there be an understanding of what the expectations are. It's always been a dicey area. Because especially when you have maps that are going on, a ton of the maps that are maybe alive for five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten plus years now. Yes. And then you end up realizing there's actually a better way to do this. I think it's important that we provide flexibility to acknowledge that in our code. And I'm just a little concerned. Maybe we're getting a little too specific on that here. But on one point, I think it's established in the Map Act as to the number of lots. Is that just a hard and fast rule as to the number of lots you can't increase them? Or is there any flexibility on that point at all under the Subdivision Map Act? I don't have that in front of me right now. I don't know if it says anything specific about that. But we talked about this amongst ourselves. And it just seemed to us that going beyond the number of lots really just started getting into the realm of, well, you really need to re-subdivide and come up with another, bring in a new map. Because then you could get into questions of, well, can I create one more lot or two or ten? Or when does that elastic stretch too far? So it seemed cleaner to us to just say, well, if you have a hundred lot subdivision, you have a hundred lots. If you want 110 lots, come back and bring in a new map. I'm sorry. I don't mean to go offhand of the reads on this. But I'm imagining, for example, a scenario where you had a phased map and you found that you wanted to record a phase, but after X number of years, it seems like it actually makes more sense to make some kind of different configurations. You end up with a few more lots there. Would that be possible as long as the overall... That is our current practice. I'm glad you brought that up because that's a good example where they've shifted densities within phases. We've approved maps like that. Under our current procedures. And we continue to do so. As long as the overall number was the same, you could move shells, so to speak. Thanks. We could get to substantial performance if the overall number was still in line. Thank you. Anybody else have a comment? We'll open it up to the public. Chair Wall, I have one speaker. It should be Chris Gempoli. Hi, Nat. Larry, how you doing? Great. You? Good. Good to see you. Staff has done an excellent job on Title 18. We have minor comments that we'd like for you guys to entertain. Bruce has done a good job of explaining what Chico Builders Association brought up. One of the items, if we can handle at 18R, as far as over-fee ownership, the question about that is when the subdivision is done and the city takes over the actual easements for the street from back of sidewalk to back of sidewalk, who owns the dirt that's underneath it? And the county handles it in a way where it's the center of street to the property owner's back property. So it's something, if we could talk about in 18R or however it needs to get revised, it would be fantastic. It's minor, but it's something, if we could be able to talk to them afterwards, it would be great. Don't disagree with Bruce on the 30 days. They've been excellent about getting it back. We were trying to get it codified. But if it's state law, why not just leave it the way it is and off it goes. We agree with Bruce on that. And they've been doing an excellent job, Maggie, by the way, of getting that 30 days turned back for us. We may not always have all the answers we want, but we can be able to turn it around and do it again if it's not complete. The second item, that was on there, was a 300-foot notice. That's how it has been. It went out to 500 feet. We were just recommending if it could stay at 300. That's a planning commission decision that I haven't yet. The more, I'm not going to say controversial, but the more I think of a burden as a parcel map situation, and Bruce brings up the being of piece milling of improvements. And so I'll use an example of an infill project that just occurred. And it was in half an acre, and they wanted to split, there was a home on it, so they needed to split it into other parcels. But the problem is when you do the parcel map, to get those two other parcels, you have to put all the improvements in before you can do any construction. So the problem with that is you don't know where your sewer is at, or you don't know where your water is going to go, and on and on and on. Right? And if you have vertical curve versus where your DI's are going to go, or what have you, you go there, you don't know what you're going to build yet, then you go on to build it, and they might not be in the same place. They might not be in the right spot. So you're cutting back the street and you're doing a lot of stuff after the dot. But at the same time, those who are infill projects like that, that's a huge upfront cost to somebody to go put in $50,000, $100,000, $200,000 in improvement to get your parcel split. And the idea of splitting the parcel is so that you'll be able to you might want to live on your say you have five acres, and you have a house on it, and you want to keep half an acre of it, and the four and a half acres, you're ready to be able to subdivide it. Well, the problem is, okay, you go to do the parcel map to sell the four and a half acres, you want to keep your half acre, and you have to go to the four and a half. You might have 900 feet of improvements that you need to do, and that costs $200,000, $300,000, $400,000. So I think this is if we could work with staff in a way to be able to, maybe there's a middle man in this situation, or it's finding a compromise in a way, I think you're going to see more infill development. I think it will encourage housing, and you're going to have maybe a lot of those smaller projects that will start popping up because they don't have those up front costs. So anyhow, I'm sure that's my timeless thing to get out of here. There's nobody else to speak. The next person could be me if I put two projects. I know it is, but I'm going to do it. If you have more suggestions for us, go ahead. You know, those four are it. And again, these guys did an excellent job. You'd like to see those included in the motion. I would. Yeah, that would be fantastic. Thank you. See what we can do. Anybody else? I have no other speakers. Oh, I got one. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I just... Go ahead. I'm Keith Dolio. I'm with the Builders Association also. And I guess I'm just... adding to what Chris said. Like he said, staff's been great. They've worked with the CBA. We've been able to add input, and they've been receptive. It's been really good. And I think the changes that were shown on the table, approval, I mean, that's... I think it's great. It's going to help with projects and just more housing in general. I was interested in the first item in the letter. Chris talked about it. He talked about the... the cost and improving housing. I thought it was worth mentioning that there's the idea that it could be piecemeal. You know, like Chris's example, it's three parcels. You could divide it. If you don't require frontage, you could get piecemealed. But really, that's kind of normal in a way. Because if I own a vacant lot and I go build a house on it, I have to put in the frontage with the building permit. So really what he's asking for isn't any different than normal. And it just seems like, like Chris says, there's probably a middle ground we can find here with this. So that's all I have. Any other questions? I'm happy to answer. Thank you very much. I got it on my phone. I tried to print it out. It didn't quite function. Anyhow, I just... Your name, sir? Hi. I'm Dave Maitry. I've been resident here for about 25 years. And I just was started... I'm here because I'm concerned about affordable housing and climate change and that sort of thing. So I'll just read my spiel. And I read through some of this, trying to grasp some ideas on that. So thank you for contributing to Chico by serving on the board. It can be tough sometimes and sometimes boring. But exciting. My name is Dave Maitry. I've lived in Chico 25 years. I'm requesting that you recommend the draft subdivision ordinance to be formatted to allow for differently defined subdivisions based on their impact to city services. Examining city impacts from development on residential lot splits as compared to development on residential lots with no lot splits and similar sized or larger splits or new development needing more infrastructure improvements. Defining lot splits based on the impact of each type has on the Chico infrastructure velocity of Chico and residents clearer way to examine and make decisions to develop clearer policy. And kind of to put that into the way I was kind of thinking is since SB9 passed and that allows for lot splits and there's a lot of different city regulations that deal with lot splits and parcels and I was thinking through my head like what if you had a crazy idea but what if you had a there's a single family lot and you you divided a lot split between the garage and the house and then you converted the garage to a separate residential unit without any further development so it pretty much keeping the same size. So I'm looking at that type of impact they would have on city services compared to right now how you can have one residential dwelling unit and then you could build junior accessory dwelling units and another accessory dwelling unit on it. So just kind of side by side and then the effect of the longevity of when the those through the years if you do have a lot split that's has the same similar impacts to one non-lot split with the added accessory dwelling units that would lead to more like affordable lots on the market as time went by so people could afford them so anyhow that's a lot to this so I just wanted to I'm excited to be here presenting for the first time in a couple years so thank you. Thank you Dave. Thank you. Anybody else? Seeing none we'll close the public comments bring it back. Comments? Motion? I am definitely a fan of increasing the noticing to 500 feet. These type of public decisions require transparency and noticing because we are doing this on behalf of the public and I've also done noticing for 500 feet for many types of projects it's not that much of a difference just to allow for increased transparency and I do agree with Bruce for frontage improvements it's I live in a neighborhood where it's piecemeal for sidewalk I go running it's very hard and so it'd be great to have the frontage improvements keep the same. I would I would agree I think also with your point about the! respect to the 500 foot noticing I think just consistency makes it more predictable as far as administration is concerned people get confused when you have all kinds of different standards depending upon the type of project type of entitlement that's being involved I think that's important just in terms of efficiency and I like the idea of staging the the improvements you know lot by lot I think that there's some merit to that I think that the it could work in some cases but other cases it probably wouldn't and so it's hard to predict when that would be the case or not be the case are they just sticking with the current standards is probably the way to go. Is in lieu fees an option like instead of building the curb gutter sidewalk having a fund for that neighborhood and so once it's once there's enough lots then having the frontage improvements? It's a case-by-case scenario that we evaluate sometimes in lieu fees are given in very undeveloped areas but if there's already established curb gutter sidewalk we typically require the development to put in the frontage improvements. I'm wondering and maybe this is getting a little bit lost but could you define minor because I think that's the point that the Chico Builders Association is making on kind of having that that burden on a minor. I'm wondering and maybe this is getting a little bit lost but could you define minor because I think that's the point that the Chico Builders Association is making on kind of having that that burden on a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. a minor. the director can approve those, or under the proposed scenario would be able to approve them. So that's an important distinction, because a parcel map means they don't have the improvements, and that's the only time we're going to get them, is when they subdivide. And then I guess my other point, if we're talking about streamlining and having consistency, the issue is we added inconsistency. And that's what they're saying. The proposed changes would notify owners within 500 feet of certain maps, and then within 300 feet for other ones. So let's either keep everything at 300 or keep everything at 500. Correct? We have. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. But I think wireless goes to 1,000, right? Yeah, wireless goes to 1,000. Major subdivisions go. And use permits in zone changes are 500. Administrative use permits go to the adjoining property owners, and some go to 100 feet. So it really matters on the weight of the entitlement and the level of just how high the potential impact is with the project on the surrounding environment. Generally speaking, the lower the radius, the more benign the improvements. Is SB 9 being codified, or is it similar to SB 330? SB 9 is codified. And at the end of the day, that's a parcel map, too. Anybody else? Yeah. This is just my comment to the board. I think if the radius as it currently stands, we're going to be able to get it to 300 feet, 1,000 feet, 100 feet, depending on what the project is. If it seems to be working, why change it? So I would actually suggest that in this particular update that we just keep it as is at the 300 feet, even though it sounds like it's not always 300 feet. I also do feel, especially with campgrounds, that the amount of fire, COVID, housing, what you think you're going to build initially, it changes so many times. And I do feel that it's kind of putting the cart before the horse in certain instances by putting your improvements in when you don't necessarily know for sure what's going to go there. So then you're taking stuff out, which, again, costs a lot of money. It costs money as well. But I do think that those improvements are important and need to be done. So I'm probably going to suggest, and this is kind of for discussion, that we add a condition in here that the improvements are upon final map improvement, or excuse me, final approval of final map, or similar verbiage. So we don't want Swiss cheese, but we also don't want to be putting in and taking out. And then I would just also suggest that we do make a condition for the, in the street easements, we just make a condition that those be refined in 18R when those changes are made, or excuse me, looked at. Anybody else? Also, I have tried to put this, so you have to build a sidewalk, give you some, but it might change. It might get torn up. They want a medium, so what does that mean? That's so, you're saying that. Is that something that would be, well, did you turn it on? We need to hear you. So that's something that it seems could be a good medium, so, okay. Bruce, could you give us an example? And I, again, want to go back to that minor. So tell me what the process would look like if Chris is doing a minor land division. What does that look like? Oh, a minor land division has a definition of our code, which means we're a curb, gutter, and sidewalk, and all the improvements are in place. But if we're thinking of a smaller, like a three or four lot subdivision, a smaller subdivision, that would mean that they would have to build or post a bond for the improvements for curb, gutter, and sidewalk to be constructed along all the frontages. And the benefit to that is many times we'll have them assign where the curb, gutter's going to be. Because public works will want to know where the traffic's going to be coming out of. And what it means is you're going to have to make a commitment at some point. I appreciate that, yeah, there's going to be, once they have to build a house, there may be some damage to the curb, gutter, and sidewalk through the construction activity. That happens, but that's the normal process now. What they're proposing is something different than what we've been doing. So, yeah. Is there a process between, because we're saying when the, they want when the building permit's issued. We're saying when, is there anything in between there where that could be a compromise? Well, they are right though. For example, if this was a historic lot that never had curb, gutter, and sidewalk, the homeowner would be required to build curb, gutter, and sidewalk. And that, and it's also an ADA. And that's an ADA issue too, where you want to have a traversable frontage. So I guess what I'm asking is, is there any point in the process between a parcel map recording and the building permit being issued where the city would see that there would be a natural place where there could be a compromise on where those improvements would be required? Are there any other steps in between there? Maybe Nat has so much ideas. I don't have any ideas off the top of my head, but we'd be willing to work with them during the Title 18 update to come up with any new processes that they want to work towards. And to tell you, that is, those standards is when that kind of stuff should be dealt with. It's design specifications and development standards is in 18R. This is more process and procedures. So it's more of a germane conversation. It's a conversation to occur in 18R as opposed to under here where we're talking about how the process works and flows. Yeah, and I guess all my comments are I really don't see Chris as the poster child for this. I'm thinking more of average homeowner, small lot that's kind of faced with these burdens that might prevent them from subdividing and providing more housing that we need. Not that you're not doing a great job providing housing. I think there's been some good points made here. And I kind of divided myself on this question of, you know, when do the improvements need to go in. I think that, though, in the end, in a more urban environment like this, it's important to get them all in at the same time and provide continuity and uniformity. And there are tradeoffs here. Yeah, there could be situations where you need to go back in later and, you know, move a curb cut or something like that. I think that in the event of a more rural subdivision, where you're dealing with very large lots out in the county or something like that, and the improvement standards are minimal as compared to the city standards where maybe you don't even have sidewalk requirements, curb requirements, things like that, it really makes a lot more sense there. But I think in a more urban environment where you have pretty intense improvement requirements and a density of activity around it, I think it's important to maintain the current practice. Any other comments? Who would like to make the motion? Mm-hmm. Go ahead. Okay. Let me try to get this. So I will make the... So I move that the project be moved. That the Planning Commission adopt Resolution Number 23-04, recommending that the City Council determine the project categorically exempt from further environmental review pursuant to CEQA Section 15061 and adopt the update to Title 18-7 Division Orders of the Chico Municipal Code with the additional conditions that the street easements be refined in 18-R. And I'd also like to keep the radius as is. You're talking about the 300-foot notification versus 500? Yes. Second. Okay. I accept a friendly amendment to include the City Attorney changes and the four recommendations from the City Council. Chris from the Builders. Yes. Okay. I'm sorry. Could you clarify that again, Mr. Chairman? We'll add in the City Attorney's changes, the ones that he or she wants, and the four recommendations that the Builders under Chris Gempali recommended. So to clarify, the City Attorney changes are the memo dated August 3, 2023, that says, Subject Subdivision Ordinance Update City Attorney Changes. So, Mr. Chairman, can you clarify, for my benefit, when you say the four things that the Builders want, does that mean that we're doing those or we're not doing those? That we would be doing those. And I'll ask the Builders to provide you with the details. And I'll ask the Board to provide you a copy of those four items. They gave us the letter. Okay. Is that got the information that you need? Well, the motion was just two of those items, I think. Two of the four. Okay. Well, I added all four in my amendment. Okay. So we need a second. I think you're going to need to amend your motion. So I would recommend that you do a new motion. A what? There should be a new motion. A substitute motion, yeah. Yes. Okay. Anybody want to make that one? I think that's you, Larry. As a matter of procedure, Mr. City Attorney, are we in a position where we could have two motions on the floor at the same time? There was one motion by Commissioner Pullen that was seconded. Then Chairman Wald then made another motion. I believe that might have been seconded. I ask for federal amendment to her motion to include the City Attorney's changes, which are in that letter, and the four recommendations the Builders have asked for. Okay. I thought the City Attorney's was more... Yeah, I thought the City Attorney's memo was different. Yeah. I only heard the City Attorney changes. So we have two memos. We're recommending the City Attorney's. That's with our recommendation. Okay. It includes the City Attorney's changes. And I think Commissioner Pullen identified two of the four, and now you're asking to include all four in the affirmative. That's what my amendment was to include all four in the motion. Okay. Well, Bruce... My recommendation would be to... Would be what? To restate your actual motion, because there is confusion as to what was being moved. How about you withdraw your motion, and then we just start over? Yes. Okay. I agree. Okay. Motion withdrawn. Okay. Anyone want to start it over? What? Why don't you start over? Let's go with yours. Okay. Okay. All right. So I will make a motion to approve Planning Commission Adoption of Resolution Number 23-4 per the conditions contained within the staff report, and with the additions of the street easements being better refined in the 18R code amendments, changes that are forthcoming, and the condition that we stay with the current radiuses used depending on the project. 300 feet. 300 feet. 300 feet. Okay. And the City Attorney changes? And the City Attorney, which is my understanding is included in staff recommendations. Second. Now, how do we add in the recommendations from the builders? I'm sorry. You'd have to have a separate motion. Well, Mr. Chair, if we could. So if we go through those four things. So their first item talks about the frontage improvements. I think that's covered in the motion here. That's an 18R issue. The second one deals with the noticing, which is part of the motion. Item three is project completeness within 30 days, as Bruce discussed. That's already covered in your codes, so it doesn't need to be part of this code. And then Title 4, the number 4 is the project completeness within 30 days, as Bruce discussed. Item five is about accepting public roads in fee. Again, that's an 18R issue. So I think we've addressed everything in here. So a couple of those are going to be addressed in the 18R update. The completeness already in place and the 300 foot noticing is the only change really that would arise from their letter that is part of the motion already. So I think we've addressed everything in their letter. Okay. We've got a motion. We've got a motion and a second. What I'd add, and maybe this is what we're not doing is we're taking item one and saying to have further discussion on that during 18R. We're not approving that tonight. And it does sound like there are the city's amenable to hearing kind of opportunities there. It sounds like there could be. There could be a lot of creative thoughts on how that would go forward. And that's probably not a discussion we should be having, but the people who are actually involved in that. So that would be why I would support the motion that Commissioner Polk will put forward. Mr. Gimelli, have we addressed your interest? If it's an 18R, my understanding of 18R is that's kind of the basis to curb gutter and sidewalk and street improvements. So if that can be handled in that portion of the motion, I would support that. I'm not 100% sure if that's where it's done. It seems like it should be done in the area of parcel maps and minor land addition. But you guys tell me, Bruce knows where that should be handled. And that. That'll be an 18R discussion, Matt. Yes, that's what the public works director told Nat and I. And we have it in our motion that it'll be discussed in 18R. Right. Whether, yeah. I'm sorry. That's the intent of my motion. That looks fair. So we have a motion. Do we have a second? I second it. Second. Hold it. Before we vote, just a clarification, my apologies, is that the motion does not include a change to allow for the kind of the piecemealing of improvements, correct? It does not. It would be a continued discussion. Thank you, Mr. Chair. All in favor? Aye. Aye. All opposed? Motion carries. Thank you, Mr. Chair. All right, so much for that one. We have nothing on the regular agenda. Reports and communications. Bruce, do you have anything for us? Yes, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to remind you that I sent you an email about training opportunities, and I just wanted to let you know that there are three conferences on the horizon, one of which is the California APA Conference. That's coming up in September. And we prefer to send the newest members that haven't gone or that haven't had any training. So if anybody's interested in any one of these, contact Nicole or me, and we'll get you registered. But do that as soon as possible, because hotels go fast, registration is cheaper, and everything else. So there is, I've noticed there's another conference, the California Chapter of the American Plan, excuse me. The California APA Conference. The California County Planning Commissioners Association. Also having a conference in Tuolumne County in October. League of Cities has their annual one. That's a year from now. That's next year in March. We've sent people to that before, too. So. I'm trying to see if I can get the APA Conference done through work, but if I can't, I would want to notify you. Sure. Yes. Yeah. So, and we do it on whoever hasn't had training, and pretty much all of you haven't. So let us know if you're interested. And then the other thing is we do have an item on for the 17th. So we'll have a subdivision at your next meeting. It'll be under the current rules. All right. We are adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. We're adjourned. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
