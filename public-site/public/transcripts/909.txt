 Call to order the special Chico City Council meeting of June 23rd, 2020. Begin with pledge allegiance to the flag, so if you'll all please rise and join me. Salute and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Madam Clerk, could I have you call the roll, please? Yes. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ory? Yes. Council Member Reynolds? Yes. Council Member Stone? Yes. Thank you. Vice Mayor Brown? Here. And Mayor Schwab? Here. This is a special agenda. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the public shall have an opportunity to address the Council by email and or engage Chico on any item described in the agenda before or during consideration of that item, as per Government Code 54954.3a. The City Council is prohibited by law from considering any other business. The City Council is permitted to introduce any other business at this meeting since it is a special meeting. This meeting is being conducted in accordance with the executive order in 2920. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via our streaming video on the City's website found under Minutes and Agendas View Meetings Online. Public comments will be accepted by email. And those emails can be sent to publiccomments at chico.ca.ca. during the meeting prior to the close of the public comment on an item. The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email. We'll begin the meeting with the consent agenda. The consent agenda is for those things that are routine in nature and can be acted on in one motion. Are there any council disqualifications or no votes? I'd like to pull item 3.3. 3.3. Are there any public comments on this item? Excuse me. Yes, I have two comments on item 3.1. Six comments on 3.2 and 15 on 3.3 and those are in the packet. Those are from the Engage Chico platform. Okay. And then were there any emails sent in on the public comments? No. Okay. So we will take just a minute to review the comments. All these comments have been turned in to us. They are sent in via the civic engagement platform or Engage Chico platform and we have had since the agenda was published to be reviewing them. Reason why the one minute time frame. We will take as long as any council member needs to review them. So two minutes. And Mayor Schwab, did you still want me to read their names into the record? Yes. Okay. All right. We received comments from Haley Bell, Nathaniel Perry, and! Theodore Ushas, Chaz Kelly, Steven Breedlove, Jules Brown, Julie Threat, Yvonne Johnson. Let's see if this item. Yes. Haley Bell. Some of them. So these were three items. Kari Logan, Jessalyn Ayers, Madison Shea, William Culbertson, Bryce Goldstein, Nathaniel Perry, Kate Admeyer, Theodore Yuls, Julie Threat, Lincoln Bone, Leonard Ross, Susan Smead, Barbara Noble Allinger, Natasha See. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Does anybody need any more additional time? So consent agenda, we've had the request to pull 3.3. I'll entertain a motion to approve or discuss any of the other items on consent agenda. Move to approve. Motion to approve. Is there a second? Second. Motion and a second to Council Member Huber. Please call the roll. Thank you. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ory? Yes. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. And Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 7-0. Okay. So item 3.3 has been requested to be pulled by Vice Mayor Brown. Yeah, City Manager Orm, I have a redundant question for you, and I'm sorry to make you answer it again. But can you explain what we are approving this evening? I think there's a lot of misunderstanding in the public about it, and so I was just hoping you could reiterate it. So if you wouldn't mind, I'm going to have Ms. Martin come up and answer that question if she would like. But is this just the final budget? Yes. Okay. All right. Never mind. I thought it was the other one. So all right. We're good. So in a nutshell, the City Council has allowed for a more prudent approach as it relates to budgeting for this upcoming fiscal year. Rather than authorizing a brand new budget for the upcoming fiscal year, we've done as close to a rollover budget. So we've done as much as we can to make sure that we're as efficient as you can possibly do under the circumstances. This will allow staff to be able to come back to City Council after knowing the true impacts in the second quarter, fiscal impacts for sales tax, so that then the City Council can have a more thorough evaluation of each department and the funding that we are requesting for those departments. I believe from a holistic perspective, this is the best approach to take, because it will then allow you to know what we're actually working with. Mm-hmm. This is fairly draconian for an organization that looks to try to serve the public and grow on an annual basis in areas of vital need that the City Council outlines for us. But that is the times that we're in, and we anticipated having $6 million additional in this budget that are not in this. So I hope that helps, and if there's any further clarity I can give, I'd be happy to. Yeah. Just a couple more questions. Sure. So if the public wants additional input into the budget process, they will have the opportunity to provide that input between now and October when we do a deeper dive. Is that correct? That's absolutely correct, and that will be the first meeting in October as we expect to bring this back to City Council. Okay. And then with now being appropriate time, there's another issue that I was hoping to kind of be worked into those conversations. It seemed like this would be appropriate time to make that request, but I welcome your input on that. Yeah. For the Councils. Sure. Just something I would love to have reviewed during the budget session in October. So I want to lay just like a little bit of background, because it's a little bit of a long one. So this might come as a surprise to Council, and I welcome any questions that you have about it. But again, it's just looking at incorporating this into the budget. Since the Camp Fire, as many of us know, there was kind of an escalation in the conversation about the rise in domestic violence as reported by the Chico Police Department. And since that report, I've had several conversations related to this issue. In addition to the presentation we received from Catalyst Domestic Violence Services, I had conversations with Mr. Orme, the former Chief of Police, the City Attorney, to really look at ways that we can build a stronger collaboration with our DV service providers, who are arguably the best equipped to provide support and advocacy to those who are victimized by abuse by a partner. So just to lay a little bit more out, during COVID-19, victims are often stuck in closer proximity to abusive partners, have less access to supportive resources, and tend to be more isolated. And during our presentation from Catalyst, they stated that one thing we can do to help provide a stronger response is through a better referral system. So we've had programs that have enabled that in the past. Divert, I know we've had this conversation, you are aware of this, and those programs are grant funded. So I'd just like to have a discussion in October, which is incidentally the Domestic Violence Awareness Month, about developing, looking at a funded contractual agreement with a local DV provider that enhances our response to victims and survivors. So that's what I'm going to do. One of the issues is kind of this data sharing issue, so that referrals can be made to the domestic violence provider to follow up with, or to be immediately responsive to incidents of domestic violence that the police are sent out to. In these conversations that I've had with the nonprofit and city staff, I basically just asked for a ballpark, what could an agreement like this look like? They actually have them with the Oroville Police Department. It lives somewhere in the world of $105,000. And I'd like for this to be considered for further discussion during the budget session. So that's my request and welcome questions, but wanted to add that in. I think that bringing that up now is the real appropriate time to bring that up. I had a very interesting conversation this morning with Gretchen Bender, our grants writer for, that is her complete title. And I think that's a great opportunity to bring that up. She talked about kind of targeting how she looks at what our needs are for a city. And those, I think those needs should come up during the budget process. That each year, department heads and council, or council is setting the policy, but department heads are coming up with goals within their particular areas. And the council, should honor that, or when they develop their budgets for each particular department, those initiatives should have some funding. So, and then similarly, at the end of the year, they should be reporting out how they did on those goals. So, identifying what goals they have, putting those in the budget. But there are probably going to be always goals that may not fit the budget. Or that particular funding needs. And then to be able to put those into a list of unfunded priorities that could be identified for future grants that we could procure and, so we would know what those budget priorities were. Both by council and by the departments. And so, by you bringing up an item that you would like to see, how we could work that into the budget. And then, by the way, if we were to put those into a particular department's goal, I think that it's appropriate now, and for us to be looking for other particular goals that we might want to have, whether we can fund them, and I hope that we can find some funding for this particular one. But if there are others, then we can put them on our unfunded priorities list. And as funds may become available either through grants, or through opportunities in our budget, with additional income or less expenses, it really gives that direction to the city manager. And during our last year's budget, I remember Council Member Orre really talking about how we wanted to have more say in how that budget would be developed. And I think bringing in council member initiatives or ideas at the budget time would be appropriate. So we have now until October to look at things like, how we can prevent domestic violence by partnering, either internally or partnering with agencies, or more sheltering needs, whatever it is that we're looking to have community needs addressed to be proactive. So. Thank you. That's a long answer to say, yes, let's include that discussion in October, or as the budget is being developed. That's all I had on this item. If there's anybody else. Yeah. With that move approval. Is there a second? Second. So the motion is second for item 3.3. We'll take the roll call vote, please. And second. And everybody had an opportunity to read the comments of 3.3 when we read the comments for everything else. Okay. Council Member Orre. Yes. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Orre. Abstain. Okay. Council Member Reynolds. Aye. Council Member Stone. Aye. Vice Mayor Brown. Aye. Mayor Schwab. Aye. Carries 6-0 with one abstention. Okay. Okay. So we will move to item 4.1, which is discussion of placing items on the November 2020 ballot. Um. Of a report by Andrew Jarrett, City Attorney, and Deborah Presson, City Clerk and Elections Official. Um. I want it to be noted that I am, um, recused from discussing item D, the franchise agreement for the Chico Certified Farmer's Market due to property that I own with it or rent have a leasehold on within 500 feet. So perhaps we could limit our discussion for items A, B, and C at the beginning. Okay. So. Can we, uh, take those items separately? Let's take the items separately then. Thank you. So, ranked choice voting process for council elections is the first item. Just curious, before we start, I thought we had already taken action on D and C and had voted to proceed to have the language put together and. I think that that's what we are hearing now. Correct me if I'm wrong. We have to have, um, the language prepared. Um. Is that, um, the language prepared and then is that posted on the, um, public notice before it is put out or is that just for the sales tax initiative? The public notice is more for the sales tax initiative. Um, B and C is here so that we get the language right. Um, and you're absolutely correct. There was direction provided on that. We want to make sure we get the language right and then on, uh, July 7th, the final, um, version to adopt. And for the council to take the official action of adopting a resolution, placing it on the ballot, um, would be before you. Thank you. And while we're on that item, B and C have been, uh, coupled because the C item, which was the, the request you had, uh, Councilmember Orre, regarding the age, um, uh, requirement, um, for Councilmembers to, to be considered, um, um, that has to be, that, I mean, that age requirement is in Section 403, which also needs to be amended relating to the charter, um, uh, redistricting. Thank you. Okay. So who's going to give the report for item A? And I know we have, um, a guest here. You can hear her. Okay. So who's going to give the report for item A? Thank you, Mayor Schwab, members of the council. Um, the first item is, um, in relation to rank choice voting. Um, that item, uh, is, is spelled out in the report. Um, as you're aware, rank choice voting is a method of essentially having a instant runoff, um, so to speak. So that, um, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, until a candidate ends up with a majority of the vote. As you're aware in American politics, typically in the electoral process, we have a plurality method where someone can win an election with fewer than 50% of the vote. This ranked choice voting changes that method so that in one election, someone will prevail with 50% of the votes. This is typically a new development for California. It's been around nationwide in other states to one degree or another, but it is still a new type of voting overall. It is definitely not the typical way of doing things. But in California, within the last two years, it was put on as a... or it was... voted on by the legislature to allow all cities in California to engage in this type of voting. That passed the Assembly and the Senate. It was vetoed, however, by the governor. And so currently in California, only charter cities may engage in ranked choice voting. Presently, we're seeing the city and county of San Francisco, Alameda, the city of Alameda... Alameda, our city in Alameda County, and then the cities of San Leandro, Oakland, and Berkeley that have adopted this type of activity. And I believe we have the Butte County Registrar voters present here to comment on how this would impact the county's counting and tabulation methods under the election system. And I believe that the Council's vote on the! was going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to When the governor vetoed SB 212, his comment was, ranked choice is an experiment that has been tried in several charter cities in California. Where it has been implemented, I am concerned that it has often led to voter confusion and that the promise of ranked choice voting leads to greater democracy is not necessarily fulfilled. I brought with me tonight Keaton Denley. He's the office manager, and he'll have a few comments after mine because I asked him to do some research on this. Along with the heat, it seems like everything else has gotten busier. So my concerns that, number one, we contacted Dominion, and they said it would be $300. $350,000 to upgrade our equipment as it stands now, and $70,000 a year. But that's the tip of the iceberg. When you look at it, it's just not an upgrade to hardware and software. You've got training costs. You've got education costs of the public, which could really amount to a lot of money. Believe me, as I've changed different voting systems, the cost... I... I... I... The cost of trying to educate the public is one of the biggest costs there. It can be confusing to the public if held on a regular general election day, like November 3rd. They can't be getting one ballot one way and another ballot the other way, or they can't be getting them together. Because when you look at this ranked choice ballot that you have before you, It is confusing to many people. So, you know, I really respect your ability with the public to discuss this item, but I don't think it's to a point where it really is gelled. My suggestion, you have an alternative to November, would be to hold it in March or April, where the city used to have their city elections. Look at what we have coming. You've just divided into districts. Now, you won't be getting the phone calls, but I will. People will be saying, well, you know, they get their ballot, and they say, but I want to vote for these people over here. Well, you're not in their district. We will get hundreds of those calls. So we go from that, that is just being implemented now, to the census. The district lines all change. The supervisor lines all change. Public doesn't understand if they're on one side of 99, they vote in one supervisor district versus the other. And this confusion, the amount of phone calls that we get is tremendous, when they can go online and see what district. They are in, but, you know, and then by 2022, after the census, we could be producing our ballots in Spanish, too. All that is a lot. It's a lot to consider and a lot to put on the public, a lot to have them understand. So with that, I'll ask Keaton to say a few more words. Keaton? All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. election department and handle it. Because not, but after we get through the census, we get through everything, and it kind of settles down. And we still have a lot of people moving from the campfire, just a tremendous amount of people. And as you see, District 5 is going to have to come way down into Chico. There's no way. They don't have that much population up there. So it's going to change the dynamics a lot. And so with all that, I would say a word of caution to everybody that this subject is better put off for a few years. And then by then, maybe it will gel. And it would be a thing to do, especially since you're a charter city. But as a county, we cannot. We won't do it. Okay? So Keaton, could you come up, please? Members of the City Council, good evening. My name is Keaton Denley. I'm the manager for Butte County Elections. So I did a little bit of research on ranked choice voting. It had been something that our office hadn't really considered because, as Candace mentioned, SB 212 being vetoed basically took that out of our hands that we couldn't conduct our county elections under ranked choice. But given the discussion we wanted to have tonight, I did a little bit more research. I did a little bit of research on that. Like she mentioned, one of the things that I did find out is that our system, although it is a million-dollar system, is incapable of doing ranked choice voting as is. Just to upgrade the system would be the $350,000 and then an additional $70,000 per year. And that's just to make the system able to do it. That doesn't take into account the training costs, the effect on voters, their information costs that they would need, outreach training, because you would really have to retrain all the voters to do it. You have the ballots in front of you. Um. The problem with ranked choice adding it to a ballot that has traditional measures or questions on it is that it can't fit on the same page as a traditional ballot question. It has to be on an additional page. Butte County recently, we've been lucky enough to keep our ballots to just a front and back. You add ranked choice to it, now you have an additional ballot card. Especially going all vote by mail, I guarantee you what's going to happen is people are going to send back one of those cards, not both of them. So while you are attending to it. You avoid a runoff, which actually isn't required anyway. You're going to lose as many votes as you're sort of gaining in that process of voters getting their voices heard. One of the things that we've seen. I looked at an Oakland school council school district race. They had 22.7% of their voters undervote or overvote in their last ranked choice election. Basically meaning that in one way or another the voter's vote was incomplete or they in the example of an overvote. Marked eight. too many selections. If a voter overvotes and there's no other indication to their preference, that vote is going to be lost because we cannot save those votes from an overvote. So comparing the overvotes and undervotes to be 22.7% compared to our last election where we just had sort of standard questions on the ballot, we only had 13.5% of those. And that just counts, that actually counts all of our outstack reasons. An outstack reason could be coffee was spilled on it. The voter made a mistake. So really we're including everything that could have happened to a ballot in that 13.5%, whereas the city of Oakland, their school district, that 22.7% is just overvotes or undervotes, basically mistakes or confusions that the ballot caused their voters. There was also a recent study done by San Francisco State on their elections for the city of San Francisco when they conducted them from 95 to 2003 under the kind of the traditional election model. And then from 07 to 2011, they adopted. Ranked choice voting. And what they found was that there was a quote, significant relationship between ranked choice voting and decreased voter turnout among younger voters and voters who lack a high school education. So really what you're seeing there is voters being confused by the ballot, not understanding how they make their selection known, or perhaps maybe not completing it all the way. They mark their one choice and then don't mark two, three, four, or five because they think that'll take away from their candidate's choice or their choice for their primary candidate. The other interesting thing I saw, in that Oakland school district race was in 42% of their precincts, the winner after five rounds of ranked choice voting still didn't achieve majority vote. They report that it was 54%, 52%, but those numbers are actually sort of skewed because they've removed ballots from the process as they moved along. Voters' voices have been removed from that election to bolster that number. One such race, the winner ended up with 182 votes. So that's a lot of votes. So that's a lot of votes. Whereas there was 364 votes cast in that election. Now that to me is not over 50%, but they report it as being 54%. So there is ways that sort of voters are removed from the process and it bolsters the percentages when it's not a true reflection of the votes that were cast. So those are just some of our concerns. Another thing to note is that ranked choice voting only changed the result in four of their 43 precincts. So you're going through a lot of trouble to really not change the election overall. And you risk losing voters' input along the way while putting strain on our office as far as having to upgrade our system and then our elections. If we were to move up from 13.5% to 22.7%, that's basically the cost for adjudication of 200 man hours, not to mention the training that would go into that system. So in addition to the $350,000 printing costs and then labor and training, it would be a huge burden in our system right now. I just can't handle it. So. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. movement. We're still bound by California law at this point. So under the current governor anyway, it doesn't seem like that's going to happen. You know, if there comes a way where this becomes the way of voting, whether nationwide or statewide, voters may be able to handle it a little better at that point. Our voters, and I'm not saying anything bad about our voters, are actually really good. They turn out in huge numbers compared to the rest of the state. But from what we've seen in other counties, this is a real burden on not only the voters, but the county department. Okay, thank you. Additional questions? Other questions? Thank you. Now we'll take some time to, or council discussion, anything council would like to discuss before we review the public comment? I just wanted to share, I kind of went into this question completely open. To go in either way on rank choice voting. So I did quite a bit of research. And one of the things I found, which I think sort of matches up to some of the things that Keaton was saying, was a report of an editorial actually in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, where they cited research that showed well-documented voting gaps. So this is a graph that favors white voters and affluent voters. And they give some of the results. So they carefully examined voting in 13 words to see if rank choice voting contributed to broader participation based on actual vote returns obtained from the Minneapolis city clerk. Unfortunately, the evidence shows a clear pattern. Voters who were more affluent and white turned out at a higher rate, completed their ballots more accurately, and were more likely to vote in the state. So this is going to be going to going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going in amongst the advantages provided by Rank Choice. Additional comments? Madam Mayor, there was one thing I wanted to add regarding the moving of the election date. That issue was mentioned. If the council were to do that, then that too would require a charter amendment, which is not covered here. And there has been some discussion, or I think there was discussion during the districting hearings about whether or not that could be done. In fact, there's a recent case out of Redondo Beach, I think within the last three months, that does give validity for charter cities to move the date of a municipal election. If you were to do that, it would not change any of the current terms or the terms that were in effect. When that happens, then current terms are extended to the new later election date. So it would not cut anybody's term short. Historically, Chico has had Chico City municipal elections in April, and that was changed 20, 25 years ago. And before your time, oh dear. But not before Carl's time, I don't think. And I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, the turnout was much lower at a non-general election time, which to have more voter participation is important to me. Other comments? So item... Oh, so... So comments did come in separately for item A, B, C, and D. So how many comments did we receive in the engaged Chico for item A? 39. 39. And how many emails did we receive? We didn't receive any more. Okay. So with 39 comments, let's try five minutes. If that sounds reasonable. If that sounds reasonable to the council, we can certainly take more time if needed. And while we're reviewing them, Madam Clerk, could you read the names? Okay. Sending in comments were Carl Logan, Lincoln Bowen, Nicole Nava, Nathaniel Perry, Bryce Goldstein, Theodore Ulsh, Rain Share, Patrick Rose, Jeremy... I'm sorry. Jeremy Markley, Eric Chisler, Mercedes Macias, Julie Threat, Gabriel Fairchild, Alexander Smith, Juanita Sumner, Steven Breedlove, Rhiannon Stevens, Jody Taylor, Leonard Ross, Susan Smead, Jamie Damon, Bart Panik, Lisa Salzman, Daniel Rodriguez, Barbara Noble, Allinger, Margaret Hicks, Amy Marie, Stephanie Barrett, Chaz Kelly, Carolyn R.P., and Rob Berry. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The next item is an update of the city charter to make the charter compliant with the California Voting Rights Act and the districting that the council did in October through February. As you're aware, the city was faced with a notice advising that... a lawsuit would be imminent if districting was not undertaken. Districting was undertaken, and so in November, the council elections will be the first election in quite a while done under the new districting. This charter amendment would not affect the validity of that prior ordinance, but it would ensure that the charter... is then compliant with California Voting Rights Act. As I mentioned earlier, items B and C are put together because in amending the charter as a whole to address the issues, and we can comply with the CVRA, we will need to amend Section 403. Section 403, I don't know if you want to take these two in discussion now, but... The council had indicated they wanted to hear things separately. We could go forward with B. And then not with C, or vice versa, or go forward with both of them? Essentially, but it's been presented to combine the two for the reason that Section 403 has some... Both of them use the same attachment, so if you want to not do C, the age of 21 for council member election, for council nomination, then we would need to note that in Section 403 and how that's been presented to be amended. Council would like to go forward individually or as one? I don't care how we talk about it, but let's assume they both end up on the ballot, they need to be separate. Yes. Yes. They need to be separate. I need to be able to vote for compliance with the council districts and not vote to eliminate the age requirement. Yes. So that's the complicating factor is that they could be done together, they could be done separately. Doing it separately would be difficult because it's amending the very charter section. Both of these issues amend the same charter section. No, I appreciate that. And also your ability to make sure they're separate issues. Yes. I would vote for that. I would vote differently on both of them. But if you put them together, I can't. So you have forced my hand like you're a Butte County judge. Oh, that's, do you understand what I'm saying? If I could offer, Section 402 addresses districts and Section 403 addresses eligibility of candidates. So while they are both in the same area of the charter, whatever term you want to use, they're different sections, correct? Yes, except the eligibility of the candidate also means that a candidate must be, must reside in a district. So we need to add that language into 403. And so this is the reason why we're taking this. We're taking a stab at it tonight. Although direction was provided in order to clarify these types of issues. And if indeed your direction is make them separate questions on the ballot, we can take another run at it and come back on the 7th. That would be my desire. Yeah, I would absolutely agree that they need to be taken separately on the ballot. Thank you, Ms. Coyle. Well, then let's discuss them separately. So you gave us the report for Section 402, the district elections. Council have any questions or comments on that? How many comments did we receive on engaged Chico for Item B? We received two. Two. And did we receive any emails for this item? No, we didn't. Okay. Then let's just take a minute to review the comments while the city clerk reads the names. I'm sorry. Hold on a second. Daniel Rodriguez and Rob Berry sent in messages through engaged Chico. I'll take a second. Has everybody had an opportunity to review the comments? Any reflections, comments, or direction? I'd make a motion to approve the proposed charter amendment to add a new district office. That's written in attachment A. Nope. That gets to the issue we were just talking about. I just want to make sure you can certainly make that motion. But if the intent of the council is to have two separate questions on the ballot, then as presented in attachment A, that does not do that. And so I would need to come back with different version of attachment A. So an appropriate motion would be to direct you to come back with language that separates the two so that we can vote separately on them? If that's the council's intent, yes. That's my motion. Yeah, I don't want those things to be on together. All right. Okay, so I heard a motion, and who formally seconded it? Vice Mayor Brown. No. Council Member Morgan. Take it. It's all yours. All right, so we have a motion and a second by Council Member Morgan. Yes, ma'am. May I have a vote, please? Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Horry. Yes. Council Member Reynolds. Aye. Council Member Stone. Nay. Vice Mayor Brown. Aye. Mayor Schwab. Aye. Carry 6-1. Okay. Now we will discuss C. Eligibility of Council Candidates Elimination of Age Requirement. Thank you, Madam Mayor. That, again, deals with essentially lining out one phrase in Charter Section 403. And that has been incorporated into Attachment A. We will bring back a version of Attachment A and appropriate question to place. The CVRA compliance portion on the ballot for on July 7th. This elimination of the age requirement would require, then, a separate amendment to those eligibility requirements in 403. Questions? Questions? Is the... Is the Clause C where it says be a qualified... Voter as defined in Elections Code. Is that currently in the Charter? That's correct. So we... Just by eliminating the term be over the age of 21, that second one requires you to be 18 or older? I mean... That's correct. We don't need to state any kind of qualification other than saying you're a registered voter? That is my interpretation. And so, Council Member Horry, when you made the recommendation last meeting, to state 18, that was the analysis that I did. It came up that one would have to be 18 in order to comply with the requirements of the Government Code. And as those change over time, so too would your charter. Yeah. How many comments do we have under Engage Chico on this item? Okay. Okay. Okay. On this particular item, we have 27 comments that we received in Engage. And how many emails do we have? We have one email. It's stuck in the table. 30 comments. Let's try four minutes, and if we need additional time, we will certainly take it. Would you please call the next... Okay. Lauren Kohler, Katie Sykes, Patricia Wang, Zoe DiMercchio, Kari Logan, Nicole Nava, Bryce Goldstein, Nathaniel Perry, Bryce Corrin, Theodore Olsch, Amy Marie, Patrick Rose, Eric Chisler, Julie Threat, Mercedes Macias, Alexander Smith, Rhiannon Stevens, Jody Taylor, and! Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Stephanie Barrett and Rob Berry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Has council had enough time to review the comments? Okay. Are there any reflections on the comments, additional questions or comments council would like to make? Anybody prepared to make a motion? I like the idea of 30 years. Sorry, Alex. Well, I'll make a motion that the city attorney bring back to a section 403 capital letter A sub letter B that changes B to simply to reside in the council district for which the person is nominated and removes the line B over the age of 21 years. Can you repeat that? I don't know if I can. But I didn't. You're saying it would just be stand-alone, the age question. Yeah, I'm asking the attorney to do what he said he needed to do, which is bring this back separately, if I understood correctly. Bring it back so that that one specific item, section 403 A, B, remove the line that says B over the age of 21 years, which effectively makes it over 18. Is that correct, city attorney? That's correct. I understand your motion to eliminate the requirement of a candidate being over the age of 21, and I would bring back, language to that effect. Is there a second? Second. Okay. I agree with this. I think it's something that probably went into the charter at the very beginning. It was assumed that the voters would always have to be 21, and having it tied to being an eligible voter is the way I think that this charter, second, should read. Any other comments? Okay. Please roll call vote. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? No. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? No. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 5-2. So the next section is the franchise agreement for the Chico Certified Farmer's Market. I anticipate this to be a rather long, long discussion. Would Council like to take a vote, a break before moving forward or just go? We can jump straight to the vote if you want. Just straight to the vote. Okay. So Vice Mayor Brown, if you don't see any indications, people would like to take a vote. So Vice Mayor Brown, please. Oh, a break. Okay. No break. No break. No indications of a break. No indications of a break. I think we got this one. Okay. So carry on. Now it's time for a breakdown. I have to reprise myself because I have a leasehold in property that's within 500 feet of the farmer's market. That was a little . I think it's a very good . Well, she offered it. Equal opportunity. Okay. So I'm going to take a vote. Okay. So I'm going to take a vote. Okay. All right. Item 4.1, Section D, Franchise Agreement for Chico Certified Farmer's Market. I imagine Mr. Jarrett will take this one. Thank you, Vice Mayor Brown, members of the council. As was discussed at the last meeting, there's quite a long history with this farmer's market and this matter was discussed in the last meeting. The reason was we asked to approve as we agreed to approve as we agreed to approve was we asked was we asked was we asked was we asked was we asked was we asked was we asked was we asked was we asked was we asked individual corporation may be valid or invalid under the California state Constitution. The language of Article 2 section 12 is quoted in the staff report which invalidates that type of a granting does not allow for a type of a granting through an initiative process. There is case law that establishes that such provision does apply to local initiatives not merely legislative acts by the California legislature. There is also a recent development since the time this was considered by the council in 2014 and that is a 2017 case named Hernandez versus town of Apple Valley. In that case the court held that granting a zoning amendment to the land owner of a property in Apple Valley and that land owner being identified as Walmart did not violate the constitutional provision. It's related here it's kind of the inverse of what we have here under this petition that was proposed and would go both terms of which would go on the ballot if you took a decision to give a zoning amendment to the property. So this is a position as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed on as we all agreed spring of 2014 when the initiative was allowed to go forward with signatures and that is there is a long history of public policy in California to allow to not prevent an initiative from going forward at the signature gathering process at signature gathering time nor to stand in the way of placing something on the ballot and instead allow the voters to vote for something and to then deal with constitutionality post-election that being said there are ways to to not allow that to happen and by either failing to take action on it or seeking a court order on the matter here we're pressed for time we have to take action council must take action by July 7th in order to place this place any matter on the ballot for November 3rd so with that the research does not change you know the way I have reviewed this and our opinion that this initiative process would be giving a private right to CCFM as also presented here and as we had looked through the the records it became clear there was no formalized franchise agreement for whatever reason that did not occur we did find a version of a draft version of the the franchise agreement that was being drafted sent back and forth between the parties and that's what's presented here as attachment I believe that's j it's been slightly updated modified to fit our circumstances here but not a considerable amount of work done on that and I think that's what we're going to be looking at in the next few days.

Sure. Yeah, we would prefer to hear public comment prior to that. How many folks have we heard from on the Engaged Chico website? We received 14 comments. And have there been any comments submitted via the public comments email? Okay. We have 14 comments, so a couple minutes to review those, folks, and then I'll look for heads. So we received comments from Lauren Kohler, Deanne Allen, Nicole Nava, Nathaniel Perry, Rain Share, Julie Threat, Eric Chisler, Mercedes Macias, Jody Taylor, Juanita Sumner, Lisa Salzman, Barbara Noble-Ellinger, Carolyn R.P., and Rob Berry. All right. Thank you. Has everybody had a chance to review the comments? All right. Further discussion from council? I'm glad to. Please. I think it's indicative of this discussion and how it's changed in that very recently, I think it was unanimous vote that we would put this on the ballot.

And so I really would like to see the final vote on this at the next meeting. Go ahead and do whatever we need to do to have it ready. And then perhaps it gets voted down. But in the meantime, I think there might be opportunities for more discussion among the community, as well as the legal part of it. So that's kind of where I'm going, which may, if that's agreeable, kind of cut out a lot of this. Every time the city attorney says an initiative can't do this or can't do that, you can eliminate that whole discussion, because we're not talking about putting an initiative on the ballot. The initiative. The initiative was signed, accepted legally, signed by 9,200 signatures, and then agreed by the council to accept without putting on the ballot. I use the term, and I'm not a lawyer, don't want to be a lawyer, that it was adopted then by the council in ordinance, whether that's the exact terminology. But it's the same sort of thing as a referendum, that once, you, you know, you revert to something. The actual form of the initiative was exactly the same as the ordinance. No one would want to make a mistake on crossing a T. Or even, if you'll look at it, if you don't mind the little anecdote, there's a little map of the market. And in the original ordinance, the map was shaded. But when we printed it, the shade didn't come out. And I was always fearful that that would. invalidate the initiative. So the format was exactly that of the ordinance and then there were meetings with the farmers market board and Jeff Brown, a local attorney, to go over the terms. They're very specific questions. Do you have half a block or a full block? Do you have one year, five years, whatever? What process do you use for renewing it? What the fee will be? There were very specific items that were agreed to by CCFM that they were willing to do. The hardest one was the $5,000 a year. If we really don't have an ordinance, maybe we need to reimburse them for six years of payments. Apparently we had no ability to enforce that. So you know there is some misinformation out there. But I think it's a good idea to go back and look at the process. Half the emails I'm reading are talking about not moving the market, which is kind of ironic. The opposite is actually true. If we follow the initiative and what we had decided earlier, there would be no changes in the farmers market agreement. If we have a subsequent meeting to adopt as a council, at that time we could, the majority of the council could move the market. That misinformation is false. There's a statement several that's out there that this is a get-out-the-vote effort. I think the opposite was true. It was seen that a presidential election year would involve the most people and would have the most likely chance of approval. But it's the fact that the voters were already getting out to vote. Our president's helping that quite a bit. We didn't really. I don't think we made any I don't really see the idea that this is. So rather than these kind of things, I think another couple of weeks we can, or less than that, maybe come up to an agreement of whether or not there is a legal stance to respect an initiative or not, and then whether or not if there is instead a subsequent council meeting, what that would look like or when to calm, I think, a lot of concerns. Legally, we use a different word. In effect, what will happen if we don't put this on the ballot is that it really invalidates the initiative. I mean, they give up the ability to get approval in that process. And instead, there's a crapshoot that there possibly will be a future council meeting. And at that future council meeting, this topic will be placed. And at that meeting, whatever four of us agree to becomes the new agreement. So it really, I think, to get more certainty about what that would look like, if that's the necessary process, I think that would help. So that's part of it. I have contacted. I have contacted Olsen Law Firm. I will bear the legal, obviously legal expense. I don't think you guys are going to reimburse me. To see whether or not that the term, not the initiative, not being able to place, but whether a statute could be placed in front of the voters by a council, which is what we're doing, whether or not that has . . . Can you elaborate on that? Excuse me? Can you elaborate on what you just said? I'm not sure I'm understanding. So Mr. Jarrett's comment to the attorney, Jarrett, is that an initiative cannot be placed on the ballot. But that question became moot when the council chose not to put the initiative on the ballot, instead accepted it. Now the question is whether or not a statute, for lack of a better term, whether a council could ask the voters to vote on that. That gives a right to a corporation. It may be that that also is not within our discretion. And in that case, the discussion on the 7th would be different. But I'm saying that I would like to have the time to further validate that opinion. Any other questions or comments from council members? Mr. Duke? Yeah, Mr. Orry, could you or would you be interested in speaking to Mr. Kuhn's letter? Or is that something you'd prefer that we deal with at a subsequent meeting? You know, I understand not wanting to be on the November ballot. I'm not going to be on the November ballot. I'm pretty happy about it these days. You know, they've got cold feet. I get it. They look at this council and they think, I don't know if you're reading the letters, they think they're going to get 25 years. They think that there will be no opposition. And so I try to ignore the stuff that's personal attacks and conspiracy theories. And I think it just comes down to that, that there are certainly, I mean, these are 100 entrepreneurs. These are business people. They see their risk right now being that they have to go out on a ballot and explain themselves to the voters. I think it would be, my own personal opinion, extremely valid. It reaffirms the community's support for them if they can win on the ballot. But instead they say that there's a council this time that probably will, you know, be going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to going to we can't take that one back. If in a subsequent meeting they get run out or get moved on to a different site or given a two-year term or their franchise fees becomes $10,000, they have given up their, I'm sure there's a poker term for it, but, you know, and so I get why they're kicking on this, but I also don't think that, I think it's our job to think it all through. There are the, we do, if it is a, if it is a, excuse me, if it is a legal initiative, then I think our hands are more tied as to whether or not their concerns rise to the point where we would not put it on the ballot. But if there is some flaws in the initiative that was originally accepted by the council that would not allow us to put it on the ballot without facing some kind of legal challenge, that we don't want to take on, then I get it. I think I'll be on board then. But I think we need to answer, I need to answer that to my satisfaction, particularly because it was a 9,200 signature initiative. I think the city has incredible respect and history of initiatives and referendums and so that's where I'm coming from. I think that allows, perhaps allowing it for a little bit more discussion, a little bit more, to see what all comes out on it. Council Member Morgan and then Council Member Reynolds. Thank you, Vice Mayor. So my question I think is more for the city attorney. Mr. Orrie, I support if we need more time, so a lot of things have been said. At the end of the day, Mr. Jarrett, is the question of it's not legal for us to put it on the ballot. And if it's not, then the, the, the farmers market is concerned that any council could vote them away at any given time. But if I heard Mr. Orrie right, the farmers market believes this council might give them a 20-year lease, which we can give them a franchise agreement. That's not in question, correct? Correct. But we're not sure. He puts it in example. No, no, yeah, no, I get it. But you question the legality of us doing it via the ballot, regardless of whether the term is initiative or referendum or, okay. So this is, I'm not making a motion, I'm just making it public where I stand. I'm happy to give the city attorney the legal time if he feels he needs it to find a way for that to work, because it doesn't bother me if it's on the ballot or not. That's number one. Number two, if it saves everybody the effort, I'm happy to continue the franchise agreement under the current terms. I don't know that I'd go 20 years because that's a long, long, long, long time. And, whoever wrote the letter said, you know, a lot's changed in six years. I responded back to him and he didn't respond back to me. He probably thought I was being a smart aleck, but I wasn't. A lot's changed in the last six months. So to give anybody a piece of city property for 20 years is, who knows what the city's going to look like. There might not even be any downtown businesses 10 years from now. I think having the farmer's market where it is now brings more people in downtown. We can debate the parking thing all day. It's good for the city, especially now. So I'm just making the point that if it does come out that we can't put this on the ballot, that I will work once again, Mr. Ory, to support you in keeping it where it is and making it better somehow, although 20 years does seem long to me. Council Member Reynolds? That was one of my questions, or you addressed a little bit of it, but Carl, you made a, or Mr. Ory, sorry, you made a statement that a franchise agreement, could be just changed over at any time by any council. Can you address that? If we do a, for instance, an eight-year franchise agreement with an evergreen on it, is that something that any council can just come in and change at any time? Not without compensation to the party holding the contract, unless there were terms in there that said you could. So that's why we included the franchise agreement as part of the contract. As it was being considered at the time, with very minor change, but typically if you're going to give somebody a lease on a piece of property, and that's what the franchise would be, essentially a license there, you can't just yank it next council meeting without just compensation. Great, thank you. I will also note, while my mic's on, that I do understand Council Member Ory's question, and the nuance that it has, and the difference that is being made between an initiative and council placing something on the ballot. And there is a, and I don't think the legal analysis has, if there's a question in Council Member Ory's mind, certainly it has not been specifically and apparently sufficiently addressed. So I do understand his question. You know, if I had said that they could change it any time I was misspoken, I understand that once we enter into a franchise agreement, that it's the terms of the agreement. But it is that, and I appreciate you put yourself on the record, Council Member Morgan, but you know what these meetings could look like when this eventually does come back, if it does come back as a council decision, and the DCBA is here, and we'll, you know, a very powerful delegation that says to you, what do you mean eight years? We have a hotel plan, we need three years, or we want to come up with an alternative plan. Anything can happen. Anything can happen. And I'm ready for that, but... What? No, but yeah, that's the problem, is we don't know when it'll come back. Hopefully before December when their term ends. You know, and it is ironic, I just have to comment that the last time this did come in front of us, it was an all-day budget session, and then it was an all-night session, and then it was an all-night farmer's market discussion, so it was the longest council meeting on record. That was my subsequent question that I hadn't quite got you to. How quick can we turn around a franchise agreement, and can it be done simultaneously so the farmer's market is assured that, A, we're voting no to put it on, and, oh, by the way, we're gonna sit and jerk you around, for lack of a better word, for the next six months. Can it be done simultaneously at the same time so they are concerned, taken care of? And so that was an additional reason for having Exhibit J, was to put those terms out there. There is a process for approving a franchise agreement, and off the top of my head, I frankly do not know if it is possible to do all the noticing and such that would allow that to happen for July 7th. But if that's what you're saying, then the question that we're getting at is, could the council approve a franchise agreement on July 7th? I don't know, as we're sitting here in this instant, if that is possible. I do recall that there is a... an application hearing process that needs to happen. But certainly if the direction was to put it on as expeditiously as possible, that could be done as well. Council Member Stone? I just want to point out the operative detail here, is that just compensation is returned. So a contract, an agreement, a lease agreement, however you want to label it, is enforceable up to the point of providing just compensation for a cancelled lease. So another council could come along, say, January 1st, and say, oh, we've decided that we're going to change this location, and your lease payments were $5,800 a year. I don't remember exactly what they were. But since there's 364 days remaining in the year, we're going to give you back your rent payment for $5,800. And that is the unilateral overturning of that lease agreement. Now maybe that's not something that everybody's comfortable... or maybe that is something that everybody's comfortable allowing a unilateral cancellation. But it's disconcerting. I appreciate that the farmers' market would like to extend that lease, and I think 16 years seems to be an appropriate number, or something less than 20, but allowing an opportunity for there to be some resistance by the farmers' market. So anyway, I appreciated Mr. Coon's letter. I'm concerned about... the ability to unilaterally cancel this contract, this agreement, but also vexed with the problem that this is probably an illegal ballot proposal in the first place. So I appreciate Councilmember Ory's request to kind of keep this contained within a certain time period, but if we're not really going to have the intention of placing it on the ballot because it's not legal, then I'm not sure that that's really part of the discussion. And I'd like to see us come up with an agreement that can be more substantively protected on the part of the farmers' market folks. Yeah, I have a few questions actually. So I don't know that... What if we were to move to put this on the ballot, the initiative as is, as written, what would happen? You know, would we be subject to challenge? Can you explain that a little bit? Yes, if... And... Okay, so we'll start with answering questions as best I can. If you were to give that direction tonight on July 7th, would bring back the actual documents that would effectuate that direction. Mm-hmm. And you're correct. Just like with any action you take, a challenger could file litigation to stop it. And you're saying currently we're... There's case law to demonstrate that we would... That would be a problem for the market. I think there's vulnerability there, indeed. And it's been raised now by the two predecessors and myself. I must also note that I did not see those opinions prior to last council meeting. And I only heard that they existed and was giving my opinion independent of those. The... So, yeah, the court, if there was a pre-election challenge, could very well say, we're not going to hear that until after the election. Not timely. If the voters vote for it, then they might... The court might hear it then. And at which point, then we're in between November and December 31st, when the current franchise period, for lack of a better word, would expire. And if we were to create a franchise agreement, what kind of legal challenge is that subject to? I mean... That too can be challenged by someone who didn't think it was appropriate to do that. In looking at your code on that, and that's in chapter 14.60, and I think it's 190, it's talking about the hearing on that. Looks like there's at least a 10-day period. So, yeah, there would still be time to have a hearing for July 7th, more than likely. Again, this is preliminary opinions on these, you know, analyzing this on very short notice here in this meeting. As to Councilmember Stone's comment about just compensation, that franchise could be written in such a way that it would be more than just the $1,500 rent for a franchise. It would be $25,000 rent or something along those lines. Great. So it's all about what kind of agreement you want to craft with your... the other party. Yeah. I'll just add a few comments. I appreciate you building that out. You know, I would say this is a really difficult conversation because it's, you know, as has been mentioned, it creates tension between two pretty critically important things. The will of the people and making sure to honor that. And, you know, long-term access to food security and this kind of critical piece of our cultural identity. So, you know, I don't take the efforts of the initiative lightly. And I also understand that the will of the people is often challenged when initiatives are completed. I would say that this particular initiative was created to ensure the stability of the market, giving the power to the voters instead of, as you mentioned, Councilmember Ory, allowing the whims of whichever council's in place to dictate those agreements. To me, that kind of security is pretty invaluable given the background of this particular issue. I'm open to waiting and to giving a little bit more air to this issue, as you've requested, as long as it's in line with the date requirements of doing what we need to do. But I am kind of leaning into the legal opinion being sure, as you've said, that this is a very important issue in a way that's not going to be considered right now. That if we put it on the ballot as is, it's vulnerable to challenge and could be voided as soon as it passes by the voters. And even though the franchise agreement is subject to challenge as well, I think that we have a little bit more opportunity to make it watertight. And I don't know what that would look like, but I would hope that that conversation would be robust and transparent. What's that? Oh, good. And I just think it's hard, given that the farmers' market and the vendors themselves are asking us to take action to preserve food access and security, that it makes it very difficult not to side with the farmers on this one. You know, it's not unlikely this would pass if it was put on the ballot. I don't think that that's an option or a possibility, that it wouldn't pass. But it's likely that it would be immediately challenged just by virtue of us taking this action when we can use our authority to preserve this. So again, I'm willing to wait that timeframe if we have the time to give to it. And, you know, given the information that I have now, I would support developing a franchise agreement, a longer one, a more watertight one, and one that maybe includes, if the lease gets denied by a future council, it does go on the ballot. I don't know what that looks like or entails, but to create a little bit more security. Council Member Reynolds. I'd like to make a motion that we direct staff to move into conversations with the CCAFM and start to develop a franchise agreement. I don't think that we can name those terms without including them in the conversation. Something to the effect of an eight-year, with an eight-year evergreen gets us to the 16, I believe, and whatever exit clause. If we ever get our sunshine and rainbows and have all kinds and tons of money and can build a hotel or a parking lot or all the wonderful things that we think we need for downtown, it's someday at some time, which at this point is looking like a long, long time away, then obviously, from what I understand in conversations with them, they're very open to having to move if it's for a legitimate reason and not being a political football. So back to the motion. I make a motion that we enter into and start developing a franchise agreement, but I'm assuming we need to bring them to the table for that conversation. So a point of clarification. Can that be done alongside giving Mr. Ory a week or two weeks to get more information? So we would essentially have started negotiations on a franchise agreement, maybe come up with some terms, but hold off on taking any action on that until we hear more of the information that Mr. Ory is asking for. If that's the only way we can move forward, it seems to me we've gotten a pretty clear answer that this isn't going to be legal and it could be challenged, but if that's what we need to move it forward, I just... I'll second the motion. I, again, would like to see something more in the threshold to prevent a future council from readily overturning this, but short of that, I'm supportive. So seconding the motion. I... Motion on the floor. I asked for a week so we'd have a fresh start, and if in a week there's a legal opinion in front of you or legal argument to suggest that the initiative is valid, and instead we're going to direct staff to start negotiating when, of course, we're not going to have anything to do in the next two weeks negotiating with the market. I don't mean to dismiss your concern. That's not at all my intention. I would just rather that that process begin, but there's nothing that would stop us from yanking that back. July 7th, if that was necessary. But tonight, I guess you guys want to go forward, but... Do you have a motion, Mr. Ory? Excuse me? Is there a motion that you'd like to make? Well, I think I was thinking no action, because right now we're in discussion, and I've asked for a little bit more time, and I've had a complex legal opinion presented to me, and I've made the effort to reach out to legal experts in the state to see whether or not there's other... whether it's valid, and I start with the assumption that the initiative is valid. It has not been challenged in six years. There's nothing in my second that negates that. I understand. Okay. Yeah, I would agree that I think it's implicit that we're not going to have a signed franchise agreement in a week or two weeks, but we can start building one and still have time to hear more from what you find out from your legal experts. So I don't think one negates the other. We have a motion on the floor and a second. Should we call the question? Any comment, Mr. Morgan? I didn't until Mr. Huber said that. So one doesn't negate the other, so we're still going to get an opinion back from the city attorney when we come back on July 7th? I offer a substitute motion that we postpone this discussion until July 7th. Motion on the floor. It dies for lack of a second, so we move to the previous motion and discussion before we call the question. Call the question. Call the question, please. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Horry? No. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. And one recusal. So it carries. 5-1 with one recusal. And I welcome that input at the next meeting, absolutely. Somebody call Mayor Schwab back in. And we'll take actually a 10-minute break. 10 minutes, okay. Thank you. Witness Witness Witness Witness Thank you. Thank you, Madam Mayor. At the last council meeting, the council voted to request a first reading of an ordinance of a general one-half sales tax that would be placed on the ballot and, if passed, would take effect January 1, 2022 and go for a period of seven and a half years, ending June 30, 2029. What you have in your packet is the ordinance, as well as the resolution ordinance. It's the ordinance that you will be passing if you so choose. Under the revenue and tax code, that ordinance requires five votes to be operative as a first reading, and your first reading is considered at the time of the order. Should you take that action to introduce this as first reading and desire to make a change from what you have at that first reading, the city charter requires no less than five days between a second first reading, and that would mean that the timeline for the second reading and the public noticing would exceed the timeline to allow anything to go before the ballot. So if you choose to make a change from what's being with the council requested today, you would have to make it today. And so in preparation, understanding the discussion that had occurred at the last meeting about a tax that would have been special, considerations for the 1,500 individuals who had signed their names to a petition about a special type tax, what we did is we offer as an addition to your agenda packet, it's only referenced in the staff report, of an ordinance for a one-cent special sales tax measure, because a special sales tax measure has some specific requirements that are required in the ordinance. And so if you're forced to make a change tonight or you desire to make a change, not having that document makes it incredibly difficult to be able to consider an alternative that may include a special tax. That special tax as presented only includes the one area of capital and public improvement, which is an area that polled very well and is foundational. And so if you would like to discuss that, we can. If you'd like to make amendments to that, we can. If you'd like to make amendments to the general tax, you can discuss those, too. So we're open. We'll leave it to you on what you want us to discuss. Chris, for clarification, based on what you were explaining about the timeline and first reading and second reading, I don't know where this is going to go, but if whatever we were discussing required an amendment, would that require then another special meeting so that we meet the requirements? No. What we've done is we're prepared with a Word document that has the strikeouts. If you desire a change, we would have to do them on the fly today. Gotcha. Okay. And included in our packet are the one, two, four samples, if I'm not mistaken. Attachment A shows a general half-cent sales tax with an oversight committee. Attachment B shows a half-cent special tax, which would require two-thirds, that has police, streets, parks, and with sunset 2029. You don't see that? Madam Mayor, the first two documents are the same measure. One includes the ordinance. The second includes the resolution and ordinance. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. special tax for capital public infrastructure, you will see the ordinance approved is lined out in Attachment D, and the specific language of what would appear in the ballot would be Attachment E, and those are starting points if you want to continue that discussion. Okay, I stand corrected. When I was putting labels on Attachment A, I must have misread it. So Attachment B is the language that would go on the ballot? Correct. Can you explain how that language is crafted? It's just kind of interestingly worded, so I'm curious. So when we hired EMC Research to do a poll in September of 2019, we received the results in October, and it was presented to Council later that year. I was looking in the wrong place, I just realized. So I apologize. And I understand. But you can continue for the public if you feel so inclined. And so the language is premised on the polling results as to what priorities the public felt were of the highest. And so the ballot language is written to reflect those. However, we must understand that we're really talking about a general tax, and it's just highlighting some examples of items that could be funded, not restricting it to those areas for the general tax. And so the general tax really is equivalent to the general fund, for general and essential services with no restriction other than those deemed by the Council. Thank you. On the second measure, the consultant, we work with the consultant also to start with a framework for that initial language based on the survey results from September, knowing that if the Council decided they wanted to consider a special tax and wanted to make changes to that, we would be doing that tonight and without the benefit of insight from the consultant. Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness or what authority has the staff taken to bring forward to us four proposals? We are not bringing four proposals. There is two. There's one proposal that's recommended as requested by the City Council. We wouldn't be diligent if we weren't prepared to take the Council's direction on any alternative measure that may include a special tax. And so it would have precluded the Council and would have boxed you into one choice and only one choice. Which, that's the consequences of a vote. So under what authority did, and by four I meant, you know, it's half a cent here, one cent there, and what the different special, you know, what we could commit to. I mean, how do we do that? Do you call the Mayor and say we're going to bring something else forward? No, there's not a restriction on staff to present information to help the Council make the best decision. So I can't point to an authority that would be able to do that. I can't point to an authority that would prohibit staff from providing as much information to the Council for their decision making. Thank you. Personally, I appreciate having that option. Thank you for bringing that forward. So if one thing fails, we may have something else to fall back on. I do appreciate that. Council Member, the point is, rogue staff. I mean... I have just a clarification I'd like. So if a proposal, if a kind of following this line of thought of the question we just had, if a proposal is, or a motion is made for the one half cent sales tax and fails, can a subsequent motion then be made for an alternative? Sure. Okay. Great. But if that whole thing strikes out. Right. Thank you. And subsequently, if that fails and there's another proposal, its staff is prepared to create a word document tonight that would reflect our desires. Good night to our hearts. No. Yeah. Okay. All right. So let's take a look at the public comment. How many members of the public did, sent us communication on the Civic Engagement Platform, Engage Chico Platform? We received 19 comments on this item. And how many emails did we receive on this? One email. One email. Okay. So we have 20 comments. Let's take about four minutes to review them and more time if needed while you read the names, please. Okay. So speaking on this item in the Engage Civic Engagement Platform, Kelly Moakley, Nicole Nava, John Brown, Marcy Pittman, Amy Marie, Patrick Rose, Julie Threed, Juanita Sumner, Steven Breedlove, Jules Brown, Susan Smead, Brian Bolin, Lisa Salzman, Dana McFarlane, Natasha See, Emma Walsman-Phillips, Dave Howell, Rob Berry, and Joseph Azzarito. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Has counsel had enough time to review the comments? Any additional questions or comments? I have a question. Are we cancelling? committed to using these funds to bond or can they just be spent annually as revenue for services yeah there's no commitment to bond these dollars so there's i'm sorry just to reaffirm because so many of the emails speak against the idea of the expense of bonded indebtedness it would take a separate future action is it contemplated by staff you'd be asking that or it's not 99 million in the budget okay no what staff will do is uh we'll recommend the most prudent path in our opinion forward once the funds are in but at no point in time right now do we have anything in line to look at bonding at this point in time this is simply to ensure that we have enhanced services to the community thank you you you! yes there was a comment that mr. Constantine made that I wanted to provide a little more clarification about I have spoken with him during this break period it has to do with the consultant describing the ballot question and providing some input on that so if you decide to go some way tonight whether it's the the! general tax or special tax or no tax at all but general tax or special tax the resolution implementing that would not be passed tonight it would be introduction and first reading tonight and second reading would ask for that resolution to place it on the ballot and it's at that time when the ballot question would be formalized and so between now and then the consultant could provide some some final language and some analysis based on what actually the council could provide that input as well tonight and then final action on that taken at the second meeting so even if we do take action tonight it's not a final it can yes we have heard many ideas of possibilities for crafting a tax initiative what the desire tonight is either to come is to if we want to move forward to come away with the intention the language that we would use and then have another opportunity for the public to give feedback on that and then make a final decision at our meeting in first meeting in July that's exactly it yes there have been many different ideas out there and so in particular I think the first one is that the proposal would be to formalize that introduction takes as many ideas and comes up with one idea that you're proposing as the way and then second reading would be to formalize that it's not clear to me let me try so the language for example on the second page of attachment B that's the proposed language that would actually go on the ballot correct it's not set in stone tonight correct but it has to be set in stone July 7th yes and tonight we need to give the intention the direction that this is intended to be that final direction we cannot make any changes to that after tonight except to reject it effective yes that gets to the first reading in the second reading so in order to have a meeting first reading be tonight and second reading be on July 7th whatever you decide tonight becomes what the only thing that can be considered on July 7th so I guess there's several questions to ask ourselves do we feel that city of Chico needs more operating capital yes we feel that yes I feel that this is not the council deciding that a tax is going to be imposed it's the council asking the voters if they would like to have a tax imposed and what kind of tax would this be would it be a general tax which would only need a 50% approval or would it be a special tax that could be only used on specific items but that would require a two-thirds majority and if we went on a special tax well if we went on a general tax that means that it could be spent on anything that the council deemed that we should spend it on or we could even layer on a advisory committee if it was special we would have to say these funds are only going to be spent on these items and there again we could layer on a advisory committee on that correct and then we have decisions on how much of a tax a half cent tax would be approximately nine million dollars a two a one percent tax would be approximately eight million dollars we are going to we are going to we are going to we are going to we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going we are going does not have an additional sales tax. So that shows in comparison how we really stand. And we are over 100,000 in population. So thank you for that summary, if you don't mind me chiming in. I'm ready to support the half cent. Obviously in the age of COVID-19, this is not an ideal conversation to be having. You know, what Council Member Ori presented seems to be a good faith effort to give us the revenue that we need in order to continue to sustain the work that we're already doing without making cuts in the near future. And it's a general tax that some data pre-COVID has said that is likely to pass and data pre-COVID has said that the three-fourths vote is not likely to pass. And so it comes at a time when the outlook for kind of everybody, including the city, is not good. It should have happened a lot earlier. And this is the very last opportunity that we have to ask the voters if they're willing to increase city revenues in lieu of laying off staff over the next handful of years. And so you know, just a few points that I like about it, and I appreciate Council Member Ori attempting to craft something that kind of wove in community concerns and also filled that gap that we're inevitably going to see. It creates by the documents in front of us a body of folks to review expenditures and increase transparency. And it allows us to ask again once we've proven our ability to use these funds toward ensuring the stability of the organization and improving our roads. And we know with relative certainty that the three-fourths won't pass. Sorry, two-thirds, my bad. You know, I'm going to support putting this question in front of the voters. Understanding that if we choose not to do that now, then we're paying the consequence. And if they choose not to vote for it, they know the consequence. And to me, it seems like this is too serious of an issue not to put in front of the voters and not to allow them to make that decision. So I will support it. We have a motion on the table. So I think about a year and a half ago, before I was on this council, I sat in on Mr. Ottoboni's question. And I think that he made a very thorough presentation on the condition of our roads and where our budget, where we were fiscally in regards to being able to pay for those, I believe it was $188 million. At that time that he projected that we were behind and falling farther and farther behind every month. To my way of thinking, this is the most important thing that we've ever had. And I think that's a very important issue for the future of the city, at least as far as operations go, that I can remember having during the year and a half that I've been on the council. I won't hide the fact that I think a general tax is easiest for us to pass. But if we can't get consensus on a general tax, then I think that's a very important issue. I'm willing to vote for any kind of tax just to get something on the ballot before the people to try to make this happen because I feel it's so important. There is a motion on the table. You know, in support of the motion, do you say there is one? There is one. Vice Mayor Brown, did you make a motion? I don't believe I made a motion. Oh, okay. There's no motion there. Okay, you support. No. No, so there is no motion. I'll move that proposal. Half cent? Yes. A half cent general that would have a start of in 22 and sunset in 29 and have an advisory board. That was directed, right? Yes. Previous meeting. Second. Second. Okay. I think citizens want from us more services. They don't want us to drastically reduce services and cut staff. The eventual language on this should, I think, talk about infrastructure, and that's my commitment, is infrastructure parks and creekways. Staff has convinced me that any, that that kind of, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as we all as originally thought and to condition it on everywhere, any way you can think of conditioning it, gives us a chance to pass, and that a two-thirds vote is just not capable, not attainable. You look at all the numbers up and down the state in the last go-round, and it's just, these are tough times. We're in a recession. Voters, businesses are concerned that we would add that extra expense to people. So I think we barely perhaps, if the business community would step up and support this, we might have a chance of getting that half cents. I certainly don't envy any of you that will be on the council next year and will have to continue to freeze those seven police officers' positions. That will have to dramatically decrease your expectations of any new initiatives in this city. We'll lose key staff members meeting after meeting. I don't envy you that. And I think that this is a chance. It's been mentioned for us to at least give some, a lifeline to staff to go forward. I really would like those that voted against it last time, and we, you know, at least one more person has to throw their support in here, to join a bipartisan effort with the business community or something that can be supported that can pass. If instead we have a fig leaf that, oh, gee, we can just dedicate a tax so you don't have to trust those untrustworthy council members. You're fooling yourselves. Two-thirds just won't pass. So, you know, I'm quite, I will vote against whatever we come up with tonight if between now and our final vote, I don't see something that we have strong support from community leaders for. The people want to hide behind the demand for a two-thirds vote. I don't see that. The police cutbacks are on them. Madam Mayor? Yes. If I may. The irony being, Mr. Orey, that you said when you made the motion that when this came back up you'd vote no on it. If there's not community support. Well, the Chamber of Commerce has already come out and said that they won't support this. On July 7th they have a decision to make. Perhaps. Certainly. I mean, they've already kind of made that decision. Last March. The other irony. I'll continue, is in our earlier discussion about the farmer's market, you were concerned that a later council could just come and change the franchise agreement at will. But this has to be... There's three words in my mouth. I actually didn't say that. Okay. You didn't insinuate that? No. It's a question. I mean, if you're going to keep talking over me, I might as well just go back and forth. Well, I fully understand that if we reach a franchise agreement with the market, that that will run for the eight years or seven years or whatever we adopt. Okay. So my point being with the general tax, we can put whatever preconditions on it we want. I was the one that asked that the franchise fee for the waste haulers go to roads, and we changed that pretty quickly, and I voted to change it because it was necessary. But we can tell the public whatever we want. Oh, it's going to go for this. It's going to go for that. And we don't know that it is. And the advisory board, to me, is just an abdication of our duties. I don't know why we would ever do that. It doesn't have any power anyway. I guess that's my statement for now, other than we already know who's going to come out against a general sales tax and the reasons they're going to do it. So if we're going to ask the community to tax itself while we're in a recession, while we're in probably the worst financial crisis we're ever going to see, we haven't talked about what's coming from the state or federally to back up what's happened in the COVID crisis. There's all kinds of tax things going to be on the ballot. I think they may all get voted down. But if we want to protect the community and this tax, we need to make sure that the people that vote for it know it's going to go where we say it's going to go. Because as you didn't mention, everything can change in November and somebody can come in. They could start a whole new department. Say, hey, we want to do this. We even heard Candace Grubbs today suggest we start our own election department. Who knows? If we want to protect the money, we've got to protect the money. And putting a citizen's advisory board between us and the money is just bait and switch and magic smoke and mirrors. It doesn't do anything. It's a false sense of security. Vice Mayor, would you accept that a friendly amendment to our motion? I would like to. I would like to remove the requirement of an oversight board. I'll give Sean whatever minor rope he wants. I would prefer to hear from other council members before accepting. Perhaps it's nuanced that temporary funds, funds that would only be in effect for eight years, should not. By any prudent body, be used for salaries. But I think that that might be too nuanced. I do like having the sunset date in there. Oklahoma City had been very successful in passing some tax initiatives that were for specific projects. At the end of that time period, the project was built, the building, the road, whatever it was. and people said okay good and then move to the the next project but I think it's too nuanced fit for that general tax some Morgan I know the answer to this so I apologize for asking but just to clear the air if I accepted that friendly amendment would you support this measure thank you I don't accept your friendly amendment thank you okay we do have a motion a second on the floor we need to have five votes to place it on the ballot so let's call for the question councilmember Huber councilmember Morgan no councilmember Ori councilmember Reynolds no councilmember stone nay vice mayor Brown mayor Schwab fails for three so that did not pass we have an opportunity to put something else before the council to consider being placed on the ballot councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman councilmember Stoneman I appreciate the question, and it's an appropriate question. I moved as part of the Finance Committee to bring this report to Council, so I think it's an appropriate discussion and one that needed to be had. I'm thankful to see Council Member Reynolds nodding her head as well. But this is a sales tax measure, and sales taxes are regressive. For the uninitiated, regressive means that a larger proportionate share of that tax is going to be paid by people with lower incomes. In District 5, where I live, it is the lowest income per capita in the city of Chico. So we're talking about the lowest income residents in my district. It comes from... For Ori, there's no question that there are infrastructure needs in our community. You referred to a section in my district as a ghetto at the last meeting. And I appreciate the general meeting. I know you didn't mean a disparaging comment in that respect. But nonetheless, there's an infrastructure need there. And yet, the demand is going to come. Most... Disproportionately to people with lower incomes, which is precisely in my district. Limited commercial activity in that district as well. With no consideration as to that larger proportionate share, what they're going to get out of that. The major highway that runs through that district is a Caltrans Highway. So none of this is going to go to fix West Sacramento and Highway 32. Or the... The intersection that I've been complaining about for years now, near Rosedale Elementary School, where my son goes to school, to cross Highway 32. So, none of this tax is going to impact that section of town. And yet, the people that are going to pay the largest proportionate share of their income, come from my district. We're talking about talking about police reform. That wasn't a stutter. We're talking about talking about police reform. And a major portion of that discussion relates to... Disproportionate treatment of people of color. And also, in District 5, the largest proportion of voting age anyway, the greatest diversity occurs in District 5. So we're talking about a tax that's going to hit the largest proportionate share in my district, which... With no commensurate projects or benefit, while we are talking about police reform, to place this on a ballot for those... The rest of the city to vote in a tax. I just... I can't get behind that. I've never been a fan of sales taxes. I think there's a revenue gap. But the revenue gap is... Our employee... I'll say this... I seem to say it at least once a year. On this microphone. Our employee costs are going up 7 to 8% per year. The problem is not that we need additional tax revenue. And I think we do. But the way that we are asking that, and the people that we're asking that of, are paying a disproportionate share. I mean... Yeah. I'll leave it at that. So I'm not supportive. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. large groups and the Chamber of Commerce and other people say what they will come behind. I am not a fan of sales tax myself, and I would rather not have one. However, I represent the entire city of Chico, and if the citizens want to vote to tax themselves, I don't think it's my job to not even allow them to vote on it. So I'd like to do whatever I could do to get a measure on the ballot, if at all possible. So what I can support is something that is similar to the D version that we have on our laptops. I think it's page 73 or wherever we're at, but need to include public safety and infrastructure as well. So if we can get to somewhere where we can agree on supporting public safety and infrastructure, then I would like to make a motion that we would move forward with a one cent, two thirds, and come together to support something to build back our community. So, sorry, I just want to make sure you said one cent special, one cent, two thirds, to include public safety and infrastructure. Thank you. And that was a motion? Yes. Second. Public safety, do you mean salaries? Or do you mean infrastructure that is related to public safety? Both, okay. So we can handle this a couple of ways. The reason a red line is before you is, as you're aware, on first reading, the! was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was your motion is presenting it would apply to public safety and what is meant by that. So you're saying that we need to make those adjustments before we take this vote. Is there a way for us to take a vote of intent before it is final redlined and then take another vote? Correct. It would be a slight modification of the motion or clarification of the intent of the motion if that is to amend this. I would recommend that we clarify right now which sections so there's no confusion whatsoever as to what is being introduced. So Ms. Reynolds. So we would then need to un- redline providing police and fire protection services. That needs to be left in there. My notes because my computer was not. Structure. So and then for on line. 11 public safety services. Need would need to be in line. And the intent is public safety services and infrastructure maintenance and improvement. Yes. And then 1314 15 I guess that would only be. Reimplement those. Yeah. Continue on the redlining in 23 and 24 on page. 1. I think that would stay out. Yes. And then on line 1 on the next page. The general would have to be. Or no it would be special sorry. Yeah. Remove general leave special. And remove. Take out the the. The. On page. 2 at line. 10. The items that are stricken there. Emergency services including preserving. That will item that has been stricken would have to be. Yes. And. That's strictly. Correct. Added. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. fine 21 spine doesn't fit there's any other changes through page 10 that we need to be addressed but then it's page 10 use of proceeds under 150 I think we're fine on the bottom of 10 it's the top of 11 we would need to change the for emergency services again correct at page 11 line 3 again we need to add and and then undelete yes for emergency services including preserving the number of on duty police officers and I see on D are we still have the citizens advisory committee on here I believe that 12 yeah I believe that's under D of 3.9 0.1 5 0 on page 12 line 12 think didn't we agree that I mean is that a is it even legal are we allowed to have a citizens invite oh if it's a special tax I guess you can because you're dedicating where it's going to go so that's okay under a special not under a general yes with a special what that COC would be doing is preparing a report on service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service If it's a two-thirds with the right language, we don't need a COC. Yeah, but the fact that it's in there is just, I think, more security for people. It doesn't do us any harm to have that in there. Oh, I beg to differ, Mr. Huber. You put a committee in the middle of anything, and it's going to be a problem more than a solution. I mean, not in Chico, but like other places. It just doesn't. So if the question is, would I support the motion, would I still second the motion if you remove that? No, I'd like to see that remain in there. So I don't mean to put you on the spot, but help me understand the difference. If we say it's only for these things, and legally it can only be for these things, why have a committee to oversee what we already signed into law, so to speak? Just leave it. Another layer of security for people to know that they're getting what they think they're getting? No. No? In an effort to keep moving forward, I will allow it to. We'll try with it staying. So let me see if I understand the motion. It's for $18 million into perpetuity for police. Public safety and infrastructure. Yes, is there anything you'd like to add? Oh, no. Okay. Okay. Which requires a two-thirds of the electorate to approve. Right. Yeah. Which we already know has polled before COVID times as not going to be likely passed. And now we're in the worst economic... I think we're in the worst economic recession that I've certainly lived through. And most people alive have never seen. But regrettably, some people didn't vote for the general. So now we're forced to vote for a special. Doesn't make it any better. You're not forced to. We're forced to vote on a special. All right. So we... Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Council Member Morgan. No. Council Member Ori. No. Council Member Reynolds. Aye. Council Member Stone. Nay. Vice Mayor Brown. No. Mayor Schwab. No. Fails two to five. I have a motion or an idea I would like to float. That we move forward. with a one cent special tax that would be used for infrastructure for only a period of five years. This would give us $18 million for five years could only be used on infrastructure. So those people who are concerned that this tax would go towards CalPERS payments, that argument is not there. Well, it's not as strong because there would be a very small proportion of this tax that would go to CalPERS because most of it is going to infrastructure, but there are some salaries, tied to implementing that infrastructure. I think that this would, if successful, give us the much needed monies that we need for infrastructure, roads, parks, facilities that would in turn help us build our economy back up. We'll write back into our community. If we are successful with this, then our community would gain trust in us saying this is what we need the tax for. We're going to spend it just on this and it will go away in five years. And then I want to think about is that five years the right amount? Would it go into an election year? I would want it to come back. I would want it to come back at another general election that's tied to a presidential election. So I guess that would probably have it expire in, at the, we want to do this fiscal years, don't we? Have it expire in July of 2024. So it would be a three year tax. So it would start in, mid year of 21, 22, and then go towards, go three years and then it would be on the ballot. If that council wanted to put another initiative in front of the public and the public would have that opportunity there to say, yes, that was successful and we want to go forward with it. So that's my proposal. Or a proposal. So my- So my- Or a proposal. And if- Is there any feedback on that? Okay. You want to go ahead? Thank you. Yeah, if we're $188 million in arrears as of a year and a half ago on roads, 18 million for three or four years is not going to put a very big dent in that. And then we have to come back and ask for another vote, for another tax. I would, was that a motion or was that just a suggestion? That was, it was not a motion. For conversation. I was looking for feedback before it became a motion, because- Okay. Because if it was a motion we'd have to go through the redlining. Okay. Okay. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. I'll wait and go ahead, Mr. Morgan. If we're going to advocate our, it's like, okay, so that would be in there. That's my first question. So the second one, and I do appreciate Mayor Schwalbe trying to do as far as the infrastructure, but to Mr. Ori's point, that doesn't help us when it comes to laying off the police officers and not hiring anybody. And if we can make the park cleaner, if we're counting the park as infrastructure and we can make that look nicer, that's actually going to require more police officers. So my feeling, I guess, is this. I haven't decided my vote yet. If we're going to go for a one cent special tax, which the surveys, and Mr. Ori certainly believe, and Mr. Stone, I know they're just looking at the survey, can't pass or would be hard to pass. I think we're going to have better luck if it does include public safety than if we leave that part out entirely. I'm not sure. Other than this is five years, so it's not ongoing. I don't know that it makes it more. I'm just talking out loud. I'm not disagreeing with you. I don't know that it makes it more palatable for the voters. This whole discussion is fantasy land. We already know that the. I don't know why we're going through this posturing. We want to bring a ballot measure forward. And Council Member Ori is shaking his head in agreement. Yeah, we already know the survey results have already told us there's no way that this is going to pass with the two thirds majority. You can decide to put it before the voters all you want to, and it will be a waste of time and a waste of money spent on the ballot measure. But if that's what the council wants to do, I'm certainly not supportive of it. I think it's a waste of time. This is fantasy land. We already know pre-COVID that this was not going to likely pass. No matter how what proportion we we apply to public safety, what we're doing is we're placing something on the ballot to make us feel good that we're bringing something forward that maybe the voters will tell us what they want to do. We already know that it's not going to pass. So it doesn't matter whether it's three years, five years, ten years. I get there's an economic principle that does say during a recession, it's a good idea for government to continue spending, especially in a local capacity. But our employee costs are doubling. Yeah. Every ten years. Our general fund budget was $54 million. Gosh, I used to know what percentage was employee costs in that case. Over 50%. So $18 million, $9 million, progressive tax, two-thirds, partitioning it off for a particular department or departments or whatever pet projects that you want to pick. We already know the same thing. We already know that the fiscal survey results have already told us that that's not going to pass. And certainly not going to pass at the time that it is most, most deleterious to our businesses in the city. Well, I'm hearing a lot of reasons why it won't work, but I'm not hearing any substitutes, any other ways that we can go forward for the money that we know that we need for the city in the future, unfortunately. I think it's, yes. I think we're all not overly optimistic about being able to get to two-thirds, and I'm putting that mildly. However, we do have the business community, the chamber, and we do have a lot of, you know, people who are otherwise detractors that seem to indicate that the only way that they would vote for this, if it was a two-thirds, if it was a special tax. So really I think it's incumbent upon us, meaning the city, to promote heavily the reality of what things will look like if we do not pass a tax. And we're not able to move forward. How post-apocalyptic things are going to look around here if we don't have that money. So, yeah, it's an uphill battle, but it's a necessary battle. It's one that I think we have to take on. I would make a motion. I would back up to attachment D again. And I'd be willing to take out the Citizens Oversight Advisory Committee. Okay. And I would substitute line 12, page 84, if that might convince Mr. Morgan to move forward. But I would substitute Ms. Reynolds' wording with, let me get up to that page. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right from beginning line nine, whereas the cost of, I would make... What page, not of the PDF, but of the document. 18. 18, okay. I would substitute... I would substitute... Police and Fire Protection Services throughout the document with public safety infrastructure, which would give us the flexibility to build things like fire stations. I realize that this isn't going to satisfy everyone, but I think it's a compromise that still helps out our public safety sector. And perhaps can get enough buy-in that we can get this passed. And still maintain all of the verbiage regarding infrastructure maintenance and improvements. So replacing... Do I need to go through it line by line? I guess I do. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. You can actually un-strike out line nine and 10. You can leave line 11 for Public Safety Services. Because those aren't germane to the end result here, whereas the city... Okay. Okay. Okay. We're looking at attachment D. Yes. Page one of attachment D. Yes. Line nine and 10. Yeah. I would take out for my version, I would leave 13, 14, and 15 lined out. Got it. I would add... Okay. Line 11 where it says Public Safety Services, I would say Public Safety Infrastructure and General Infrastructural Maintenance and Improvements. So... Mr. ... Can I ask you a question? Yes. Mm-hmm. So is it your intent then to make it only about Public Safety Infrastructure, not people? In the effort to get a compromise, yes. Okay. Thank you. Let's see. So I... Go ahead. Sorry. You almost had me. Tell me where... What I need to... What I would need to do different to have you... Well, I guess I... I'm sorry. I'd like to ask why the... Why cut out... Why make it Public Safety Infrastructure instead of just Public Safety and Infrastructure? Because my understanding is there has to be a level of specificity. That if it's too ambiguous, that it's not... Mark, could you speak to that? Because I had asked you that question earlier today. Yeah. In a specific tax, it has to be specific. If Public Safety is... That's... And I think the city attorney is going to have to read into this a little bit as well. The term public safety, is that good enough or do they have to specifically say public safety personnel and infrastructure or can they just say public safety? Yeah, the difference should be the specificity. What it comes down to is on page 10, actually page 11 of attachment D and that's section 3.90.150, use of proceeds and we're going to put the money, be restricted to put the money towards. So as a special tax as proposed originally with exhibit D, it was for public safety personnel. So I'm going to put it in the next section. So as a special tax, it's only for the proceeds of the special tax must be used only to maintain and enhance capital and public infrastructure such as roads, sideways, parks, greenways, and other public assets. It sounds like what you're proposing, Councilmember Huber, is that would all stay and you would add and public safety improvements. Public safety. Infrastructure. Well, I'm okay with improvements if you're okay with improvements. Okay. I don't know if you're talking to him or me. I can't see your eyes. I'm okay with improvements and if we had to be more specific and said public safety including preserving the number of on-duty police officers and firefighters or improving 9-11 response times, anything that made it specific. But what I don't want to do and partially to your point, Mr. Huber, if we're going to get an amazing amount of pushback, but if we can explain to the public the apocalypse, the apocalyptic nature of the finances, the chambers on board, some of the community groups that might normally have opposed such a measure, I think if we try to cut out the, and this is, I'm paraphrasing here, if we try to cut out the 9-11 response time being what people, when people think of public safety, I'm all for a new fire station, particularly if it's in District 1, but I'll take it anywhere. That comes with personnel as well. If we're talking about public safety, people want to feel safer. So if we take the public safety officers out of the equation, I think that makes it that much harder to sell. I think, you know, I can't be certain, but I think part of the reason that one or two of our council members are opposed to it is because it appears too heavily weighted toward police public safety personnel. So. Quick question. Would it not be specified a third, a third, a third, if we're doing public safety, infrastructure, parks, whatever it is, we could add that to it and specify so it's not a heavily weighted to all one. I guess the hypocrisy of this is we're having the conversation saying if we don't raise this money, and if we don't get all this in, then we are going to have to lay off 40 police officers next year. But if we can't put up ad attacks, that, you know, that's going to keep, you know, that's going to pay for police officers' salaries. So we can't have it both ways. I mean, if you're, if the directive is to try to get rid of police officers, then we won't have a, somehow it needs to be able to maintain salaries. Obviously we're not going to. To be clear, there's not a proposal to lay off 40 police officers. I understand. Okay. It's been said by staff members and by people that if we don't have this, we are going to be laying off X number, of police officers and X number of firefighters because we're not going to have money in the budget. So I just want to be clear that when we're being told this is what we're going to have to do is lay off. We've also been told that the general sales tax is what's going to pass. And yet we're having this conversation and spinning our wheels about getting a two-thirds tax to pass that's not going to pass under the guise that some sort of compromise of this diet is going to change the perspective of the public that has been documented by research. I will not support this for that reason. It has nothing to do with what's in it. It's the fact that the research and data that was scientifically collected, the only data that we can reference pre-COVID said no, this will not happen. I would love to hear your alternative motion. I would love for a version of a general sales tax to pass because that's what could pass. And I supported Councilmember Ori's proposal because it was a stark compromise between the one cent general, made it specific, gave it time parameters, I voted for it too, but it didn't pass. Is there another version that you might put forward that could pass? I don't foresee a general sales tax passing based on the comments that I've heard from three out of seven of us. I don't see it happening. I think that was the best proposal we could have had. I agree if I may. Yeah, just because one won't pass doesn't mean that we go down the road to grab the next worst, and we don't have to go back and forth and try and keep pushing one in forward into the conveyor belt to make ourselves feel better about asking the voters for something that we already know what the answer is. They're not going to pass this. They weren't going to pass it before COVID. It's not going to make it any more enticing. So I agree with the Vice Mayor. I don't disagree with the Vice Mayor except that nothing against the researchers or the data, but it was a survey, which is akin to polling, which is sometimes good, sometimes bad, and as many of us have pointed out, it was all pre-COVID. The town has changed. The city has changed. The park has certainly changed. Maybe people's opinions have or have not, and I appreciate, Mr. Stone, what you said about, you know, if this is bad, let's keep trying to change it to make it where it should go so it will pass is like spinning our wheels. That's not exactly what you said, so I apologize for that. My purpose to Mr. Orr, I don't want to see us laying on our backs. I think if we got a tax, general or special, only for infrastructure, and then we turned around, regardless of what we told the public, and we turn around and laid off police officers, they're going to be irate. I think that if we pass a general tax on a different council and dispense it in a different way, which I think they will, the citizens are going to be irate. So whether it was Casey's, and I was right there with Mr. Huber until he left the personnel out because I think that's an important component of public safety. I think it's probably the largest component. And then Ms. Reynolds, you know, added, is this a third, a third, a third, and then maybe let the departments decide. I don't know. I know I'm one of the detractors that you're talking about, and I certainly represent a certain amount of people. I probably represent the largest amount of people that are no tax, no tax, no tax. And I'm not trying to be inflexible. I think we were almost there with Ms. Reynolds when she was talking about the first motion. And the only reason I voted no, and I know you guys can laugh at me as long as you want, I don't see the point in putting an overwatch committee that has no role. So we've actually come fairly close. All right. Oh. Ask one question. If we do not specifically include police salaries, would the savings that we would realize, you know, from the funds that we would be earmarking for infrastructure, could those be in turn used for salaries, police officer salaries? That's a difficult question. And I think it's one that could best be answered by likely there is some percentage of funds going to the varying departments that this new funding mechanism would be able to give support to, but to a large degree, no, on that. But there will be some benefit reaped from that, but it's not as much as I think that everybody's hoping for, if that's the sole goal. So I'm going to, if I may, I'm going to amend where I was going with this. I'm going to go back to Ms. Reynolds' proposal and ask to substitute it with the same motion, except take out citizens' oversight and accountability. That's a motion. Second. Well, take out citizens' oversight, not take out accountability. I know that's not how you meant it. I know, I know. But somebody could read it that way and be like, hey, they just passed a sales tax measure with. Item number 3.90.150 on page 11. Well, the entirety of that, there's four aspects there. Citizens' oversight and accountability is that heading. A is about separate fund accounting. B is initial statement spending plan. C is the independent audit. It's only. So D. Yeah, it's subsection D. And that's page 23. So that's page 12 of attachment D. Right. Lines 12 through page 13 at line 2. Yes, strike that. Yes, a motion and a second. I just want to review Councilmember Reynolds' suggestion was for infrastructure. It did not include salaries for police officers. Okay, just wanted to refresh my memory on that. Okay, so there is a motion and a second. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. in perpetuity yeah i don't think yeah okay have a vote please council member huber yes council member morgan yes council member ory no council member reynolds yes council member stone nay vice mayor brown mayor schwab no fails three four that would have been better odds in the election than the ballot those numbers were better than than the the measure would receive in november randall in the interim if i could have a conversation i understand you've exceeded opposition to regressive tax it is a half a cent if we go back to that it is sunsetted it's got about as many protections and it it's an emergency revenue source and what sales tax in our town does is that it taxes that corning guy that wants to buy a car and it it it's the fact that we're the economic center of the north valley and we can spread we are that over you know over a much larger area unlike our property tax where we're serving an urban area much larger than the people that have to pay for it through their property taxes our sales tax is that one that captures the the entire region and the resources that we put out in the region there's nothing else that does that for us so i think it is a unique opportunity one time that you that you might uh uh uh uh! we we we we we through and to hit that corning farmer that's buying the tractor as well as, you know, poor person. You know, given the fact that we need, I would like to make an effort. I would love to hear some of the council members that would like something like this to pass to say, and we're going to raise $200,000, and we promise there won't be a hit piece against the council member that's running. That does anything. Council Member Ory, I appreciate you, especially for the folks at home, laying out the different impacts that taxes have. You know, if we have a transient occupancy tax, that doesn't hit local residents. It hits people that are traveling into town. Just as your point is reasonable that sales taxes are everybody that comes into the area to purchase things, as well as our triggered tax through Amazon and Wayfair and those types of entities. I've got a 26-month-old son at home. Most of you know that. We purchase diapers. It's not the best system, and I full mea culpa, we don't use reusable diapers. Oh! Oh! I know. Believe me, I think about it, and the amount of waste that we produce. But those are taxed. And when I look, I mean, if I'm supposed to be representing my district, and I know the makeup of that district, the lowest income residents in the entire city, with little opportunity for that infrastructure and changes, while we are demanding, the community is demanding, we are demanding reformations to the Police Department. The suggestion is we should give more money to the Police Department explicitly to make sure we pass something is just going to be palatable and shouldn t be palatable There are other parcel tax opportunities I recognize that general tax is the easiest to pass and we have seen those numbers as we as we as as as as as as as as as as as more supportive with the proposal to shift from one cent to a half cent. In fact, if anything, I think it's a better opportunity to pass a one cent sales tax and then say, you know what, because of the impact, we don't want that much money right now. It's a far better strategy. But so reducing it a half cent just means that another entity, the county, can come by and pass another half cent sales tax on top of it and absorb that revenue. I'm uncomfortable with that. But at the end of the day, I cannot turn while we're in this environment, knowing what the economics are. I've been saying this from in February, that this COVID thing is going to be something that we're going to be living with for the next year or more, that the economic impact is devastating. And right at a time when that consumption tax is exactly what a sales tax is, is going to be hitting the residents that are most gravely impacted by COVID. Right? These are the people that work in the restaurants, that don't have careers that are making them even the median household income of $44,000, $46,000, $45,000, $46,000 a year. I can't, in any reasonable conscience, support such a measure. And then beyond that, knowing what that means for the proposal in the first place, I have questions about whether a general sales tax would pass in this environment in the first place. Making these grand notions of, well, we'll dedicate it to the police department, we'll get a two-thirds majority, and gee, maybe we'll get this proposal, is just as ridiculous as the proposal itself. I can't support it. I appreciate my colleagues trying to find some reasonable manner where we can generate some revenue safely. But if this is supposed to be a comprehensive review, of our opportunities, it absolutely isn't. It's just taking one, maybe possible, and since that doesn't seem to have agreement necessary on the council to, you know, protract this discussion about how, well, we're going to flagellate ourselves on the altar of, we want to give so much to public safety and so much to infrastructure, it doesn't matter. This just isn't going to be passed. So. Council Member Stone, just a point of clarification. Is there any version of a general sales tax? That does align for you, whether it's language, whether it's... Not at this time. Not in the economic environment that we're in. But the change that was different from February to today is I was comfortable having the voters receive that general ballot proposal and making a decision on it. Since that time, since this came before the Finance Committee, we are now in the circumstances that we're in. We don't even have the public in our seats right now. We have no idea what our budget's going to be like, the city budget's going to be like. We, I think, regionally and nationally, we're kidding ourselves as to what that economic impact is. And I say that, it sounds like I'm being alarmist. I'm not at all. So I don't want to harp on how dangerous these economic times are. But we know moving forward that this is going to be devastating and to think that we are going to... I think that's what's hard for me. Throw that onto the ballot to impact the residents that are the most needy. It's like passing a lottery to approve the school bonds, you know, or to fund for schools. The very people that it's supposed to benefit are the people that are going to be paying the price in the first place. The residents in my district and all of the lower income districts within the city pay a larger proportionate share and I just can't get behind. I think that's what's hard for me. Having this conversation that the action taken by this council would simply be to ask the voters of your district, could you get behind this for these purposes? And to me, that feels like our responsibility to ask that question and that's all we are doing. And so I appreciate your stance. I understand it. It just seems so reckless to not ask the question when we know we have some data, data pre-COVID. I get that. That shows this is a possibility. And so we're asking the voters, do you agree? And to me, that's very low risk. That's giving them that power. And to say I'm not going to give them that power because I don't agree with whatever the funds would be used for when they should be able to make that decision. I'm struggling with that so much. You're here. Yes. It's a red flag. I know. Is it the only one proposing it? I don't think so. I know. I mean, you're engaging in the conversation. I appreciate that. I appreciate your willingness to elaborate. And that's also why I commented. It seemed that the questions were directed at me. And, you know, again, I'm in the lowest income district in the entire city. There's no question. The people that are going to be paying the most for this out of their proportionate share of income are going to be the people in my district. And they're potentially the ones that are going to be the least positively impacted and the most negatively impacted, especially as things stand right now. And I'm uncomfortable with that. So we have... Oh, I'm... No, it's okay. We've had a proposal for a half-cent general sales tax that would be for a specific period of time. We had a proposal for a half-cent specific or special infrastructure for a period of three years. Three to five... Seven years for a time period. And we had a proposal for a special tax that would be for police... Public safety salaries and general infrastructure. And we did not have any proposal that passed. Is there any additional proposals that we would like to move on or shall we move on? One last call for another motion. We will move on. Thank you. We have a five-minute break. Yes. Let's take a five-minute break. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

I do want to notate that it's just a little after 9 o'clock checked with the city attorney on which of the closed session items that we need to hear and he anticipates needing about 5 or 10 minutes of closed session so in order for us to be finished by 10 o'clock we should get into closed session at 10 till just to give everyone a sense of time can I ask a clarifying question at the expense of Mr. Jared are those minutes like council member minutes or like Andrew Jared minutes he told me 5 so I told you 10 you already bumped it up I'm sorry oh dear okay so let's get right into it then 4.3 is a verbal update regarding allowing public access at future meetings city clerk Debbie Presson thank you mayor and council this is just going to be a quick update obviously it has been the desire of the council to open up the council meetings and to have a public access to the council meetings and get the public back in and participating the community wants it the council wants it and we're trying to look for ways to facilitate that just wanting to let you know so one of the requests or directives from council was to have the city reach out to the county health official and let them know that the council was moving forward with opening up the meeting I believe that I believe that I believe that assistant city manager assistant city manager Constantine actually reached out that was right in that transition with Dr. Miller leaving and I believe and he can speak to it if you'd like to talk to him about that but he did let them know that with that transition he was asked to copy someone else and he has not received any response the city hasn't heard back at all at all at all at all so so what we've been doing in my department with my staff has been looking out council wanted to look at other venues possible ways that we could open it up obviously with the social distancing this would be limited we anticipate that if you had the department heads stay in their offices stay in the other building we would and not set out here we would perhaps be able to do that we would be able to get maybe 20 people social distancing in this chamber as well as maybe another 10 or 11 in conference room 1 conference room 2 we could probably get 4 or 5 with the social distancing and we would be able to at least have the audio on in there not the audio video but at least the audio so again that's not that's more people than what can attend at this point we do have a highly engaged community and citizens do want to get back here so we reached out to the university to look at Laxon and those kinds of places the larger venues they are not even considering opening their facility to any outside group at all until possibly the fall same with the Chico School District again we weren't looking for free access we were looking for places to rent and to be able to open this back up to our public and to our citizens so we're not going to they're not taking any reservations until the fall as well we did check with Tinseltown to see if we could get into one of the theater sizes we couldn't you know we didn't get a call back and I would anticipate they're not even opening until July so that could very well be again the whole process is that in order to social distance you can't walk past someone and climb over them to get to the six foot seat that you know that has that distance in there the Elks Lodge which was another large venue is they're not available at all right now for outside groups and we didn't get a date as to when they thought that they would be reopening and renting their facilities out talked to John Clark today the executive director of BCAG their their facility is about the same size he felt like it was about the same size and with the social distancing they do have the only thing that is better there than here in terms of the distance is that they have a 10 member board so I could see the council actually being able to spread out and have seven members up there but again you're going to be having limited seating we would be able to actually just place the chairs out and have them six feet and have them six feet and then we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could They've been doing, they don't have the same amount of public participation, and so they have very limited audience, you know, need there anyway. But they did, they're doing a lot of the Zoom stuff, and they actually are going to be adding some additional cameras so that they can facilitate that a little bit easier. It has been tough for a lot of the groups that we've talked to. So I can go back and do a site visit and see. I don't know if there's a set number that the council's looking at. I know you would love to be able to have everybody who wants to attend be able to attend, but I'm just not seeing how that could be done and still meet the criteria of the social distancing. I did look into other cities, Loma Linda, there for, first open meeting will be July 14th. They'll have use of masks, social distancing, and taking temperatures at the door. Typically, they only have a few people in the audience. Fullerton, staff and council set, will be sitting behind plexiglass, limited seating with six foot distancing for the public. The public must wear masks, but they aren't taking the temperature readings. Manteca, very limited seating, 18 seats, mask required, and temperature test. They'll be sitting behind the door. So some of these are very small. However, Chochilla, 25% maximum occupancy to calculate how many will be present. Department heads and council will join in remotely, allowing more residents to be present. So you would all be gone, but they have the city clerk and the assistant city clerk and the city manager are the only ones in here. Thank you. Council Member Morgan. So, you know, many of you received your Western City magazine, and in it they had a whole article on how communities are being innovative in terms of providing more opportunities for the public to participate. And they had one city, I believe it was Montebello, that actually did a drive-through. You could drive through and speak on an item. Now, I don't know who was called. They would have called when that went up if that was like at NASCAR. You can go. But they did do that. So, we did check. There was one city, obviously, that was spotlighted in that magazine that actually took phone numbers of the citizens, and the city clerk staff called them when it was their turn to talk. And, so, trying to look. And then, obviously, another city, I was trying to find my notes. The public comments were read into the record, and that was their way of doing that. So, obviously, we can't get an outside venue at this point in time. And so, what can we do? With our own facility, and how can we make that work? We did talk about having the department heads sitting in their offices and coming over. Again, we're talking maybe 35, at the high end, maybe 40 people coming in. I reached out to Eric Gustafson today, and I just said, okay, so what if we just did plexiglass in between all the seats, and could we do that? And obviously, people would say, well, I don't know. We could still have to get around each other. And so you couldn't unless you had a bubble and every single one. I don't see how we could probably do that and I'm sure he cring ed when he said he probably won t er open up any of my e ma ls now after I asked him that . In addition , there are a lot of needs for the plex as we we we we we we we we we we keep getting pushed out. So they're even having a hard time getting some of the windows fixed where people are actually conversing with the public. We talked about outside in the city plaza with the tent covering, but in this heat and the noise and the possible honking and stuff like that, it would never, it wouldn't work. And then I thought about, okay, so we do know we tested the microphone, the handhelds. You sometimes can't hear them in here, but actually there is one that's pretty powerful and it can go clear out to the sidewalk in front of the council chamber. So I'm thinking 40 people in this building, council's still here and staff in the department heads in the other building, but being able to do, sometimes it's a little bit of a challenge, but it's a little bit of a challenge. So keeping that type of a lineup, keeping it socially distanced, I think that's hard to manage. I wouldn't even want to ask the interim police chief what he would think about that. How would we call people up and how do they get through the crowd safely to get to the microphone when it's their turn? Or do we just look for ways to say, if you want to speak on this item, get in line now. I mean, that is a possibility. so the other thing is is that we've we got a report from uh josh in it at the last meeting talking about the webex and the the capabilities the technology is there however um just so you can kind of grasp this and maybe there are examples of other cities that have the same kind of public engagement since the covid19 pandemic hit and we went into this emergency mode we received and the limited meetings that we have had over 900 comments received in from the the engaged chico platform that is not counting all the public comment emails i didn't total those i didn't get that opportunity to do that so like on the march 25th special meeting we had three items on that agenda and we received 337 comments for that meeting for three items and that's not counting the ones that come in through the emails and so managing managing the callers would recall would would really require i believe a group a contingency of managing that and being able to tell them okay you're in the queue um i i would actually before i would do that i would actually volunteer to call people and get them on the phone and then being able to have them talk to you directly so it it um i don't really have an absolute viable solution to this and i think that um you know if you want to talk to chris constantine regarding you know what he did hear back which i don't think he heard anything at all we staff we've been grappling with this we're looking for ways we you know the whole reason you have a city clerks to ensure that the public has a way to participate and so this is weighing heavily on all of us um and so i i'm i recognize i'm not bringing you true viable options except that we could open up a new way of doing this and i think that's a good way of doing it and i think that's a good way of doing it and i think that's a good way of doing it and i think that's a good way of doing it and i think if we can get that okayed i know that you've instructed us to inform the health department that we are planning on opening up but you're talking maybe 40 people in a facility and so if that's the way you would like to as to move forward that is great and then we would still augment that obviously with the electronic emails and the engaged chico platform and how would we be able to select those 40 would it be a good idea to do that in the future i think that's a good idea to do that in the future i think that's a good idea it would have to be first come first serve there i it would have to be first come first serve there i or a lottery um there there was one additional thought that i ran by um the city manager today and you know he probably doesn't want to come over to my side of the building anymore but i thought so i know the council is committed to transparency into the public involvement and and just hear me out i recognize that council works there are council members who work and they cannot make it for a day meeting and i totally i i understand that what if we had the ability to have people i could schedule people to come in and be heard before the council on one one item or some cities actually have them come and provide all their input uh for a certain set of minutes and they actually um go over all the items that they want they wish to have the council hear themselves tell you and we take public input for a couple hours and let them if or an hour however many people are scheduled i we can queue them up we would have them you know because we would make appointments with them i'm willing to try that for some of the items that i know that i can make appointments with them and i'm willing to try that for some of the items that i know you want to get back to and that you want public participation in even though you want them for all of them i recognize we have some some big items so you for instance could say on tuesday from 10 to 11 you will be taking public comments um from people who wanted to talk about item 3.1 and then ask everybody to be here determine how much time they could speak right i would stagger it and then record them and have well i was i i i could i could do the recording but i think that they really want to see you they they want to see the council they want to be able to tell you directly and so i didn't know if you had one this isn't the optimal specifically identifying if there's a couple of items that we can adjust our schedules for to take public comment on is that right and then go ahead and go into that discussion and it could go four or five hours maybe it only goes three but you've afforded the citizens an opportunity to really be here um they they may not be able to stay in the room for all the deliberations but they were able to have their their their voices be heard directly by you i don't know that doesn't get you where they get to actually sit in here other than they can watch on tv i mean i don't know i guess we could check to see if the city manager has money in his budget for a huge screen outside um but i i just and i say that i i i understand the critical nature of trying to get our citizens back into this meeting and i we i think that we've looked at every possible way um that would work either with this facility and since we don't really have a venue outside that um with other agencies that we could truly we could we could we could we could we could we could we could we could use to get a larger amount of people in. We have a high engagement with our citizens. I think that once we open the doors, I believe that they'll be here. They're going to want to be here. We were already having packed rooms and had to use overflow before COVID-19 hit. So I only, I can only anticipate that they're still interested and that they will be, they'll be back. Okay. Questions? I just have a comment. And I don't know if this is feasible or if this makes it any better. But Pastor Brian Myers, who's done the convocation a couple times, Grace Community Church has a rather large auditorium. He says they can fit 85 people social distanced in there because their chairs move. There's four different entries and exits. So you can control the flow of people. They can, offer a remote viewing room for another 25 to 30 people in two different places that gets up to 150. They can put the council up on the stage. Stage is bigger than this. And if you're interested in, I don't know how that works technology wise with having to show all this, all these other things. If you're interested in talking to him, he'll, he thinks he can make that work. What if it comes down to a venue? It's much bigger than this. Right. No, I'm absolutely open to that. In terms of technology, I think that we will have a capability. We may not have Granicus. There may be an offset to that, to being able to have the people in the room. We'll always be able to reload the video into Granicus. So it'll always be, you know, it'll be accessible. However, you know, we wouldn't be streaming it through Granicus just because that would be the moving of a server and all of those kinds of things. But I'm definitely willing to, to look into that. If council, so chooses, um, choice energy authority streams on YouTube. I mean, it works really, really well. I would be, it would be a matter of, would the council be willing to, uh, consider that auditorium and would it work for you? There's no point in you talking to them if they wouldn't be willing to consider that auditorium. It's an auditorium. It's not a church. It's a gym. And I will say that it could still be streamed. It just, it's not a church. It's a gym. It's a gym. It's a gym. It won't be through our Granicus engaged system. I'll have to load it back in and retime. I'll have to go, you know, and I can do that. That's not a worry. Um, if the council would like me to move in that and check that out. That sounds like an excellent idea. St. John's is probably about the same size where we held the housing conference. They've been very cooperative. You say it's about four entrances and not their church, but the auditorium part. Grace is a little different. One's downtown? No. Grace is a little bit bigger, but it's right across the street. Yeah, Grace is bigger. I mean, either way. Seems to me that one of those two options would be worth exploring. We wouldn't have to restrict the number of people. Hopefully we wouldn't have to restrict it. At least it wouldn't be as severe. I would like you to look into that. Okay. I think, and we do have a lot of citizen engagement. We have a lot of people coming in. I would guess, and I could be wrong, but I would guess we're not going to have quite the level of people come that we did in the past. Just like the restaurants that have opened up are all slowly coming back. So if we can find a venue. First of all, Debbie, I appreciate all the work you did. No, that's all right. Because you've got the technology to deal with. You have all these different things. It's almost impossible to make it. The amount of work you'd have to go through to get 40 people in here almost isn't worth it. But if we could get 80 with another 40 or so in an overflow, and they could feel that they were in the meeting, and it's already set up, we don't have to put a plastic divider. They can move the chairs that far apart. And then if people trickle in, we might not even have to worry about the lottery or the referral. We're selling tickets or however that works. When we got to that point, maybe it'd be worked out. I mean, especially the giggling that's been going on up here tonight. There's clearly some funny stuff going on. So I don't know if you need direction on that. I don't know what the other alternatives are. And I didn't know that was one until this came up. Expanding the search to churches, I think, is a good idea. It sounds like there's probably a few out there that could accommodate a larger group and allow the chairs to be moved around. But I mean, I can visualize it being a positive thing. Okay. Yeah, I'm supportive of that. Feel free to pursue. And I would love to hear more as soon as possible. Yes. All right. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Any other comments? Okay. We will move to item 4.4, which council member requests. Item 4.4. Item 4.4. For a Mayor Schwab request, I talked last meeting about my belief that there is a great divide of the understanding in our community regarding policing, community service funding, and the judicial system. Policing is the city's responsibility, and the one that we need to be taking responsibility for. And I think that's something that we really can address. Looking at the City of Chico's Police Department's website, I talk about community policing, specifically public safety, saying that there should never be a division between a police department and the community it serves. They truly are one in the same. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. that addressed the items that were brought up by many members of the community asking to be sure that the city was adhering to all of those policies. I think that it's important that we have a better understanding why is there the divide between the community that doesn't understand that, yes, we are following the policies that our community wants them to follow. What are the AB 392 regulations? How is the city implementing them? Are we in compliance? And to reach a better understanding so that the police department can explain what the regulations are and what the regulations are. And to reach a better understanding what their policies are and that the community can have a conversation about what those concerns of theirs are and how they reach that understanding. The venue that I chose to do was sign on to the My Brother's Keeper Pledge for mayors that serves as an audit of police policies. And I committed when I signed those on to review the Chico's Police Policy Act. And I made sure that the police department used the force, engaged the community in that review, report out our findings to the council, to the public, to our community, and reform any of the police force policies that this committee, this ad hoc group can agree on. If there is disparity. That's what I want to do. between there. I've met with the interim chief of police, I've met with the CPOA, I've met with community groups and they're supportive of us moving forward in this so that we our community can come together with an understanding of what those policies are. Um I'm suggesting that this committee be comprised of myself , council members council member Huber and council member Reynolds , 3 community members that are appointed um by the committee members um and the chief of police should be at this um part of this ad ha committee and two members as of the Chico Police Officers Association. I think that it will bring better understanding. Before we start asking for any changes, I think what we need to do is have a better understanding of what the policies and the practices and the training and the culture of the Chico Police Department is. Just because, well, not just because, because so many police departments are coming under question throughout the country, I think that we owe it to our community and we owe it to the police department to be able to say this is the status of the police department's policies and we want to really have a, we don't want to have a division between the police department and the community it serves. We want to support the community. We want to support, we want to support the police department. So I, that is my proposal, that we form this ad hoc committee, study the policies, and have a broad community discussion of them. Yes, Sean? Can I ask a couple questions? Yes. I hate to say, I hate to put you on the spot because that's what Vice Mayor Brown always says, before she asks me a question. I don't hear this. Can you, obviously, thought this out, I don't know to what extent you've talked to Chief Madden, can you, and I'm not offended in any way, can you explain how you got, it's nine people, how you picked the council members that you picked? I selected council member, Hubron council member Reynolds because they were not up for re-election. That if this process takes longer, than November, then they can continue on this discussion. And I designated the mayor because I think that no matter who the mayor is, that they should be part of this process. Okay. And then, so this is more a question for the city attorney or debuts. It can't really be ad hoc because the amount of, because if there's council member appointees, does that not make it a, some other word? It's ad hoc. It's ad hoc because you're creating it for a specific purpose. Okay. But it would be covered by the Brown Act. It is a Brown Act. It would have to be public. Okay. Yes. It would be public. It would be publicly noticed. Yes. And general public comment on that. Mm-hmm. Well, general public comment as to the purview of that. As to the what? The purview of the meeting. Oh. Right. Okay. I have some comments. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mayor Schwab, I stated at the last meeting, I'd be happy to support a conversation. It would be difficult for me to support a committee formation because it would be taking this conversation to a less publicly accessible venue. And I think if you just let me go. And the kind of handpicked component of it is it's difficult for me to support as well. I think in the grand scheme of things, my solid belief is that in a time like this, the discussions and analysis, should happen as in the public eye as possible and with special consideration to transparency about the process. And I want to expand on that a little bit. So far, we've had three, what I would call, you know, significant priorities, issues, go to committee, that have yet to come back to the full council for official action, however you might define that. Housing, cannabis, and tenant rights. Three issues have taken hours of, committee work to refine and have yet to make it back here. And what I know from not being on one of those committees is I have no idea what the process was. I have no right to information until it comes back here. And I don't know if the discussion leading to the report being offered is as robust as I would like to see it be, especially for an issue that, clearly I've created a robust proposal I care about. And as one other council member who's brought forward a robust proposal, specifically including information about use of force policy, I believe I absolutely deserve a seat on the committee in good faith. I believe this is going to pass, even though the concept itself feels like a little bit, doesn't align exactly with my priorities in terms of moving forward with this. But I would ask that you allow me to serve on this committee so that I can be transparent with the public about the initiative that I have also brought forward and confident in the recommendations that come forward. I would add I'm the only social worker on this body. I'm the only LGBTQ plus member on this body. And that kind of diversity is important, especially in a conversation about public safety. I have the utmost respect for the people that you have handpicked for this committee. But I would respectfully request that if I'm going to support this, that you allow me a seat on it. I'll address the item of it being a public conversation. They will, these meetings will absolutely be public. They will be, anybody who wants to come to this meeting will be able to come to this meeting. So the council members? Yes. Members of the public will be able to speak to issues, be able to talk about their concerns. It will be a public meeting in a public venue for the public. Will there be a timeframe associated to bring a robust report back to the council so that we can make a decision on these urgent policy issues? I know that it's going to be important to, I don't want to bring it back. I don't want to have this happen so quickly that relationships are not formed. And trust is built into that. I don't think that it's, I don't, I think, from my perspective, from my experience working on committees such as this, some trust needs to be developed. I can certainly be open to a timeline or a time deadline from this, from the body to work with and will work my best to have this happen. But I think that we will need to have a series of at least six meetings for this to come back. And are you going to respond to my specific request that I be, a member on this body? I acknowledge that you have requested that. Is this an actionable item? This is an actionable item. I move approval with the change that one of the council members be the vice mayor and the other that you would appoint and that you come back in 90 days with a report even if it's an interim report. Oh, definitely can come back with an interim report. Second. I'll make a substitute motion that it stays the way it is. Second. We have a substitute motion. Are there any comments? Well, I guess I have a question. I don't know what it means when you throw your hands up in the air. I can choose my own answer. By all means. Well, I'll just leave the substitute motion there and I'll ask if it is relevant. All right. Can we have a vote? Well, I'd like to say something. We have to have a straw vote. There seems to be strong dedication to making sure that those members adhere to what the mayor has proposed. You know, there's one person of color and one LGBTQ here, and both of those people were not, you know, are not being considered for that post. The argument was made that we want to make sure that we pass through the election cycle appropriately, and yet the vice mayor is not subject to that election cycle concern. And there's a substitute motion by somebody not named in that committee to make sure that they adhere to that membership. It's pretty clear the membership selection was cherry-picked and is extremely important to the continuance of this committee. For that reason, and that reason alone, I've had a profound loss of trust in that process. So I won't support it. I had a question. Your original proposal, your written proposal said, in regards to community members, said, including representatives of concerned citizens for justice. You didn't, I don't think you mentioned that tonight. That's more of a recommendation. I know that that group has been working, with a couple of council members and with the police department in various aspects of the use of force policy. And I've had those discussions. I put them there because I would make the suggestion that anybody that is appointed to this committee has some familiarity with the use of force policy. And I know that that group does. Well, I'd like to see that a definite part of the committee, not merely a suggestion or hope for. And to the comment about the members being cherry-picked or hand-picked or whatever, I don't, you know, I'm just as happy to have Vice Mayor Brown on there as myself. So I don't have any problem with that. Thank you. We have a motion. Correct and a second. So let's have a vote on that. So this is the substitute motion that does not put Alex on. Yes. That we would have to vote down in order to get to my motion. Yes. Okay. Do you have any other motions? It's Ann's proposal. Yeah, my motion is just Ann's proposal that leaves the mayor, you and Ms. Reynolds on to your point, Mr. Huber, about making the motion. Okay. So you would be making sure that the ad hoc committee is made up of the right representation. So you would be appointing someone, Haswood, Ms. Reynolds, Haswood, the mayor. Okay. Councilmember Huber? No. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember Orrie? Aye. Councilmember Reynolds? Aye. No, I'm sorry. My vote is no. Okay. Councilmember Stone? Nay. Okay. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Yes. Fails 3-4. So there was an initial motion, and can we please have that restated? Okay. And that one was to, that was a motion by Councilmember Orrie, seconded by Vice Mayor Brown, and it would be a substitution of Vice Mayor Brown onto, and add her onto that committee, and the report would come back in 90 days. Who would we substitute? Up to the mayor's selection. That's what I heard Councilmember Orrie say. That was my motion. Okay. And Councilmember Huber, I just want to thank you. Not to say that you wouldn't be on the committee, but just I know that that vote potentially puts that at risk, and I really commend you and really respect that, and I appreciate it very much. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? No. Councilmember Orrie? Yes. Councilmember Reynolds? Yes. Councilmember Stone? Nay. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 5-2. Okay. Okay. Item 4.4b, Vice Mayor Brown's request. All right. Well, I will pick around some of it because we're moving to committee with some of it. So thank you for your time and your consideration of this proposal. What you have in front of you is a pretty robust request for this Council to consider that is looking at common sense reforms to the police department that are supported by data overwhelmingly. It should be no secret that these are things that both I and I think several other Councilmembers have expressed support for in the past, but I think at this moment in our history, there's really no... I don't think there's any real excuse for delaying them or for not having these conversations. I just want to add that this is stuff that I've studied and understood and thought about and talked about and met about leading up to this moment. I just think it's really time for us to be decisive and responsive and to make a plan moving forward. So I am going to break down the conversation, if you're willing, into kind of chunks because I know that this is a pretty extensive list of things that my proposal is requesting. And I also want to add in some recent experience that I want to share with you. So the first part of my request is a public accounting of the training of our police force with particular focus on CIT, crisis intervention training, critical incident training, de-escalation, and implicit bias. I want to commend Interim Chief Madden who was proactive in reaching out to me alongside some other staff at the police department to share a document containing this training. I think I have it here. It's quite extensive. Where they had kind of delineated... Staff had done me the service of delineating each staff member, the hours of training that they have had, the dates that they had that training. Really valuable information for me and helpful to sit down and really talk through some of this stuff. This information, as I understand it, and please correct me if I'm wrong, Interim Chief, is publicly available. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. That's a yes for those who didn't hear it in the public. And I would love for people to know how they could access it. Because looking at it, it does not tell the whole story as talking to you definitely did, but just knowing that the public can have access to that understanding. Explaining each component of training is difficult given what I've learned, but I also think it's prudent that they could review it for the sake of transparency. It was definitely helpful for me to understand where we're at and to really look at where we can go from here. Deputy Chief Madden, as the first part of my proposal. Are you... Are you able to kind of direct the public where that information could be available? Is that a possibility? And I have an added thing. If that doesn't work out, then maybe we could revisit that discussion in October and you could give a little bit of the fine points of that training. I'm sorry. Chief. Yes, we can do that. I do believe at this point... You can move forward. Sorry to cut you out. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Chief. So in regards to training, at this point, what I do believe, maybe the city attorney can correct me, but I believe that information is accessible through Public Records Act request. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that clarity. And as far as kind of looking at October as a potential place to just brush over some of the fine points of that, of the different trainings, is that an option or a possibility just so that the public can be aware of some of this? Again, I know given our conversation, it's not... We can't do a deep dive into everything that's on this list. And I've definitely benefited from that understanding, but just a brief overview. We could do that. October would certainly give us time to prepare. As you saw today, the list of training and how we formulate and put that information together is pretty extensive. Yes, absolutely. And I appreciate you sharing it. So, thank you. So, if the council is amenable to that, that feels appropriate for me in terms of the first part of that request. The next aspect is related to use of force. You can sit down if you need to. And I'll note that the police department did put out the policies, as Mayor Schwab referenced, and compared them with the use of force policies that have been shown to decrease use of force incidents. I also know that we have a very low incidence of use of force in police interactions per the data that we have access to. And I know that data is readily available. Given the mayor's committee has been approved by a majority of council, it seems that that's the appropriate venue for unpacking that. And I'll hope for a more robust and timely report from the committee around that issue. So that moves us on to the next item in my proposal, which is the request that each officer receive 40-hour CIT de-escalation training. Within a two-year period. And I'd like to speak to that a little bit more closely. Again, I want to add that Chief Madden reached out to me proactively to really get clarity on my request and to share data on the training program, as I mentioned, both the required post-training and the additional training required by the department specifically. It's clear to me we've got a robust training program. It's clear that we've been moving in a positive direction over the years to make sure that our officers have access to the training that they need. And training that they need is going to be a very, very important part of their training. That enhances their competency in a lot of different areas. This proposal isn't meant to undermine that progress. It's really meant to create a baseline for additional trainings to continue building on. So I would like to see, in short, every Chico police officer trained in 40-hour crisis intervention and de-escalation techniques. And I'd like to see a plan and a budget for implementation within two years. This really does create a base level of required knowledge and an intensive application. And I think those two things are critically important. It also increases our accountability for kind of using these techniques in crisis circumstances, especially when a behavioral health worker is unavailable to respond to those incidences. And I just have a couple more things I want to say to that, and then maybe we can talk a little bit more about training. The 40-hour training is above the current eight-hour minimum that's offered, but the annual eight-hour requirement will only enhance and reinforce the immersive experience for years to come. So that my request would be... I would like to see that we direct the police chief to come back to us in October, again, during budget season or budget discussion, with a plan for getting all officers trained in post-certified 40-hour CIT and de-escalation training. I would ask that this included a plan to train any incoming officer in this model prior to them starting work with their department. I'm interested in a model that's sustainable and feasible for us to make sure that people continue that training. And I welcome a model that's local, but also inclusive of the police. So I would like to see that this would be a model that's sustainable, but also inclusive of outside voices and trainers. I want to see it happen. I want to see the numbers that will make it happen, and I want to see it instituted with a time-certain mark on it so that we can show that we're making progress toward that goal and that we've got time to meet it. My meeting with the chief and the deputy chief and the training manager was truly informative. I was really glad to sit down and connect about the issues, really hoping that we can kind of work together to find solutions. I think that's a model that strengthens that training requirement and moves us forward. And I felt heartened to know that there was a willingness on the part of staff to help bring that to fruition. So I'm seeking council support and directing staff to bring a plan back to us during budget discussions in October. So is that a motion? Yeah. Second. So I have a couple of questions that would probably be for the chief. Okay. So I have a question for you. And you might be able to answer some of them, too. Sure. So if I understood what Ms. Brown just said, you want to go from the eight hours of required training to 40? To make sure everyone gets trained in that initially, and then the eight hours would be building upon that, which is the required. So how many hours does your average officer get now? It depends on the topic. Yeah. So we're talking about implicit bias training, racial profiling, crisis intervention, de-escalation. These are all individual topics involved around one broader spectrum. So one of the things we were trying to show Vice Mayor Brown is the difference between our common terms and what POST uses. And so what we will do is we will break that down in October to get specific with the POST terminology to show you how many hours. So right now, outside the eight hours, there is no POST requirement past that. We're far surpassed that. And just to educate a little bit, commission on POST is one of the highest standards in police training and authority in the world. And not saying that we don't have things we need to look at, but I want to establish that and tell you. And I think that's what we're trying to do. You're going to find that we're well beyond that. We take our training very prideful at Chico PD. And 23 years ago, that's the one reason why I came here and lateral to this organization was the training and the equipment that was provided to me. So we've kept that culture in the organization. I think if you talk to any police officer, they would say the same thing I, whether they got hired six months ago or 20 something years ago. So again, we're going to be above that. 40 hours. There are certain requirements for that that are required. And right now that is really our training officers. They have to have that POST. It's only four training officers and all of our training officers have been through that course. The 40 hours? The 40 hours. And there's four of them? Four training officers have been through that in total? There's more than that. Okay. There's more than that. Four have been through it, but there's more training officers than have been through it. Is that what I'm understanding? Right. And I can get you that data, but it just seems to me... So the chief, the reason I'm asking the question is not necessarily for all the detail, but to understand, are we going, how many hours of training, I'm not opposed to training in any way, shape or form, how many hours of training are we going to have to add to the police department and the budget? Is it feasible to take whatever the number is, 85, 90 officers and get them all 40 hours of intervention training and all these different things in a town this size or the police department this size? That's my first question. What kind of budget adjustments that's going to be? And I know you don't have the number here, and that might be one of the things that we hear in October. That would be number one. And then number two, I'm not necessarily opposed to a report and hearing about it. I know your officers and I know your training and I feel good about it, but also at what point... I can take a... This is a horrible example. I'll make it anyway. I can take a 16-year-old driver and say they have to wait 20 minutes to get to the police They have to wait until they're 30 to be able to drive a car and take all this training and some of it's just going to be more than the average person can afford. So where is the happy medium? It sounds like you think, you believe we're certainly better trained than the minimum post requirement, which I'm happy about. And so what I'm looking for is... And I think actually that's what the vice mayor is asking for. What's the gap analysis between that and... And why did you pick 40? Just out of curiosity. That's the kind of evidence-informed immersion. Okay. I mean, most... We talked about a lot of other different types of courses that... Or courses, I guess is what you'd call it, training that specialties go through and a lot of it's 40 hours and it's just that immersion piece. That's helpful. Thank you. So that's more of a statement than anything because I know you can't come up with a number, but if it... October. No, I know. We'll have maybe by October. But we've also had members of the public come in and say, you know, your police officer should be social workers, they should be firefighters, they should be psychiatrists, they should be... All of that stuff. All these things. And we also hear that the police officers, I don't believe this, that the police officers are already overpaid. And if we were to get them all those different credentials would be at like $600,000 a cop. So I know there's a trade-off somewhere. So in that report, we have to see what that is. Yeah, absolutely. Because not just the training, you have to look at it full circle. So if I take an officer and send them to Sacramento for a week, essentially, and they're not going to be able to do this training, I have to hire another officer on overtime to backfill that officer. And so there's consequences to that type. I think what we really need to look at here is one of the things I feel strongly about is reality-based training. So rather than sitting in a room somewhere watching a PowerPoint, what we've done is taken a proactive stance on some of these issues. We're training it. We have certified instructor, post instructors. And racial rights. We have profiling in CIT. And what we're now doing is we're implementing these concepts in training and we're getting it right into our day-to-day operations. And so whether we are doing arrest and control techniques on the mat or whether we're out doing firearms proficiency on the range, we're actually incorporating these concepts into reality-based training. And that's where... Yeah. I can tell you that that's where officers are going to retain this information. And that's... I mean, they're pros at it. They do it all day, every day. And we've been doing it in this industry for a long time. So I can get you those numbers. I think we need to look at how do we accomplish what you're asking for over a period of time and how that looks. There are some options there. And I should bring... I'm going to try to bring some options back. One option that we discussed, I discussed with the vice mayor is I have certified instructors. I have a cadre of them. Can I create a training and get it post-certified? That's an option. And I don't know what the rules are now with all of this reform. What I envision is you're going to see state and federal reform that's probably going to address some of these issues. Maybe not directly for us because we're so far above. But it might answer some of the questions as well. And you might see funding and some different things that come along with this to reach your goals. So I think, you know, emotional decision-making right now, you know, this has been a turbulent time. A lot of emotions involved in it. But I think by October, I think we can really get into the weeds into what we're doing as a police department. We can do a presentation to council and really show you what we're doing to begin with. And then we can develop a plan moving forward. I really think that this ad hoc committee will allow us to look at what the existing training is, how your model compares to this specific Memphis model, and allow us to make a better decision when we come to looking at what training is needed. Yeah, and I agree with that, Mayor. That could be a disconnect. The only thing I would like to add, I just want to, you know, put it out there that, you know, since I've taken this role, it's a crazy time to step into that seat. But I've talked about transparency. I've talked about relationship building. So I'm excited about that. One thing I caution council a little bit is to just keep in mind that when we talk about police policies, it is a single most important thing. That comes out of the office of the police chief. That's really the reason you have a police chief. And that's why you have a police chief that needs the education, the training, and the long-term experience to provide policies that's good for your police officers, your employees, protects your community, and protects you from unwanted liability. And so I have no problem sitting in a room. I'm engaging. I've always been that way. But. We'll have experts in that room as well that I really want to be able to understand their perspective, right, when it comes to actually doing police work. Because not everybody can do it. But I think the end you're going to find out is Chico BD, we hire the best. And just to add real quick to that, and I commented to the vice mayor, one of the things I was upset most about some of this national conversation was it lacked probably, I thought, where a lot of these issues begin with. And where they begin with is the type of people that you hire and put in this position. And so. We're talking about huge municipalities, thousands and thousands of police officers, you know, and I can't speak to what their standards are, but I can speak to Chico PD. And so what I would enjoy in this conversation, Mayor, is let's start this conversation and somewhere in this. Committee. I want to show you what we do because our standards are so incredibly high. And I look forward to educating council of the public on on where we stand as far as the type of people we allow into this this profession. Chief Madden, if you don't mind me asking while you're up on the on the lectern, part of my proposal has to do with the police community advisory board. I don't. We talked a little bit about this. I don't know if you have any comments about kind of transforming or adapting that to better meet the needs of the community or if it's too soon. And October would be better to to get deeper into that. But I wanted to give you the opportunity if you if you wanted. Sure. Thank you. I appreciate that. And I appreciate Council Member Stone's comments last meeting who sat on this board. Council Member Morgan. I've really gone back and thought about it. I've really done some research. Internally figuring out where this started. It looked like it started originally with Chief Dunbar really carried forward with Chief Mike Maloney. And I've watched the progression of it. Clearly, clearly that board was impacted by some significant events. We know that their last public meeting was September of 2018. And two months later, we know what happened. So I don't want to discredit that board. I don't want to discredit the current board members. I think it was just a situation that was out of the control and the chief's focus was was taken elsewhere. So with that said, really, to be honest with you, I, you know, I, I felt strongly before all this happened is that I accepted the interim role to just kind of hold down the fort until, you know, a permanent chief could be selected. But there's so much moving right now. And I feel like it is my job to stay out in front, stay engaged and look at these things. So. With that said, I'm going to be reaching out to the current board members. I'm going to have a meeting with them. One of the issues with that is I want to recognize their efforts and participation. I want to have conversations with that board as to the pros and cons and get some information there. And then I'm going to work with city manager to get some of his vision. But I really believe that board. Was designed. To have community members. In the community that had the finger on the pulse of their areas. To sit in a room and build a strong relationship with their police chief. Where they felt comfortable coming and bringing issues to that chief. Having those. Those conversations. And the chief. Allowing to address those and in turn educate those folks back. So. To me. We should be thinking. About vulnerable populations. That representation to make sure that we're building upon trust in the relationships. That are going on out there. Our faith communities. All the different civic leaders that we have out there in the city. Those are a perfect venue. To build a relationship with their police chief. Because the police chief sets the tone and sets the mission of the police department. And so what a better way to have impact on that. Provide perspective. And allow that to occur for your police chief. So. That's my vision of it. I really. You know I've looked in and I wanted to get back to where I think the original intent was for that. For it to be successful. Would that include some sort of. I don't know like annual report that. You know the council could review. Right. That kind of stuff recommendations. I don't know. Yeah. So I really think it. It boils down to getting this group together. Kind of reestablish it. Coming up with a mission statement. Have a clear objective. Have meetings and agendas. And at the end of the year do a end of the year report. To the community. As to. You know what that. The successes and what the board did. Absolutely. Thank you. I appreciate you letting me ask these questions. Sure. That's all I had. Okay. Yeah. Motion and a second on the floor. As far as hearing back about that training. And those issues in October. Can I get a clarification on the motion? Yeah. Is it just. Is the motion just to have the information brought back. On what it would cost to bring forward. Because in here it's written a plan. For getting all officers trained in evidence based training. I don't think we can make the plan until we have the information. So I'm all about getting the information reported back. So then we can figure out how to move forward. Yeah. But to say that we're going to make a plan to do something. Without having all the other. Information that we're probably going to get at the other meeting. I'm not. I don't want to tell the police chief what training they need. He may say we need 50 hours. I don't know. And it may be 40 hours of this and 10 hours of this. I don't know what he's going to come back with. But I'm all on forgetting the information. But I don't want to commit to saying that we're going to do this in two years. Until we have the information back. Yeah. The police chief said that he. His vision is the idea of a post certified. Kind of. Internal. Blend of. Of potential trainings. And I'm interested in that model. I'm interested in. What the budget is. And I think we need that information before we're going to be able to make decisions on moving forward. But I'm leaving it up to staff to kind of identify that plan. Because they do know their organizations in that process better than we do. I'm just saying this is the priority. How do we meet that goal? And of course your input is welcome. Perfect. That's what I want to know. Thank you. Okay. We do have comments on this item. How many people do we have that have. We received 47 comments on this item. And how many emails did we receive? One email. Let's take five minutes to review these comments. And I think it's a good idea to remind the public that we've had all night to read. If it seems like we only have five minutes. Yes. Yes. I will reiterate that. That we have had these comments available to us all day and all evening. So we will take five minutes. I'll check in to see if perhaps we finished before that. Can you please read the names please? We received comments from Robin Engle. Kelly Mokely. Rhiannon Stevens. Patricia Wang. Emily Smith. Jessica Schubert. David Gatton.! Nick Rose. Juan Serrana. Jeremy Markley. Mercedes Macias. Juanita Sumner. Alexander Smith. Virginia Alvis Griffin. Steven Breedlove. Jamie Damon. Chaz Kelly. Lincoln Bone. Sianna Sinocqui. Addison Winslow. Herbert West. Sonia. Sonia Antoine. Lisa Salzman. Jules Brown. Susan Smead. Brian Bolin. Bart Penick. Margaret Hicks. Stephanie Barrett. Deborah Jones. Ashley Jones. Natasha See. Lanita Fedorchuk. And Rob Berry. Witness! Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Council had enough time to review? Yes. So there's a motion on the table that's been seconded. Any further comments? Just on the overall topic, I want to, uh, appreciate the chief's comments about who we bring on and the importance of that. Um, I assume that we're still with Butte college with the Academy. It's been four years since I've been paying attention. And that training needs to be looked at by the committee to an interaction with Butte college to see what they're offering. My daughter went through the Academy. So I, without commenting on the scope of the training, I think that interaction would be very important so that we make sure that new, new, new officers are coming in with the best skills possible. Good suggestion. Okay. Have a vote, please. Council member Huber. Yes. Council member Morgan. No. Council member Ory. Aye. Council member Reynolds. Aye. Council member Stone. Aye. Vice Mayor Brown. Aye. Council member Brown. Aye. Mayor Schwab. Aye. Carry six one. I know that, uh, that was a vote on a part of this proposal. Is it okay if I continue a little bit? Please. I just want to expand. I appreciate Chief Madden's, um, kind of overview of the police community advisory board. Obviously a part of my proposal is looking at making this model more aligned with community needs and diverse perspectives. Um, and, and I get the sense kind of across the board that, uh, there are adjustments needed for this group to perform to, to, uh, operate optimally in terms of how members are selective and what kind of dialogue does or doesn't take place. Um, and that there's greater transparency and mutuality among membership and the community and the, and the police department. So I appreciate the, um, the priority given there. Um, but I wanted to leave it open for further discussion by the council, as I know that this is an issue other people have brought up, um, to, to discuss the, that particular part of the proposal. Okay. Um, we will post that as we post that as we post that as we post that as we post that as we post that as we post that as we post that as we post post that as we post post that as we post post that as we post post that as we post post that as we post post that as we post post that as we post post that as we post post that as we post need to have further discussion after the committee meets to make to make any determination of that which committee the ad hoc committee the last item on my request if there's other comments about this the last item on my request is really just like all staff training related to implicit bias is aligned with our diversity action plan just another thing that I would like to see come forward is for staff to bring a plan to implement I know that this has already been offered this year so I know that we're making progress toward getting staff training implicit bias but looking at getting all staff trained in a minimum amount of full implicit bias training with refresher training included identifying a vendor making it a requirement implementing it citywide it's kind of an effort for our public facing staff to to continue to build on that knowledge for the diversity action plan so that's you the last part I think that might be a good discussion to have in October with our budget training I know that miss cannon has been working closely with the University to offer some training but I do think previously we talked about the budget of what are the council priorities how what are the goals that we set through our our various budget plans so I think that's something that we'd like to talk about. plans, how are each department going to meet those and what kind of funding do they have determined. I know that there's been a very close relationship with Chico State where they've offered to provide those trainings. So I think just saying let's have that discussion in October as this is one of the goals, I would be supportive of that. Yeah, I'm not asking for it to happen now and I think budget time is an appropriate time to dive in. But I just want to prepare staff to be able to present that to us and have that conversation. That was also my basis for the earlier comment was I want to signal to staff that these are the things that I would like to see coming forward. That's not a vote or even a direction at this point, but we will begin to machinate these issues and by the time it comes to budget session, with real numbers behind that, I would like staff to have those answers because that is something that I'm from a community review board as well as this aspect. I would like to see that staff moving in that direction. Without so much specifics to say yay or nay, we need to address that now. Direction provided as I feel appropriate. Do we need to take a vote on it? I think we need to take a vote. All right. Well, that concludes that. Obviously, the use of force policies as a high priority for me. I do appreciate the council supporting me participating in this committee. It's something I've been studying a lot and definitely want to learn kind of all aspects of it and see how we can move forward. So I appreciate that. Yeah. Council rules say that we cannot continue any additional items. I did get direction from the city attorney that there was one item of closed session that was very time sensitive. So if council would agree to go into closed session. Speaking of that point of order, if I may, our charter says that our council meetings start at 6 o'clock and yet again we had this discussion earlier. Our regular meetings are at 6 o'clock. There was discussion previous that the special meetings could start at 5.30. I understand from an email from Vice Mayor Brown that she is not available at 5.30. I did not realize that that to be the case. I didn't say not available. I said the transition from my work day to the meeting is narrowed sufficiently with that half hour. And I was concerned at the last meeting or the meeting before that that we continue to change and balance the public around with what time we start our meetings. Now I'm self-employed like Vice Mayor Brown. And so it doesn't immediately, impact me quite the same way as it would other council members. But I do feel it's important to make sure that we're adhering to process. Especially with regard to maintaining consistency with the public and also not challenging your colleagues to dance around when they, I mean, we're in COVID time so I'm at home. This doesn't impact me but I do feel an obligation that I should be defending precisely what our rules are. If we start a meeting at 6 we're supposed to meet at 6 and this will remain in consistency. There was some misunderstanding and we can certainly take that into account as we're scheduling meetings. I want every council member to be able to be here on time. Since we only have one item left, can I make a motion that would allow us to consider that one final item? Thank you. I just, my understanding is we couldn't do that. And I would, I would say they are more than we can do. We've been extending, we've extended meetings. A dozen times. Right, but not since the new APMPs came through. That's the only issue. I would totally, I would absolutely support that. I'd be happy to. So the motion would be to suspend the rules. There's a motion to suspend the rules. Is there a second? Yes, second. Okay. Hold on.! Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Witness Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 5-2. The last item is a request from Council Member Huber. Thank you. With a friendly amendment from Council Member Morgan. Yeah, thank you. This should be short and sweet. And what I'm asking for should also be short and sweet, which is a presentation by the Concerned Citizens for Justice. Really, I believe it will set the stage for the other conversations and the ad hoc committee by sort of laying out the vision that this group that really cooperates very nicely with Chico PD, they both complement each other as far as how they interact. And all I'm asking for is 10 minutes for them to do a presentation on the issue. And a presentation on the items that they feel are the most important components of what needs to happen moving forward with creating a better relationship between the community and the police. And I would ask that it be set no earlier than mid-July. And there was also, Council Member Morgan, I believe I seconded Mr. Huber's motion and then offered if we are going to hear from that side that we have the Police Officers Resource Association, Research Association of California do the same. PORAC represents 77,000 public safety officers that have a duty to provide Californians with the safety and security they need to feel protected in their houses and homes and in their homes. And they do that in the streets. That's their stated duty. They do research on the use of force. They have called for a national use of force standard. And they advocate at the state and federal level for protections for both police officers and citizens. So a very good board to do that. I think we're going to hear from one, hear from the both. I actually think they're going to have to say a lot of the same things. I don't think having them at the same time is probably a wonderful idea. But as long as one follows the other, I think it would be fine. And the other thing I would ask Mr. Huber is 10 minutes isn't a lot of time. I don't think we need to give each group half an hour. But I mean normally presentations are supposed to be limited to 15. Just another five. Sure. Are there any questions? How many comments do we have on this item? We have nine. Nine? Okay. Let's take a minute to review the comments. Comments were received from Robin Engle, Nicole Nava. Let me make sure that that's the right one. Yes. Nathaniel Perry, Julie Threat, Bryce Koren, Rain Sher, Juanita Sumner, Jules Brown, Steven Breedlove. Any questions? Has counsel had an opportunity to review the comments? And is there a motion? Move to approve. Please. To hear presentations from both. Okay. And that's the motion. All right. Then let's have a vote. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Orry. Aye. Council Member Reynolds. Aye. Council Member Stone. Aye. Vice Mayor Brown. Aye. Mayor Schwab. Aye. Carries 7-0. It's grasping at straws, but I think it's given the importance of it. If any council member has a change of heart, please let me know. I think that a special council meeting in a very short period of time would still allow us to put something on the ballot. I don't expect it to happen, but if community members, business leaders that are listening out there that are concerned about the solvency of the city, you know, I would be open to meeting at any time. For clarification, such meeting would need to happen at least five days prior to the July 7th council meeting. Okay. We will adjourn to our closed session.
