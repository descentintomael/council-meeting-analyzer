 Good evening. We'll call to order the adjourned regular Chico City Council meeting of September 15, 2020. I'll start with the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. Please stand and join with me. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Madam Clerk, can we start with the roll call, please? Council Member Huber? Here. Council Member Morgan? Here. Council Member Ory? Here. Council Member Reynolds? Here. Council Member Stone? Here. Vice Mayor Brown? And Mayor Schwab? Here. I'd like you all to join me in a moment of silence as we pay respects to the lives that were lost and the families that have been displaced by the North Complex West Zone fire. Thank you. Thank you. We were to have an introduction of the Buchanan Health Officer, Dr. Robert Bernstein, but I understand he is not here today? Correct, Mayor. It doesn't look like he's able to make it this evening, so we'll try back another time. As you know, they're very busy at the county right now, dealing not only with COVID but the fire, so thank you. So, public participation. This meeting is being conducted in accordance with executive order N-2920. Attendance at the meeting. The public may attend the meeting in person at 421 Main Street. Speakers must sign up to speak by checking in at one of the speaker card tables located on the east side of Indiana. The public will be given instructions to queue up in the city parking lot. All speakers will be given instructions to queue up in the speaker line. Citizens will be able to maintain social distancing requirements while waiting inside the municipal center on the first floor. Remote public participation during the meeting. The public may view the meeting on CAMCAS Channel 11 or through the Granicus platform found on the city's website, dash view meetings online. The Engaged Chico Civic Engagement Program. Was available for citizen input on individual agenda items prior to the meeting. And that program can be accessed through the city's website at the link listed at the city website under Granicus. Engaged comments were closed at 430. However, if we've missed that time frame during the meeting, public comment will be accepted by email and can be sent to publiccomments at chicoca.gov. That's P-U-B-L-I-C-O. C-O-M-M-E-N-T-S at chicoca.gov during the meeting prior to the close of public comment on an item. The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email. Consent agenda. The consent agenda is for things. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were introducing the consent agenda. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Okay. I am. Yeah. Consent agenda. It's for things that are routine in nature and therefore can be enacted in one motion. Are there any council disqualifications or no votes on the consent agenda? Before we get into that, if there's a change in the agenda, I would assume you would want to make that in the beginning now. I can. And so my question is, I would like item 5.1 to only include those items that are agendized. Do you want us to consider that now or when we get to 5.1? I think since it might be, it's a change in agenda, it would be appropriate to hear it now. I wanted to just give a little back story to that item, if I may. Item 5.1 is an overview of the needle exchange program. This contains at least one item that was supposed to come to us right before, right after. We closed the public meeting and just went to emergency items only back in the end of March. And at that time, Mr. Berry asked me if he could make a special presentation to the council when we were going to also get a presentation by the North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition. And I had agreed to that at that point. The agenda went out. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And I would include Mr. Berry's request. He reminded me of the offer that I had extended at that time. And knowing that the mayor can't allow special presentations under the APNP, which is found in item C.8, I asked, I conferred with the city attorney on his opinion. And after that discussion, I decided to go ahead and add that to the agenda. However, if council would like to override that decision or vote on that, I am perfectly fine with that discussion and decision coming forward. So, Mr. Ory. I'm sorry. Is there an amended agenda? You said you added something to the agenda. I added the speaker. There's no, that's not listed on the agenda. Can I have some? Yes. It's consultation with the city attorney or the city clerk regarding this. Well, I'll defer to the city attorney. However, I recall this conversation happening and whether or not to add Mr. Berry back into the agenda after the agenda had already been posted. I believe that you had a conversation with the city attorney. And the, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I understand that he indicated that it didn't need to be amended in order for Mr. Berry to be allowed to speak on that because of the situation prior of inviting him to speak. Did you say did not need to be? I couldn't hear. That is correct. But I understand if Mr. Jarrett could speak to it, that would be great. Yes. Everything that the mayor said is my understanding as well. And as to item 5.1, the A presentation by North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition, that was not amended to include any other speaker. But the history to that going back several months was that Mr. Berry was going to be speaking as to that same item. It was my opinion that no amendment to the agenda needed to take place in order to facilitate that discussion. I feel confused. Council requested and voted on having North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition to present. We did not request or vote on any additional presentations. And my item was also explicitly a separate item from North Valley Harm Reduction Center. I've been clear about that for years now. Yeah. If it's not out of order, I'd like to make a motion that we limit Mr. Berry's input this evening to the three minutes that everybody else gets and take you up on your offer to overrule your decision to have him speak on an extended basis. Second. So there is a motion and a second. Let's take a roll call with that. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. So, Mr. Berry, we will have you speak three minutes when we come to item 5.1. So in the meantime, if you could wait outside. Will we all be going outside? All people should be outside at this point. And then you may come. I'm sorry? You should stay inside, Sean. And then the members from the North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition, if you could come to our, join us when we hear 5.1. Okay. All right, so back to the consent agenda. Are there any council disqualifications or no votes? I would like to poll 2.4. Are there any speakers who provided emails or are here in person? Yes. On consent, we received 14 comments via the CHCO, Engage CHCO component. We did not have any additional emails in the public comments account. And then I believe we have one speaker scheduled for the next meeting. So I would like to speak in person on this item. All right. Well, let's take a couple of minutes to review the comments from the Engage CHCO platform while you read those names and queue up the speakers. Okay. And the speaker is Corey. There is no last name. So if Corey can come into the building, ready to speak. Well, we have that moment. I'd like to thank staff for coming. Thank you for permitting the first floor of City Hall to be used for the queue with the speakers. We haven't been doing that as of late until this evening tonight. And so given the smoky conditions outside, I'm appreciative to staff. Thank you. Thank you. Debbie, I didn't receive a copy of the Engage CHCO hard copy of the notes. Okay. Okay. I'll leave that to the mover. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Madam Clerk, can you read the names of the individuals who sent us? Absolutely. So we received 14 comments. Jessica Haggard. Susan Smead. Deborah Bird. Nicole Nava. Claudette Ritter. Deborah Jones. Gary Vitell. Larry Coleman. Ashley Jones. Jules Brown. Jackie Smith. Jessica Giannola. Rob Berry. And Jeff Young. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... All right. All right. As counsel had an opportunity to review the comments, I would like to ask you to read the comments. All right. As counsel had an opportunity to review the comments, I would like to ask you to read the comments, I would like to ask you to read the comments, I would like to ask you to read the comments, I would like to ask you to read the comments, Sacramento or Reading or another county to buy what they want or need. And it's really just cutting out a potential source of revenue for the city. That's all I want to say. Thank you very much. Thank you. So is there any discussion of consent? Or I'll entertain a motion with the notation. There are three ordinances that the title of should be read. I'm sorry. Yes, with the exception of 2.4. An ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending certain sections of Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code regarding accessory dwelling unit regulations for consistency with state housing laws. And I think you've also met an ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 10.52 of the Chico Municipal Code relating to abandoned vehicle abatement and amending, adding or repealing provisions in Title 10.52 of the Chico Municipal Code, for the administration enforcement by the City's Code Enforcement Division. I'll second that if that was the case. How about the ordinance relating to 2.1 as well? Oh, geez, yeah. There's two there. Yeah, there are. Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 5, creating Chapter 5.42, Commercial Cannabis Businesses of the Chico Municipal Code to regulate commercial cannabis uses within the City of Chico. And ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 19 of the Chico Municipal Code, Chapters 19.75, Cannabis Regulations 19.44, Commercial Office Zones 19.45, and 19.46, Manufactural Industrial Zones 19.48, Airport Zones, and 19.80070, T&D allowable land uses to allow commercial cannabis uses within the City of Chico. But that was a motion by Council Member Huber and a second by Council Member Stone. Correct. Do we have the vote, please? Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Huber? Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 7-0. And we will consider the item that was removed from the consent agenda, Item 2.4, Consideration for Approval of Supplemental Appropriation Budget Modification Number 2020 ASD-008. Council Member Ori? Thank you. My interest is in the $1.2 million, more or less, of the CARES funding. I would like a larger discussion of our discussion on how to use those funds. But what I really would like to see is for it to be delayed until after our discussion next week regarding our response to homeless solutions. I would like us not to close off the options of how we would spend that money until after we've had that meeting. So I'm really asking this to be tabled. Mr. Oren? Sure. Honorable Mayor, members of the Council, Council Member Ori, staff would love that opportunity to be able to delay that. Unfortunately, the CARES Act had a very constrained time frame, and those have already been submitted. The CARES Act funding had a very limited span of time where you could submit and get your actual plan in, and all the costs that the city incurred actually pretty much, actually, pretty much, had a very limited span of time where you could submit and get your actual plan in, and all the costs that the city incurred actually pretty much, not only the cost of the city, but also the cost of the city itself. So I think that the budget took up all of that money. It was $1.36 or $1.38 million, so thereabouts, almost $1.4 million. So unfortunately, as prudent as that may be to hold off and wait until after the budget and look at things at a greater scope, the immediacy of needing to get that in is why it's already on and move forward. So, yeah. I didn't ask for it to be delayed until the budget's approved. I asked for it to be delayed one week. Yeah. And if I'm hearing you correctly. Yeah. So we've already submitted. I believe the submission date was September 1st. Yeah. And so if we delay it a week, nothing changes. So since it doesn't change anything, I will move to table the use of the CARES fund for one week so that we have that discussion with all of our, whatever discrepancy, and it sounds like we don't have much. I could go into a larger discussion of, I believe, an earlier conversation where we were talking about a different use of those funds. Yeah. The city staff took a vast look at what those funds could be used for. We went through so many iterations of how do you best utilize those funds to include, obviously, the homeless solutions and a lot of other items. And then once we came to the point of realizing that all these calls and all the calls for service and everything else. That we were doing already in relation to COVID-19 would consume the vast majority of those dollars, there wasn't much left to really debate over. And so, you know, if council desires to delay approving this item, take this item out of the supplemental, then that's council's, you know, purview. And I understand where your logic lies there. But staff will do whatever is necessary at this point in time. Because it's already been submitted, I don't know if it would be a futile action of delaying. But. Right now, that's where staff is at on it. Well, to that end, what are the impacts? Are there any impacts to delaying this? To delaying the supplemental by a week? No. It's just that the plan's already been submitted to the federal government, state government, et cetera. And so there's really not a lot of manipulation, as far as I know, that you can make to the funding recommendation. So the supplemental basically is just falling in line with. That's the only reason why I would suggest that there's not a lot of flexibility in how to modify it. And it was on consent. So I just I think I can appreciate Council Member Ori's desire not to rediscuss this exact same item tonight and get some more clarity on it. But it is on consent. I'm inclined to to support Mr. Ori's motion if there aren't impacts. If there are no impacts. Well, I talked twice about it. I don't I don't know if Mr. Ori has specific questions about this, but. I've had three minutes to absorb the fact that what I was told. I believe what I was told, how those monies could be used. That staff made a decision that that wasn't feasible and instead submitted a proposal in front of us. I may well agree next week that this is fine and dandy and we have no discretion. I would hate to have to vote on something with three minutes of. Consideration. And when I've been told I have no discretion. So I think. It would be prudent. It would excuse me. It would be prudent just to wait one week in order to for me to confirm our lack of discretion and then have a conversation with us next week. How we may or may not want to spend those funds. Mr. Arm and Ms. Martin. Yes. Fortunately, Ms. Martin is here. I was I was trying to track him down. Here she is. So maybe she can bring some further clarity. Yeah. I just wanted to let you all know that the amounts that are in this supplemental are what we. How are looking to recognize as revenue for the cares act through our June expenditures. So it's stuff that's already happened through June. We did have some kind of projection in the reports that we sent to the state as to from July. Onward as to what we will be using those funds for and really what this supplemental shows is the revenue piece that we are expecting to put into. The general fund because of the cares act funding and then there are some small amounts that are being transferred out to other funds because we had our facilities maintenance group sent a bunch of money on supplies and things like that. So we're reimbursing our internal service funds and things like that. But aside from that, there's not a lot of listed expenditures. It's just really showing what the revenue is in the general fund. It's not specifying specific. Items that we're spending the money on on. Okay. So it's just really to make it so that we can facilitate moving forward with our caffer because we've got auditors coming in and we're trying to clean up all the budget items for that. Mr. So would it help because I want to make sure we answer council member or his question the submission of the cares act funding and actually utilization of those funds. That's. Not necessarily what this supplemental is reflecting. Correct. To answer his question though on the use of those funds. When or where or how can he further discuss should council desire that aspect of it. And that's a good question. I mean the we were under kind of a very short timeline with reporting to the state. We had to submit that information. And it was, it wasn't so strict that we had to tell them this is exactly what we use this money for. This is what we're going to use this money for. But we had to give them a kind of overall picture of what we expect, because they're going to utilize that information to go forward to the federal side of things and say, look, all these people spent so much more than what they actually. Got so it's, it's a utilization for them to kind of report where the money is being used at this or the other level. So. It's not binding us to a specific purpose at this point, but we did have to report and say, this is our best guess. This is how we use these funds so far. I got it. I would ask for the courtesy of a week delay. And so I would. And thank you for the second. Sure. Any other questions? We had a motion and a second. Let me get back there. Okay. And it was council member stone who seconded it. Okay. Yeah. And for the record, I'm not sure I'm not opposed to this action either, but along with the council member or just if there's a week that doesn't impact us and council member would like that information, especially when it's not on the finance committee. I think it's appropriate. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Council member Huber. No. Council member Morgan. No. Council member Horry. Aye. Okay. Council member Reynolds. No. Council member Stone. Aye. Vice mayor Brown. Aye. Mayor Schwab. Aye. It carries four to three. Thank you for the courtesy. Thanks for including me. Thank you. Thank you. Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Yes, we received 22 comments in Engage Chico. We did not receive any comments through our public comments email account. And I believe we have 10, possibly more, individuals in person who wish to speak. 10, possibly more? Well, she had a card here and I hadn't gotten a chance to look at it. All right, so 10, 11. All right. All right. So as we review the comments that were provided to us, and as you read the names of those individuals, we will have the speakers queue up and they can each have three minutes. Mayor Schwab, a point of clarification. I think there was a business from the floor comment from Ciceri Sherry at 336 today. It does say business from the floor, BFTF. Oh, and that, I apologize, that went into your regular email account. That didn't come through the public comments after the meeting started. That's the difference there. That did get distributed to the full council before the meeting started. Thanks for the clarification. Okay. And I will read the names of the people. Let me just add. Okay, so the 22 comments that were received in Engage were from Jessica Haggard, Diane Larkin, Margaret Hicks, Julie Threat, Andy Keller, Marcy Pittman, Nicole Nava, Taylor Skinner, Claudette Ritter, Rob Berry, Carolyn I, Paula Hare, Susan Smead, Kimberly Burke, Michelle Hale, Robin Engel, Karen Wilhoit, Caroline Arpey, Ashley Jones, Larry Coleman, Jackie Smith, and Kim Dietz. Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Will the coaches be there? Thank you. Thank you. Has counsel had enough time to read the comments? Okay. So we will hear from members of the public that are here. Ms. Ingle? Okay. I do want to just announce that the cards came in and they aren't in the same order that they may be standing outside. So it may take a second for them to reorganize the line. Oh. But Robin Ingle, followed by Rhonda Magnuson, followed by Paula Hare, followed by Corey, and then Nicole Nava. So Robin Ingle. And will that be three minutes each? Three minutes. Okay. Thank you. Good evening, counsel. Hello. From a human services. Professional perspective. What we're dealing with in our community is learned helplessness. Learned helplessness is a sense of extreme powerlessness in the face of tragedy. And as we know, we've had one tragedy after another tragedy after another tragedy in just a few years. And I feel the need to speak on behalf of all of the people, which is. And a vast majority of the population. That isn't here. And they're not here because they're dealing with more pressing issues like trying to secure housing or trying to get water or their own traumas, cancer, miscarriages, divorces, whatever have you. I want to bring to light the fact that, again, this is most of the community. You're only hearing from those of us who have the strength and fortunate circumstances to be here tonight. Okay. The resources to be here tonight. You're only hearing from us. You're not hearing from the single parents who have to be home. From those who are working extra long hours. From the emergency services workers or any of those people. Please keep the rest of the population in mind. The entire population in mind. Especially those who are hurt most by the recent fires, which took some people's second home from them. And those who are marginalized. But that's how we have been consistently, regardless of the circumstances. I want to suggest again that, as I have in weeks prior and as you and I have agreed, and we're better together. Divisiveness only hurts us as a community. And so I think it's important to incentivize and reinforce those of us who have solutions and come with solutions versus those who divide by giving them time to work. for example, to present on something that they are not aware of, they don't have expertise in. I do have a lot of social work and clinical social work knowledge that I'm happy to offer. I would, for free and at any point, about addressing people who are marginalized. I've been working with that population for 21 years as a licensed clinician. In terms of housing, I believe we need to give CHAP the go-ahead to do the housing that they're ready to create. We need affordable housing. We need to consider inclusionary zoning. We need to work with tourists because there's no reason that there should be 50 open beds there in the light of all of these traumas. I did reach out to them, by the way, because I like to take action and not just complain. I didn't hear back, so I'm hoping something can happen in that route. Thank you. So Rhonda, Magnuson, followed by Paula here, followed by Corey, Nicole Nava, Patrick Newman, and Angela McLaughlin. I want to thank you all for your time. I think some of you know me. I'm a homeless person out here. Ms. Magnuson, can you step up so that we can hear you? Okay, thank you. I've been out here for two and a half years, going on three now. I am clean. I am sober. I have been for 30 years. So why am I out here? I would like to tell you the reason why that I am out here is because of the services. Because of a woman that arrived here from a different place that had a little bit of intelligence, a little bit educated, witnessed some horrific, horrific things happening. And it wasn't because of the homeless people. It was because of Michael at the Jesus Center running around, tapping people on the back, denying them things. It was me taking a woman in a wheelchair to a shelter. for a whole week solid and then to a hospital to get her help. She was removed and then I was told that she couldn't be there because she caused a problem three years prior. I took her to in-law. She was rolled out as fast as I rolled her in. I then went from lugging food to covering people to so on and so forth. And as I'm doing this, I have the police, I have the Jesus Center calling people, doing things. Next thing I know, I am on a street. I am suffering. I am hardcore street, mind you. I am denied all services. So tell me, why is a woman that does not do drugs or alcohol and that is educated and stood up for the rights of others and the rights of herself, why is she standing out here on the street being prosecuted for such? Which I am. I'm being jailed. I'm being denied any kind of humanity whatsoever. And now that this epidemic has happened, a lot has gone in. And if you go out there now and the ones are camping off wherever they are, they are not hurting nobody. And 75% of the homeless are your very own people, born and raised. I am not hurting anybody. I witnessed three girls come off a foster care system onto the street. I asked her why. Asked them why. Because their foster daddy hadn't left them alone since the day that they got there. And mom was awful pissed about it. Not a dad. So when you guys are sitting here and you are making your judgments and you are punishing and you are doing whatever it is, you try having some understanding. You come out here where I am. You ask me. You ask a young man named Ralph over there by Food Max right now. Thank you very much. I watch the witch hunt. Thank you for sharing. Yeah. I'm going to do a lot more. Thank you for your time. Paula here, followed by Corey, Nicole Nava, Patrick Newman, Angela McLaughlin. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead. Hi, my name is Paul here. When I was here before, I talked about the garbage. Some of the garbage there on the way to One Mile was picked up today for the first time in three months. But the stuff in the water at the same spot was left there. So there's carts of garbage in the water. So before One Mile. And at the pond, Crosswind Police Station, I've been putting it online for three months. And the garbage is so thick back in there, nobody will come and get it. I want to know when the council is going to come and pick that up. And my last question is, oh, it's not a question. I want to say something. Our treats is runoff from snow and ice. It's refrigerated. It's water. HIV and other diseases stays alive in that needle, in the blood. It doesn't dry up for 42 days in our creeks if that needle is thrown in the creek. That's another reason you need to stop all these programs and keep them stopped. If a drug addict wants needles, they can buy them online. They can go to the store and buy them. They don't need a doctor's slip. Why are we, the taxpayers, giving them to them to use, throw in the creek? It makes no sense. I know they're in the creek because I pull them out. All the people that do it, me. The other people aren't going in and doing it. And as far as all that garbage in the creek, if you guys want to get some people together with some ropes, I'm going to the creek and try to garbage up. And you can holler up. I don't have anything else to say other than that. I'd like to see some things cleaned up. I'd like to take pictures down at the animals down there at that pond. I haven't been able to do that because most of the animals aren't there anymore. Because the people went back in there and threw all the garbage everywhere. Yeah. It's just ridiculous and it stinks. Something needs to be done. We're killing our wildlife that we're supposed to be preserving. Please do something. I like taking those pictures of those birds because then I've got something to go home to and put on my TV and blow our way up and see what I got. That's the only fun thing I've got left in life. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker is Corey, followed by Nicole Nava, Patrick Newman, Angela McLaughlin, and Jessica Giannola. Hello again, Council. There's nothing I can say about the homelessness thing generally that's more eloquent than what Ms. Magnuson said a few minutes ago. Okay. But, you know. Sorry, I'm drawing a little bit of a blank here. You know, I had something else, but I'm totally blanked out. Take care. Nicole Nava, Patrick Newman, Angela McLaughlin, Jessica Giannola, and Jeff Creed. Thank you. She remembers it. Sorry. Good evening. As I've been up here before, I'm here to talk about some of the safety issues that are concerning to me and to others in our community. I want to first, though, remind you guys that you have a resolution that I've emailed a couple times and brought by hand, Prop 20, Reducing Crime and Keeping California Safe Act of 2020. It would be super. Super duper if you all could get on board with signing that one. It will help keep everybody safe. I know it's a state initiative, but it's important here, too. All right. So, on to other things. So, just today, a fire again in the vicinity of my home, just on the opposite side of the park, more near Ms. Mayer over there. And I know she gets concerned about some of that, too. This one was apparently going to race away. They had to call for... I don't know if you guys are aware of this, but we had a fire in the area and we had to call for quite the response. And that's what we're afraid of, folks. That is our reality. Not all of you live right there. And it's scary. It's hard to rest at night knowing that this is happening. And we just keep getting told we're going to deal with it at some point. We're going to deal. And I know the 22nd, we're supposed to have a presentation by our city manager and staff. And I'm really hopeful. We hear some short and long-term solutions that work. We had... So, in addition to the fire, we're having issues with break-ins and things like that. We're having issues with operations, invasions. I don't know if you've been by 12th and Mulberry to look at the area fondly named Devil's Triangle. But there is profuse amounts of trash. It isn't just like, oops, there's a little bit by someone's site. It is really, really bad. And I don't want to spend my day calling code enforcement and having to come down here all the time and talk to you. I'd much prefer to be back with my husband right now. And I really think that you need to come prepared on the 22nd to implement quickly measures that will protect us all. I don't think it's asking a lot. You guys have delivered the porta-potties. You've delivered the food. You've provided needles. You've provided all kinds of things. And it just never stops. There was an individual that came up to speak to us when we were at the Windshine Park just this weekend. He was unhoused. I went through every scenario to try to get him to services. And you know what he wanted? He wanted it brought to him. He wanted you to try it. He wanted you to charge his phone. Get his water there brought right to him. And he is not clean and sober. He has been ejected from facility after facility and won't go to the shelter. I said, what will it take for you to get the COVID test? So one idea is to bring the COVID test to them. Go take the test. Get them tested. If their phone is not charged and they can't make the appointment to get a test, what are we doing? Because the shelter is half empty is what I hear today. The tourist shelter, half empty. So you could be placed there. And we are placing people. So please do what you need to do and start acting to remove people from the parks and from the waterways and get us safe. Thank you. Patrick Newman, Angel McLaughlin, Jessica Giannola, Jeff Creed, Jeff Glatz. The demonization continues. Anyway. On the front page of today's paper, Mr. Berry is once again threatening to sue the city of Chico. He says our laws are not being enforced. The destitute have set up tents. Our swimming areas are threatened, though they are not, et cetera. And he has offered an ultimatum. He demands compliance from you, the council, or else. And so begins the historical lesson. In every time of crisis, a society can make a decision. And it can make a bully legitimate and often does, appointing him to boards and commissions and positions, on the way to anointing him the authoritarian expert hero savior. Because in times of crisis, the bully has solutions. In times of crisis, the bully speaks to that place in us that wants the neat and clean way out, a way towards safety and security. But I'm not so worried about the bully. He's always there. I'm worried about those who can stop the bully. I'm worried they're actually more fond of the bully than they care to admit, even to themselves. They're certainly fond of solutions. I'm worried that those who can stop the bully and stand up for the least powerful, those poorest of people who are scapegoated again and again will not stand up. And I'm worried about the bully. I'm worried they will not stand up because they don't have a personal enough, emotional enough investment with those who suffer the most. And they want to put the majority at ease, to comfort those who suffer the least. Democratic societies have a choice at moments like this. Often that moment is not recognized until it is too late. A couple other notes. Last time I was here, I couldn't really talk about the issue of the personal knowledge thing. And I think that there's two foundational things to get into the public space and meet people where they are and get to know them and develop relationships so that everything else is put through that lens. And then to understand human rights principles and apply them. Those two things tend to be missing. They're foundational. And one little note. On Sundays, if there's anything that can be done about this, I'm going to be in the middle of a meeting. And I think that we need a little bit better garbage capacity in the plaza. I've been hearing from people who are out there, homeless are quite willing to pick up trash and keep it clean. But the trash cans are overflowing. And it would help if we had a little more capacity. Thank you very much. Angela McLaughlin, Jessica Giannola, Jeff Creed, Jeff Glatz, and Mike Jensen. Good evening. I'm actually here to talk about an appointment to the police committee. I am concerned that Mr. Berry's primary purpose has been obstruction and harassment of the council and the broader community. He's done everything within his power to prevent the council and community from moving forward with initiatives he doesn't approve of. Racism. He's been raging here and online about literally any program geared towards addressing the needs of the homeless in our community. Harm reduction strategies or anything else that doesn't treat problems punitively. He has repeatedly sued the city. And he's even now seeking a $110,000 payday for obstructing Simplicity Village and keeping people on our streets another two years. He regularly bullies community members and organizations of whom he disapproves. And keeps the council and community involved in petty fights that don't advance anything of value. He has demonstrated his lack of understanding of the role of the commission by telling the newspaper recently, the committee's purpose should be showing how professional and well trained the police are. He needs to be removed from this post. As I've mentioned previously, he doesn't have particular expertise in housing, city management, and public health. He's beenCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCD homelessnessCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCD Jessica Giannola, Jeff Creed, Jeff Glatz, and Mike Jensen. Hi, Council. I have a couple things as usual. One thing I wanted to give my support to with the city is supporting the public health aspect to COVID and the restaurants and opening. We had Gallagher proclaim that we just do anything we want with the restaurants because there's smoke. The COVID is still here, so we want to abide by those health regulations. The homeless people have been in the smoke and the elements this entire time, and I didn't see any restaurants opening their doors to them for that. So that leads me to my second one, just providing that support for... planning ahead. We have winter right around the corner, so I'm hoping that we are locating a site or plan or something because the winter weather is going to be hitting, and I just want to keep supporting you guys in accomplishing that goal in having something better than what we've had in the past. I wanted to voice the objection with preferential treatment or the appearance of in giving extra time to people because they have... we all have an argument. It's really hard to hear out there what was already discussed. I can think that that might have been resolved, but moving forward, I'm hoping that that is not something that's repeated, and we're very strong with everybody gets the same time. Use it wisely. We have a lot going on in the city, a lot of complications, as usual. Chico. I wish that the decisions that we make in here were based on science or facts, a need, a resolution, a resolution, a decision that we're working together instead of worrying about who's going to sue us. I see a lot of decisions happening in the last couple of years based on, is someone going to sue us if we make this decision? And that's just not how a city should run. We shouldn't be constantly terrorized by someone who is always going to sue us if we make the wrong decision in their eyes. So when we make those decisions, we're contemplating different things, health things, building, housing, homeless, trash in the creek, whatever it is. Let's make those decisions together based on the information, good information, reaching out for support, counties, state, whatever it is, making those choices based on that. That's it. I'll talk more later on the other one. Thank you. Jeff Creed, followed by Jeff Glatz, followed by Mike Jensen. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, council. I want to touch on a few things that I heard. I concur it's hard to keep track of what's going on with the shuffling back and forth. But I thought it was ironic that the last speaker was concerned about the city being sued. When I talked to the police, code enforcement, and other agencies in the city, they all complain they can't do what other cities do because they're worried about getting sued. And they're not worried about getting sued by Rob Berry. They're worried about getting sued by organizations outside the city who advocate for the homeless. So the trash cans was brought up. If you want that debunked, just go to my YouTube channel. LC2 is the video, and it shows all the trash under Esplanade by Chico Nutt. And it shows an empty trash can dumpster put there by the city, I believe, because it's right next to your hand-washing station and your outhouse, and it's empty. And the entire watershed there is covered in trash. Shopping carts, feces, urine, entire watershed. It's a great video. Devil's Triangle. I've been advocating for months to get outhouses there. They put one outhouse. One outhouse serves, I believe, my memory serves me from 15 years ago, it serves five people for a work week. Once you add in 24 hours, it serves, like, one person for a work week. For 24 hours. How many tents, how many people are living at Devil's Triangle? There's no dumpster. There's no outhouse. We could put in K-rails out here in the city to support these businesses who don't really support the city that well, but we can't put in K-rails and take a two-lane road down to one lane and put in a dumpster and outhouses where traffic doesn't really need two lanes at all. And the road is so screwed up there, nobody wants to drive on both those lanes anyway because you didn't fix the roads 10 years ago. You didn't make a plan to fix the roads. So I talk about plan failure many times. This whole camping ban, or camping plan, was a plan failure. You guys made a bold, rash decision. You didn't give it any forethought. You didn't think about the ramifications. You didn't think about an exit plan. You just did it. And then when it went to hell, what'd you do? Like cowards, you just said, oh, it's not our problem, it's his problem. It's not our problem. And your neighbors call you and complain, and so you get them away from your house, you push them out by everybody else's house. You could have come in and said, look, leave the camps where they are, and instituted rules for the campers. Clean up your camp, there's a quiet time, just like any other campground in the world. But no, you were too cowardly to come in and say, look, follow these rules. And now what do you have? You've got a disaster across the entire city, and you're going to try and implement a plan that you just consolidated, when you've already made the mistake, put your foot in the poo. Would have been a smart answer. Plan failure. Seoul City Council. Jeff Glatz, followed by Mike Jensen. Hello, Mayor, Vice Mayor, Council Members. I guess last time I was here, people couldn't hear me, so sorry I had to come again. Not home, they couldn't hear me. I'm not going to try to point fingers. I've been doing that a little bit. I just want to try to talk about moving forward long-term macro issues in the city. We do, some of you and I, share a fundamental difference in what I believe the role of city council is. I believe your role is as custodians of a city and the citizens of Chico. And I think that sometimes personal ideologies and bigger, beliefs can get in the way of local, what's going on in our local community. I especially feel that, for example, the marijuana encampments, homeless issues, the same amount of energy that I believe is put into the marijuana issue, I would like to see put into other issues that I believe are impacting our community. And the NRC, National Resource Center, has the top ten things residents want in their community. It's pretty simple. You guys are going to know all these. But it bears just repeating for the public. Public safety, number one. Economic health in your community, number two. Education and enrichment, number three. The natural environment, number four. Image and reputation, number five. The overall appearance of the community, number six. Sense of community, number seven. Health and wellness, number eight. Mobility, nine. And built environment, just streets and stuff like that, number ten. I think we're underperforming. We're underperforming on the top seven. And so today I just wanted to talk about economic. To get what many of you want to happen, you have to have revenue. You want to solve homelessness. You want to solve these other problems. Whatever that problem is, whether it's homeless, PD, fire, arts, you have to have revenue. So you have to have a plan that will look at the economic growth of our community. And this has been going on for six years. I've just been watching. And this general, while problems are coming up, this is not being addressed. Companies are coming. Companies are leaving. I know of two companies now, as I mentioned before, that are looking to leave. I understand one company may be coming in. But a tit for tat is not going to be the answer to solve all of our problems. There has to be some sort of a plan. And that starts with kind of the quality of life and what made Chico Chico for ten years ago, five years ago. And you have to get back to that. So whether it's solving the homeless, like right now, I look outside, and there should be children jumping in to Fountain over at City Plaza. And there's not. So that is damaging our downtown business community. So by not, oh, shit. Sorry, ten seconds. I'll have to return on that one. But basically, you have to increase your revenues. You have to get the economy going. If anybody up there wants to accomplish anything, they're hoping to try to accomplish. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry for the word. Our last question. Our last speaker is Mike Jensen. Yeah, I'm Mike Jensen. I live in Chico. I came up here to study. I think we have a problem with, I heard earlier about the CARES Act. I'm for supporting the retirement, current retirement, people considering retirement, public service. I think we need to make an issue of that. The West Coast is a disaster. I've met people at the Plaza, various places that are not out of the air. We need to, I'll talk to any financial guy. I will advocate for studies. Now, before the next November 3rd, we need to study. We need to find data. I will work for any financial department. I will consider questions from the floor, from the, from the, from the city manager, people retiring, the vice mayor. I will take questions. I'm offering that now. I have no big agenda. I'm trying to be happy. If you have any questions, I think we need to, I think that CARES Act is an opportunity. I think, I think we're, we need to call for that. The city councils, we need to call for that. Counties all over the United States need to say that we can't predict the next two years. We cannot predict it. I don't think Carl's going to get much of a retirement from this little episode, but we need to, I forget, CAL FIRE. I mean, city fire departments, county administrative, anybody retiring or has retirement, they need to be backstopped by the financial powers that be for the next two years. I'm saying that. I can't. I think people should come to the city councils in the next, before the elections, and ask, state what they think the problem is. So, again, I have called for questions. I only have 57 seconds left. We can have questions after this. But, anyway, I, I love you all. I can't go to Reno. I can't go to Boyce, Idaho. I can't, I can't get away. I can't, I've got relatives in Reno. I mean, I can't get away. This is a crisis. And the solution to anxiety is to be active. If you can find an ability to be active, to advocate for a healthy cause, we may house people from the refugees, from the fires, but we're not telling the homeless to put a, you know, to smoke after 3 in the morning. The farmers are telling me, it's coming down in the droplets of the dew at 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 in the morning. And it's got, every droplet of water has a thousand dust particles in it. I don't want to be running, we need to study this stuff. If we don't know that now, if we don't get that data now, we can get that data now. We can ask, hey, do you want to get your lungs tested in the next week? We'll test your lungs. Thank you so much for sharing. All right. Thank you for your time. So, we will take a 10 minute break before we start on the public hearing portion. We'll take a 10 minute break before we start on the public hearing portion of the meeting. Getting back to order. And we're on 5 point, excuse me, 4.1, which is hearing order information of maintenance assessment district A41 Drake Estates subdivision. We have a report from Brendan Arvani, Public Works Director, Engineering. Hello. Hello. Good evening, City Council. The item before you for 4.1 is, as Mayor Schwab mentioned, was for the establishment of a Chico maintenance district. This is a 17 lot subdivision on a floral, off of Floral Avenue just north of Manzanita Drive. The improvements that will be funded through this maintenance district are generally storm drain improvements that are associated with the maintenance district. We will be able to complete the maintenance district with that subdivision. That completes my report and I'm available for any questions. Any questions? Okay. Good. Well, we will open the public hearing. Were there any e-mail comments received? No. And then through the Engage Chico platform? No. And do we have any members of the public with us tonight? We do not. Okay. So, we will close the public hearing. Ask for comments or questions. Ask for questions or entertain a motion. So, there's a motion to approve from Council Member Reynolds and a second from Council Member Huber. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Horry? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. So, we will move to regular agenda and here 5.1, which is an overview of the needle exchange program. The Council had previously asked for these four items to be brought back to us. They were all related. So, we brought them into one item. Okay. We have a presentation from the Nuremberg Valley Harm Reduction Coalition. Consideration of alternatives to needle distribution programs, which may or may not include a complete ban on the program. Council Member Stone requested to discuss needle waste and cleanup. And Council Member Morgan requests to discuss a ban on needle exchange programs. It would be my recommendation that we hear all four of these items in the agenda. And then open up public hearing together since people probably did not ask to speak for one particular item of A, B, C, or D. And then after we hear the presentations, public comment, questions, of course, then we will decide any direction that we may give staff. So moved. We're going to do that? I'm sorry? Do we need to make a motion on that? No. Okay. I was just asking for a motion. I was just asking for feedback. Sure. Okay. So, first one is a presentation from the North Valley Harm Reduction Coalition. Welcome. Hi. We have ten minutes for your presentation. Does that work for you? Yeah. Awesome. Thank you for allowing us to present today. My name is Marin Hambly. I'm the onsite HIV and hepatitis C rapid treatment specialist. I'm the testor for Northern Valley Harm Reduction as well as outreach lead and core member. And then my name is Angel Gomez. I am the program manager. So, in your packets, you should have a little bit of a report that I sent out. I just want to start with an overview of what is Northern Valley Harm Reduction Coalition. There's a lot of misinformation out there. And as we'll go over, we spent hours and hours and months and months engaging with folks to try and talk about some of that information. That's why we're here today, spending my evening after working all day talking to you all because this is important. And we want to engage with you. So, Northern Valley Harm Reduction Coalition started as a group together in July 2018 and really grew in response during the Camp Fire. We were born during crisis and during fire and coming together to meet the needs of a really underserved community. We're in time now. We're in times of crisis and fire again. Harm reduction services means supporting any positive change an individual makes in their life to take care of their body. We all have different capacities and levels of resources to make that happen. We all have different trauma we live with and past experiences that put us in different situations. Coming together in that crisis, we were responding to people living through losing their homes in intense trauma. And being totally unheard. We began by just offering outreach services and opioid overdose reversal trainings. Narcan, naloxone trainings. As we are seeing again now, both during COVID and during the second fire, during times of disaster, opioid overdoses skyrocket. And so we began by just offering those trainings. And we grew into offering a syringe litter reporting line. As well as the Narcan trainings. As well as referrals, sharps containers for safe disposal of used syringes. And then we began doing community workshops. Talking to people. We've met with many of you as council members as well as many community groups. And then finally in October 2019, right? We received... Robin, could you just take one moment? We have people in the lobby that are waiting to speak from home. To make comments. But we haven't called for that yet. So could we have them wait outside or over in the municipal building? Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry to interrupt you. October 2019, we received our certification from the California Department of Public Health to begin offering sterile syringes. As an authorized syringe exchange program. That license allows us within a limited area to offer sterile syringes as the number one evidence-based way of reducing rates of communicable disease. Primarily HIV and hepatitis C. Syringe exchange programs are associated with a 50% decrease in the spread of HIV and hepatitis C. And so California Department of Public Health stands wholeheartedly behind us. And is our authority figure. And so we received that license. And began operating. As you all know, we were operating for a short time before COVID hit. And our services changed a bit during COVID. Trying to recognize social distancing. But still offering our essential service. The first three months of our program were a joyous month without screaming. Other... Without other programs. Without other protesters in the park. As one of our core members, I've been there nearly every single Sunday since October. It went from an experience where we could engage with participants. I had... As both the on-site tester, I get one-on-one interactions where I'm counseling folks through what is HIV? What is hepatitis C? How do we spread it? How do we prevent it? Getting to build really strong relationships. To a time when I was being screamed at. And called derogatory terms. I've been misgendered over and over. Someone came and threatened to shoot us all. Threatened to take a chainsaw. Come back with fire at our participants. It became a very violent, hostile space. And yet we remained serving our participants. Because if we're not there, they're facing that alone. In this context, we stayed. And we're going to keep staying and working with this community. As you all know, there was a lawsuit. A lawsuit settlement in which we are not currently able to offer sterile syringes to our community. That's not all our services are. As I mentioned, we offer the overdose reversal training. Stripes containers. Collections. Referrals into medically assisted treatment. And a lot more. And so we're still... We've built a lot of trust and relationship in this community. All across the board. So, while, while back, you asked MVHRC to come present. To council. Part of this report is from pre-COVID times. Over the course, largely of two months. But some of these extend to the previous year as well. We engaged in 33 different community engagement meetings. We met with Chico Police Department multiple times. The Target Team. Butte County Public Health. We met with Chico Area Recreation Department. As well as Chico... City of Chico Parks. We met with Chico Unified School District. Paradise Unified School District. Downtown Chico Ambassadors. The President of the Downtown Chico Business Association. We met with several council members. We also met with... We have monthly attendance to multiple committees. The Butte County Homeless and Runaway Youth Task Force. As well as the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force. We've presented and given workshops at medical facilities. At ENLO. At Opioids... At the Opioid Symposium. We've worked with classes. We've worked with homeless services. HIV and Hep C... We've worked with community services. We've also spent a lot of time engaging with folks who are really angry at us. I have spent... I spent two hours one Friday night talking to Nicole Nava. Trying to listen. Trying to engage. I care so much about this community. And trying to include everyone in it. It's not like we're not spending time listening and trying to adapt. And hear everyone. A community that has harm reduction services is safer for everyone. It is including all kinds of positive change. And I believe that wholeheartedly. Over the course of these 33 different meetings. Many of which I attended. As well as Angel attended. There was a lot of common themes that came out. When we listened. We called these listening sessions. Because we were largely just going to these different departments. These different groups. And asking... What's going on? Like, what do you want us to know? How can we do better? How can we serve you? And then some of the things that we talked about. One of the themes that arose. Was common questions around our services. One thing that we found really helpful to clarify with everyone. Is that our services are never offered in isolation. There was a lot of discussion. Are you an exchange? Are you a giveaway? Do you just hand out needles? We're not. Right? So there is not a single instance in which we are only offering sterile syringes. Our sterile syringes have always been offered. And accompanied with syringe collection. So we collect thousands of used syringes every single weekend. It's always accompanied with a syringe litter cleanup in the area that we're operating. It's always connected with referrals into medically assisted treatment. Into... Sometimes it's housing. Sometimes it's medical care. Into offering Narcan and other basic hygiene products. First aid. Our services are never ever offered in absolute isolation. The other thing that we found helpful. And helpful to clarify. Is questions about are there more syringes in the community? Right? We're seeing more syringe litter. And a couple points there. Syringe litter is a problem in this community. It has been a problem for a really long time. And it continues to be a problem that needs more resources. Right? We need somewhere to put used syringes. They're not going to go away if MVHRC goes away. And they were here long before we were here. You don't solve problems by screaming at them. You solve problems with resources. And we offer a lot of those resources. So not only does MVHRC increase access to sterile safe syringes. We also increase access to disposal. We offer 24 hour syringe reporting line. We'll return people's calls. And pick up litter. We talk with police department a lot about how to coordinate between. You know, if they're calling us hanging up and calling PD. How do we not overlap? We're working towards building that capacity. And the research published by the California Department of Health. And the California Department of Public Health. As well as for the California Center for Disease Control. Found that communities with syringe exchange programs. Report increased rates of safe disposal. Right? And keep in mind that MVHRC serves a tiny fraction. Of the community of people who use drugs in this county. The people that engage in our services. Are bringing back needles. Are collecting used syringes. And so while there is more syringes. There's also more disposal. But that's not always the case. Another common theme to questions that we are asked. Are why is that MVHRC a one on one exchange? Right? Why doesn't someone have to give me one syringe. In order to get one syringe. And there's a lot of reasons there. All of these are evidence based. And not fear driven. So a few different reasons. One. In looking at the different reports and studies. As well as consulting with national and statewide organizations. They have found that in every context. syringe exchange programs are more effective at decreasing the rates of spread of HIV and hepatitis C. They're more effective at encouraging a safe syringe disposal, so returning a used syringe, and they're more effective at getting people into treatment, right? Our ultimate goal, is that my 10 minutes? That is, but we had a bit of a disruption, so if you wanted... I'll wrap up real quick. Okay. And so, and you all can ask follow-up questions, and I can answer there. And I just want to end with letting you all in on some of our current program development plans. We have, we're a brand new program, and we've been adapting and operating in the middle of crisis, and we're all volunteer run. And so, we have a lot of program development in queue, and asking us about it goes a really long way. So, some of, one of the biggest things we heard from every single one of those 33 meetings that I attended, why are you in a park getting a building? We would love a building. We would love to not be in the ash, in the rain, and the 100 degrees weather. We're working on it. You all know as city council members just how hard it is to find property, a commercial property, and to find a property that's not in the rain. And so, we're all working on that. We're not just asking people to get a property to rent, to have services. We're volunteer run. So, we're working on it. That's our number one priority, is to find a building and get out of our park. We would love that. And lastly, just to talk about, we're working on some different models for participant incentives for return of used syringes. And I know I've talked to some city staff about that. Yeah. Questions? Let's open it up to questions. Okay. Thank you for being here and for presenting. You mentioned briefly referrals to medically-assisted treatment, et cetera. Can you speak a little bit more as to how your program works to make those referrals and if you have any data on the amount of referrals made? Yeah. Yeah, so when we make our referrals, we find out specifically with each person what's going to work best for them. Because we don't want to send them with a sheet to call because that can be overwhelming. So we find out what kind of insurance do they have. If they don't have insurance, we'll start signing them up for Medi-Cal right there. We find out, like, do they have any transportation issues. And then, depending on their insurance, which most of the people we come in contact with have Medi-Cal, we will call, in some cases with Medi-Cal, we'll call Butte County Behavioral Health right there and oftentimes we'll make. We'll make a next-day appointment. If they have private insurance, we have a couple of places that we'll call. And again, we can usually get them next-day appointments. We do that with groups quite often for the people who have private insurance. And for those that are looking for methadone maintenance, we send them to AGES. But generally, we'll do that through Butte County Behavioral Health. And on average, we were getting about three or four referrals a week. Sometimes we'd have as high. We'd have as 15 referrals a week. And now that we've stopped providing syringes, we're closer to one or two every two weeks. Yeah. And just to add in a little bit there, in the different research that's been done, it's been found that people who have access, who get to engage in syringe exchange programs, are five times more likely to enter into treatment and three times more likely to report discontinued drug use. And we're seeing that in action. And that... That is part of relationship building and trust. I think many of us in this room know if we don't want to do something, we're not going to do something. And me yelling at you to do that thing probably isn't going to encourage you or inspire you to feel worthy and valuable and with the energy to enact change. And so our model is progressive engagement, right? So the first time, I'm going to get to know you. And I know that you're going to come back. And the second time, we're going to talk more about it. I might make that call with you. I have one person, I have a couple people that I... They have my cell phone number. They call me every couple of weeks and say, okay, Marin, I'm ready for you to come pick me up. Will you, like, let's go to the clinic. I'm like, great, cool. You're ready? I'm ready. Let's go. So that trust-based relationship and progressive engagement. And like Angel was mentioning, like unique referrals. Because not every place is going to work for everyone. And you can see the last three agencies on our list of meetings. Our behavioral health agencies, we have a number of them. We have a number of agencies. And we've, over COVID, we have bi-monthly collaborative meetings where we talk about how to make effective warm referrals, how to get as many people into suboxone clinics and medically assisted treatment as possible. Other questions? The syringe litter disposal line. Did someone pick that up? Because one of the complaints, I think, is that, you know, one of the complaints I heard was we called the syringe needle pickup line and no one was there. Therefore, we ended up calling Chico PD. So the first question is how did the disposal line work? Was that run by volunteers? And then secondly, listening to you talk about, we had this heroin needle litter problem before, which I don't, I agree. But how do you account for the increase in the needle that Chico PD saw after you guys got started? I mean, you talked about evidence-based research. You didn't provide any, but you go evidence, evidence, evidence, evidence. We have graphs from Chico PD that say this is what happened with the needle pickup we were doing. And supposedly there was a litter disposal line, which I understand the purpose of. It's like if we're going to go do this, we should at least try to pick it up. But something doesn't seem to fit. So can you help me understand that? Yeah. So how does the syringe litter reporting line work? People do have to call and leave a message. Okay. And it goes voice to text to my phone. I work 730 to 5 every day. I do most of our volunteers. So having that operated line wouldn't be feasible for us. And we talked about that. And if there was ever a point where there was an operator and then a message, that would be unclear for people. So when someone calls in, I almost immediately get a message to my phone that I can look at real quickly and forward to a larger group message that we have. And I believe there's about 15 people in it right now. And so I'll forward it to that group. And whoever is the first available will say that they're going to pick it up. Generally, we can respond within two hours. That also depends on when I receive the text message. But the only times we don't receive the text message very quickly is when they come in the middle of the night or in the very early hours of the morning. But that's generally how the line works. And then depending on if that person left us a phone number to call them back, we'll contact them. Because in the message, it specifically says, if you want to call back, leave your number. Okay. And just to further that answer and answer that second question you had. So if you look at number five in the MBHRC program development, we talk about increasing our average response time to screen Twitter reports. Like Angel mentioned, we're a reporting line, not a hotline. So there's not a warm voice. But our current response time is within zero to two hours unless it's in the middle of the night. And we're hoping to increase, sorry, our current response time is zero to five. We're hoping to increase that to a quicker response time. And in the multiple meetings with the target team in Chico PD that we held, I talked to Sergeant Sandoval and Officer Madden about the increased calls there at the time, Officer Madden. About the increased calls they were getting and increased litter. And over the course of our multiple meetings, they started to see that decrease even. So when our program first opened, there was an increase in syringe litter. And that's because there are more syringes. There's also more access for disposal, but it takes time. And for those to come back to us because we're not collecting every single day 24 hours a day. And then we also talked about that overlapping calls because we were noticing the same thing. We're like, hey, this is really weird. People are saying they called your line and they're calling us. And what we found is that people called our line, didn't leave a message and hung up, and then called Chico PD. And so we talked about are there ways where, I also worked for a shelter in town and like we sometimes do direct communication with PD if they have a referral. And so we talked about potentially developing a way where they can say, hey, we got a syringe litter reporting line, did you get the same call? Who's gonna go out? So not to duplicate services. So that was a really good answer. My next one, there was, you talk a lot about people yelling and screaming and doing all these different things. Why do you think there was such a public outcry regarding your service? Pain. I think every single person, at least that I talked to, even the ones that's dedicated a lot of time into following me home, stalking me at work, threatening my life. I engaged with those folks and they shared with me a lot of stories of pain. A lot of people who are very mad at us have very personal experiences of people that, they love being harmed by drugs. We all love someone, most of us love someone who's used drugs and that's why our program exists. I think we could have saved a lot of lives that have been lost previously in this county. And so pain and trauma and fear makes us do a lot of things. That's why our program exists. And so I think it's really fueled by that. And that's why we face that with, we are literally gonna meet every single person where they're at, whether they like me or not. It's still approaching everyone with that sort of,CDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCDCD You know what I mean. And this is kind of rhetorical, but at what cost to the community? With the needle litter, with the ranger being stabbed, with the cops being stabbed, with the service worker being stabbed? How do you balance that? We're putting all this out here. It's affecting some number of the communities, the parks, the people that it's attracting. And over here, we're saying, well, we saved, I don't know what the numbers are. We saved 10 people from HIV and Hep C, which is fantastic. I mean, saving one is super, but at what cost? And how do you justify that? And I'm going to disagree on the misplaced anger. I think that's where people are coming from. When I hear you in front of us explain the program and the thought that you put into it and the emotion and the clear caring, I get it. And I think most other people would, too. But I think the anger is coming from, that's my wife's name. Those are Freudian slip, Amber Anger. God, I hope she's not watching. I'm just waiting for the phone to go off. They're upset about something. And maybe it's misplaced anger. I'm not sure about that. And then my last question is, tell me about giving heroin needles to minors. Because we know what happened. It's interesting that you call them heroin needles. They're just sterile syringes. So there's no drugs in them. But we know what they're for. Not necessarily. We give needles for testosterone, estrogen, heroin, meth. Insulin. There's a lot of different uses for our syringes. So it's a misnomer to call them heroin needles. But it is dramatic. So I hear that. So back to that first part of the question, with harm to the community. Like I said at the beginning, there are problems with syringe litter in this community. And they need more resources, not less. The way to respond to needle pricks, which in our discussions with both the sheriffs and the Chico Police Department, is that pricks bias. By a citizen off duty are actually extremely rare. There are pricks in the line of duty. So police officers searching someone and sticking their hands in things have been pricked. People in the medical field have been pricked. And so the response there is more resources for safe disposal. If I have a piece of trash and I have to walk two miles to put it away, I might lose it before I get to that receptacle. We need more disposal containers. We have recommendations for the city council to work with. Pharmacies are actually legally obligated to be a part of discussions of how to dispose safely of hypodermic needles. And so increasing those. Do you want to talk about minors? Well, no. To add to the needle stick injuries, and especially with officers, in the five years before we operated, there were eight needle stick injuries to officers in Chico. So that's about an average of two a year or so. Sorry, the four years. That's an average of two a year. Since we've operated, I've heard of one needle stick injury by an officer. If you look at that strictly by the numbers, that's a 50% decrease for officers. We understand that they do put themselves in danger and needle sticks are one of those things. But this program helps reduce that danger to them. Especially because people don't have to have the fear of being charged with paraphernalia for syringes because of the program. And that's a big reason why people do improperly dispose of syringes. They don't want to be able to use those of them or try and hide them on their persons because of that fear of charges. And having syringe assets takes away that criminal part of having those syringes. And we also give out a boatload of sharps containers. So instead of them floating around a car or floating around a pocket, we're able to provide those containers. So that's part of the decrease is resources we offer to the community. And so to touch on the minor part, yes, we do offer services to minors. It is an unfortunate truth, but it's a reality that there are injection drug users that are minors. I knew them when I was a minor. I knew people in high school who did it. But because there aren't that many, but because there are so few, they have an even more isolated social circle. They have even more stigma around them. And this is one of those few places where they don't have that isolation and that stigma. And they can just as easily get HIV or hepatitis C as an adult. And we have a minor in the community. We have a minor action plan in place. So we don't refuse services to minors when we identify them. But because, like Angel's saying, minors more than anyone should be protected from dangerous diseases. But we engage on a different level. We work with, if they're homeless, Sixth Street, the HEART, Homeless Emergency Action Response Team. That's where we're part of those task forces to really do those referrals. And when I ask Behavioral Health the same thing, what do you do when you find minors? You know? It's really hard to find services for people under 18 who are using drugs. There's not a lot out there. And there's almost no doctors willing to prescribe medically assisted treatment for minors. And so as a whole county, we really need to address that issue. I know Behavioral Health has also been in discussions about how we support our minors who have unfortunately been introduced to drugs and using it intravenously. And I could tell you a whole load of anecdotes of why that's happening. Yeah. So definitely need resources. And I feel like, just to add slightly on that, it's important to acknowledge that every week we do have a licensed clinical social worker on site working with people. And we also have someone who has a master's in social work as well. So every single week we have a professional social worker there engaging with people and connecting them with resources. And people that know how, have been trained how to handle those instances like when there's a minor. Other questions? Okay. Yes, I have a couple. Yes, Mr. Huber. So you mentioned potential incentives to getting people to bring needles back. Can you elaborate a little bit on what some of those programs that have maybe worked in other communities were? Yeah. A lot of them were actually invented by our participants. So we asked people, what's going on? How can we get more people to bring in needles? How can we get more people to use syringes? And two ideas that really stuck that a few different people mentioned. One is a raffle program. So we are working towards funding essentially any time someone brings back a used syringe, they get a raffle ticket. No matter how many or how few, it's incentivizing that behavior. And then every week, because we operate on a weekly basis, you get a raffle ticket. And then we do a raffle drawing and you get like a $10 to $15 gift card. We're really careful not to monetize a single syringe because then that creates an economy. Like if we were to say a dollar per syringe, then we would see rates in crime increase. We would see stealing and that sort of thing. And so the raffle program was one idea and it kind of brings some positive encouragement to like, hey, I'm cleaning up my parks. I'm taking care of my body. This is good behavior. And the other idea was... Using like one of those meters, like a thermometer, where when we hit a certain mark of, you know, when we hit 10,000 syringes turned in, we throw a pizza party. So quarterly pizza parties were the two ideas that our participants came up with. 10,000? Yeah. We collect... That was our weekly average when we were providing access. That's how many we were collecting. So... Just to touch on that for a sec, because I've gotten that question a lot too, of like what's an average amount of syringes? And we do this on a needs-based basis. And I do this with people who are coming up to me for services, right? Let's say a lot of people use... Say average use is about 10 times a day, right? So if you're injecting 10 times a day for seven days a week, that's 70 syringes. Every time you inject, there's about two to three misses, right? Where it's hard to inject properly. And you want to use a clean syringe every single time. Because every time a syringe goes into something, it becomes barbed and contaminated. So now we're at 70 times three, which is 210. And that's just an average use. Sometimes people use more, sometimes people use less. And that's kind of a little bit of math there. Yeah, thanks for those local ideas. Anything that you're aware of that's worked in other communities to incentivize? To my knowledge, most other communities that have syringe programs, they find that at the first, the return rates aren't great because it's a new habit. It's a new thing people aren't used to. And then it increases. And what they do, the ones that have the funding, is they have paid staff that go out and collect syringes. I don't know of any programs that incentivize syringe return. Because of the issue of monetizing it and how that can create more problems. Which is why our incentives aren't necessarily per syringe. And we're trying to take that element out. But I don't know of any program that has any other incentivizing of returning syringes. Okay, thank you. The other question was, you mentioned that your referrals for treatment programs go to AGIS. Are there any other alternatives to AGIS? And what would it take to have other options for people other than just that one facility? We have two pages of options that we work through depending on someone's situation. AGIS is a good one. Butte County Behavioral Health has a substance use MAP program. So AGIS, Behavioral Health, and Groups to Cover Together, the three primary intakes that we do. And then if someone's in Orville or in different situations, we might look at that a little bit differently. And it's worth noting that AGIS is the only place people can get methadone. They're the only opioid treatment facility that's certified to do that. So if the best option for that person is methadone, then they're the only option. And is there anybody doing Suboxone in the area? Yes. And is that AGIS also? AGIS does Suboxone. Butte County Behavioral Health, NLO has their Bridge program. Groups to Cover Together, AMPA and Orville, Northern Valley Indian Health. What a team. Argyle Medical Group. And there's a couple more. And would you mind elaborating, just in case everybody doesn't know what the difference is between Suboxone and some of the other replacement therapies? Yeah. So the two main ones are methadone and Suboxone. So methadone is a daily dose. It's liquid. And people go into the facility for the dosing. And so they're going in every day. And they're meeting with their doctor. And they're meeting with that nurse. And they get the monitored dosing. And how it reacts with your brain is a little different than Suboxone. So methadone has a higher potential for abuse. And the simplest way to put it is like you have heroin, which is like a full antagonist. Methadone is the same. But what it does is it eliminates what all medicated-assisted treatment does is it helps control those cravings. And that's what drives people to take place in those risky behaviors. To do those things that we see like stealing from family members or neglecting to take care of their loved ones. It's that craving that drives them to do that. So methadone, that's why it's so regulated. And you have to have a special license to dispense it. So what Suboxone is, is you can do that just with your primary care physician out of an office. They do have to get a special training, although it's not a very challenging training for providers to do. And so what it does is it helps. What it does is it's a partial antagonist. So like where heroin, methadone are up here, Suboxone is kind of down here. So the potential for abuse is much lower. And also in most cases it's paired with Naloxone, which is the overdose reversal medication. So what it does is it blocks your body from any more drugs. So if you're taking the Suboxone and you're still trying to take heroin, it's going to block that heroin from interacting with your brain. Whereas you can take methadone and heroin at the same time because it doesn't have that blocking agent in it. And so those are the two options that are readily available. Suboxone is like a daily thing that you take and you can take it home. You can get it filled out at a pharmacy. How much you get to take home with you is dependent on the provider. Some will do three days at a time, a week, a month. It's dependent on what the provider decides for that person. And there is also an injectable form that you do monthly as well. And that's also an injectable Suboxone. Okay. So the Suboxone slash Naloxone, is that a combination that is intended to help people wean themselves off of drugs? No. Neither is meant to be weaned off of. So substance use disorder is a chronic medical condition, which means it is a lifetime thing. And all of the research shows that, just like with influenza, any other chronic medical condition, like diabetes, right? You take that medication for as long as you need. So that person, the minimum that people should be on the medication is a year. Before they even consider weaning off. But it shouldn't be a consideration unless that person feels ready. And that's what all the best practices show. Just like if you were taking insulin, right? And you were doing better, you don't take them off of the insulin. It's because of the insulin that you are doing better. And so all the medical things say, keep them on the medication. Even if that's their entire life. As long as they're stable and they're doing better, keep them on the medication. And Ms. Reynolds and then Ms. Brown. I'd like to... I just had a quick question. I remember, I think that was maybe because of COVID, you guys had a change in the program where you're able to do deliveries. Are you still currently able to do that or is everything on hold right now? So everything related to a sterile syringe. Is on hold. Everything else we are able to offer. So I still go pick up new syringes. Right? We can do that. And we've always... We've done that before we had a license. We'll continue doing that. All the services, opioid overdose trainings, HIV and Hep C testing, I still do on an appointment basis. All these things are kind of mobile. The only thing that was restricted by location and then by deliveries is the sterile syringe. And the thing that the settlement has put on hold is the sterile syringe. But that's not our only service. Okay, perfect. Thank you for the clarification. Just a quick question. Do you collaborate, aside from the organizations and providers that you refer to, do you collaborate with other medical professionals in your work? And can you explain or expand on that? Yeah. I can talk a little bit about from the HIV and Hep C testing side. I'm constantly talking to other providers about what they're doing, what they're seeing. For any preliminary pauses for HIV, I'm working with Caring Choices as well as Butte County Public Health, working with people to get the follow-up treatment and care. For Hepatitis C, any reactions there, we're working directly with Ampla Health. And there's a doctor there that we do kind of warm referrals to because he's worked with this community a lot and people have had good experiences. A lot of the people we're testing would never have gone into clinics otherwise. And so it's a lot of work to kind of be like, I often accompany people because of the amount of mistreatment they've experienced in hospitals and clinics. So we have different clinics we work with. We work with Enloe. And then we also kind of consult with different addiction treatment specialists. And that's kind of phone calls and conversations. And we are looking at that. Increasing those collaborations. In addition to that, too, we also refer a lot of people to the Shalom Free Clinic. We get a lot of people who have abscess, who have infections and have a lot of other medical issues going on that just don't want to go to the hospital. They don't want to go to a doctor's office. So we send a lot of people to the Shalom Clinic. And a big advantage to that is they operate just a few hours after we close. So we can get people in much more effectively and talk to them and say, hey, how are you? Just two hours from now, you've got to be here. They will take care of you. They're not going to talk to you or shame you or anything about that your injury was related to drug use. We also really try and heavily encourage people to go to Enloe when they need to, especially now that they have their bridge program. They have a substance use navigator. And I have his cell phone number. He doesn't work on Sundays. But I will always tell people, like, when you go to Enloe, you have to go to Enloe. Ask for him. He will advocate for you regardless of what you're needing there. And so there has there's still a lot of mistrust with people to go to a lot of these traditional healthcare facilities. But it's starting to change. But it's slow. No questions. Mr. Stone. You mentioned assistance by other healthcare organizations as Vice Mayor Brown. And you also mentioned that you've coordinated with the city of Chico to some extent. But I'm wondering. What do you typically see in other communities that have these type of needle exchanges? And by the way, thanks for the information on the assigning some value to the needles. As you know, a couple of years ago, I had looked for something along those lines to try and curtail those needles and rein them in. And CRV was just one of the suggestions that I had made. But I can see now that monetizing those needles, how that can create additional problems. But I'm wondering. What do you see in other communities? And a couple of months ago, I was looking in other communities throughout the United States that have independent contractors that work to clean this up. And I think you alluded to that at some point during the discussion tonight. Many cities have sharps containers built into restroom facilities and city halls and that type of thing that are steel that can be contained and not be messed with. I mean, what is it that the city of Chico can do to help rein in the number of errant needles that we have? That you've seen in other communities? I think that the collaboration between syringe programs and the communities they operate in and their city and local governments varies wildly. Yes. Throughout the United States and even just in California. You have some programs that have been supported and received funding from the city for decades now. You have other programs that are constantly going head to head with their local governments trying to operate. But now is the time. So is that funding that they're providing, is that to continue the needle syringe exchange or is that to draw them in or presumably both, I guess, if they were? It's to provide syringe access. No kidding. Okay. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. But I think one of the biggest things, and we've talked about this a lot, that the city can help with is having more public access to syringe disposal. Having kiosks in locations that aren't enclosed buildings that someone can just walk up to, put them in and not have to check in, not have to be there during certain hours. Because there's a lot of fear of people, they say they don't want to out themselves. A lot of the people that we were doing deliveries to were people that did not want to come to the program even when we very first started and there wasn't as much attention. Because they were afraid that their employer was going to find out or their spouse or their parents. So even the idea of like we have a drop off box at the public health office by Chico Jr. Even the idea of walking in there and dropping it off is very fearful for them because they feel like somehow they're going to get recognized or noticed. And I'll also note that you left off at least one public meeting, the local government committee meeting between the city and county was also one that you met in 2019. Yeah, I forgot to tell you. Thank you. I've got a couple of questions. I suppose thinking of needle drop offs. So for the needle drop off locations, once they get dropped off, there's the challenge of picking them up and disposing them and our current waste haulers do not have the certification to do that. So luckily, MBHRC, as long as we get to stick around, we have that contract and we continue to have that contract to dispose of used syringes safely. We'd be happy to collaborate with the city to develop some sort of program where we're maintaining them, disposing them and upholding that contract. Okay. Thank you. A lot of your challenges seem to stem from money, having a physical location and paid staff. What are your solutions? Grant writing? Grant writing. We are seeking grants. We're writing grants. We're open to being helped, I'll tell you that much. Yeah. There are not a lot of grants for syringe programs. And so the ones that are out there, there's a lot of competition for them. And to be clear on a, I think, common misconception, the budget we received from the California Department of Public Health was $15,000. Not a single dollar of that is staff funding. All of that is directly related to supplies being distributed, which we no longer have anymore. And you say your program is on hold. What does that mean? The syringe access portion of it? On hold, does that mean that, what is the avenue to reopening that, I guess? On hold to me means that it's on a temporary hiatus. Is that a correct assumption or does that mean that you are not permitted to distribute needles? I think we can't predict all the future. I know that we're going to stay in this community working with people who use drugs and working with all members of the communities, whether they're loved ones of people who use drugs or mothers with kids or parents with kids. We're still here and the syringes were just one part of our program. So our program isn't on hold. Syringe access is on hold. And we're going to work to try and bring that service back in a way that is safe and responsible. And professional like we have been doing and like we will hopefully do again. So you would have to apply to the state again for that? In order to be a California state certified syringe exchange program, we would need to apply to the state like we did previously. There would be a public comment period. We would do an environmental review. And then if we receive that certification, we would be able to operate again in that way. Any other questions? Question. Was the basis of the lawsuit, I haven't read it, but was it a CEQA lawsuit? There's a few different claims in there. CEQA was the main one. Which is why in the settlement, any program approved by the state has to go through an environmental review process. And that takes months. And to be clear, the settlement occurred not because there was proof of environmental damage, but because we settled because a CEQA process wasn't followed, because CEQA was never intended to apply to syringe exchange programs. But there was kind of that negotiation of, okay, a CEQA review didn't happen. Now it's a larger question of does CEQA, should CEQA apply to syringe exchange programs? And we were kind of caught in the crosshairs of that larger argument statewide. CEQA is a problem for developers as well where there's no change in outcomes, but it delays a project for two years. So it's not uncommon. Thank you. Okay. Well, thank you very much for sharing. Thank you. So the second bullet point is consideration of alternatives to needle distribution programs, which may or may not include a complete ban on the program. That was as a result of our February 4th meeting, a request to bring that back. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Jarrett, do you have any comments? Thank you, Madam Mayor, members of the Council. Yes, as we previously discussed, there are various cities around the state, primarily in the North State area, that have adopted a ban on the establishment of needle exchange programs. Most notably Oroville and the City of Biggs. We have reviewed this. Previously we have talked about the needle exchange program being preempted and ways to, you know, eliminate an established program from the city. And a program that is established pursuant to Health and Safety Code 121349. C likely would be preempted from the city taking action to ban that program. However, there is nothing on point in the case law that would prevent an ordinance such as the one done by the City of Oroville to prohibit the establishment of such a use within the city. So I think that's a good point. So with that being an open question of law, neither being prohibited nor specifically stated as being preempted, cities have adopted such ordinances. Much has been said about 112349. There have been some who have claimed that the Part B portion of that, which allows for a local agency to establish a needle exchange program, to establish their own process for establishing a needle exchange program permit to allow such uses. There have been some who have suggested that that, because it has the word may regulate in their terms to that effect, that would mean that the city has to give its consent for the state licensed version of that program to be established. Okay. So that's a good point. There's no case law that supports that position. I do not read it that way. And so as the last speaker was mentioning, there are multiple ways in which these programs can be established, or at least two ways. One is state permit or a local permit. And the SEP programs were first established through a state law that allowed local agencies to, to establish a syringe exchange program, or project as it was called. And that would be established by local agency taking action through consultation with local health officer. And although that's not what's been done here, that is a way things can be done. So there are various counties that have a local permit process to allow SEP programs. If the council desired to bring an ordinance that would require, in and of itself would require CEQA action. There was a comment that CEQA was not intended for SEP programs. That might be true in 1970, 72, or thereabouts when CEQA was adopted. Syringe exchange programs were not the focus of it, but was, was the focus, was having the potential effects on the environment. And so that is a threshold for any government action, whatever the government, not just cities, states as well. And so, I don't know if another speaker might speak to the, the lawsuit that was filed, the basis of that, and the settlement. I don't have the settlement document that was provided that. But I did review the, the lawsuit that was filed that eventually caused Northern Valley reduction to cease their syringe program and indeed address a CEQA problem that the state had and address a planning, largely planning and zoning issue. That case did not go to final ruling or the Court of Appeals and we can find no case on point that addresses whether or not a city or the needle exchange programs have to abide by comply with local zoning. So that again is an open question a lot. There have been attempts recently in 2019 SB 692 by Senator Morlach. That was a bill that would have required authorization of SEP or reauthorization of SEP programs only if a local ordinance would permit such use. That legislation was not passed. It got stalled in committee. So the legislature has thought about these issues in the recent past. It should also be noticed that the SEP programs, I believe, run through... There is a sunset date. I believe it's 2021. And I don't know if there's activity at the state level to continue to extend the SEP program. Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... Umm ... state banning ourselves from doing something that we don't think we should be doing as a city function. In other words, the city is not going to approve a needle program, never has, hasn't been offered here or suggested here. A ban would be banning ourselves from doing something that we've never suggested doing and the state would preempt us if they so chose. Right? It's an open question is what you're saying. So whether or not the state has preempted you already, again, that's the open question a lot. Whether or not they have, you have the authority to enact a ban similar to Oroville. There's no case law that says that you are expressly preempted. There are other types of laws out there where the courts have ruled that cities have taken an action and ultimately are found to have been preempted. So. Are you saying that we could possibly create our own local permit that would for instance require the CEQA, require planning and zoning and then also establish other criteria that the city may collectively feel is important. Meeting litter pickup threshold. Physical location, hours of operation, those types of things. There are other, under the same code section, 121349 of the health and safety code, part C establishes the statewide program administered by the State Department of Public Health. Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm the City Council, the Mayor, and the local health officer of the city may establish a needle and syringe exchange project. So, yes, you could establish a local exchange project. The terms of that, I don't know. We haven't delved into everything you've just mentioned as being applicable, but that sounds like a start of a project. However, the state could also, even if the city had such a program established, sounds like the state could also approve another program in the state. I believe so. Yeah. From my understanding, the history of it is that those exchange projects were established first, and then the statewide program was established after. And it should be noted, the whole reason for having those projects from a law enforcement standpoint is just possession of drug paraphernalia is against the law, of course. So, if one possesses a syringe, or if one possesses a syringe, or if one possesses a syringe, or if one possesses a syringe, or one provides a syringe to another person through a syringe program, that's an affirmative defense for the possession or the distribution of drug paraphernalia. It just seems so crazy that the state would permit such a program without, you know, asking the city what criteria or how it impacts the city. So, there is a process for the city to be involved, and that was done here. It's a limited process. It's not asking the city council. It asks the local law enforcement officer and the local health official for a comment letter, essentially. And so, last August, I think it was, when the application was received by the state, then there was a comment period that the chief of police, Chief O'Brien, had asked the city to do. And so, the city has done that. And so, the city has done that. And so, the mayor at the time was asked to provide a comment letter. He did. Butte County Health Officer, Dr. Miller, provided a comment letter. The state then took those letters into consideration and issued the permit, and, you know, may have provided some basis for, I believe, because of Chief O'Brien's comment letter. the date, the days of distribution, and the scope of the distribution, the distribution area, was limited. If I recall seeing that in the approval letter back from the Department of Health to the city. I have questions regarding cost recovery, especially since this is a state, this was a state-permitted program. We've seen increases in, reports of increases in needle debris and needle waste. What are our options related to some measure of cost recovery or support to help clean some of this debris up? Are you suggesting cost recovery asking the state for? Yeah, I mean at least. Or NVHRC, I can't squeeze blood from a turnip, but there are no options available. No sharps. No containers. No program. No grant program when they develop or permit a use like this within a municipality. The best that they've got for us is two comment letters from our, in our case, a county public health director. And then our chief of police or chief law enforcement officer, which in our case is the chief of police. There's no additional funding, no other support, no other practices to navigate this. We're on our own. Nothing under the state codes that I could find. And we're not going to be able to do anything about that issue. There is one other way that the city has the ability to comment on this. It's upon reauthorization. The initial period can be up for two years that a permit is issued. At time of reauthorization, then the city gets, the city council gets the opportunity to comment. I believe there needs to be a public meeting regarding that. Wow. All right. Oh. Thank you. Additional questions? Follow up, I guess, on Ann's process of trying to figure out where we're at and what our options are. So if we had a local ordinance, not to regulate but to ban, because to regulate, it sounds like there's a presumption of some level of approval. And also it sounds like it's an either or. The state could issue a license. Regardless of whether we had an ordinance. But if we are in a place where we have an ordinance and we're trying to enforce it, this would, us, would be the city litigating with the licensee? Or would the, right? Because there would be the ones that would be in pursuant of their state license, would be running this program. Right. Assumingly against local ordinance. So then we would sue them to stop. Is that, is that my understanding? It sounds like you're assuming that there is, or your hypothetical is that there is a local ordinance such as Oroville's saying this use is banned. And then the state issues a permit. And. And the, the, the permittee then establishes themselves in the city. Right. And then we're trying to take legal action to prevent them from undertaking their actions underneath the permit? That's my question. Okay, good. So yeah, you'd, you'd be suing, you'd be suing the, the permittee for establishing a, an activity that is, unless it's a legal action. That's not lawful under city ordinances. Under city, but authorized by the state. Now, among those cities that have adopted local ordinance, I think all of them without a current program, have any of them litigated this? Have any of them gone after a permittee to follow the local ordinance? Not to my knowledge. Has that been tested in courts at all? Not to my knowledge. And you would, it, it sounds like though you say it's an open question that we would be going up against, I mean it not just, you know, somebody starting a program. It's somebody who has a state permit. And then we would be in court arguing that that is, is, does not allow them to operate. We would be going up. Right. It would be a question of who has the permit. Who has the control, the state or the local folks. Correct. And we would be the first to litigate this. Under your hypo, yes. Yeah. And I would add in there that more than likely, although we would likely be seeking a written mandate or an injunction against that permittee, I could see where the state would intervene. And the state attorney general would come in representing that permit. And I would say that the state attorney general would come in representing the California Department of Public Health as they did in the, the case that I believe was Galloway versus North Valley Harm Reduction was the name of the case that was ultimately settled here. The AG's office was involved in that case as well. And again, others could speak to the, the details of that case. I was not involved. The city was not involved. But I'm curious as a follow up. Who's the, the expert witness about the, the public health impacts? Is it the city? Is it the California Department of Public Health that issued the permit? I mean in that case, right, if we're the ones that are litigating this case against the state for allowing this, this permit and the California Department of Public Health that was the issuer of the permit to the permittee, who do we get up on the witness stand to say this is a concern of public health? The, the people that are doing that are the California Department of Public Health, right? I mean wouldn't they be primarily arbiters for the state attorney general on this issue? Probably for the, for the state, yes. And then you, on the city side, you have your own health officer that would be representing your interest. You could have other experts as well. I can see where that could come an issue. And the public health officer commented on the permit in the first place? Yes. The, the former public health officer for Butte County. Right. Interesting. He did. Additional questions? Yes. Thank you. Okay. So the next item is the Councilmember Stone request to discuss needle waste in Phoenix. Well, I, I, I think if we're taking these individually like this, then my request is for staff to review what recourse do we have, what, what opportunities do we have to, to, to get back some funding, whether that's through the organization. And it sounds like they're already willing to provide some of that support. If we had sharps containers around town and worked with pharmacies as was suggested, it sounds like we have an entity that's willing to pick those up for us and help us dispose them. So I, I brought this up now many times, more than I can count on one hand in the last two years. And I, I'd like to see staff make a concerted effort reviewing what other communities are doing. And bring back a report in that capacity. What other communities are doing to clear the, the needle waste. What other communities are doing in terms of sharps disposals. What other communities are doing in terms of working with, with pharmacy resources. What other communities are doing with independent contractors to help clean up that, that, that waste. Again, these were all things that were going on in other communities throughout the United States in 2018 while we still saw needle low waste in this community. So that's great. So it's a re-engagement of that request, and I'd like a report from staff, finally, once and for all, about what other communities are doing to succeed. What we did in 2018 was this got sent to the Internal Affairs Committee. Internal Affairs came back with it. Mayor Schwab, you were on that committee. And what came back was, well, geez, it's largely a county problem, and I guess we should not be addressing this, so let's move that to county. In fact, the chair of that committee was former Council Member Andrew Coolidge. And that's where it left. We worked with the local government committee trying to coordinate with the county. There wasn't any drive or impetus. Maybe we should not be attempting to liaise with the county on this one, particularly since they were opposed to the permit in the first place. But what can we do concrete? I mean, shovel, let's get the debris out of our creeks and streams, out of our roads. Replace. Rather than shaking a stick at an organization. Do you have any information now, Mr. Orme? Obviously, we've, staff, you know, contingent upon that. You recited it as it was on the Internal Affairs Committee. There was no recommendation out of the Internal Affairs Committee back to council. So staff never got direction to move forward with that type of evaluation. Nonetheless, we have reached out to the county, and the county has not contemplated any programs. And also reached out to our local waste haulers. I know, Mayor, you'd mentioned that. And what you found out in that exercise is that there is only one entity that really has that authority right now. The permitting, proper permitting to be able to do collections. So we're really limited on what we could do. If council directs staff to conduct that further research, obviously, we would work with the permittee in conjunction with reaching out to pharmacies to find out what avenues do exist. If it's council's desire, we can put that on our to-do list and work towards those ends. Well, we'll get to that when there's motions after public comment. But I'd certainly like, the community seems to be calling for this as all hands on deck. And that it's a clear and present danger. And I'd appreciate if staff was able to research the cleanup efforts. But we'll talk about that at a later date. Thank you. Council, have any questions? One minute. Okay. The next item. The next item for discussion is Council Member Morgan's request to discuss a ban on needle exchange programs. Council Member Morgan. I think we talked about all that stuff with the first one. So we can take public comment and then come back. Okay. Does anybody have any specific questions or comments on this particular item? Okay. Well, let's hear from the public. Madam Mayor, there is one other item. Oh. And it does relate to bans. It's a ban that you currently do have. It's a ban that you currently have on the books under Chief Municipal Code 9.43.140, prohibition on possession of hypodermic needles. It's our opinion that you were not preempted from the time, place, manner restriction that you have on possessing those. That's limited to, I believe that's limited to the Civic Center. But in any event, we do not believe that the city's current ban on the possession is preempted by state law. So you're saying that the city's current ban is in effect on individual possession? Correct. And the reason is it allows the exemption for someone who has it for a medical need. Okay. So it's, again... It's a local ordinance on possession. It mirrors the state law on possession of drug paraphernalia and has that same exemption. So that has been mentioned in the past. Okay. So just wanted to bring that up. Follow-up on that, because I, and not to give anyone any ideas, hopefully there aren't too many viewers out there that are subject to this, but isn't addiction... Is it a disease in the first place? So if somebody were really sharp with this type of thing, could they say, I have an addiction, which is a disease, which is a disorder, therefore for a medical need, I have needles on me? Well, so it's funny. So addictions like that, like for an ADA-type purpose, having to make reasonable accommodation and so forth. Yeah, so as it turns out, the court cases that have reviewed that have said you're... Right. You're... You're actually disabled actually once you're in treatment. When you're off the wagon, so to speak, then now you're breaking the law. Right. Good point. Thank you. Yeah. So we have speakers. Can you please comment and tell us how many... First, how many people sent us an email or wrote a comment? On Engage Chico. We have 38. And how many members of the public are here to address us? We have eight. Eight. Okay. So the members of the public will be able to have three minutes each. And while we are reading the comments, could you please say the names? I also wanted to address an email that we received saying, why is the council reading the comments during the meeting? Why didn't they do that ahead of time? Some council members did have an opportunity to read the comments ahead of time. Others were not. And the council wanted to make a commitment that we are reading the public testimony. So even if perhaps they've been read before, it gives us a time to look at them again, especially in light of the discussion that we're having. So... Well, we... While we are reading the comments, would you please read the names of the people who submitted them? Yes. So we received email comments from Jessica Haggard, Margaret Hicks, Julie Threat, Matt Donner, Jennifer Curtis, Jody Taylor, Deborah Bird, Taylor Skinner, Nicole Nava, Claudette Ritter, Janet Bezrelos. Lisa Salzman, Rob Berry, Carolyn I., Marcy Pittman, Pam Schneidman, Susan Smead, Steven Muser, Deborah Jones, Michelle Rettlinger, Gary Vertel, Kimberly Burke, Michelle Hale, Chanel Fowler, Robin Engle, Cami Dinley, Stephanie Barrett, Carrie Logan, Karen Wilhoyt, Nathan Hall, Fred Ludwig, Ashley Jones, Emily Lane, Carolyn R.P., Jackie Smith, Carissa Casey, Kim Dietz, Andy Wilhoyt. And we received email comments from the people who submitted their questions. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we're going to read them now. So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points So we've got a few other points two things. One, can we ban? And two is, should we ban? Can you do a quick summary on should we ban? North Valley harm reduction is based on the idea of harm reduction. The question that nobody's asking is, what harm and what harm are they trying to reduce? The main mission of Northern Valley is to reduce blood-borne pathogens, primarily HIV and Hep C. However, the harm of the addiction itself far supersedes the harm associated with HIV. We had nine cases of HIV in Butte County last year. There are 20 million people in the United States that have substance abuse. We had 70,000 fatalities for opioid overdose. The opioid epidemic has far exceeded the casualties associated with COVID, even if you accept the CDC's inflated numbers. Thank you. It's been over half a million people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Corey, followed by Afec. Puka. Puka. Robin Engel. Nicole Nava. Hello again, City Council. I heard a lot about several people mentioned seeking remuneration for the needle or syringe litter. And I'm wondering why no one has brought up seeking remuneration from the city council. I'm wondering why no one has brought up seeking remuneration from the city council? Well, I think the city council had to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame on the city council for having to throw the blame individuals as yourselves and not rather than being primarily the responsibility of public health officials and the people who are more educated and have specialized spent their lives specializing in these topics I personally am kind of mystified as to why certain members of City Council seem so intent on banning a program that reduces the amount of blood-borne diseases on the street and in the community of Chico at large because not all drug users are homeless so it's not we're not just talking about the homeless population there's all sorts of people that were helped by this program when while it was running banning needle exchanges banning needles works does not work at all prohibition you can prohibit needles from here to kingdom come there are still going to be needles people are going to get them people are going to feed their addictions unless they have the support that they need to quit one of the I think most important things that NBHRC provides is dignity people are treated with dignity and respect no matter where they are where whenever how they're showing up and that's there's something that's that's the long game it's the long view this is you know it's a long game it's a long view it's a long game it's a long view this is not a short-term problem and it doesn't need a short-term solution like what's being proposed also the some of the services they also provide food they're providing COVID education to the street community that may not have necessarily the same access to the kind of public health knowledge that most of us have access to and that's in masks and that's important and I hope that you will consider this very carefully and take the time that it deserves for this extremely important decision that affects this community so so strongly thank you Corey Corey give me a moment an answer to your question you asked why we're not seeking remuneration from from some of the opioid distributors there is a lawsuit underway and and we're a party to that lawsuit so we are seeking that but I appreciate you bringing up pharmacies because that may allow and add some some enhanced encouragement if you will to help us with this problem and one question did you remember what you which you were thinking about speaking it at the last time you thanks a lot so it is effect hookah and I apologize if I mispronounce that name and Robin Engle Nicole Nava followed by angel McLaughlin Good evening. My name is pronounced Afaf Pooja. Thank you. Maybe it was my handwriting. So I've come to speak, obviously, about the needle exchange. As of the last reported numbers, from my knowledge, Butte County has 250% more deaths related to opioids than the rest of the state. Those are actual people's lives that are lost, lives that you're supposed to represent. This is an epidemic we've been fighting much longer than COVID. In fact, between 2014 and 2016, more people have died from drug-related incidences than from car accidents, gun-related deaths, and homicide combined. These are completely preventable deaths that are on our hands as a community. It's unavoidable to talk about drug abuse and homelessness, as many other people. It's a problem that other people have brought together. They're not the same thing, but they go hand in hand many of the time, along with mental health. So, they say, people, critics of the needle exchange say that it creates a safety concern in the community. And I want to ask them how many people have to lose their lives if their only problem is littering. If littering is the only problem, let's tackle littering as the problem, rather than banning an essential service, to people who require it. You can find countless scientific studies, so I'm not going to bore you with details. You can just search on Google, and as the presentation before us very eloquently told you guys. But I see a value in Northern Valley, that they have a direct connection to the people affected by the opioid pandemic, whatever you want to call it. There are hour-long lines that come and wait for needle exchanges and the resources that they provide. These are hundreds of people that are spoken to directly as people. And they are your constituents, they are our neighbors. And they need to be treated as such, not just as throwaways. So, I'm extremely happy that the people against Northern Valley, have not experienced, hopefully have not experienced, the damage that drug abuse and homelessness can cause. And as someone who has recovered from opioid use, I want to say that I've witnessed the damages and the mental health effects that come along with drug abuse, and how valuable it is to talk to someone on a weekly basis, is a kind of luxury that I couldn't have imagined when I was struggling myself. And I want to point out that that is also a crucial value that Northern Valley provides. Not only sterile needles, but a place to talk and to learn and to improve your life. Thank you. Robin Engle, Nicole Nava, Angela McLaughlin, and Jessica Giannola. Good evening, Council. I was here months ago when we heard from experts like Dr. Lindsay Briggs, Dr. Miller, and we heard about the volumes of evidence-based research in favor of harm reduction and this needle distribution program as a means for staving another mental health and public health crisis in our community. That's the last thing we need is another catastrophe. So I am fully in support of moving forward with the needle distribution program. And I want to say that I think a lot of the response, the pushback, even some of which we're still hearing tonight, has a basis in fear. And I get that. I understand that. I'm afraid of needles and I'm afraid of drugs myself. I've had to work through my own issues about drugs and needles because I'm afraid of needles. But my clients have needed me to. So I had a client, for example, who lost her home in the Paradise campfire. And she's been seeing me since then. She has relapsed since then with the current fires that put her into PTSD mode. I'm supporting her through that by, as we've heard, by giving her dignity and respect. And that is really the only way to help people achieve their full potential. It's the only way for us to work together and come to a better world. And that's the only way to help people achieve their place as a community. So I think it's also the only way to combat our own fears, is to look eye to eye with these people that we tend to judge and look down upon and talk with them and realize that they are us. All of us have our own addictions. I know mine is sugar, for example, sugar and chocolate. And yours might be booze. It might be nicotine. It might be, I don't know, artichokes. But we all do have addictions. We're all human. We're all infallible. And until we accept this and see each other as equals, we won't get to a better place. I really like everything I've heard tonight about dignity and respect. And I want to suggest that there is absolutely, there has to be a compromise solution that feels at least okay to everyone. For one thing, 24-hour drop-off locations where people can come in, where people can go anonymously to drop off the needles. That's a great idea that I heard from Marin. And I think that could be easily implemented. There are certainly other ways of managing the needles. And I want to say that I've been in the parks a lot doing cleanup and volunteer outreach. I found a George Foreman grill. I found an office chair. Those are more than $150. Anyway, those were dumped by people who are homeless. Those were clearly dumped by people who have resources. Thank you very much. Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Angela McLaughlin. My name was used by NVHRC tonight, which is against the rules. You did not call for a point of order. And to me, that is a fail, Mayor. This is not an exchange program. A similar program in Eureka had a recent sting operation with alleged evidence of collusion between the needle providers and the addicts for drug sales and usage on site. That program cheerleads for NVHRC. Their evidence-based data only focuses on a drug-using population and not the collateral damage done. They have historically used dated studies. Lies were told tonight by NVHRC. They pretend to listen and failed to keep their promises to me on our two-hour Zoom call. I had a friend present, and we captured the action items agreed to. While we kept our agreement, they violated all but one of theirs. As you know, an officer, a BCSO, and a landscaper were pricked by dirty needles. A baby was stabbed in the face with a needle. At least one needle tested positive for hep C. Multiple kids have picked up dirty needles that weren't stuck yet. Tens to hundreds of thousands of dirty needles are left all over our community and in Butte County. The dirty needles are found in creeks, parks, our grassy soccer fields where hundreds of children play soccer, and at the schools, our plaza, retail centers, and at daycares. We've done complaints to EPA and OSHA. The violations occurred as follows. Sharp's biohazard containers were given out, don't equal capacity, equal to the number of needles they hand out to the individuals. Therefore, the delta of those contaminated needles, ends up in our community. Children pick them up not understanding the dangers of contracting a blood-borne pathogen. NBHRC has staff and volunteers picking up dirty needles barehanded. This has been captured on video multiple times, and they were in front of news stations when they did it as well. NBHRC doesn't have capacity to pick up the dirty needle waste. They have introduced it at a much greater velocity into our community. Their response time via an unmanned Google number is an atrocious number. It is a risk that a community member or pet will be stuck by a dirty needle, or that the needles will wash down our creeks and rivers and further pollute our environment for years to come. They do not accurately track what actions are taken, counts, referrals to services, community outreach, complaints from the community. There are audio and video recordings of their activities, and they are not meeting their mandates. There is suspicion they would falsify the records to pacify the state to retain their permit. This community requires outside intervention. The City Council has not directed a ban. We have filed complaints with many, as I have stated, and we have held safety protests with hundreds of people here. We had petitioned with almost 15,000 signatures. And you are standing on your own political and your personal ideologies and not listening to the thousands upon thousands upon thousands of constituents who thankfully will get to vote this November 3rd. Angela McClain. I am Angela McClain, followed by Jessica Giannola. Hi again. I actually wanted to first just comment and say how much I appreciated the presentation from NVHRC. That was one of the most rational, informative conversations I think the community has seen about this issue. And I actually really appreciated the introduction. And I appreciate the entire Council's questions. So thank you all. A couple of things. I would really like to see us, you know, this goes back to 2018. Randall requested that we look at addressing syringe litter. This is not a new problem. One of the obvious things that we can do is to put dispensers or dispensers, to put syringe disposal containers all over. Make it easy to do the right thing. It's simple. There are lots of ways that we can do this effectively. It sounds like NVHRC is willing to be active, good partners on this and make sure that that litter is picked up. So let's make it simple to do the right thing. And part two or part three of this is I would love to see this conversation go on. I don't think there is a rush to vote on this. There are a lot of questions about whether or not you can actually ban the syringe exchange. As far as I'm understanding, we're probably, if NVHRC applied again tomorrow, we're six months out or more if they have to go through CEQA. There's no rush on this. We're getting, it feels like we're getting good information. This felt like some progress today. So I would really love to see you guys think it over. Aside from doing, you know, a few obvious things. Again, like disposal, syringe disposal containers is obvious. But other than that, there isn't a rush on this. That's it. Thank you. Jessica Giannola followed by Jeff Crean. Okay. I had to write this one down because I want to forget something. First, I'm going to go through the process. I feel like it's really important that we, as a collective unit, acknowledge that we have an opioid addiction problem in our area. And that it existed before NVHRC program existed. Like people said, it's been going on for years. We cannot ban the addiction crisis out of our town by banning the needle program. And doing nothing, taking that safe stance of doing nothing, saying I don't want it here. It's not going to make it go away. It's still here. We have a responsibility to do something. Partner with our resources like NVHRC so that we can move forward and make life better for everybody. We need a strong partnership. The city and the community hear what the opposition is saying. They don't want needles in our park. So let's find a place besides the park. They are hurting. They do have family members who have gone through addiction problems, have lost them. They're in prison. They are hurting. That's the stance they are coming from. They're asking for help. And their idea, because they think this is the only answer, is get the needles out of here. This is how we're going to help our people. But the needles are still out there. NVHRC is not the only one. There's the addiction problem that still exists. It's PTSD related. PTSD like crazy right now. Imagine how many people are using. Without the needle program, they're not getting clean needles. So they're using dirty needles. When you take away access, free access to clean needles, you create a black market. People will collect them. And if we had, say, an exchange, one for one. People will collect them to exchange them for the clean one. Someone's going to steal theirs. What are they going to use then? They're going to reuse one they find. They're going to go and prostitute their body to try and get one from somebody who has them. Or spend the only money they have to buy another one. They're not going to just stop because they don't have access to a clean one. They'll reuse. And then we have with NVHRC, they do testing. They do testing for Hep C, HIV, you get on the list. And just in a three month period with Hep C, 50% of the people tested had Hep C. They're not getting clean needles now. They're reusing. So that is in our community. And it's not just people who use injection drugs who have and spread Hep C or any of the items. Any of the diseases. People sleep with whoever or have contact with somebody and it spreads in the community like that. We need to have the clean needles because that reduces the risks for everybody. A used one does bend. Bacteria and disease is caught in the bend of the needle when it's reused. So someone else using someone else's is then going to get that into their body or an officer patting somebody down if it's a used one. They're at a higher risk of actually getting stuck with a virus infected needle versus a clean one. We need to stop sites. 20th Street Park. That's a good one. Jeff Creed followed by Mike Jensen. So much to say, so little time. There's my timer. Thankfully I'm not Rob Berry. He got the chef tonight. So if you're at home, I want you to take note of what happened in the last presentation. The presenter had 10 minutes. Ann Schwab interrupted, kicked everybody outside so the people waiting couldn't hear the presentation. And then she gave the presenter more time. Kind of like last month when she was talking about the how veterans need their access to marijuana. Now I don't know of her being a veteran authority or a veteran designated speaker. I've never heard of veterans having problems getting pot. I have heard of veterans getting pot. I've heard of veterans having problems getting jobs. And our veteran speak, you know, designated speaker of a mayor didn't say anything two weeks prior when the presenter, who obviously got, also got prejudiced time, did nothing but disgrace, disparage, and demean veterans as he said they weren't fit for work in law enforcement. Not a single council member that I heard spoke up in defense of veterans who need pot. And I don't know of any of these people who are going to be able to get jobs. That is a legitimate veteran issue. And I don't know of marijuana access being a veteran issue. I'm sorry, I've only been a veteran for 10 years. So maybe I'm too new to the problem. So, NDHRC said that their program is fueled by pain and trauma, their own personal pain and trauma. Do people in pain and trauma make good rational decisions? I don't think so. That's just my opinion. But I think I could probably support that with statistical data if I had to. So they talked a lot about following science, following numbers. I didn't hear a single number from them. Whenever they cited somebody, they didn't cite a specific city. They didn't cite any cities. They said most. They said many. They said all. It was all hogwash. And you all bit it hook, line, and sinker. And then we have our city lawyer who again displayed his own bias. How did he not sit down with Rob Berry two months ago and talk about this so at least they were on the same page as lawyers? That just seems criminally negligent to me. But I'm not a lawyer so I can't make that allegation, I guess. So if you're at home, you need to take away what I'm trying to get you to take away. Is these people intentionally plan the destruction of Chico? And this is another good example. And this is another good example. And if you really want to help people who are addicted, you get them help. You don't give them more access to drugs and needles. That's called codependency. That is counterproductive to addiction recovery. And I don't know how that word hasn't been mentioned all night. Thank you. Disgraceful. Mike Jensen is our last speaker on this item. And I think we'll ask one. Of course, I'll entertain questions. I'm not really well versed on this controversy, but I'll get back to the numbers. I don't know which way it's going to go. I don't know if the state's going to win. I don't know if Diggs has more validity than Marysville. And, you know, let's get, I mean, we're going to have some statistical numbers from public health. We're going to have some hepatitis results since February or last November. We're going to have some numbers. I wish you all well. I, you know, there are incidents of hepatitis. There are diabetics. There are loose needles. I guess if I was going to advocate, I would, you know, I would say you could have a box, an unbreakable box at some of the pharmacies. Inside and out. You can, I think people need to communicate better. I think there could be more communication with people that are lonely and, you know, whatever, have a problem with this or that. I'm trying to not smoke because I've got enough smoke in the air. Again, let's just look at the numbers. And I don't know. I don't, I'll tell you this. I don't think there's a shitload of needles from here on the ground. I'm on the creek and it's going up the bike path, past one mile to the freeway. I don't think there are very many. And I'm on the ground out there. Next time I come here, I'll bring my park watch. I've got a minute left. Anybody have any? I mean, we have leaves out there by the plaza like this. This is not Southern California, Washington State. Things are getting burned up. So I like the word dignity. That's the word of the day, too. There is an aspect of dignity here. I'll excuse myself. Thank you. So we'll close the public hearing. And if it's okay, we'll take just a short five-minute break. Will the next koala be back to the koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala koala of 5.1, heard public comment, and now looking for some council direction. So I have some thoughts whenever you're ready, but I wasn't sure you were finished. I'm finished. Thank you. So I really did appreciate, which will shock many people, North Valley Harm Reductions presentation. I learned a lot of things. I think that their heart is without a doubt in the right place. I think the way they're going about it is probably wrong. I absolutely think that the cost to the community outweigh the benefits. I'm not saying that there aren't benefits. Just because someone uses the word evidence-based doesn't mean that it is because people frequently use that term and then don't offer any statistics. Unlike myself when I gave them for the marijuana ordinance. What I did here was give us more time, give us more time, give us more resources. Give us places to throw the 10,000 plus needles we're bringing into the city on a weekly basis somewhere. I don't know how many sharps containers that would actually take. So, and I said this last time when I brought up my request to ban the needle exchange program or distribution program altogether. I agree with Council Member Stone's request. Whether North Valley Harm Reduction made this worse, which I think that's a given. It was certainly there before. We have to stop the bleeding. It needs to stop getting worse before we're going to get to the point where we can start to make it better. And I think part of that is following in the lines of our sister or brother or whatever you call it, municipalities in Oroville and Paradise and Biggs and Gridley. And I certainly understand the city attorney's concerns and he is there to protect us to do whatever needs to be done. But I think it's clear that it is possible for us to write an ordinance prohibiting the establishment of such a use however that may be done. I think we've got the Oroville, Gridley, Biggs, various different municipalities have passed their own ordinances and I would make a motion that we direct the city attorney to do the same. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr Mr the ideas behind the goals that the North Harm Reduction Coalition wants to do are noble, and I think they benefit our community. However, I don't think that operationally it's working in our community. Increased number of needles, not having a site, not being funded correctly. I, of anyone, know the value of volunteers, but I also know that a successful organization can't depend solely on volunteers. Someone that can't answer the phone and go right out to identify where those needles are, someone having a site for it, having someone that coordinates it. I think that the harm that's being done to our community is one of the most vulnerable things to be having to deal with. worse than not having a fully operationalized program that benefits from the community. So my question to you is, do you see some type of ordinance that might allow a needle distribution program that had standards in place, that if you operate, you need to have a brick and mortar location? If you operate, you need to be able to pick up needles. If you operate, you need to provide statistics to the city. You need to do these. So it needs to be located in certain places. You have to have proven funding, not just these dreams. So I'm going to stop there. So instead of a, I guess maybe this is a question to the city attorney, instead of just an outright ban, what if Butte County Public Health wanted to open a program or partner with a program? So let's say we win this lawsuit against the opiate manufacturers. Could the city help with that? Because that certainly would be that part of outreach and mental health. Addiction services. Could we look at creating an ordinance that would allow a well run program instead of just an outright ban? So if I can answer some of those and then we can turn over to the city attorney. It was 2018, I think. 2019 it might have been. At the state of the city when we talked about, you know, act accountability and compassion together and the first idea of the renewal center came forward and lower kutona and the jesus center were going to do all these things and centralized services because they were fragmented and in a perfect world with all those non-profits working together which i don't believe will ever happen because they're all in competition for the same dollar but in a perfect world if that happened and we had wraparound services and that was a place where an addict or whatever could go and get a clean needle but they had to get services in a perfect world absolutely but here's the problem for me on what you're suggesting ideas are a dime a dozen they've got two pages of ideas oh we got this idea we got this idea we got this idea we got this idea okay i made this lecture today to my students my strategy students ideas are a dime a dozen execution is all that matters i don't care about your ideas i see what's happening in the community i appreciate that you don't have any evidence other than the fact that you're not doing anything to say evidence because it sounds good because i all i heard was 10 000 needles and i went in what kind of community that we care about our employees our families our young people does that make sense and my and then one other thing and you talked about the volunteers and i appreciate what i do appreciate what the volunteers are trying to do i don't think these are evil people and i might have had my mind actually changed a little bit i used to be on a church board and this church was downtown chico the church i got married in and they wanted to open a a coffee house run by volunteers actually guys this is never going to work starbucks is a block away you'll never beat these people they know exactly what they're doing volunteers are great i think volunteer programs are great i love people that volunteer this is what we're all doing up here i don't see them pulling it off anytime in the near future so my fear about what you're asking me or schwab is that if we leave the door open they will continue to stick their nose through it so what i would like to see is that van is that prohibition of use in any way shape or form and if they come back and it's part of the renewal center or some kind of wraparound service then we can look at you know what we can set aside our ordinance because you have a program but until that they're going to come keep coming back with ideas and ideas and ideas and volunteers and keep pushing and keep pushing until it's good i think it's bad so i absolutely appreciate where you're coming from but right now i'm a hard no you're welcome i'll be i'll be i'll be i'll be i'll be i'll be i'll be i'll be i'll be i'll be i'll be months. And instead you want to, and I get it where you want to bring us to places where we haven't gone before, but the last time you did this, it cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars after a frivolous lawsuit that, you know, because we were going down this path of suggesting that we were better than state referendum law. And we were, you know, it cost us. It cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars because of those actions that were taken in closed session by you and your fellow council members. And I hear that exactly tonight now. Let's do a feel-good thing, just like a feel-good thing of fighting the referendum. Let's, you know, let's put us on the side of right by putting together a law that is not been challenged. We would be the first if the IPA program was re-established here. Why not let somebody else lead forward? If somebody else has a syringe exchange program in their community, they adopt an ordinance because they actually have a program and then are challenged by the state or challenges the state, we'll join them if we want, or at least they'll be setting a precedent. But no, we're supposed to be the ones. That lead forward and hire, you know, devote our law firm to taking this on. So, you know, it's the right time of year for this kind of yes or no kind of action rather than doing what we have. We have, I was prepared tonight, I was prepared four months ago and it took this long to get here to support the environmental quality, review process. After having read the LA Times article in detail about what happened in Orange County, it was clear to me that the state erred in not providing an environmental review. They knew. The Orange County decision came down a month before they issued the permit locally. They knew this. You know, I think the state failed in a lot of other different ways. So I'm going to offer a substitute motion that we can make a motion that we engage and comment with the state public health environmental quality review process with a focus on public safety and that we direct the city attorney to review all local ordinances and report to the council any cases of any challenges to the state supremacy. So, Madam Mayor, if I may. So, first of all, Mr. Ory, I don't think most of the people in the cloud or wherever they are knew what you were referring to. I would be glad to articulate if you would. Well, I actually think you're projecting when you're looking at me saying you're, you know, pursuing emotional feel-good initiatives. As far as the city attorney goes, we've given him plenty of things to do. And as far as waiting for another municipality, plenty of other municipalities have done it. So maybe it'll happen there, maybe it won't. But it doesn't need to be here. Let them attack some other municipality. We can stop it now and we should. Because forget all the research, all this. It's what's right for this community. This is crazy. Tens of thousands of needles. They admitted it. We're giving them out, we're giving them out, we're giving them out. Who is this good for? We hear former drug addicts saying, you're just enabling people. You shouldn't be doing these things. I don't understand your logic. So, no, I won't support your motion. Mr. Ory, could you restate that? I didn't catch it all. That we engage and comment with the state public health environmental quality review. Yes. With a focus on public safety. And that we ask the city attorney to continue to review all local ordinances and report to the council any cases of any challenges to the state supremacy law. Councillor Ory, I'm assuming you say city attorney review all local ordinances relating to syringe bans. Yes. So, I just wanted to comment a little bit. I completely understand Council Member Morgan where you're coming from. I hear it loud and clear from a section of the community. Yes. And I think it's important that we have a conversation about this. I share many of the concerns. You mentioned early on in this conversation, I think during whatever it was, A through D, you brought up the word balance. And I think that balance is an important consideration. One of the things that I feel like we run into fairly often, we have with COVID certainly, is that there are instances when health guidelines, when things that seem to be proven or shown to be effective, conflict with community standards. I think that problem's been around for a long time. So, when I go to the CDC website on needle exchanges, do needle exchange programs work? They say SSPs, needle exchange programs or distribution programs, help people overcome substance use disorders. If people who inject drugs use SSP, they are more likely to enter treatment for substance use disorder and reduce or stop injecting. A Seattle study found that new users of SSPs, were five times as likely to enter drug treatment programs as those who didn't use the programs, which is exactly what Marin said earlier. That's from the CDC. We have the same issues with the CDC over COVID guidelines. And the CDC says one thing and the community says other things. I happen to think that there's, as I often do, that there's a middle ground. Going back to balance. I see where there's a benefit to any community for there being an opportunity to have these interactions with people who are addicted to drugs. And that these sort of programs allow that interaction and that's what increases the likelihood that those people are going to enter drug treatment programs. But I do feel like what was happening before was, you know, there's two audiences we're trying to serve. We're trying to help people avoid getting blood borne diseases. We're also trying to help them out of addiction. But we can't ignore that there's community members who are addicted to drugs. We can't ignore that there's community members who are potentially impacted by needle litter, needle sticks, and that sort of thing. So, you know, early on I felt that an exchange was more optimal than a distribution program. I understand that the efficacy of an exchange is not as good. However, I think sometimes we have to compromise. To balance that community standards with health guidelines and health results. So, I am not in favor of an outright ban because I think that at some point in the future there may be a program that comes along that we can structure with the sort of ingredients that we want to it. Which might include sharps containers. It might include exchange rather than just simple distribution. It might include sort of a more robust referral system to drug treatment programs. I'd like to think that we can do this program correctly in the future. And so I don't want to write it off now by banning the possibility that one could happen in the future. But that's how we have to work. Motion that it has not been seconded. Is there a second? So, do you offer an alternative to the motion on the floor? No. . On Mr. Morgan's motion. Yes. Yes. Yes. So Council Member Huber, you did second that? No. I didn't think so. Okay, so it failed due to a lack of a second. Okay. I just didn't know if I had missed that. So back to... Let me get back there. A motion by Council Member Morgan, seconded by Council Member Reynolds for a complete ban. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ory? No. Council Member Reynolds? Yes. Council Member Stone? Nay. Vice Mayor Brown? No. Mayor Schwab? Aye. If it fails, 3-4. I'd like to make a motion to direct staff to come forward with a report on what we're capable of in terms of cleaning, what are some of the things that we're capable of and what are some options to fund that, both from a community standpoint as well as a municipal standpoint. That's not an approval of that, of course. That's bringing back a report to let us know, not sending it to Internal Affairs. It will die or pass it on to the county. I want real actionable items that the city and or the community can engage in to clean up the needle debris. That could include, and by no means am I demanding this, but it could include... It could include pharmacy resources, municipal sites, and it sounds like there's a willing participant to engage in the cleanups on our behalf, at least picking those up, rather than subjecting that to our public works staff. That was my motion, was for staff to bring back this report for concepts and ideas. Yes. You got it. Cleanup only, not... Thank you. A tough one to shake out on that one for a second. We've been down this road before. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. And Natalie, you don't have to get too excited about celebrating over that. Bad joke. Are we ready to move on to our next item? I don't know. Okay. We have several items in closed session tonight. We want to respect Council's wishes to adjourn the meeting by 10 o'clock. Are there any items that are left on the agenda? 5.2? 5.2? 5.3? That... 5.4 that need to be heard tonight? The sewer debt refinancing, which is the next item, is time sensitive. Okay. Would we... If we didn't hear them tonight, can we hear them next week? I'm in. And have Ms. Martin speak to that. I know that it's... With the market, it's very time sensitive. Yeah. We are on a... A bit of a timeline because approval from Council for this tonight kind of starts the next pieces in terms of putting the paperwork out there for pricing and timing the market right. And then we're looking to close on if it's approved, the refinancing on the 14th of October or thereabouts. So we do have some time sensitive items. I don't anticipate this taking long. No, I was going to ask how many comments... It doesn't look like we had any comments. Do we have any speakers? Okay. So if it's okay, we'll hear this item. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, everybody, Mayor and members of Council. Mr. Dowell couldn't be with us tonight, but he is on WebEx. And we also have Mark Northcross from NHA Advisors and Teresa Hoyorano from Richards, Botts, and Gershon also attending via WebEx. They've been instrumental in this process. And if there are any questions about any of the paperwork, they can assist... help facilitate that. Back in May, you were provided a presentation on the potential savings the city could achieve by refinancing the State Water Board loans that we have that we issued to have improvements out at our wastewater treatment plant. Before you tonight are the proposed official documents related to the bond issuance for that refinancing. Currently, we are estimating an interest rate of approximately 0.83% on these bonds. And that would provide about $160,000 savings for the sewer enterprise. There are three loans currently with the State Water Resources Control Board. There's a 2001 loan that is scheduled for final payment this fiscal year anyway. It's actually scheduled for final payment in October. And then there's this 2008 loan, which has just under a $24 million balance that we will be hoping to refinance. And then we have a 2009 loan that has a balance, a balance of approximately $1.8 million. And with this refinancing, we're looking to pay that loan off with cash on hand in the sewer fund. We're paying off all three loans. If we do pay off all the loans with the state, we'll be releasing approximately $4 million in required reserve amounts in our sewer reserve fund. And the plan to do with those monies is to maintain them in the reserve for future capital improvements. As part of the plan, the city presented information to S&P so that we could get a rating for the sewer enterprise. We just got word this afternoon and we are happy to report that we obtained a AA negative rating for them. This will give us a very good rate when it comes to the bond issues. And given the current economic climate, this rate is a very good determination. So with that, we are requesting that you authorize the issuance of the loan to the city sale and delivery of sewer revenue bonds as outlined in the staff report and all of the related documents that are in there. Do you have any questions? Are there questions? Verify again that there are no speakers for this item. Okay, so looking for direction from council. Move to approve. So I have a motion and a second. We have roll call vote. Council member Huber? Yes. Council member Morgan? Yes. Council member Horry? Aye. Council member Reynolds? Aye. Council member Stone? Aye. Vice mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 7-0. So if item 5.2 and 5.4 are not time sensitive, excuse me, 5.3 and 5.4 are not time sensitive, we will hear. Uh, reports and communication and then go into closed session so that we can complete our meeting by 10 o'clock. And we will bring these items back at the next meeting. Is that the, what I understand? Item 5.3 and 4? Yes. I have a question. Point of order. Can I ask a quick question, Ms. Schwab? Yes. I thought it was we were taking, we've always done no taking up more business out here until 10 o'clock. Can we not just finish these two items? I'm not saying I want to be here super late, but on a special meeting where we've got a lot of stuff to cover on homeless, I, we've got a lot of information for next meeting, so I would be okay staying if anybody else is. I was, um, interpreting that we should do our best to finish by 10 o'clock. Um, but if council would like to hear these next two items and go into closed session at 10 o'clock, then we can do that. What direction does council want to go? That's what they, they want to know. State B&P 1010 says. It doesn't say pull the council. It says at 10 o'clock stop hearing new stuff and be done. And go into closed session? That's what it says. Okay. Then we will continue on with these next two items. 5.3, a consideration of draft intergovernmental cooperative agreement with the Chico Area Recreation and Park District card for the coordinated park services and facilities. We have a report from Eric Gustafson, public works director, O&M. And Linda Herman. Actually, it's me. Sorry. And I'll be brief. Um, back in 2019, 2010, we entered into an agreement with the Chico Park and Recreation District to kind of look at cooperative programs and see how we can have efficiencies in providing services in the Chico area. That, that, um, agreement's been, it's pretty old. And so the council approved an ad hoc committee, appointed an ad hoc committee between, to meet with the card board to look at re, revising that document and looking and see if there's other ways that we could cooperate. Umm, the city attorney had to be the vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice services. And it also redefines our roles and responsibilities or restates our roles and responsibilities between the two entities. It has a mechanism now to transfer community park development impact fee funds, not fees, funds to CARD since they are the only entity that's really building community parks. The city's not in the community park business. It also provides a mechanism to transfer where appropriate and where applicable the neighborhood park funds that are and we just did that with the Centennial Park that they're going to be building in the northwest area. And then it provides a method to transfer neighborhood parks through the development process. We used to do that. Peterson Park in my neighborhood is one of the ones where the city would involve in the development process where the developer would build the park. CARD would develop a mechanism to fund it similar to our maintenance district. It could be a landscaping and lighting district or some other mechanism. And then once the park was developed we would deed that park to CARD because again we want, we're in the neighborhood park business for a while but decided it wasn't something we wanted. We as a city wanted to continue. So CARD would just be able to, it just sets up that mechanism again that we would go through that process early on in the development process so that they can be part of the design and decide what things they could maintain and also to provide funding for the maintenance of those parks. So before you is the draft agreement and what I'm asking is that you approve the draft and then we'll be able to do that. And then authorize the city manager to facilitate the execution of the final draft of CARD. Okay. Any questions? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So how many people communicated with us electronically? I believe we did receive I think five. We did. We did receive ten comments on the Engage Chico platform and we have two speakers in person. So we'll review the submitted comments while you read the names and cue the folks and the people speaking can address us for three minutes each. Okay. Okay. Okay. So the comments were received from Jessica Haggard, Margaret Hicks, Julie Threat, Nicole Nava, Claudette Ritter, Ashley Jones, Jackie Smith, Jessica Giannola, and Jeff Creed. I also need the additional time. Let's cue up our first speaker. Okay. First speaker is Nicole Nava, followed by Jeff Creed. Okay. Okay. Good evening. So I love CARD. I grew up doing pretty much anything you can imagine with CARD and have been watching how the City does things. And so I'm glad to see you're revisiting an MOU and folding in things. But I thought I would note a couple of things that I think are important to this community that have to do with the Parks, with card and I get the card has jurisdiction over certain things and City Parks has jurisdiction over others. I think the elephant in the room when you work on things is how to work on evicting illegal campers and working with those individuals to do things. Again, happening on the 22nd to have conversations, this is a good thing. They need help. It's smoky, it gets hot, it's gonna get cold. We want to be humane and get them somewhere but the somewhere should not be our parks. Continually enforce that knowing no camping and this should be part of agreements. It shouldn't just be what City Parks is doing. Card, card struggles too. You should be working on citing anybody that is lighting fires in these parks. It's happening in the neighborhood parks too and so there people need to be attentive to this. Then there needs to be like a massive and thorough cleanup and I would be overjoyed to participate in something like that when I know we have a plan and that it's going to continue. I think you're finding your city will be willing when they're ready to go. Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm You guys can be effective on both sides of the mirror because let's face it, to the community, they don't see CARD and the city. I talked to Ann Willman, and that is a continual struggle with who does what, where do we call, who reports what. So it's really important that this covers all of us. There needs to be performing of timely maintenance and not letting things slide. We don't want these areas to look tired and get run down. We want kids to be able to play there again. So I feel like some of this, I know you're working on a lot of fiscal things to do with this, but I thought this is a good opportunity because it is the MOU and talking about how you're going to do business together. Improving the ambiance of these parks by catering to taxpayers and not just people that are camping there illegally. You know, Cape Reckless needs a big landscape makeover. He did a great job with the buildings, but it needs more. The park needs some improved signage and things like that in areas near CARD too. So I think that's a good opportunity. So I would love to see some security happen, you guys. We need more security. And just, I think we need to partner with CARD and be transparent at all times and acknowledge these problems so that we can move forward together. Call me for a cleanup when we're ready. Thank you. Jeff Creed is our last speaker. Jeff Creed is our last speaker. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I go to CARD. We can't do anything. We can't cite people. I go to city parks. That's not our property. We can't do it. So this is just, you know, I appreciate the need for CARD, but as a citizen, it's just another runaround for the city council to create loopholes to create, that's not my job. That's not my job. That's not my job. And so I had to go and get the property lines and prove that it was actually city property and go back to the police Chief and go look this three feet five feet is County and that was a whole argument that took months and took me Doing the leg route leg work to go back and prove that hey that actually is your job So when you transfer these parks to CART Who's their siting authority if I'm out there drinking a beer who's gonna come write me a ticket? Is it the security guard from CART? Do they have that authority? Do they write those tickets? How many infractions have been written in city parks in the last year the last decade and when we go and we look at other Cities in California, let's do that five up five down or ten up ten down Let's see how many infractions have been written in their parks You know if you want to report from if you want to waste councils time with a report about needle Cleanups, let's let's have a report on that Because you know all this stems back to a lack of the City Council doing its job when you drive into Marysville before you hit That trussle there's a big sign no camping allowed and they don't have these problems do they? They don't have needles in the parks. They don't have campers in the parks. They don't have stolen bikes in the parks so it all comes back to the fact that you set up a system where You're not doing your job and you've done this for decades. It's not just this council and I've said this for four years I've been up here saying you know, it's the council's Before you none of you picked up the ball and ran with it to make a change for the future None of you are looking forward to make Chico better three five or ten years from now, and it's disgusting and it's tiring It's very very tiring because when I look at it, and you're gonna see I'm gonna lay it out Just how bad you failed in the future weeks Yeah So close the hearing and look for direction from Council I'd move approval I think I was on this committee I Wanted to comment on two things though, thank you I Went into the committee with a question and of Making sure that our park rangers could also operate in card facilities And I think the message it would been a couple months now was that thanks, but no thanks We got it covered I think maybe they're using private security or maybe there is an issue about using park rangers But if there is an issue about using park rangers in all parks and Creek ways I would hope that would come back and be part of the NEMU or future discussion The second part is An open council meeting a while back and that this committee meeting I argued that we really need to look at Having one entity having card manage all of our parks There is resistance from staff that I appreciated that you know, there's a bit of pride that we can do this but I Bring it up again today because of the fiscal crisis that we're going to be facing at least for the next couple of years That that needs to be back on the table as we just run a out of money that we need to find ways that we can consolidate and run more efficiently and so I Want to mention that that also came up at this meeting and I had support we had a real good discussion going there for a while with One of the myself and one of the card directors, but ultimately the committee chose not to pursue that at this time So we do have a motion to approve and that was Council member Ori and seconded by council member Huber. Is that correct? Council member Huber Council member Morgan council member Ori Council member Reynolds council member stone vice mayor Brown mayor Schwab carry 7-0 Have item 5.4 Council member Huber recalls City and County Intergovernmental agency meeting frequency Yeah, thank you this seems like I brought this up another lifetime ago back in March And we all know what's happened since then so it's understandable that it took a while to get back to it but at that time my thinking was that there are so many issues that can be I think much better addressed by a combination of the city and the county And I've met with and I'm sure everybody here has probably met with some of our supervisors before and I've really felt a Belief from them as well that more collaboration between the city and the county Would be beneficial so that city and county Intergovernmental I'm not sure what the name of that committee is that meets right now it meets quarterly Is that what it is local government committee or commission? You know I'd like to see it meet more often number one and my understanding I had a conversation last night with supervisor Lucero my understanding is that a Number of the sort of topics that I think that it could be addressing she brought up fires fire prevention fire services that sort of thing Her and I had spoken in the past just off the record or just in her own casual meetings about addiction services dealing with addiction At a larger level and also mental health problems all of those could be issues that this Commissioner committee could deal with to To better ends than what we've been able to do just as a city or just as a county So I did have a message from her tonight that she asked me to share This is supervisor Lucero. She said please let them know I am totally in support of more frequent meetings six per year to start And more robust public discussions on how we currently partner and how we can expand our partnerships to leverage leverage resources So I Guess my what I'd like to see happen or I'll make a motion that we increase the number of Meetings of this group and that Well, I don't quite know how to direct their agenda But I think just a more frequent meeting would lead to To work on some of the issues that they could be addressing that they haven't been able to yet I'll second the motion however There's probably some logistical issues with that the types of issues that the local government committee and I'm chair of that committee the types of issues that we've worked on have been exactly the ones that you just defined we've had North Valley harm reduction and syringe programs at least twice in 2019 Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm Umm And that makes it a little bit challenging because the makeup of the council, or excuse me, the makeup of the board of supervisors is not matched with the effective outcome within the city of Chico. So we have, it's the local government committee is the staff between the county and the city who meet very, very frequently, if not just daily, in all capacities, whether that's public works or otherwise. So what the local government committee does is meets to make sure that the policy makers are all on the same page and that staff is there to engage. So seven, eight years ago we were talking a whole lot about annexations and sewer connections. But it morphs through time as we're dealing with these intergovernmental concerns. That's also, again, not matched with the effective output of the board of supervisors. So... Okay. We talk about a lot of things, but it's tough to get things off the ground. And that, what we were just talking about earlier about a, having some kind of way to work with the county on getting dirty needles cleaned up. Again, you just have this grinding halt. There's lots of discussion. There's lots of great ideas. And the, I will speak from experience that those board of supervisors members, the supervisors that are on that committee work very aggressively. And staff is engaged. And we're all excited. But... You hit this wall when it's not an effective output of either the council or the county government. But, you know, by all means, I think any time you can get together with all of those people in the same room, there's more good that comes out of it than bad. So I'll second the motion. I'm not sure what that looks like on the ground and may be a challenge for staff. But I'll support the motion. Are there any other changes that could be made to the way that that organization meets that could make it more effective? Sure. But again, I think the through, yes, absolutely. In answer to your question, yes. I won't belabor the point. If I could comment. Sure. I actually wish you could send this to internal affairs. I think we got a pretty good discussion. I'm all right with the motion. So there used to be three standing committees of the council. And the third was... A committee. Local government committee. And it's been kind of amazing to me to see the fact that that morphed and changed and is not at all what it used to be. When we had three standing committees, every council member had a better chance to participate. Right now, if we're two, there's always an odd person out, at least. And so I've suggested this in the past, that look at the one we just had with CARD. We could have this one standing committee that would also be the committee that would meet with CARD. Rather than an ad hoc special committee that would meet whenever. If, you know, university, anything that was not internal, not finance, you've got a committee that would meet regularly. But not necessarily with Deborah and Tammy. But would be available and knowledgeable. I don't, you know, maybe the next mayor and the next council would consider that. This body is, as I've noticed being on it, I'm surprised. It's a very... It's a very... It's like it's its own agency. One of the things it is, is a finance agency that has debt that we have to meet regularly and go through a budget. You know, it's that kind of thing. And what has happened at least twice in the last nine months is that the... Mr. Ring, is that his name? The county staff person would put an email out saying, is there any agenda items? And we've canceled two meetings because no one came back of the six, five members that had a pending issue that they felt that they needed to bring up at that meeting. So you can go ahead and schedule six meetings. But unless the agenda and the mission maybe changes a little bit, you know, I agree with Randall that I don't think we're going to see a lot of change. I did bring up, you know, it's been kind of my push on this. We all have our own. Issues was disaster. After the campfire, I wanted to have a conversation and we had a conversation with on whether or not we learn lessons from campfire. And I remember six months ago saying, but what's the next disaster? And of course, we would have had a hard time guessing what the next disaster was going to be. But I think it... You know, let's go with your motion. Let's see what happens with this. But I would hope that or would suggest that is the new council and the new mayor is constituted in the next go around that you think about a standing committee that would have a greater authority and better reasons to meet regularly with all of our government partners. Perhaps external affairs. I'm sorry. External affairs. Okay. So we have a motion by Council Member Huber and it was seconded by Council Member Orry. Is that correct? Stone. Stone. Okay. Our next meeting is November 5th. And I would be glad to step down if you wanted to appoint any of the continuing council members so they get a flavor of what that thing is. Well, the reappointment is in December or January by the... Right. I just... Same for the November 5th meeting. Yes. I mean, the day after the election, I probably have other things to do anyway. I've just brought it up. So if there's interest, please let me know. So could I also maybe suggest, and I apologize for interjecting, but perhaps having the mayor send a letter to the county because they drive the agenda. They set the meetings. It doesn't come from us. And so perhaps having that conversation that the council would like to have more meetings and maybe expand some of the discussion areas, that might behoove us to start that process because we can't just call for a meeting on our side. It's coming from the county. I think this is really probably intending to have a pretty frank discussion at the local government committee meeting in November to... To trigger some changes. Okay. But we'll agendize it for a future meeting. All right. I'm waiting for the computer. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? No. Councilmember Ori? Aye. Councilmember Reynolds? Aye. Councilmember Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 6-1. Okay. So reports and communication. We have city manager's report. Due to the lateness of the evening, I'll decline. Thank you. Okay. So councilmember request pursuant to APP 1010, councilmembers may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting. After stating what that item would be, a majority vote is councilors needed in order to staff to agendize. Councilmembers may also submit request in writing. We had no written request. Are there any verbal requests? There was a written request that I submitted to... To staff. It was a rather large one, which meant that it was unwieldy. And so I understand why that didn't make the list. But that's okay. The request was... And so the pre-documentation and everything that is required to get that on the agenda has already been placed. So this is just notifying council and hope for support. This is regarding pedestrian safety along the Highway 32 corridor, which of course is a Caltrans issue. But we have... As I have reported, we have a number of issues. We have a number of issues that have been reported, again, going back in 2018 and 2019. We have a pretty significant pedestrian crossing problem across from the Burger King on Nord. And there's no curb and gutter requiring people that are using public transportation, especially going to Rosedale Elementary School, that have to cross into the on-ramp to traffic of a state highway in order to cross that intersection. I'll also note that at La Linda and Highway 32, close to Glenwood, further up, there was a fatal pedestrian to automobile accident. And the residents at La Linda have been mentioning for a long time that they have a considerable problem. Those are both in the proximity to, quote, unquote, safe routes to schools. I know there's a lot of private ownership necessary in order to make that happen, because not all of this is directly on Highway 32. And so that private ownership requires the private property owner to engage or some kind of ADA transition committee, something along those lines. I'd like to agendize a discussion to see what we can come up with and staff can come up with with regard to pedestrian safety along that Highway 32 corridor. Second. So the motion is second. Any comments? This is really very generically cross-examined. I'm not sure if you can see the crossings of Highway 32. Generically so, all of Highway 32. I'm probably precluded on one because I've got a property. That was my problem. I was going to suggest one at Linden. Yeah. Let's say before the 800 block of East 8th Street. No, what we're literally talking about is on 2nd Street, if you were to turn northbound on Highway 32 or North Avenue, there is no curb, no gutter. It fills with about two, three inches of water in the rain. And that necessitates people walking, both going from Craig Hall, Chico State students, the larger number of homes and apartments that have developed on the other side of Nord requires them to cross there as they're coming to class. Not far from the old red and gray pub. So I know there's at least one council member that's very familiar with this general area. But the only way, especially when it's raining, the only way for a pedestrian to cross is to literally enter the lane of traffic for an on-ramp to a state highway. I can tell you're really passionate about this. Well, you know, my son and I have walked that, right? We'll take the bus at that station and walk across and we've literally had to be in the on-ramp to Highway 32. And I thought, how in the world is this possible given the developments there? There's a dilapidated corner lot there. But with the number of pedestrian intersections problems that we've had on other parts of Highway 32 that have been solved. Through tremendous effort, both staff and Caltrans. We've solved this in other areas. We've solved this closer to 1197 East 8th Street. We haven't where a major portion of students cross a state highway to get to their apartments. And so I just can't believe it. We haven't done that yet. But for another day, this is a request to agendize. So let's have a vote. Council Member Huber. Council Member Morgan. Council Member Kuehler. Council Member Orrie. Aye. Council Member Reynolds. Aye. Council Member Stone. Aye. Vice Mayor Brown is absent. Mayor Schwab. Aye. Carries 6-0-1. And may I please ask Council's concurrence to allow Jeff Creed to speak to Item 5.4. I didn't. Oh. He's here and he did have a card in in time. I just didn't even think to ask. All right. If after he speaks, I can. If he doesn't, we can return to this. Yes. We will return to this item. Okay. So Jeff. I apologize, Jeff. Well, I was going to come down and say I really like the idea of expanding these meetings. That's actually a step forward in making the city a better process. Or city a better place long term. No, I'm good. Sorry. I lost my train of thought listening to the last question. I'm sorry. Last discussion and vote just really kind of befuddled me because I brought that up like three years ago and I got it ignored. So the council member here will request interagency program. I think it's a great idea. One problem I have with this council and the city in general is you push stuff out to all these subcommittees and ad hoc meetings and stuff, and I can't go back and follow what's going on in those meetings. I get a report at the end, and I can't follow it. So, you know, one thing, if you're going to talk about adding more meetings, I'm all for it. It's great. I think it's a great plan. But what I would think about doing is make all these ad hoc meetings at any Brown Act meeting, why not have it here where you have this great audio-visual equipment and record it and post it online so we as citizens can see what's being said in all these little subcommittees and all the little back, you know, there's all this hype that there's all these backdoor meetings. I don't necessarily believe it, but I get accused of it all the time by the other side of some of these issues, right? So add some transparency at the same time is what I was going to say is, you know, bring it up to, you know, put things online. It's not hard now. It's not going to cost you a huge amount of money. You have the thousands of dollars of technology. You know, it's just a little bit of hard drive space, right, a little bit of cloud space. And add that transparency so people can see what's being said. You know, I did find it disturbing that we have a council member who's had such an inappropriate or alleged inappropriate Facebook behavior over the last year as the head of an interagency council or whatever you're saying. I'm sorry. You know, it just struck me as odd. It's like why do we have somebody who's, you know, even got recent allegations about inappropriate behavior on Facebook, why is he the head of any subcommittee? So something else to think about. But please, thank you for the positive vote, even without my comment. Have a good night. See you in 20 seconds. Okay. Okay, we will return to... I would request to agendize a discussion of disbanding the police review board or police review committee or whatever we're calling it. I think it's accomplishing what we intended it to, and I would be interested in the mayor's other ideas of how it might be constituted or how a review might be taken. Well, the charge to the committee was to review training and the use of force policy. Because training may have budget implications, that's what we have been reviewing currently. We have a meeting next Thursday, which will review the first four meetings, make recommendations to council, and then you'll have that report. And then for the next probably three meetings, we will look at the actual use of force policies and then bring back a second report to you. That's the status of the committee. And that's what the... Do you see this committee meeting? I'm sorry. The report? From this committee being on our agenda, first meeting in October? Yes, because that's the budget committee, or the budget meeting. And so I recapped all the first four meetings. They're ready to go. I have plenty of material about the current state of training. Also on AB 392 and SB 271. Are those numbers correct? An analysis. By the city attorney's office on if 392 is captured in the use of force policies. There are some use of force policies that Chief Madden is updating. There's three bills... I'm not seeing a second. I don't want to ask you to do the report now. Well, we're missing one of those members of that committee. And so I'd rather have that discussion with that member present. I'll second. Okay. It's been seconded. Just be on the agenda at the same time. Call the question. Sorry. Council Member Huber? Is that no? Yes. Okay, correct. Thank you. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ory? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? No. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown is absent. Mayor Schwab? No. It fails with a 3-3 vote with one absence. Okay. Opportunity to try. Any other requests? I have a request. Just real quickly from the lady that owns the Hatchet House. She was interested in doing a pedicab pub bar type of business. If she wants to do that, that's something that would require an ordinance change. So I would just like to bring it back and show it to council and see if it's something that we would be interested in expanding our downtown business to allow something like that via an ordinance. Point of clarification. The letter that was... Well, I'll second the motion. Let's put it that way. I'll get more information when it actually comes on. I agree. It was just... Because it seems to be focused. There was mentions about Bidwell Park, and there are only just a very few number of places where you can consume and purchase. There's no alcohol in Bidwell Park. So this would be opening up a considerable experience. And she acknowledged in there that there would be no consumption of alcohol in Bidwell Park, and we would have to... She's already spoken with the first floor. The second floor, she's already gone through a lot of the city stuff and realizes that there is quite a few hurdles, including ABC, that she's going to have to get through. But I'd at least like to explore it. Anything we can do to bring stuff downtown and promote business when we're in the financial position we are, I don't see any reason not to at least talk about it. So I second the request for the agenda item. Right. And you'll get me information to include. Perfect. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown is absent. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 6-0 with one absence. Any other requests? I've got a question. Okay. Okay. So we will recess to closed session. Are there any public comments on closed session? None. Or emails? Are there any council disqualifications? Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
