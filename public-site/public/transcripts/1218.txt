So I'll turn it over to Associate Planner Madison Driscoll.  Thank you.  Good evening, Commissioners. I am Associate Planner Madison Driscoll.  And I will be presenting the staff reports today.  This is a request to authorize a quick service restaurant with a two-lane drive-thru.  So the project site is located on a vacant parcel along Forest Avenue between East 20th Street and Bainey Lane,  just east of the city.  The site is located on the east side of Highway 99.  Looking closer and using some retail landmarks, the site is just south of the Target Shopping Center and north of the Wal-Mart.  The site is zoned Regional Commercial and is designated Regional Commercial on the General Plan land use diagram.  The site is also identified within the 20th Street corridor opportunities site.  The opportunities site encourages retail development and identifies this as a local business area.  The site would serve this site  in particular as an opportunity  for intensification and infill  development within our rather  large retail corridor off of  east 20th. The proposed  restaurant would have a 4,666  square foot size and there would  be 82 parking spaces, 10 bike  parking spaces and a two lane  drive through. The site would  receive access from a shared  drive aisle with taking access  from forest avenue. The drive  through could accommodate a  queueing of up to 42 vehicles.  The architecture is contemporary  in style and uses a variety of  materials to create visual  interest. The building would be  covered in stucco and accented  with a brick wainscot. All  windows and doors would be marked  with a large canopy that would  cover the drive through area.  Landscaping would include a  variety of new trees reaching up  to 54% of the shaded area of the  parking lot. In a larger context  of the site we are currently  processing an application for a  parcel map and an architectural  review of the site. The  parcel map and the architectural  review of the site would be  submitted at a separate time and  with separate applicant teams  regardless of the Chick-fil-A  site. The Chick-fil-A has had a  separate applicant team versus  Tommy's. The proposed parcel map  itself would be divided into three  parcels with the northeast site  being Chick-fil-A, the southeast  site being Tommy's and the  northeast site being Tommy's  car wash and the western site a  future pad retail site. We  currently have not received any  submittals yet on what is going  to be on those future pad sites.  We have just gotten a preliminary  overview. You can see on the  beginning slide and what was  provided to you via email that  it would be most likely two  larger retail stores. The site  would also itself establish an  access point from Forest Avenue  and the west side of the  building. The site is located  Lane. You are able to see the  traffic pattern in yellow on the  site above. Also as you noticed  as the memo distributed to you  before the start of the meeting  the applicant is requesting a  revision to condition number two  of AR 2505. The revised condition  allows the applicant a little  bit more flexibility for the  timing of their building permits  while assuring that the city will  be able to continue to  The condition is really broken  down into three parts or three  options for the applicant to  choose. Number one is to wait  for the recordation of the  parcel map so that is parcel map  2402. Option number two is to  include the frontage improvements  in their building permits and  construct them themselves if  someone was to therefore not  construct them before them. Number  two is to include the frontage  them. Option number three is if  the frontage improvements are  already installed by the time  they are ready to pull building  permits they can proceed as is.  Staff has received no public  comment on this project. Staff  recommends that the planning  commission consider the project  staff report, direct any  questions to staff, hold a public  hearing regarding the proposed  project and adopt the planning  commission resolution 24-01 or  excuse me, yeah, 24-05 or yeah,  25-04, excuse me, and including  the required findings and  determine the project is  categorically exempt from further  environmental review pursuant to  section, CEQA section 15332  approving use permit 2408 in  architectural review 24-01.  The lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot [inaudible]  lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot  any questions.  Mr. Scarpa.  similarly none at this time.  commissioner wall.  nothing.  just go down the line.  I have one.  I noticed the site plan calls for  accessible access to walk along  the entire length of the southern  border of the property and up and  down lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot  lot lot  lot  you are speaking of the  accessible parking?  it'  s not accessible parking  it'  s the accessibility for a  pedestrian or wheelchair user  accessing from the south eastern  corner of the property.  the applicant can also speak to  that when we'  re here about any changes.  any other questions?  none.  i do have a  clarifying question.  i was a little bit confused and  i got some clarification.  thank you principal planner  solly.  when we talk about in the staff  report the project site, kind of  this site plan, the  site plan, there'  s the reference to the  overall six acres and then  there'  s the reference to the one  point something acre site.  for the parking, is all of that  parking on the site plan that  we have in front of us right  now?  yeah.  when we'  re talking about when it'  s six acres versus 1.15 acres  we'  re talking about the 1.15 is  the disturbed area of the site.  because it'  s one number is a little bit  over six acres. the parking would  fully just be accommodating just  chick fil a itself.  so it would not be anything  tied to the required parking  for the tommy'  s car wash to the south or to  the future pad sites.  okay. then my other question  is i saw some really beautiful  signage for the building itself.  i didn'  t see anything as far as  the size of the building.  is there a marquee sign that  would be?  we have not received or  actually decided on this we  would be reviewing signage once  it comes to the building permit  phase and that would be subject  to the city of chico sign  standards itself. it depends on  the size of the building but  usually if it'  s stand alone they'  re allowed one size.  monument signs can be up to 12 feet. i'  true but i think it would be a pole  sign or anything to that  regard. okay and i guess my  question on that is typically  correct me if i' m wrong but that  monument sign is factored into  the total sign allowance?  yes it is.  okay so if we'  re approving today with what  we have on the signs on the  building we don'  t have that monument sign.  no the signs on the site they are just placeholders. they are not going to be  i would like to ask you what the signs actually are.  okay.  itself i believe based on signage it would be a little bit less itself.  let me clarify the center identification sign is actually a separate sign that doesn'  t come out of the budget for this particular development. it'  s to identify everything within the center and it would have a center name on it.  it'  s just a small thing for chick fil a.  okay.  like we have on mangrove we'  re unwind and u.s. chefs it'  d be a lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  I think we have one of those, do we?  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Nicole, how many public speakers do we have?  We have one public speaker, the applicant.  Okay.  So we will, if anybody else would like to speak on this item, I'll let you get a speaker card in.  But we will invite the applicant up.  And we do have ten minutes for that.  So if a representative from the applicant would like to come.  Good evening, Chair Scott and Commissioners.  Very pleasure to be here tonight.  And just wanted to introduce myself.  My name is Christine Cho.  I am with Chick-fil-A.  I am with the Westfields.  Our region development and construction team.  We're based here in California.  And we work on all the new locations in Northern California.  Thank you for your time and your consideration this evening.  I would also like to thank planning staff and city staff,  and especially Madison for her thorough presentation tonight  and working with us to get our project to this point.  Our building was, you know, we believe it was designed with care,  with the community in mind, and we're very confident, proud,  of where we are now, and we believe this will be a great addition to the city of Chico.  Just a little bit about Chick-fil-A.  We're a quick service restaurant that began in 1946.  We pride ourselves on excellence in customer service, food quality, and community involvement.  We have been rated number one amongst quick service restaurants for nine consecutive years  by the American Customer Satisfaction Index.  Our business model is solely built on local ownership.  Our owner-operators come from a variety of backgrounds and work experience  and truly care about the impact that their restaurant and their team members  and the community that they serve.  Majority of our operators are owners of just one restaurant.  They're independently run, owned, and operated,  and many of them live in the community where the restaurant is located.  So we really are proud that it's really run like a small business,  even though...  You know, everyone thinks, you know, Chick-fil-A, they see us as a big company,  but the restaurant itself is truly a small local business,  and they're very involved in the community.  This particular restaurant will employ about 100 to 120 local residents.  You know, a lot of students, it's their first-time jobs,  and it offers a lot of flexibility, leadership growth opportunities,  competitive wages, benefits, and hands-on training and mentoring,  and a chance...  to apply for scholarships for continuing education.  Since 1973, Chick-fil-A has awarded around $191 million  to more than 105 team members that work in our restaurants.  And we're proud to say that many of our current owner-operators and franchisees  started out as team members and worked their way up  to becoming a franchisee local owner-operator.  So that's, you know, certain...  That's... certain, that's just an example of, just exemplifies  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh... Thank you.  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  I do have one question.  You mentioned, and this doesn't factor into our decision,  but that local ownership,  do you currently have a local owner identified at this time?  No, we do not yet.  That doesn't happen until we're about to start construction.  And then I do believe Commissioner Sharp had a question on parking,  so if there's somebody that could speak to that, that would be great.  Okay, sure.  I don't think it was on parking.  It seemed more like circulation.  Circulation.  Circulation.  Okay.  I'll get to you.  Yeah.  Hi, good evening.  I'm Jennifer Kirby.  I work for Kimley Horn.  I'm one of the consultants on the Chick-fil-A team.  I'm the licensed civil engineer for the project,  so hopefully I can help you out.  I hope so, too.  Actually, I just wanted to talk about the project  So, you're talking about the path of travel for disabled users?  Mm-hmm.  And I noticed that it goes along the entire south line  of the property, then back up and circles back around.  It crosses the travel lanes three times.  I was wondering if there's an option for us to kind of,  to cut out some of those crossings and make it a little safer and easier for everybody?  Yeah.  So, we have two different paths of travel that go to the front of the building.  So, there's a secondary path of travel that only crosses the drive-through,  once in the northeast corner.  So, if you have the site plan in front of you,  you can see that the secondary option only crosses the travel lanes once.  So, that reduces those types of possible conflicts that you're referring to.  Yeah.  For the path of travel, you know, on the southern side,  we're trying to master plan for like the future developments as well,  which this is independent of, but we're also trying to future-proof.  So, that's intended for some connectivity into the master development.  Okay.  and what are some of the options that you have for development as that comes through future applications?  Would there be an option to maybe change where the northbound access is, I guess?  Sorry, that was correct and not right.  So, after traveling, if one is traveling west from the south-east corner,  would there be an option to kind of take a,  to replace a parking space or something,  to allow a direct line into the building without having to cross over the drive-through lanes twice,  and then still maintain that east-west pass across?  Are we able to put a site plan on the, I think that would help.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking, but I didn't help anybody here.  The area around control of the power plant, can you go?  Yeah. So, I guess what I'm asking is along that, I'm not sure.  You mentioned just something along, like, you know,  these are all to cross here, cross here, and then cross back over here.  Is it possible to kind of shorten these two out and maintain and just put a path through this way?  And then you can still maintain the sidewalk going further to development,  but cutting out the entire possible conflict point?  So, we would keep that path of travel across the drive-through,  even if we were to add another one internally, because we utilize that for operations.  So, as part of the drive-through,  we would keep that path across the drive-through exit.  Chick-fil-A often have staff who are wearing safety vests and are out in the drive-through  to help traffic go quickly,  which is one of the reasons why they're able to serve so many people and,  you know, make sure people are getting through the drive-through.  So, even if we were to shift that path,  we would keep that across the drive-through exit.  That's just a standard for our operations,  but they lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  impact that actually seems like the most reasonable and when you expect people to use I think a option that maybe we could just  assess at staff level during the building permit process would be  Do I have a way to point on this the most?  Is on that first drive aisle when you're coming off for us the first drive aisle when you turn right  We could possibly add a path of travel right there on the left-hand side that goes up  The reason why I don't want to necessarily commit to it is that we have really strict  Tree shading requirements and I know that we have a tree planted there  So I don't want to necessarily promise that we can get rid of a tree and it's gonna work out  but if you can trust that we'll have the best intentions to work with staff during the building permit phase to assess that as an  option and just leave that for  Staff assessment and not necessarily make it a condition of approval  We'll work with staff to see if that's feasible  Okay  Jennifer while you're up  the parking on this is sufficiently more than what  Would be the minimum requirement for a site like this and a use like this  Could you explain just kind of what goes into?  Your projections on how many parking spots we need  To take that or do you?  So we from like a chick-fil-a standpoint  We do tend to aim to have more parking than typically is required per city code  and we find that that's beneficial because  We do tend to have a lot of patrons visiting the site  I think people get frustrated when they go to a restaurant and they're excited to get their food and then they're just circling the parking lot  And they can't find that spot on the street. So we want to make sure that we have that in our system. So we can help them with that.  space. So we find that it's a better user experience when we tend to over park from  like a city standpoint, it's over parked, but from an operation standpoint, you know, we find that  this is like the appropriate amount to serve the facility where we're going to have folks who can  get in, get their spot, parking spot, get into the site. And it doesn't create that congestion  in the parking field. When we tend to only follow parking requirements that are per city code,  what can happen from an operational standpoint is you have people who are trying to get to the  drive-through and then you have people looking for their parking spot and then it just causes  more congestion, which then can have negative implications for traffic flow on the city. So  when we go more towards our Chick-fil-A standards of having a higher ratio than city regulations,  it just allows for that congestion to not be a problem. Thank you. Any other questions?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. Well, I so part of that is, you know, we're  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  but we're working with partners. We want to be here. We want the developer to get their land in.  I don't know if we have a rough schedule. First half of 2026. First half of 2026.  Okay. Thank you. We're glad the community is excited.  Great. Anything else for the applicant? I'm going to close the public hearing.  Okay. Thank you. Great. Thank you. We have no other speakers, so I will close the public hearing  and bring it back to the commission. Any discussion? Motions?  Yes. I've got a few questions for staff, actually. Great. And thank you, Chick-fil-A team,  for your time.  Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for coming up to chico and making your proposal. Looking  forward to having you here. I'  m a little vexed on this one  because on one hand this is exactly the right kind of use for this site. This is a regional  commercial site. We should be focusing development here. Again, we love to see new development,  new projects coming to town. We also have design guidelines.  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  wondering what the basis for the  recommendation for approval  would be given that fact and  that'  s one concern I'  ve got. I'  m also concerned to  hear that signage is not a part  of our action here tonight  because signs do require design  review approval and that'  s what  we'  re doing here  tonight. By my estimation the  amount of signage on the  building is just about the  maximum right now and it'  s actually on more  elevations than the code would  normally allow which actually  makes sense in this case because  it'  s going to be a larger  center I get that'  s not that big a deal  but I think we'  re maxed out on the  square footage and so the  free standing sign might put us  over and I think we should see  that if it'  s going to be  here. Another concern I had was  that the building is not  going to be a part of the  municipal code requires that  alongside property lines that  would be the southerly property  line here that parking stalls be  separated from the property line  by at least 10 feet of  landscaping and I'  m not seeing  that here. What I'  m seeing is a curb a  sidewalk and then about 18  inches of dirt and then parking  and that'  s going to become  we had more landscaping that'  d be fantastic for parking lot  shading. That plays into another  concern I'  ve got with this and it  wasn'  t addressed in the staff  report and that had to do with  something our chair pointed out  and that'  s the amount of parking  I understand that chick-fil-a  needs that parking and that'  s great so my comment  isn'  t you have to get rid of the  parking or anything like that  if that'  s what it takes to make your  project successful I'  m all for it. My concern  is that the municipal code says  that if you want to propose more  parking okay if you want to  propose more than 35% we need to  look at some trade offs with  additional landscaping additional  shading or something like that  and I'  m wondering what that was in  this case what that discussion  was and what extra we'  I'  additional information in this  case as it were as required by  the municipal code and also I  noticed that the parking light  standards parking lot light  standards are up at around 25  feet I think and there'  s a design  guideline that says they should  be limited to 18 feet and I'  m wondering  what the rationale was for  deviating from that standard on  about the design of the trash  enclosure or the utility  structure which is the nearest  structure to the street actually  I'  m wondering how we got  through the completeness phase  of review on this application  before it came to us those are  things we'  re supposed to be  looking at so we can approve it  all quickly here at this level. Good projects that are complete and ready to get  should move quickly through the  approval process and I hate to be  bringing this stuff up at this  point because this kind of  throws a wrench into things  maybe I don'  t know but these are concerns  that I think we should be paying  attention to our city is getting  built out one project at a time  and we'  re making steps in either the  right direction or the wrong one  and some of these things are  pretty simple fixes especially if  they'  re taken up earlier  on in the process.  And lastly I'  m not really  concerned about environmental impacts so much on this site at all or  sequa however we'  re not talking about an  infill site here this project site is larger this is a six plus acre site and  infill projects can be exempt only if the site is five acres or smaller and were we to instead of getting a  lot of  exemption route have to go through a  negative declaration we might be able to take a look at some of the localized  traffic impacts here these uses generate more traffic than just about anything  else on the planet. It'  s a double barrel 42 stall  drive-thru which is great that'  s a wonderful business model  working for you guys but this is one of the most congested parts in town of our town and we'  around the area and it looks like we'  re going to have another  pretty high intensity use right to the south of it and who knows maybe farther to the west it  sure would have been great to have had a closer look at this project as a whole and not just  gone the exemption route and not taken a look at that personally I don'  t think it qualifies for an  infill exemption and I think we should have more discussion around just the localized  circulation of the  traffic impacts and the  circulation impacts that might occur with this project and others in the area.  In connection with that and lastly  and I apologize there'  s a looks like a stubbed out street next to the  to the sinclair gas station is that a public street or is that just a public or private thing that  remnant or should we be looking to try to use that or no?  that is an access way that is held by  sinclair gas station itself the reason that is afforded to just sinclair for that car wash that'  s existing there as far as connectivity to it there was a I believe there'  s an attempt to connect with that property owner but it did not phase out also with the new connection on  bainey lane it will also line up with the proposed new walmart expansion when there is a connection there and at least based off of the  the  I can answer one question on the  siqua exemption.  So the project like I said earlier it is the site overall assessor parcel is  a bit over six acres so it is over the infill exemption requirement of five acres but the site itself of disturbed area would only be  about little over one acre even if you'  re accounting in the area that is the access.  If I may interrupt I apologize that'  secure sequence.  this project can proceed all  by itself with or without the  related project they'  re partnering  with. This project can be built  all by itself on this lot and it  qualifies for the exemption  because it involves less than  five acres. There'  s a recent court  case in fact where somebody sued  a city over approving a project  similar to this sort of  situation where it was a 20  acre site but the court found  that just because the project  site the disturbed area is well  under five acres it did qualify  for the infill exemption. This  site is an infill site it'  s totally  surrounded by the major  commercial area it'  s called out in our  general plan as a focus for  where we want to see growth and  we'  re happy to see it here  now.  I would agree but I would  sharply disagree that it qualifies  as a standalone project and  project this is part of a  larger project we'  ve seen it in  materials shown to us this is  part of a larger project I'  m not sure if  it relates to that court case or  not but we know there'  s other  stuff coming and this definitely  seems to be slicing it out and  treating it separately to I  don'  t know if it'  s to avoid  going through a neg deck but I  think it should have been dealt  with differently. I'  ll leave it at that  Mike. I'  ve raised a number of points  that I'  success with our design  guidelines this year I don'  t know if my fellow  commissioners share my concerns  but I see a great project for  chico but we aren'  t see a  project that is compliant with  our design guidelines and our  municipal code in the ways it  should be before we take action  tonight that'  s my opinion.  I did take some notes I'  wondering on some of these points  you to give us a few points if  it'  s possible to enter  into the record since we didn'  t have this in the staff  report. The position of the  building can we start there what  was the decision made on there  to where the positioning of the  building is on the site?  at least the argument for the  positioning of the building I  would say is I believe it was  help with the correlated traffic  of the overall center itself. I  do understand it is a design  guideline but you also will have  cars regardless blocking that  area with the barrel drive-through  of the site.  I don'  t really have anything other to  say to that besides that point.  There is also many areas within  the building that are not  I think maybe if I think what  commissioner wolf is looking for  is even if we'  re not following the  guidelines we want to know why  and what those conversations  might have been. So really from  your standpoint the idea of  having that traffic flow at the  front and accommodating the  drive-through is the reason that  the building is where it'  s located.  Yes and it was also  accommodation of a backup of  drive-through.  Chick-fil-A'  s a great place to have  We had a lot of questions about  We really wanted to make sure  that we had the adequate queuing  for it and this was the best  option for it at least.  Okay.  And then the science and design  review.  We are the architectural review  and historic preservation board  as well as the planning  commission.  So what does that process look  like from here on out?  Do you feel like we have  sufficient information on  reviewing the science?  So as far as the sign review  goes if we can we could possibly  come back and discuss further the  signs if that feels sufficient  to staff itself.  In the past I know at least for  we did do recently for racing  canes a sign review.  When it gets to that level we do  have some issues with the  applicants on meeting.  We do have a sign code for this  exact reason in some ways.  I believe at least the sign code  it is a little bit more than a  as well and if you are to ask  for additional signage you can  go to the board itself so we are  I would be more than happy to  come back with that information  and work with the applicant if  you would like to review that as  well.  Okay.  And as far as we know it  meets the sign code.  It'  s up to the director to allow  signage on more sides of the  building than normally allowed  by the code subject director  approval and we don'  t know that they'  re proposing a  monument sign so they probably  are meeting the sign limits  based on what'  s on the building  and as far as we know what they'  re proposing.  Okay and really that'  s something when we get  further along in the process the  director would be involved with?  Yes.  If the board had a problem if  the commission had a problem with  signs any of these signs or  designs of these signs or the  number of sides of the buildings  that it'  s on should probably lodge  that in whatever motion is made.  Okay.  So that we can carry that  forward.  Yeah and if I could clarify  my comments on that I understand my  question and I'  m not concerned about  having more signs on different  sides of the building here it  seems like that is appropriate  here. I think the concern that I  had and maybe that the chair had  was and maybe we could get  clarification from the applicant  on this is there going to be a  monument sign for this project  in addition to what we'  re seeing here?  We can ask the applicant  we can open the public hearing  and ask them it'  s not on the site  m not on the site plan so I  would be reluctant to make up  things that are on the site plan.  Right.  Okay.  Ten feet of landscaping.  Was that a deliberate decision  that was made?  And is that what we feel like  is required for this site?  It'  s not required.  It'  s adjacent to streets so there  should be a ten foot landscape  buffer up front along forest.  Okay.  Not along the  southerly boundary which is  shared with the city.  provided with an interior shared  drive aisle.  And I do see a landscape  setback?  The point is a good point  though there'  s not much space for  anything to grow there so don'  t expect much  landscaping to occur in the  little strip.  Okay.  That'  s true.  If I could clarify why I  said what I did.  It'  s a quote from the  municipal code.  Off street parking for all uses  outside the downtown area except  for single family dwellings and  duplexes shall be located ten feet  behind the  O!  The section of the property  front and side street side  property lines.  The area between the parking  area and the property lines  shall be fully landscaped except  for point of access and this  landscaped area shall not be  counted as meeting the minimum  five percent interior landscape  requirement.  Am I just misreading that mike?  I'  m not sure which  section you'  re looking at.  Is that the section that'  s adjacent to a residential  use?  No.  I'  m sorry I don'  What section is that?  Well the  section that'  m looking at  perimeter landscaping adjacent  to streets.  If we could perhaps set that  aside.  I have my concern persists in  that we'  ve got this 18 inch  strip of landscaping that'  s not going to  live.  It'  s going to be roasted  there in the summer time.  There'  s no shade.  There'  s going to be cars  overhanging it.  I think there'  s opportunities for more  robust landscaping in this  location and I think the more  robust landscaping and the  additional shade that'  s going to be  I think that'  s going to be a  good way to address the needs  for such improvements in  connection with the additional  parking.  This has about three times the  amount of parking than our code  requires and I think it'  would be  appropriate to seek some  additional shading along that  south side.  were there any discussions on  any in lieu of  value fees or any benefits to  the city with how over parked  this is?  there wasn'  t a discussion  itself like I said we'  re quite aware as city staff  that these are quite busy  locations.  I think kind of the idea was  since we have the example of in  and out just to the east of the  site and we did not want to  repeat the same mistakes there.  I know that'  s more of a cueing issue  for it but even though we'  s a good reason so that  site itself is fills up quite  well even with an empty  Krispy Kreme building there.  So that was kind of the  reasoning behind having such an  over parked area itself is more  of accommodation and not wanting  to spill onto forest avenue as  well.  I don'  t think the concern is  about the number of parking  spaces.  I think the concern is  more when we have something like  this that'  s over parked there'  s typically some  there'  s a lot of  people who are  I think there'  s a lot of  s either an explanation  that'  s provided to the planning  commission of why this variance  is needed.  So a discussion on that.  Or as part of that discussion  what we are getting in exchange  for that recognizing the impacts  of that on the site.  So with having this will there  be additional landscaping?  Will there be something else  that comes along with this going  over the code?  especially on this.  Not to my knowledge no.  I'  m going to reopen the  public hearing after we get  through some of these.  So if you guys are taking notes  that'  uld be great.  Okay.  And  then the lights not meeting our  code is that accurate?  The design  guideline.  The design guidelines?  I wanted to go back to the park.  There'  s ten bike lanes in the park.  parking space.  spaces which is well in excess  of the minimum requirement for  bike parking. They did provide  additional bike parking they  thought they were doing the  calculation right but they  provided 10% of the bigger  number they provided not the  smaller number that was required  is 10% of the number that'  required. They'  re providing a lot of  extra bike parking there and  extra parking there and along  near the front. The high  standards for lights is to make  sure that lighting is at a level  that trees can grow over the top  of and if they'  re separated  enough the trees are separated  from the light standards enough  you don'  t have that much  of a conflict between the two.  We felt there was good  separation on this diagram but  if you want to make the light  standards lower you can add that  that is my fault I did not  include that we did have that  proposed it is a covered trash  enclosure with center block and  bronze itself as the roof it'  s similar to what is proposed I  can like I said if the board  would like to review that well I  would be more than happy to bring  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot  Yes, we can.  Do you want me to end on the environmental review?  I know you talked with Principal Planner Sully on that.  Okay.  All right.  I will reopen the public hearing and we'll start again with 10 minutes, Nicole.  Put it on the drive right now.  And also, if there's anybody in the audience who wants to talk, since the public hearing  is reopened, you're welcome to bring in a speaker card.  Hi.  Thank you for letting us come back up.  I think we can help answer some of the questions that arose.  So just to add to the points that were brought up by Madison for the circulation and the  placement of the building.  If we were to push the building to the front along Forest Ave, because of the way drive-thrus,  like we're limited to the circulation of how a drive-thru around the building can be so  that the driver is on the correct side of the building to pick up food.  So you can only wrap around the building a certain way.  What happens if we were to bring the building to Forest Ave?  You essentially have to take our site and flip it 180.  Okay.  So what that does is the drive-thru queue would be right along the main drive entering  in, which dramatically decreases any overflow storage for the drive-thru.  As city staff mentioned, we hope and we plan and design our sites for all queuing to fit  within the limits of the drive-thru.  But we like to design with safety factors so that if there's an overflow scenario, it's  still held within the limits.  So if we were to bring the building to Forest Ave and we flip that configuration, we essentially  lose that safety net.  And then you're potentially having queuing in the primary drive and then potentially  backing up onto Forest Ave.  So the reason for the recessed building is to allow those drive-thru operations to function  with that safety net of extra queuing in the parking field.  May I ask a follow-up question on that?  I understand what you're saying.  I understand.  And I think one of the things that I've been thinking about is is that would the answer  be any different if the presumed property lines were different?  If the lot were bigger or slightly different shape, would we have more options there?  No, because it's more of a configuration with how drive-thrus work.  Because if we bring the building, we can't wrap around the other side and so we'  because you always want the driver on the correct side of the building.  So we can't wrap around the other side.  Okay, thank you.  And then the other item, we hear you with the shading on the south side, so we just  wanted to offer that we can reduce the parking by two stalls and add center finger planters  on those two sections of parking on the south property line.  We'll get rid of two parking stalls in the middle so that we can add an additional planner  with another shade tree for those parking stalls.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I just want to address the over parking issues.  I know there are city standards, but Chick-fil-A, we have our own kind of standards of where  we want to be at parking.  You know, I think we really differentiate ourselves from other QSRs.  We don't want this to just be a drive-in, pick up your food, get out.  We are, we want this to be a community restaurant.  We've definitely seen more dine-in, you know, since post-COVID.  Our restaurants are a lot more hospitable than other competitors.  I mean, our, our, every table has fresh flowers.  We have very welcoming team members and we have a lot of, it's a family destination and  we want to be able to accommodate for that and hence that's why we sort of have our own  parking criteria and our own parking standards and we just want to be, make sure that our  patrons don't have any issues with parking.  And then Christine, could you quickly answer, do you foresee having a monument sign?  Yes.  I think we will pursue that.  We, that's something that our sign vendor will prepare.  We were trying to finalize our building element because we are working on construction documents  right now to have a completed set so that they can start their packet.  And we will pursue a monument but it will all be within the guidelines of the amount  of signage that's allowed.  Perfect.  Any other questions Commissioner Wolff or any other commissioners?  No.  Okay. Thank you. » thank you.  Any other public speakers?  Okay.  I will close the public hearing and then Madison if you could pull up that trash enclosure  that would be great.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I think that's a beautiful trash enclosure.  Thank you.  Thanks Madison.  Yeah of course.  Okay.  All right.  Any other Commissioner comments or questions?  Just comments.  I mean obviously I have a lot to say about this project.  project and I apologize to the  applicant team I don'  t mean to dissuade  you from being in chico I'  m looking forward to  you being here. I'  ve never had a chick-fil-a  sandwich I'  m looking forward to trying  one here in my hometown.  Actually it'  s not my hometown but I'  ve been here a long time  now. I'  m looking forward to that I  want you to understand my  comments are not intended to  stymie you at all just trying  to help along good projects and  I want to say again my  comments about the parking  weren'  t about the number of  spaces you know your needs  better than we do and I want  to support you in that so just  to be clear.  I just I do want to echo  that as well and maybe just  also a good point of why I  think commissioner wolf is  asking these questions but also  why I felt the need to  entertain that and have that  discussion is I think the  responsibility of the  community is to be  transparent in our roles and  so if we are I find Chico to be  incredibly business friendly but  when we are making  accommodations we just need to  be transparent about those  accommodations we'  re making and why.  And that was really the point I  think of facilitating that and  giving that opportunity for you  guys.  So I never want to  talk about how lot lot lot lot doing that. So thank you for letting us get through that. I  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  lot lot lot lot lot lot lot  I'd like to make the motion to approve this project.  So if there are any other discussion items, I'd take them.  I do have one.  It's sort of relating to use permit finding five about the proposed use compatible with the existing and future land uses of the vicinity.  Given the concentration of like quick service establishments with very similar offerings right there,  where KFC, Popeyes, and we just approved a raising canes in this immediate area,  I do have a concern about like market saturation and if Chico could really support like very, very similar.  And it's not related to any of the other questions and concerns we had, but I did want to bring it up before we vote.  None of those other places have Chick-fil-A sauce or a peach milkshake.  So I...  But it's a good point.  Yeah.  I want to reopen the wound that Wolf opened here.  I think given how much of this project relies on the environment around it,  the access for this is not on the property.  The signage is not...  The main signage for the commercial center is not going to be on the property.  I think we do need to do a little more diligence on making sure that we have a bulletproof exemption on this one.  And I'm not fully comfortable.  I'm not fully comfortable with the description given here.  I'd like to see a little more documentation if possible.  Mike, I'm going to defer to you.  Is that...  I mean, you are the actual planner and have that degree and certification and the one who will be sued if anything comes up.  So how confident are you in that?  Using an exemption for this project?  Pretty confident. project pretty confident. That court case was pretty  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. not even two acres. It can' t have that exceedance. It might  it might be a swage to some  planning commissioners to hear  we did do a traffic study you  won'  t see that until  the commies parcel map comes in  but we did take a broader look  at the traffic additions from  all the potential development  from the parcel map because it  did involve the larger area.  There was some information that  public works got from the other  applicant for that.  we should have been  providing that information in  the staff report.  yeah.  okay.  let'  s try this out and see what  happens.  I'  m going to.  that'  s the try it out and see what  happens.  I move that the planning  commission adopt resolution 25-  04 approving use permit 24-08  and architectural review 24-05  subject to the recommended  conditions contained therein.  I'  m going to  add a recommendation that  let'  s add a number  two or four.  to reduce the parking by two  stalls in the middle to add an  additional planter.  that would be along the south  side of the property.  along the south side of the  property.  and.  I'  m going to  sorry.  the lights.  yes.  if we could amend the light.  I'  m trying to pull up the exact  number.  but those would be subject to  18 feet.  18 feet.  do we have a motion?  is there a second?  add a second by chair scott  which I hopefully will never  say again and then a second by  commissioner wall.  any discussions or friendly  amendments?  yes.  I would like to ask a friendly  amendment.  larry if we could.  just on the signs.  sounds like they want more signs  than what they'  re showing and we haven'  t seen that.  would you accept a friendly  amendment that that come back to  us before they issued the building  permit on this or no?  staff make that approval?  it doesn'  t need to come back through us.  on the way to them.  then would you accept an  amendment that the sign package  be subject to staff approval  prior to building permit  issuance in accordance with the  requirements of the municipal  code?  yes.  I can go with that.  great.  I can too.  we will add that.  did you get that?  I did.  the minutes will get it too.  okay.  so we have a motion and a second.  any further discussion before we  take a roll call vote?  all right.  if you could give us the roll  call vote.  just to clarify the motion is as  written in our staff recommendation  with the addition of the  the  commission of taking out the two  parking stalls and having a planter  at the south east?  south side.  southern property line.  the light standards being followed  at the eighteen feet and that  a sign package be reviewed and  that a building permit.  note that the package be reviewed  for compliance with our municipal  code prior to issuance of the  building permit.  thank you.  Perfect.  All right.  Thanks.  Commissioner Wolf.  Yes.  Commissioner Wall.  Yes.  Commissioner Sharp.  No.  Commissioner Laffins.  Yes.  Vice Chair Skirpa.  No.  Chair Scott.  Yes.  So that passes four, two with one absence.  All right.  Thank you.  We'll move to regular agenda.  We have none.  Reports and communications.  Principal Planner Mike Salley, do you have anything for us?  I have nothing tonight.  Thank you.  Okay.  And do we anticipate having another meeting in April?  Do you know?  We don't have the next meeting planned right now.  Okay.  Great.  Thank you.  But we'll let you know as soon as we do.  Okay.  Anything from the commission?  Great.  Well, we will.  We will adjourn.  Thank you.  Thank you all.
