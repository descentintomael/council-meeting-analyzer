 Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sounds like you guys are having fun over there.  Yeah, same.  I guess I'll wait for Bruce to check on the doors.  All right.  Calling to order the City of Chico Planning Commission meeting of Thursday, March 4th, 2021.  And due to protocols established for COVID-19 community response, this hearing is being held via an online format.  I can go over the public participation item, or we can talk about that when it comes to business from the floor.  Does staff have a preference?  Okay.  So, yeah, we can talk about that for business from the floor.  If anybody is tuning in for that, we'll go over how you can participate.  First, let's, we just called it to order.  So, item 1.1, Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.  Please stand.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Great.  Thank you.  Roll call.  Can we get the roll call, please?  Commissioner Dermede.  Here.  Commissioner Scott.  Present.  Commissioner Rensink.  Present.  Commissioner Ober.  Here.  Commissioner Howitt.  Here.  Vice Chair Law is absent.  Chair Goldstein.  Here.  Thank you.  Item 2 is the Consent Agenda.  These are considered routine and will be enacted by one motion.  It looks like we just have approval of the minutes under consent agenda.  So, if we could have discussion or motion to approve the minutes.  I'll move to approve.  Sorry, Dennis.  I was just going to say, I may not have been heard, but I abstained from the consent item there because I was gone at that meeting.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  So, we still need a second then, I think.  I'll second.  If any of us read the minutes.  Thank you, John.  Cool.  So, we have a motion and a second.  Any discussion?  Sounds like we can vote.  All in favor of approving the minutes, say aye.  Aye.  Any abstentions?  Dennis?  No, I was here last night.  Oh, you were here.  Enjoyed it very much.  Thank you.  Now I'm confused.  No.  I missed the November meeting, which is what we were approving the minutes for.  Oh, okay.  Right.  It all makes sense now.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Cool.  Any opposition?  All right.  Seeing none, the minutes are approved with Dennis' note.  Cool.  Item three, business from the floor.  So, if staff could give a quick overview, if there's anybody on the line, for how to participate in that.  That would be wonderful.  We have two attendees in the Zoom, and they're both for the project tonight.  But we can invite them to speak if you'd like for business from the floor, just to see if they have any.  Sure.  Just raise your hand if you're interested in speaking in business from the floor.  And if we don't see anything in that or the chat box, we'll move on.  There's a raise hand button.  Chuck or Paul, if you would like to speak from business from the floor, hit the raise your hand button.  All right.  Thank you.  Great. . .  .      .   .   Great.  Great. e  Actually, so that'll be our next item.  If you could wait for that one, that would be ideal.  Yeah, no problem.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, business from the floor,  it sounds like we just have people here to speak on the next item,  but business from the floor normally would just be any item not on the agenda  for reference.  So seeing no other people speaking at business from the floor,  we can move on to item four, public hearings.  So first, any ex parte communication on any of the one item?  I drove by the site.  Nice.  All right, none for me.  It doesn't sound like we have any.  I just drove by the site also this afternoon.  Good idea.  So item 4.1 is the John Jones Vesting Tentative Subdivision Map.  And, yeah, we can move on to the staff report.  Thank you.  All right, good evening.  My name is Kelly Mercury.  I'm the planning staff member.  I will be presenting this project tonight.  The item before you today is a request to subdivide a 1.71 acre parcel  into 12 lots for small lot subdivision,  single family residential development.  The project site is located on the east side of Carlene Place,  between West Lassen and West Shasta Avenues.  The project includes one of the two buildings,  and one public street extension off Carlene Place,  terminating at a temporary dead end.  So the site is designated low-density residential  on the general plan land use diagram  and zoned low-density residential  with aircraft overflight zone D overlay.  Surrounding land uses include single family residences on all sides.  The project site consists of one residential parcel,  having a lot depth of approximately 296 feet,  single family residence and accessory structures  existing on the site.  The site would be removed.  The remainder of the parcel is vacant and undeveloped.  The city's small lot subdivision regulations allow lot sizes ranging from 3,500 square feet  to a maximum 4,499 square feet  to encourage a variety of lot sizes and configurations.  Interior lots must meet minimum lot width of 38 feet,  while corner lots must be at least 46 feet wide.  Consistent with these requirements,  the average lot size for the project would be  3,906 square feet.  The eight interior lots would be the narrowest,  having a width of 45 feet,  while lots six and seven would be the largest,  having a width of 55.1 feet.  Gross density for the project site would be 7.0 units per acre,  within the allowable range of 2.1 to 7 dwelling units per acre.  All utilities are available nearby to serve the project,  and the new homes would be connected to Cal Water and City Sewer.  There are 49 trees existing on the project site,  six of which will be preserved.  Of the trees to be removed,  21 are subject to the tree preservation ordinance  and will require the payment of in lieu fees  and will require the payment of in lieu fees . .  proposes to connect to a future road  extension of Carlene Place  that would provide through access  to West Lassen Avenue via the large  residential parcel directly  east of the project site, which has  the potential to be similarly  developed in the future.  A neighborhood meeting to  review the project was held on December 16th  of 2020. The meeting was  attended by approximately  five neighbors, the applicant, engineer  and planning staff.  A few questions were raised  at the meeting, mainly pertaining  to the configuration of the new street extension.  Staff has  determined the project's consistent with general  plan policies and any  applicable city subdivision standards.  The project's been determined to be  categorically exempt from further  environmental review pursuant to CEQA section  15332  infill development projects.  Staff recommends the  Planning Commission adopt Resolution  2102, approving the  John Jones  vesting tentative subdivision  map, subject to the attached  conditions. That concludes the report  from staff. I can take questions now or  turn it over to the applicant for further  discussion. Thank you, Kelly.  Thank you. Great. Do we have questions  for staff at this moment?  There's some really large black  walnut trees that are on the site.  Those don't qualify under our tree  preservation ordinance.  There is some debate between  English walnut and black walnut, and the  English walnut does. Some of the black  walnut, I think it depends on the diameter  of the tree. So I actually have the tree  permit that was issued, the tree removal  permit. I was just speaking to the urban  forester. They're kind of negotiating back  and forth over the last couple months,  seeing which ones could be retained and  which ones were going to be subject to in  lieu of fee payments. So that was actually  given to me in advance of this meeting. So I'm going to ask the  board to review it. And each one was  labeled, which were subject to the tree  preservation ordinance and which ones were not.  So do we have that current information?  I do have it with me. I don't have it for you,  but I could give you my copy if you'd like to review it.  I'd like to see that.  Sure.  Yep.  Good question.  And then another quick thing, as I drove by today,  I noticed that there was, looked like there was  grading going on. Had there been any grading permits issued?  So they did apply to demo the existing structures,  and that has happened already. So grading associated with the demolition has occurred.  I figured it was something, it looked like that.  Sure.  While Kelly's looking for that, John, are you talking about like tree number 12,  for example, the black oak, the 42 and a half inch?  Well, I was looking at, you know, I always look at, when I'm looking at mitigation stuff,  I always look for the larger trees.  Thank you, Kelly.  Of course.  And then...  This is the old original permit that was processed in December.  This is the one that was just given to me today.  That's a breakdown of all the trees.  Okay.  Very well.  So I'll take a look at it really quickly and pass it on.  Sounds good.  So yeah, the larger ones, Dennis, are obviously the ones I was concerned with,  and not all of them look like they're in good health.  It would be nice if, to me, a complete tree preservation report also talks about the health of the tree,  not just the size of it.  And so that would be...  That would be nice to have for future in these.  But yeah, the larger ones, I mean, some are 68, 69 inches, I believe.  And the other thing I understand placement of them is kind of critical.  And a couple of the large ones seem to be, you know, placed in a way that they don't seem to interfere  with the way the project is laid out.  So those are my other concerns.  Okay.  I'll let you .  Yeah.  Should we just take a few minutes for looking that over?  I'd also be interested in reading it.  I guess, I mean, I'm also interested in viewing it.  We can maybe have the applicant speak unless you'd like to have full attention on them.  I also have the exact same concerns in terms of the trees and wasn't totally clear.  I suspect that this information will help or maybe just take care of it.  But it wasn't really clear.  I think it was clear on the essentially the in lieu fees, you know,  where which trees were going to trigger that specifically and, you know, what that would add up to.  So it could be that the information that you're looking at will help.  But in the meantime, hearing from the applicant makes perfect sense.  So that's fine by me.  Okay.  All right.  Unless you have objections to that, I think we can hear from the applicant now.  All right.  Who do we have up?  First up is applicant Chuck Tetra.  All right.  Good evening, Commissioner.  I'd like to thank the city staff for working hard on this.  And I kind of jot down some of the concerns that you have.  Perhaps I can throw those out for you.  The demo was done on that property at the request of the code enforcement.  Ms. Charlene said that they were having some issues with some things out there.  So I'm going to go ahead and get that out there.  So we went ahead and demoed the house.  I had it scheduled there.  Just kind of cleaned it up a little bit.  The neighbors were a little worried about it as well.  Speaking to the trees, right now my current removal fee is $54,000 to remove the trees.  I am working with Mr. Bamlett.  Some of the trees, there's a little discrepancy.  The 69th tree that was mentioned is dead.  Yeah.  And so therefore, we're going to have to remove it.  We're negotiating on what should be the end movie for those.  The ones that are left along the perimeter, I am going to save them.  I know some of the neighbor reached out and was wanting those trees to be saved.  So anyone's along the bedside, we are going to save the neighbors for some privacy as well.  What else we got?  I think that this is a good, great example of good city planning with future extension  having a contiguous neighborhood there.  That would be a move to Lassen.  I think that about covers it.  It's pretty straightforward.  The house plan would mimic the one that I built a year and a half ago on Cargine Place.  It basically would be kind of a mirror design.  And our niche with our business is we're trying to keep housing affordable.  It's skyrocketing home prices.  We've got a 24 requirements.  Makes houses much more affordable.  Much more expensive to build.  So we like to pride ourselves on keeping about $15 a foot ahead of all the competition.  And people seem to love our infill subdivisions.  So I hope everybody else here feels the same.  If I've missed anything, I'd be more than happy to answer some questions.  One quick question for me.  What do you mean by $15 a foot ahead?  Well, our sales price.  When we sell the home.  We look at the competitor that they're selling for.  Look at that and you try to stay $15 lower per square foot.  Okay.  Thanks for the clarification.  Question relating that square footage range on the houses and their prices projected.  They're going to range from 1389 to 1535.  And we're trying to stay.  And we're trying to start all of our houses with a three.  All right.  Any of you?  Yeah.  Just one quick thing, Chuck.  With relation to the tree study that Kelly just shared with us.  That looks a lot better.  And I'm confident if you work with Richie Bramlett to come up with a solution about preserving those trees that can be preserved.  Because they definitely are an asset of that property that's there.  Then I'm comfortable with that.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  And one thing also in my mitigation, I'm proposing to Richie is that not only will I put the street trees, but I'm adding trees on Carleen Place that are not required.  And then I will also put another tree in front yards because we like trees.  Good.  Thank you.  Thanks.  I have one question.  It's actually about this list.  John or somebody might be able to answer.  Some of these trees on the diagram, the X goes over the number.  Which ones are those?  I can't read the number on the diagram.  Oh, yeah.  They kind of got crossed out a little on there.  Yeah.  The ones I was looking at, Bryce, were the larger walnut trees.  And the one that makes sense, what Chuck just said about it being dead.  Yeah.  And not in good health.  That has the tree health on there.  And so that's pretty helpful.  But it looks like the largest black walnut was actually not in good shape and needs to come down.  But then trees number 31 and 32, which are black walnuts, are near the side.  And it looks like they were going to try to retain one of those.  Okay.  31 is the one that's dead, it looks like.  And 32 is the one that's dead.  And 32 is the one that's not going to retain.  Okay.  Yep.  Good to know.  And you're saying that those are two of the ones that are kind of Xed out on here?  Yeah.  And then tree number 10, which is right on lot number 3 to the entry of lot 3, that to me is, I think it's a 68-inch black walnut.  And so that's a shame that that has to go.  Yeah.  It says above average.  Yeah.  And it says above average on there, too.  I mean, I'll just, I mean, just for the record, I've, Hidden Oaks, you guys know Hidden Oaks development?  Wonderful development where they actually designed the housing development around these large heritage oak trees that were there.  And it's wonderful.  But unfortunately, those are kind of becoming few and far between.  And like I said, I mean, trees are a great way to add value to whatever development you're doing.  Not only are they good for the environment, but they're also good for the environment.  And, you know, people want those in their yards.  So in the future, it would be awesome if, you know, we meet ahead of time, talk about which trees possibly could be saved because they do add to the project.  And then, you know, work from the design angle from there rather than just, you know, trying to put a cookie cutter template over the top of a piece of land.  So that's my opinion on that.  I agree with that.  Also, I notice in the map, the sidewalk kind of jogs around some sites.  So I'm not sure if you can see the lights of trees that still have an X over them, which is interesting.  It almost looks like they were going to try to preserve those trees and build around them, but then couldn't.  I'm not sure.  Any clarification on that?  Can I speak to that?  Uh-huh.  So that was the goal to do that.  And so when we do a rough draft of that, I try to save those trees.  And then what happens is utility companies come and they need to put joint trench and or water.  And they have requirements of which they cannot place a lot of their utilities that close to something like that because then if their utilities kill the tree, then it's a liability.  So there was an effort made at the beginning to save those trees.  Like I said, we do try to make an effort to do that.  And unfortunately, on a site this small, it's kind of hard to design around that tree in order to preserve it.  And still get lots and do an affordable or trying to stay affordable for people in my house.  So I do hear what you're saying.  And there was an effort at the beginning to retain those trees.  Okay.  Question for Chuck.  Back to tree number 10, I think it is on lot 3.  Is it possible to save that one?  Is it the tree?  I think it's important to note also that a lot of these trees are not going to be used as a temporary property.  There's a great area there for tree preservation.  If you go out and I'd love to take you over once a little bit.  But you look at some of these trees and they say that they're 49 inches or something.  And what they are is sort of the accumulation of a tree that had been cut down in the past and now they're like little sprouts.  So but they have to take the circumference of that breast height.  And that's how they get their calculation.  So a lot of these trees, even though they say that they're not going to be used as a temporary property, they're going to be used as a temporary property.  So I think that's a great way to say that they're 48 inches.  I apologize.  I should have sent you pictures.  They're actually a bunch of sprouts that have come off a tree that had been cut down years ago.  That's interesting.  Yeah, I think number 10 is the one I saw when I went out there and it looked like a tree that Frodo would climb in or something.  But anyway, okay.  Thank you, Chuck.  You're welcome.  Yeah.  In the future, maybe some pictures.  I'm not sure if trees that you might predict us tree huggers will comment about might help clarify.  Thank you.  I will send some pictures just so you guys have them.  I know it's not for tonight, but it's interesting to know that the way that these are calculated, I think that pretty much relies on what is considered a 49-inch tree.  Even you guys might look at it and say, well, that's not a tree.  Literally, it's an accumulation of about 10 different sprouts that came off of a tree that had been cut down.  And there's about seven or eight of those that's called for bigger trees that I believe Mr.  Gustafson and Mr.  Bamlett actually went and either looked at or Richie had pictures and they determined that, yeah, that's not the intent of what the mitigation was.  But it's still some pain.  I'm still paying an 18-inch fee on those trees because they are a tree.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for the clarifications.  And I'll just add that the information that we're now looking at that has made its way around, Dennis is looking at now, does help a lot.  I appreciate having that, the tree health information as well as configuration and some comments about, you know, numbers of dead branches and things like that.  So that information, I think, is hugely helpful to me, especially with this kind of a development with this many trees slated for being taken out.  So I appreciate that, you know, coming to us.  And echoing what you said.  I think maybe John said earlier that having that information early in the process would help a lot.  And I realize, you know, there are mitigating factors often that contribute to whether you can provide that or not.  But whenever possible, that's a big part of the decision.  So thanks.  All right.  Further questions for Chuck?  I think, do we have another?  Okay, good.  We have another speaker from the applicant.  Okay.  If we're ready.  Seeing no other comments.  All right.  I think we can have the next speaker.  Excuse me.  Good evening.  It's Paul Moran.  Thank you for the time.  Thank you.  I only have one question.  And I actually spoke with Kelly earlier today.  And she provided me the answer.  But I thought I'd ask the applicant directly.  I'm interested in.  I have a wooden fence.  I have a standard wooden fence in the back of my property, which runs along the south side of this subdivision.  And the fence is actually on my property.  And there are remnants of an old wire farm fence on the, you know, just on the other side of the fence on the subdivision parcel.  So just wanted to get, wanted to know, will the, will it be built with a standard wooden fence in the backyard?  Because there might be some structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be structure there and there might be  The applicant did raise their hand. Okay go ahead. Okay go ahead Chuck.  We can hear you.  Thanks. Okay do we have any further speakers? All right then unless the  applicant has any further rebuttal or comment. Seeing none I think we can close  the public hearing. All right hearing is closed. Further Commission questions or  discussion?  I'll give you a moment.  The only thing I'd like to say you know and I appreciate the economics of the  applicants subdivision. I just wish there were some you know 1100 to 1300  square foot houses in there just to keep the price point because the price is  escalating so rapidly here in Chico. They get them down into the lower threes  you know. He said the number would have a three in front of it. Three nine nine nine nine  nine is a three and so you know it is what it is supply and demand but it would be you know  the smaller the square footage so but they meet all the requirements it just would be a wish on  my part. I agree with that Dennis. I think ideally it would be great if we could see  some projects with homes that are a little bit smaller. Like I don't plan on ever buying a three  bedroom house unless I start a family because I can't afford it and I don't need that so we're  kind of missing that segment of the market of slightly smaller houses but yeah that's  unfortunately not what we've been seeing. That's something that hopefully we as a city  can incentivize in the future.  Well at the same time you know we have a workforce that's diverse and greatly in need of houses of this size as well as the  other houses we've heard from a number of employers. They're having trouble attracting  personnel so I mean this seems to fit in with the surrounding areas. I looked around it  about as good a fit as you could have in terms of continuity through the neighborhood there  and I think this is just going to be a really good project and add 12 more houses to our  badly needed supply.  Mm hmm.  Yep we definitely need more housing so.  Further comments? Discussion? Motion?  Okay well I move that the planning commission adopt resolution 21-02 finding that the project is  categorically exempt from further environmental review and approving the John Jones vesting sub vesting  tentative subdivision map S20-05 based on the required findings and subject to the conditions indicated therein.  I'll second.  All right.  Moved and seconded. Any further discussion?  Seeing none I think we can go to a vote.  All right all in favor please say aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  Aye.  Any abstentions?  All right.  Motion carries.  Good work.  Okay let's find the agenda again.  Can I just add a quick note just in terms of what I mentioned about the 11 to 1300 square  foot houses.  Go ahead.  The Miriam Park for example they've had good demand on their two bedroom two bath houses  and I think you know there's no doubt that the housing is going to be a good fit for  There's no argument that a three bedroom probably will sell for more but there are enough people  that a two bedroom two bath works for.  So that's why I brought that up.  I think there is a demand for that.  Yeah certainly there's a demand for this type of housing that we're approving and there's  a demand for smaller housing.  We just need a diverse array of housing to meet our city's needs and as we saw when we  were reviewing the past RHNA info we haven't really been meeting a lot of the lower ends  and smaller housing.  So hopefully in the future we will.  And that's something that I'm hoping that our city council will take initiative to promote  the development of different types of housing.  So onto let's see item five is the regular agenda.  It looks like there's nothing on that.  Item six is reports and communications.  Do we have any reports and communications?  No.  I don't have anything to report Madam Chair.  Just to let you know we have we will have a meeting at our next meeting a sign ordinance  amendment for March 18th.  So.  Okay interesting.  Okay.  I'm not sure that I caught all of that.  So are you saying we won't have a March 18th meeting or?  We will.  Oh okay.  Yeah we have an item on for a sign ordinance amendment for your next meeting on March 18th.  Cool.  Oh sign ordinance.  Okay.  All right.  Well then I think if there's no other reports and communications we can adjourn and we'll  see you all on March 18th.  All right.  Same time same channel.
