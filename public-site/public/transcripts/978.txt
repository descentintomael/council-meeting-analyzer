On behalf of everyone who has gathered here today, thank you for your many and abundant blessings. Thank you for life itself, for health.

I'm going to ask you to get your ready so we don't have that lag time in between one and two. Okay. Thank you. Greetings, Chico City Council members and other citizens of Chico. Thank you for this opportunity to speak. My name is Lyndall Ellenson and I'm a retired professor of public health and a long-time resident of Chico. The focus of my comments is a problematic use of survey data collected by point of contact among men housed in Chico. My comments tonight are excerpted from a letter I sent to the Bureau of Public Health and the Ute County Continuum of Care on June 3rd, 2021 and that letter is submitted for your review as well as these remarks I'm making tonight. There are multiple copies. Valid and reliable data to help solve the issues of homelessness in the U.S. is vital. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has sponsored the biennial Point in Time or PITS survey since 2005 to provide consistent data on homelessness across location and time. I understand that the 2020 Butte County Chico PITS survey was canceled due to the pandemic for good reason. I also understand the legitimate need for data that led to the non-bid grant given to the new nonprofit Point of Contact to collect data among Chicos unhoused. My concern is with the validity and reliability of those data collected and presented by Point of Contact and therefore with the utility of these data for policy decisions. Upon review of recent presentation to the Continuum of Care survey, several survey questions raised concern. For example, the question, quote, are you aware that camping in Chico is a non-profit area? Are you aware that camping in Chico is illegal and you will eventually have to move? What types of sheltering would you consider moving to? Unquote. This is what we call a double-barreled question. When two questions are asked at the same time but the data are collapsed so you can't see or there never were answers to both questions. It's important for validity issues, however, most important for validity issues, however, is that the first question is threatening and likely to bias the response to the second. This is a classic violation of the principles of survey data fidelity. The question is, how do we know if the data is valid or not? However, I am more concerned with what I did not see at the presentation. To ensure confidence in the validity of results, it is incumbent upon those who report their research findings to also carefully describe instrument development and reliability testing, staff training protocols to ensure inter-reliability across subjects, data storage, and how researchers will protect subject anonymity and confidentiality. This should be done with enough detail that peer researchers can assess the validity of the data. I did not see any of this information presented shared with the data presentation. Because the HUD point-in-time survey provides the methodological rigor to ensure data validity, I recommend that a formal PIT survey be scheduled and funded for Butte Chico in January 2022 and that any data-driven policy decisions be halted until these data are available. Finally, I offer my experience as a researcher and public health professional pro bono to assist in the planning and implementation of the January 2022 PIT survey. I am happy to provide more detail and take any questions now or at a later opportunity. Thank you for your time. Ken Mollison followed by Kelly Johnson. Sorry, nice to meet everybody. It's my first time in front of you. I'm an owner of a farm out here. The water rights on Manchee Creek, I own a portion of those. I'm a member of the community. It's a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not a state that's not RVs, trucks, everything. They're just dumping human waste everywhere. This place is a toxic waste site. What happens when the winter comes? What happens when the fire starts there? The main pipeline for all of North Valley is right there with the storage tanks right across the creek there. What's going to happen if those things go off the fire? I have hundreds of issues that are really bad. That's a riparian habitat. That's a salmon habitat. That's, you know, go on and on, and you can go down the list. My problem is there's one set of laws for people that pay taxes, and there's another set of laws for the homeless. They don't have to, they're not enforced on them. I've been talking with the EPA, talking with the North Valley Water Resources, and the Fish and Game. They have given them citations. They can't do anything at this point because, you know, no one enforces the laws or the rules. I'd be in jail for 20 years and have a five-year sentence. I'd be in jail for 20 years and have a five-year sentence. I'd be in jail for $100,000 fine if I did anything close to what's happened. What we need is immediate testing to start. I'll bring the water to the Oleander lab that they can do the testing, and we should get a baseline. Start up at the top of the creek, you know, butte creek where the water comes in, and come down and test it, and you can see as it increases. And then when you get down below there, you'll see what kind of E. coli, you know, and hepatitis. If it's hepatitis, I'm screwed. Somebody's going to be buying my property because it can't be fixed at that point. And there's, you know, people swim in there, the animals go in there, everything. It's crazy. So I'm just really discouraged at what's happening and that there's a state put on removing them because, first off, that's my water rights, and they're being, you know, trampled, and we're irrigating. What happens to all the water that's being aspirated by people when, you know, the sprinklers are going on and stuff like that? They're going to get all those diseases, too. So that's just the start of my discussion, but thanks for listening, and I hope we can resolve this very quickly. Kelly Johnson, followed by Nicole Nava. I want to discuss the term service resistance. I've been working with my clients to get them into the shelters that are currently available in Chico for many months now, and one of the primary things that is preventing people from going into the shelters is not their own resistance, but rather the oppressive rules. There's a 6 p.m. At Torres, if you do not arrive at 6 p.m., you can't go in, and if you don't go for one night, instead of letting you in the next day if there are available beds, you have to schedule an appointment to get in, which often takes a week. Those people will be on the streets for that week, and that is not where you want them. So if that shelter is not available to that person, you will not be able to enforce against them. So if in the... This is Center, their new shelter, they make people get up at 6 a.m. They have a stack of rules. I went there just yesterday with my client, and they write him a stack of rules this big. They have to wake up at 6 a.m. They have to get there at 6 p.m. I, as a high school student, didn't even have a curfew of 6 p.m. People should not have to abandon their autonomy and their freedom in order to seek shelter. So if you want people to go to shelters, you need to make them a viable option for people. Now, the worst thing you could possibly do is re-encounter... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ...in order to engage in your vicious game of Whac-A-Mole. With Whac-A-Mole, instead of getting people, forcing people to leave Chico because they won't, you're just moving people from place to place to place and dispersing them. That's the worst possible thing for your law enforcement personnel. It's the worst possible thing for your fire personnel. Now, if you have a sanctioned campground or several sanctioned campgrounds, we can ensure safety. We can make sure there's fire extinguishers. The fire department will know where those people are. Law enforcement will know where those people are. If you keep up with your game of Whac-A-Mole, then you're just going to move people to random locations. The fire department's not going to know where they are. There are going to be people all over Chico. They're going to spring up in front of businesses. They're going to...every single time you do the enforcement, there's going to be trash. You know that. Now, it's no secret that many of these people have substance abuse issues and mental health issues. Many of them are very low functioning. Some of them are high functioning. You have a whole spectrum. Your current shelter system is only serving high functioning homeless people. Low functioning homeless people are going to have trouble making it to Torres, making it to the Jesus Center at 6 p.m. every night. So you're leaving the low functioning homeless people out on the streets. Now, those are the ones who are going to have the most trouble and who are going to be leaving their trash behind and all that stuff. So you guys need to create solutions. And if you don't, and if you start playing Whac-A-Mole, I'm going to rent more U-Hauls and I'm going to move people around again. Thank you. And that doesn't work for anybody. It takes away certainty and it's not going...you're not going to get rid of homeless people in Chico. So you need to look at real solutions and there's plenty of federal funding available for that. Thank you. Nicole Nava, followed by Jeff Creed. Good evening, Council. Nice to see faces. I want to actually, probably to the shock of everyone, agree with the rule portion of what the prior speaker said. I actually have experience with the population and I actually have long thought that that is not a great idea. So I'm just going to...that wasn't planned, but I did hear that and I want to say that I actually agree with that and would love those service providers to revisit that part of things. Totally agree about the...when you're trying to reach service resistant, that trying to meet those hours is like not going to happen. So anyway, moving on from that, what I wanted to actually talk about since there's time later to address some of the... the questions that have come up in the chat, and I think that's going to be a really important part of this discussion, is regular business of Chico. So I want to talk about some good things. Some good things are Council Member Sean Morgan and Mayor Coolidge had nice outreach emails that kind of delineated some milestones, some things coming up, opportunities people have for engagement. And so I appreciate that the styles are different and the Mayor noted he doesn't do social media as much and this was more a push out. And I would love to see people kind of riot. And I think that's something that we've seen in the last couple of years, is people coming up to us and saying, you know, we're going to do this, we're going to do that. And I think that's something that people have recognized to that level and kind of dig in in the districts and let people know. I know that Cami isn't afraid, excuse me, Council Member Denley, and also does kind of updates about things going on. And I think that there was a good start made when the Mayor, excuse me, the City Manager with some staff were highlighting things on, I think it was like Connect Chico or something like that online. And I think we've taken a pause on that. I haven't seen it if it's come out. But I think it's important to keep connected with this community. And now that we're in districts, people still kind of don't understand what does that look like, what does that mean. Of course you are all tasked with city business across. But I really did like how the Mayor actually addressed some things that were germane to the district that he lives within. So I think there's opportunities for that that could bring community members together if you guys were to engage with them on that level. I think that if the City were to do something, just a little friendly critique is that it was talking at us and it was great because we were learning about some of the different departments. But where I noted we didn't have engagement was people were asking questions and they weren't getting answered. So then just make it where you can't comment then because it kind of felt like we were unheard. And so I would like to even see you have a community forum. Pick some people. Like have a contest and then have them come out where you're doing your thing and be able to engage. And ask questions and things that might be a little more lively. So I just wanted to change it up because I'm trying to go for, let's try to lessen toxicity all the way around. And it's great when that happens at council level. It's good role modeling. So I'd love to see our community kind of rise to that too. Figure out what we can support. One Chico put a post up about CHAT and Everhart Village partnering with the county. Take a look. Jessica Giannola. I'm sorry. Hold on one second. It was actually Jeff Creed, but that's okay. That's okay. I can make it. It's okay. Jeff, come on up. I'm sorry. I knew I took him out of order. I apologize. Good evening, council. So I just kind of came down to laugh again. Because, you know, there was a lot of talk in January about this council being voted in for a purpose. And, you know, I had hopes that that would come to pass. And I think one thing that's missing is, you know, like two meetings ago I walked out asking who makes a plan like that. Who makes a plan? What I meant is who makes a plan where they don't want to get graded? Who makes a plan where they don't want a measurable outcome? You know, who writes a paper in college where they don't want to get a grade? You know, they just want to, you know, say, yeah, I completed this. And, you know, good, bad, or other, it's done. It doesn't matter. And that's what I think your homeless herding plan, cattle herd of 2021, was all about. It was just about, you know, going out there and saying you did something. And I agree with, you know, previous speakers that whack-a-mole is a failed plan from the start. The idea that it was a plan from the city is laughable. So moving forward, you know, the last meeting was really funny because a lot of things were said that were really important. And I think everybody missed them. If you didn't go back and watch it a few times, you probably missed it. One was the city manager said he didn't want more public input on $22 million worth of spending. That was really funny. Probably the best comment. The best comment was from Councillor Brown when she said this meeting was a mess. And it was a planned mess. You know, the city manager also said he didn't want to, didn't want to, in case, Councillor Reynolds asked about bringing it back and divide it up and prioritize. And the manager said he didn't want to bring it back because it would make him look like a silly, make him or his staff look silly. But it's really him because, you know, his staff works for him and he's the one who pushed forward the project, right? Instead, he chose to make you all look silly. You know, go back and watch the meeting. You guys are fuddling around trying to get a motion to pass. And, you know, he said he would prioritize everything equally. So the funding for the new dispatch system for the police and half a million dollars to work train 15 people, those are equal priorities under his own words. Now, if those are equal priorities in your own words, you know, we've got to get this done. We've got bigger problems, right? But my point is, is that was all done to make you all look stupid. And he did a good job of it, created division, created this befuddlement. And he just doesn't want to hear from us. If 15 people is too many comments on $22 million of one-time funds, that's really scary. Why was the meeting at 4 o'clock? To discourage public input? Why was the closed session at 3.30 to discourage public input? You know, this is getting real disappointing. You remember that public input you want to discourage are the people that helped you get away. He was our last speaker. Oh, I'm, wow, I am so sorry because I. That's okay. Okay. Hi, council. I just have a couple items that I'm hoping that can be considered for a future agenda. One item, a few meetings back, it was the Zoom stopped. And I was just wondering if you could talk about that. I think that we can gain some pluses out of COVID and the abilities that we learned with reaching out to the public who haven't normally been able to, I don't know, have been able to access meetings and participate. So if we could maybe reconsider that at some point. So that way people at home with kids, single parents, whatever, they're part of the community. That way they have a voice. Another item that I think that is worthy of reconsideration is the old BMX bike. So that means that that's a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's not a new tip that's I'd like to suggest is I know that there's litigation going on for our unhoused population and the ordinances that we have down. But I'm hoping that the city can maybe consider going ahead and identifying at least one site before the resolution with the legal team. I don't see from my end why we need to wait to consider a site and then work on the legal end with another site or another idea or another resolution. But we do need to have one site right away. We're putting it off. We have people suffering as they're waiting. They're waiting. Comanche site. The water gets shut off regularly whether it's repairs or not. But it's taking a long time for the repairs to get done and the people go without water. Especially this time of year is critical in having regular water access. The cooling tent locations. It's downtown Depot Park. If there could be a second location or other idea where maybe Comanche Creek where most of the people are congregated right now or something for cooling especially this week. My last request is I'm hoping that city management and council will think of or consider reaching out to the community maybe with some advocates. Just kind of getting out there just to see for yourself and meet people in person. I think it would help see situations a little different. I think it would help see situations a little different. I think it would help see situations a little different. I think it would help see situations a little different. I think it would help see situations a little different. I think it would help see situations a little different. It's not that it's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's not a visual sight that's District A43, parcel map 2801, Sierra Cascade Group. Welcome. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor, City Councilmembers. Item 4.1 is a hearing for the formation of maintenance district A43. As a condition for final approval of a subdivision map, a property owner is required to provide means to operate and maintain public improvements to its division. To comply with this requirement, the property owner, in this case, the Sierra Cascade Group, has requested the formation of a maintenance district to cover the long-term maintenance of public improvements to its division. The formation of a maintenance district provides funds and the appropriate level of maintenance to public improvements to that division. Staff's recommendation is to approve or to adopt the resolution and to create the maintenance district A43. That concludes my report. I'm available for any questions. All right, questions? Mr. Huber? No? All right. Okay, thank you very much. So, do we have any speakers? I'll hear it. We'll open the public hearing. Do we have any speakers? Okay, so we'll close the public hearing and entertain a motion. Move it through. Second. A motion and a second from Councilmember Brown. Madam Clerk, if you could take the roll. Yes, Councilmember Brown. Aye. Councilmember Denley. Aye. Councilmember Huber. Aye. Councilmember Morgan. Councilmember Tandon. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries six zero with one absence. All right, thank you. So, moving on to the regular agenda item 5.1, continuum of care presentation. Welcome. Hi. Oh, you know what? I need my glasses. I did not see a thing. Good evening, Councilmember, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you about the continuum of care. I'm Anastasia Snyder. I am the Chair of the Continuum of Care, I'm also the Executive Director at Catalyst Domestic Violence Services. I'm here also with our first Vice Chair, Don Taylor, who I know you know very well, who is our first Vice Chair of the Continuum of Care, as well as the Housing and Homeless Administrator with Department of Employment and Social Services. So we want to thank you for having us here. I'm not used to this setup. So what is the Continuum of Care? We're going to give you sort of an overview and a historical context and picture of the continuum of care. So I'm going to give you a little bit of a summary of what it is that the Continuum of Care is and does. The Continuum of Care is a regional and local planning body that coordinates housing and services funding to address homelessness. And for us, the region encompasses all of Butte County. Some Continuums of Care are citywide or multiple counties. Ours is just the entire of Butte County. And it was designed by some legislation, and I'm not going to go through them all. The one I want to really kind of connect with you about, briefly, is the 2009 HEARTH Act, the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act. It consolidated the three homeless assistance programs into a single program, the Continuum of Care. And this is through HUD. These included the Supportive Housing Program, the Shelter Plus Care Program, and the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy Program. The HEARTH Act also codifies into law the Continuum of Care planning process. A longstanding part of HUD's application process to assist homeless service providers, homeless persons by providing greater coordination in responding to their needs. And in 2015, the authority to administer rental assistance amended the HEARTH Act to include, to allow nonprofits to administer rental assistance under the COC programming. So early homelessness funding, for more local and historical, context, the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force was in place already, and the COC members, many of the COC folks were members of that as well. So the, and the expectations of the COC were much more loose than they are now in the beginning. And the COC didn't have the required structure that it currently has. So it was a much more free form kind of policy body. Additionally, it was primarily transitional housing, that was funded through the COC. And that meant the Community Action Agency was the lone applicant and recipient of funding. At that time, HUD was not interested in funding emergency shelters. So no one else on the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force was applying for those funds. So Community Action Agency kept the task force in the loop as to when funding would become available and how much they were going to be applying for. And then the task force would rank and review. Similarly to what the current COC does, their loan application. Eventually the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force asked the COC to find, to create its own body, because they saw themselves, the Chico Homeless Task Force saw themselves as primarily Chico centric, that makes sense. So at that point, we launched our effort to plan the reconstituted COC in accordance with the growing HUD demands. And so that transition came at a really good time. The Greater Chico Homeless Task Force relinquished their role as the lead administrator. It was a good time for the COC to really pull together stakeholders and formalize the program. HUD began to emphasize a formal collaborative. That was the approach that they were really stressing. And in 2009, 2010, they really wanted, were really pushing that to meet the new expectations of the consolidation of the HEARTH Act. HUD began to also push HMIS, which is the Homeless Management Information System. That's our data collection tool. Don will talk more about that. But they really started pushing that HMIS requirement. And because it was required to get transitional housing funding, it was natural for the Community Action Agency, or CAA, to take on the role of the HMIS and the COC lead and the collaborative applicant. Those are just terms that I'll get into in a moment. As HUD expanded the program, we hired our first paid coordinator through the Housing Authority to assist with the ramped up expectations and growing funding competition and requirements. During this time, we also continued to strengthen and process and identify priorities for services. And that's part of that ongoing requirement of the COC, to plan for services. So the COC has many roles and responsibilities, as I mentioned. And HUD started putting more and more responsibilities and mandates onto Continuums of Care. And it should be noted that they did this without, with little or no financial support to those, to the Continuum of Care and to the agency that was acting as the lead. In the initial case, it was CAA. And as you can see, we are responsible for many things, the point in time, the housing inventory charts, as well as HMIS, as I mentioned, and the coordinated entry systems. And Don will talk about that. But they also really required that we start designing and implementing processes associated with funding and how we award funding through the COC. And then again, COC planning continues to be one of their mandates. So, to the nuts and bolts of the COC, this is the current structure of the Continuum. And the Continuum is really made up of all folks within all interested parties related to providing services and solutions to address homelessness. And that is service providers, it is our medical personnel, it is our law enforcement. We are wanting to bring all interested parties to the Continuum to address the issue. And this diagram shows the relationship between all of the entities. As you know, we have a governance charter and policies and procedures, those of which I included, or we provided those to you in your packet. But if you look at the Continuum, it is the larger Continuum that elects our board or the council. The COC council is made up of 20 members. We have 12 regular members that are elected by the whole Continuum. And we are required to have a board, we have a cross section of service providers. They identify a couple of different, a couple of different, what would you call them? Representatives that they would like to see on the COC. A victim service provider, a homeless service provider, a housing authority is often identified, as well as they have a mandate to include somebody who is homeless or formerly homeless as one of the members of the board. You also know that we, we hold seats for the three jurisdictional coalitions, the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force has a seat on our Continuum, as well as the Oroville Task Force, and When Paradise had a Task Force, they also participated on the Continuum board. And then of course, you know that we have the five jurisdictions that are disappointed by the bodies who also are on the board. And I believe coming this next coming month, we will have all five of those in our board, those seats filled as Gridley has identified a person that they would like to participate on our continuum of care council. So that's how we make up the council. We have elections, I believe, every two years. Again, that's outlined in the governance charter, how we do that for the at-large seats. The whole continuum from the council, the whole continuum will also then vote on the chair and the two vice chairs to serve in those positions. We also have committees. As you can see, we have a list of committees that we have. HUD has identified a few that they really would like us to see. Households that they would really like us and actually they would like us to have, and that actually goes towards scoring points on the continuum application for funding. Veterans, they want to see us have a veterans committee, a chronic homeless committee, households with children, and then of course we have some others, certainly an HMIS coordinated entry. And then we just recently added an LGBTQ and people of color committee to ensure equity across all programs. And then you see that we have the two as needed, which is the point in time committee, which is a really substantive event that happens biannually. You heard a little bit about that. It takes a significant amount of work from the whole continuum to conduct a point in time count. And then we have the lead agency, the collaborative applicant, and the HMIS lead. And I know that's a lot of jargon. I'm sorry about that. But it's the continuum that is responsible for all the duties that are assigned, with the exception of maintaining an HMIS and coordinated entry system, and for applying for the dollars that come through, the original dollars that have come through through the continuum to each jurisdiction. And Don will talk a little bit about the funding structure as well. And that's what we're referring to as the continuum dollars. So both of these functions are done, the collaborative applicant, lead agency, collaborative applicant, and the HMIS lead. Those can rotate. And we do, are required to sort of vote in a new one on a period, or vote in or reaffirm who we have on a regular basis. And that's set up through an MOU. Acting as the collaborative agency, acting as those three bodies right now, is the county, as you are well aware, that just recently transitioned from a community action agency. And they're tasked with, certainly like I said, the two main tasks, the application and the HMIS lead, as well as leading strategic planning for leading the strategic planning process to end homeless, supporting collaboration among our community partners. And I think we really saw them step up and do that in a very significant way with Project Room Key and Project Home Key. That was a task that they undertook for the continuum and for the county. And did a remarkable job in that work. They are also required to establish performance targets for the continuum and for the grant recipients. They are to monitor the grant recipients. There are a group of us that receive grants through the continuum of care dollars, and they are to evaluate outcomes and report those outcomes to HUD along with us grant recipients through what's called an annual performance review. And I know that Donald will speak a little bit more about some of the really nitty gritty dollar stuff related to the continuum of care. If you have any questions of me, I'd be happy to answer. I know I went through that quickly. Thanks. Good evening, Mayor, council members, city staff. Let's go here. So, we have a couple of questions. Okay. I'll try not to get too much into the jargon here and keep your interest for the remainder of the presentation. Okay. What you're seeing here is an illustration, and it's an illustration of the different components or parts of a COC. And really what we're looking at is how it weaves together housing and shelter, you know, with the services. Okay. As you can see, coordinated entry is central to it all. And coordinated entry is the process in which information on homeless individualized individuals and households are put into a centralized database. That information is used to prioritize, to identify those who are most vulnerable and rank them so that when programs and projects, housing becomes available, you take the people from the top of the list, those that are identified as most vulnerable, and you get them into those services, into that housing. Just to briefly go over, I'm not going to get into great detail about any number of these core components, but just to kind of touch upon a couple of them. I'm going to go through them. Okay. So homelessness prevention is really the efforts to keep someone in housing. There's much, much more resources required to take a household and put them back into housing once they have become homeless. So the idea of putting energy into prevention and keeping them from becoming homeless in the first place is one of the strategies that's used, and it's part of our continuum of services. Okay. Outreach engagement. That's really where you build rapport and trust with the individual. And then the second part is the outreach engagement. So you direct individuals to overcome the trauma that they've encountered, and you provide information, and you direct individuals to resources. Outreach and engagement is not simply as simple as going out and saying, hi, I'm Don. I see that you're homeless. There's a bunch of services I'd like you to come and see. Individuals are homeless for a number of reasons. Households that are homeless are there for a number of reasons. You know, everyone's story is unique and it's different. And often they've experienced trauma. You can imagine how long, if you've been on the street, a year, two years, three years, 12 years, you know, what kind of trauma that occurs. What kind of trauma occurred to put them on the street in the first place? So to gain trust from an individual sometimes takes time. It may take a week. It may take months. It may take a year. And you wonder why would you put a year into working with a household to try to get them into housing. It's because it's the humane thing to do. But outreach is not as simple as just going out and providing the information. It's a matter of, it's a matter of, you know, building rapport with the individuals and with the families and the households that you're working with. Okay, emergency shelter rather speaks for itself. This is emergency in nature. It's to get someone with four walls and a roof over their head, get food into them, and then try to get some services that might, you know, allow them to take a step into different options, whether it be shared housing, transitional housing, permanent housing. But it's to get them out of the elements and get them some services. Okay. Transitional housing is just what that is. It's transitional in nature. This is not permanent housing. Transitional housing is usually defined as housing up to about 24 months. So you've got someone who's maybe working on their housing stability plan, their housing plan. They need some time to get things into place. Maybe they need time to get enough income to where they can become self-sufficient. Maybe they need rental subsidies for a period of time. So that might be something that you do for a couple months. Maybe 12 months. But, you know, up to about two years, that's really the definition of transitional housing. It's kind of temporary in nature to get them more into the permanent housing or permanent supportive housing. Transitional assistance is that assistance you're providing them while they're in that transitional housing. Permanent supportive housing is housing with a permanent nature. It's not time limited. This could be where you're going to be for the rest of your life. It could be just somewhere where, you know, you know you're not going to have to leave, you know, within the next, you know, 12 months, 24 months. Okay. Supportive just basically means you've got either individuals or households who require a level of support in order to get stable within that housing and then to subsequently maintain that housing. And then rapid rehousing, that's a service that connects homeless families and individuals to permanent housing through a tailored package of assistance. You know, and it may include time limited financial assistance and it's got targeted supportive services. Okay. There's an awful lot of data involved. I'll try not to get my inner geek on too much and really inundate you with a lot of the acronyms and a lot of the data issues. But we do need to touch upon some of it. I wanted to provide this slide just so you get an idea of some of the data that we do look at, you know, through the CLC. This particular data set comes from our 2020 set of data and this is part of our housing inventory count. Okay. So, the 2021 reports are not available. We have submitted all the data to HUD, but they have yet to generate the reports. Everything was pushed off schedule because of COVID. So, those reports are coming out. So, we'll look at this 2020 data right now. Is that county data? This is not county data. This is the COC, our region. This is data that's directly for our COC. No, but I mean is that the numbers in terms of? In terms of the county, yes. Okay. HUD definitions for our entire community. Okay. So, we're going to look at the data set for our county. Okay. One part of the comprehensively assessing the housing and service needs of individuals and households within the continuum is to use data. Part of this data set used to reference is the point in time count and also the housing inventory count. These were mentioned earlier by Anastasia. CLCs are instructed to conduct a point in time count during the last week of January each year. For even numbered years, this point in time count consists of the sheltered or unhoused individuals and households. This also includes a report on the beds available for occupancy on the night of the count. Beds under development are excluded. Again, this is referred to as the housing inventory count. On odd number of years, the point in time includes a count of both the unsheltered and sheltered individuals and households. As a reminder, due to COVID-19, there was not an unsheltered point in time count in January of 2021. It will be planned for January 20 of 22. And as Anastasia mentioned, we'll probably be getting our point in time committee going I would suppose sometime in the next month, sometime in July. It takes a good six months to plan and organize the efforts needed to really get an intense count done county-wide. A lot of volunteers, a lot of efforts there. This here is an example of the housing inventory count. It shows beds counted in multiple categories-emergency shelter, transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing, other permanent housing for the different demographic populations. If you take a look at the fifth column it shows the total year-round beds for a different housing categories. For example there were 319 emergency sheltered beds available countywide on this night and so that's how you can look at this data and see okay where are we out with our beds and again this is a single point in time it's a single night that we're doing this data. Moving on how are COC programs funded? Okay this slide will give you kind of an overview of current homeless resources. If you take a look towards the top there you can see that only two sources of funding are provided annually. All others are one-time sources of funding. The two annual sources of funding require providers to reapply every single year and the money is not guaranteed. The funding is very prescribed according to federal and state priorities and the eligible uses the eligible activities. You can't use it for whatever you want it really has to fit within the parameters and just to kind of illustrate what I mean by saying that the money is very prescribed for eligible activities. Let me give you an example or an analogy of something you might be more familiar with. Let's look at city infrastructure. Okay let's look at the city needs regarding say roads transportation. Okay say we've got a large amount of potholes that need to be taken care of. Also on the road you've got a lot of painted lines you know directing traffic that need to be redone. You've also got a lot of street lights that are out. Okay those are some of your infrastructure concerns. Those are your needs. You're highest priority is potholes though, because there's a lot of potholes. I'm not saying that there isn't, Chico, but I'm just using this as an illustration. Okay. Funding becomes available, and the funding says, we've got, you know, this amount of money for lights and paint. Now your priority is potholes, and everybody knows that, and you're all well aware of that, but because the money is available for lights and potholes, you go after that money, you put your applications in, you get it, and you take care of that. You don't forego that funding source, because the other priority isn't available. The money isn't available for that. So that's kind of how the COC looks at some of these funding sources. When they become available, you do your best to put in competitive applications, you go after it, and then you fit the needs. We may have different local needs, different local priorities, yet we have to work within the parameters of whatever the federal and the state says are the criteria for those particular funding sources. Eventually, hopefully, we get some pothole money, but what you do is you look at what's available, and you look at how you can do what you can with what's available, the resources that are there. Okay, you'll notice that a lot of this, again, is one-time dollars. They may go for a period of time, but it's really a challenge. And here's part of the takeaway from looking at this, when you're looking at the dollars on top, or annual funding, that still have to be renewed every year, reapplied, every year, you look at the other one-time dollars. The huge challenge for providers is to plan for sustainability. You know, how can you plan for three years down the road, five years down the road, ten years down the road, when you don't know if you're going to have dollars? When you've got money for a particular project for a limited period of time. It's a huge challenge. Okay, let's look at the process for the COC homeless dollars. And you often refer to this as, you know, the COC, funding. The one on the top there, that's the McKinney-Vento dollars. That's often referred to as the COC homeless dollars, and how the funding process works. So we'll take a look at that in a little bit. And what this slide elaborates on is working your way through it. Many of you may have participated in, you know, notice of funding availabilities. That's a NOFA that comes out, and you're familiar with the funding process of going through a request for proposals. In case you're not, I just wanted to throw this out there. You know, that, you know, funding becomes, you know, allocated or it's available through a NOFA. And then you put out a request for proposals for partners, I want to go after those dollars. Okay, the NOFA reflects the activities that are eligible for funding and the COC priorities. The NOFAs often reflect what are the federal or state priorities as well. So they're giving you the parameters. Okay, what we do as the COC is we establish a scoring process in response to the NOFA. We also look at a way to convene a ranking committee. These are agencies, you know, usually agencies that are not applying so that we can avoid conflict of interest. And again, this is in our policies and procedures manuals. You know, this is all documented. We have to ensure that there's a fair and equitable process. The collaborative applicant drafts and submits applications on behalf of the COC and selects applicants for funds. Okay, so for our COC homeless funds. We have funds that come out and generally this is every fall. Okay, here's the NOFA. Here's the funds that are available. The grantees that currently have COC funds submit their annual renewal applications. Okay, so the collaborative applicant takes all these applications together and tries to make the most competitive general application for all these. Because our COC is putting together their consolidated application on a competitive basis with other COCs. Nationwide. Okay, so even though money is available, we still have to compete on a national level to get those dollars. Okay, and again, those are monies that are being reapplied for on an annual basis if the organization decides that it wants to reapply for those dollars. Now, why would an organization not want to reapply if they're currently a grantee and they have dollars, say they're doing tenant based rental assistance or something. Why would they not want to reapply? Well, this does happen. Okay. And a couple of examples might be, say you've got an organization that receives a grant for transitional housing. HUD comes along and eliminates transitional housing as one of the priorities or an eligible activity. So now you've got a grantee who can't reapply because now that activity that they're engaged in is no longer an eligible activity. That money gets reallocated so now you can have other organizations, other agencies come in and apply to get those dollars and put them back into place. If you do not select an agency and put those reallocated dollars into place, then you do lose them. HUD will take that money back and they'll put it back into their big HUD pool of money for next year. Okay, that could be one reason why somebody doesn't reapply. You could have an organization that does tenant based rental assistance. Now, say they've got multiple grants and we're in a housing shortage right now. We all know what it's like in Butte County as far as trying to locate rental. Units right now. If you do not expend the money that you're granted, then it looks bad upon the continuum as a whole. And so when we're reapplying for grants, you want to, again, bring forward the best possible altogether application. So if you've got a grantee that's not expending their funds, which shows a lack of performance, maybe not because of anything they're doing, they just can't find rental units. Then you may have an organization say, I'm not going to reapply this year. That money can be reallocated. And again, you go through that process of applications, reallocating it to another organization, hopefully in a different area that's going to strengthen our application overall. And so there's a lot of working components in getting just this little bit of amount of money out there. One of the biggest challenges we see, again, with the federal dollars and the state dollars is we may have our local priorities. We may know here within the county. We may know here in the county of Butte what we need. But if the federal government and the state government says here's your dollars and here are their priorities, they may not align. So often you'll see us put together a consolidated application based upon their priorities may not necessarily be what we need. But we're doing it because we do need to bring the dollars into the region. More on homeless management information and data. Okay. Okay. As mentioned previously, the homeless management information system is a local information technology system used to collect client-level data and data on the provision of housing and services to homeless individuals and families and persons at risk of homelessness. Each continuum of care is responsible for selecting an HIMS software solution that complies with HUD's data collection, management, and reporting standards. Our local CLC uses a system called Clarity, which is a product of BitFocus. This software is used by many of the CLCs within California and across the country. HIMS data standards have been established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. And this is to allow for standardized data collection on homeless individuals and families across systems. These standards are updated on a regular basis. Generally annually or biannually. The HIMS lead agency that Anastasia talked about previously is responsible for coordinating with the selected vendor to integrate these changes. The HIMS lead agency is also responsible for coordinating with the CLC members and users to establish policies for use, privacy, security, and data quality. This lead agency is also responsible for training homeless people. To enable these new standards to be able to enable these new standards to be able to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards to enable these new standards Drug abuse is 10.92. Chronic health condition, 16.55%. HIV, 0.41. Developmental disabilities, 8.54. Physical disabilities, 16.58. Domestic violence, 19.57. And in this example, the way that we- If I can just interrupt you really quick. We usually allot about 15 minutes. And I know we've got a lot of questions too. So kind of looking through your last couple of pages there. But if we could just kind of move through them a little faster and then we can get to some questions that we have, if you don't mind. Not a problem at all. All right. Okay. That's probably enough of that example then, huh, Mr. Mayor? Not particularly. Okay, outcomes. Well, we can look at the way that outcomes are displayed. This same data, as you can see, we do need to have outcomes. Anastasia did mention earlier that we do use systems performance measures. These were put in place by HUD. And the systems performance measures, it measures performance across the entire system, across the entire COC, all the organizations, all the agencies that are receiving money, not just each individual one. There are measures for each individual one, but we also have the performance measures so we can look at how we're doing as a whole. And then, for the next slide. Okay. So, this is an example of some, 54% of persons in transitional housing or rapid re-housing exited permanent housing. 88% of people in permanent housing remain there over six months. One of the challenges of finding affordable housing, as you can see, those in transitional housing, the average days of entry to exit into permanent housing was 304 days. That's 10 months. That's 10 months in transitional housing. So, when you're sitting there as a student, as a COC member, and you're looking at how can we do things differently, how can we really help the community, you have to start asking yourself questions. Do we need to focus energies on creating more transitional housing beds? Are there other resources for that? Is this really a lack of supportive services that prevent people from moving from transitional housing into permanent supportive housing? Is it a lack of funds for supportive services? Is it a capacity issue and not enough providers? Is it a lack of affordable units? There's no way to do that. There's no simple answers for all these complex problems. But the data can help guide us through some of the strategies. Coordinated entry system, here's just an example of some of the things that we can take out of our coordinated entry system to help guide, again, where we want to put our energy, where we want to put our strategies, where we think we need to move forward. More on the housing inventory count. This is actually some of the data that we did upload this year for the 2021. Again, it's not in the HUD report form, but this is what we have here. And again, this is a matter of us looking at data and looking at how we use data. An example of this, let's look at, let's just, okay. Okay. We can look at the emergency shelter one if you want real quick. In this, there are 170 more beds than last year. Are we really creating that many more beds in our system wide? No, I don't think so. Most of the beds that you see that are more than what we had last year are because of the COVID response. You know, we put a lot of non-congregate shelter programs into place like Project Roomkey. So you had to count those extra 150 beds because they were in place on that night on January 26th. Okay. The emergency shelter bed utilization, right? It was 65%. Does this mean that we don't have enough unsheltered people in the county to go into those beds? Probably not. Does this mean that people don't want to go into those beds in the shelter because we have enough beds? Probably not. You have to remember this was done on January 26th and we're in the midst of a pandemic. And the congregate shelters were operating at a severely restricted capacity following CDC, CDPH, and local public health guidelines. You have to remember TORS is operating at 60 out of 160 maximum beds. The Jesus Center was not operating in the Sabbath House at all. The Oval Rescue Mission was also operating at a severely limited capacity. Okay. You have to remember all these nuances when you're looking at data sets. So I just wanted to illustrate this that, you know, the inner utilization of the emergency shelter beds may be more likely due to the restrictions placed on shelters operating within a COVID response. So you have to have a story. You have to have a narrative when you're looking at data. You can't just look at data and go, okay, this is real. This is a real simple way of looking at it. You got to know what's going on. What's the context? And this was just one more example. This was our point in time. And this was just showing how it can be differentiated into household types, cell populations. So it's just another granular level of detail that we can get with our data. And that will wrap it up, Mr. Mayor. All right. We have a couple of questions for you. I know council members do as well, most likely. I did want to refer back to my original ask on this, which was a review of the COC budget relative to where funds were received from and from what sources, where those funds were spent, and what geographical locations those funds were spent, which very simply was meaning a detailed account by year for the last five years of funds received and spent, and the city, or in which area of the county they were spent. Just a simple multi-page detailing so both the community and the city council could understand. I didn't see any financial information in here. That is something we're working on because each one of these grants is different in nature. We don't have an existing spreadsheet that just lists them all like that. We're working on something, and when it comes to the five different years, we can go to the HUD website, and we can go to the HUD website, and we can show the expenditure report. So there are a few of them. But I mean, you know what you brought in and what you spend each year, right? Yeah, we've got an expenditure report that can be run. Okay, yeah. I mean, I'm just very interested in that, and particularly in what geographical location those funds are being dispersed within the county. That would be a little bit more difficult because most of our HUD data is for the continuum. It's for the entire region. Oh, I understand. It may not specify. These are the funds that are being spent. The exact number of dollars were spent in Chico, Oroville, Gridley, Paradise. It'll just show that these were services provided countywide. Okay, and I understand that if that's a service provider who provides services countywide, but if it's, let's say it's Jesus Center, you know, we know where they're located. Yep. So, I mean, we could detail out probably the majority of that funding, I would guess, as to location. If it's rooms, we know what town. We could differentiate what was spent countywide, and perhaps what was spent within a jurisdiction. But you have to remember, and again, this is some of the nuances. If you're looking at money that was provided to the tourist shelter, they are located in the city of Chico. They take people from the entire surrounding area. They take everyone from the county. They'll take people from Paradise, Gridley, Oroville. No, no, I completely understand that. I'm looking to where the funds are actually being spent. So, and I think that was the request. Just in looking at this, I'm seeing an absence of the financial data. And when I made this request, it was for the financial data. So, that was the goal in doing this. Because, you know, we're charged with obviously looking at the whole picture as well, with you guys being a part of that picture, and figuring out the various aspects. Without having knowledge as to what the dollars are, it's very hard for us to determine how the rest of it, you know, or what the county's doing, and how that should be spent. So, we need that component. And I think that's a vital component for us to have. So, when we make a request, we're able to get it. When we make our decisions, we know where the holes are as well. And we can provide or search or whatever it might be, you know, a particular area to bolster or not bolster, because it's being overfunded or underfunded in terms of our opinion. All right, I'm going to open it up to questions from other council members. Before I go back to the rest of mine, do we have any? Do you want to go? Council member? Go ahead. Fire away, Scott. Yeah, we can hear you. I didn't see things like financial hardships, unemployed, underemployed, evicted, lost housing, displaced by disaster. Are people that fall into those categories just forced into the existing categories you have in the pie chart? How are those people viewed from the CLC standpoint? Okay, we didn't have a pie chart in the presentation. Sorry? In that particular one? Okay, those are, okay, on these ones, these are categories that HUD listed. And those categories that were answered through our HIMS system, these are questions on part of an intake process for HIMS programs. And so out of 100% of the data, all these percentages represent the percentage that people fell into those categories out of 100% of the data that was put into HIMS for that particular year. And that's across all of the different programs. And those categories were, and this would be self-reported, self-identified information that people, households were telling the providers they were working with, and that's why they landed in those categories. And you're going to have families that don't fall into any of these categories. Are these categories provided by HUD? Are these categories required by HUD or are they provided? Could we add more categories going forward? These are the ones required by HUD. Could we add more categories to it? If requested? Yes, you can, but usually there's a cost because we're working with a vendor with our HIMS system. And when you go outside of what you're contracted with, if you're adding additional categories, if you're adding in additional work, then, you know, you've got to pay the vendor to put that into place. Also, there are specific programs where HUD says this is all we want. We don't want you to do anything else. We as a COC are always welcome to do anything else, but yes, it does come at a cost. And we have to make sure we keep that data clean, which is being reported back to HUD, and then that, which is what we're using for ourselves. All right. Scott, did you have a follow-up question? Yeah, thank you. So, Don, my concern is that if people don't fall into one of these six or eight buckets, if the real answer is something else, if they were, you know, you know, you're not going to be able to get them to the next level, you know, turned out by the campfire, and, but that wasn't one of the options they had, then they would have to self-report as whatever, addicted or mental illness or something else. They wouldn't have the opportunity necessarily to represent the issue that really created their homelessness. Is that correct? Within certain data fields, within certain programs, this particular data was taken from one program, well, it's a combination of all the programs. But we have other data sources, too. If you look at our point in time count, we did add questions in the most recent point in time count, which ask, are you a campfire survivor? And we have the ability to add questions when we're doing things like the point in time. There are a requisite number of questions that are required by HUD. Absolutely, we can't deviate from those, but we can add. And then we have to carefully make sure that we mine the data accordingly. When we do our point in time surveys, the results, you'll notice in the 2019 that you're going to have two different sets of numbers. You're going to have a set of numbers that is reported to HUD because HUD has got a much stricter definition for some of their things like what is the definition of homeless? So, what constitutes that? So, then you have a second set of numbers, which we do as a community. And that's a continuum because it gives us a much more colorful, a much more informed idea of who and where are people homeless. So, when you look at the 2019 report, you'll see that it says it's a survey, it's a community survey, and it's a report. The report are strictly the HUD numbers. The community survey is those additional questions that we can ask and put those type of questions in place. So, we have the ability to do that, but it takes a lot of, well, it takes money, it takes volunteers. And quite honestly, HUD doesn't give you money to do those extra things. Thank you, Don. I appreciate the work you do. Thanks, Scott. Anything further, Scott? No, thank you. All right. Council Member Denley, I believe you had some questions. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate the presentation. I actually like all the pie charts and things. It makes it easy to digest the information. Rather than like tables and tables of numbers. Thank you. So, I appreciate that. I was also just a little concerned about like budget and numbers and dollar amounts. I know there was a PRA done recently to figure out like how much money has come through the COC. I think it was around 26 million. I think that might have been back to 2018, but I'm not even sure what that timeline is. And I know it was noted that like to figure out how much money was given to which programs, the response was basically like you can go through the program and you can go through the minutes to figure out what dates certain programs were awarded money. But if you go to the website to find minutes to learn that there's no minutes since like November. Is there a reason there's not minutes available this year at all? You're a week ahead of us. We're getting ready to, we've been redoing our website. So, the county staff is going to be presenting probably by the end of this week the new look to the COC website. So, some of the data elements at this point, past minutes, past agendas, those kind of things may not be available. But by next, I think by Friday, at the latest, by the COC meeting on Monday, we're going to have that up and running. Okay, perfect. So, the announcement hasn't come out. So, we're just a couple days ahead of this. We're ahead of it. Okay, great. Well, I'll look forward to that. Yeah. Yeah. And then I have a couple other questions. I know we're about 70% into the 10-year plan from the COC. And we're sort of 70% in and we only have up to about a 20% or 25% achievement rate on the plan's goals. So, I'm curious what the COC's threshold is, where they would decide at what point it's declared that that plan's not working. Like, what is the threshold there for the outcome to decide, maybe that needs to get revisited if we're 70% in with only 25%? Just curious what the threshold is. The discussion has been that it's time to get an update. We absolutely need an updated strategy. We did put aside money when I say we. The administrative entity of the county put aside money in the homeless housing advocacy program dollars, the HAP 2 dollars, to redo and we'll put an RFP out to redo the 10-year plan. So, there is a strategy for that. Okay, perfect. And then just with, I know you had mentioned that HUD has some pretty strict guidelines on, you know, what the money can be used for. There's all kinds of strings attached. And with that in mind and the fact that a lot of times that hinders our ability to help people with some of their needs, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic, like you can't have treatment as a requirement for a program, things like that, in light of knowing that, does the COC have any committees or plans to make committees to advocate for change for funding requirements or for things like Lanham and Petra's Short Act? Do they get involved at all in advocating for that? I think on an individual basis, many of the organizations already do. I know that the county does. We do not have a specific legislative committee. But that should be something to note. I was going to ask you, do you think that would be considered? Actually had to target it for, you know, legislative action, so. Okay, perfect. Well, thank you. All right, council member Cannon, do you have some questions? In the outcomes, I did see that you had mentioned 88% of the permanent housing over six months. Is after six months, do the COC or the service providers keep track? Or that's where the hand-holding stops? I'm just curious to know. Because six months is a very small time. I feel like that, so maybe you can answer that first before I hear my feelings. It really depends upon the funding source, the organization, and the service being provided. With certain types of services and the funding sources, there may be a requirement that says you will follow these people for 24 months after successful completion of getting somebody housed. Just to ensure housing stability, you know, and make sure that that's done. And that's sustainable. Others, they say no. It's like once you get them in, that's the extent of the services you're going to do. And you're not allowed, it's not an eligible activity to continue providing services. So the strategy is, well, you come up with alternate people or alternate sources of support. Or not. And those are some of the gaps that are within our system. There are an awful lot of gaps. We realize that. There's not enough funding to take care of everything. So I also want to mention, I know you just mentioned that, you know, the funding sources come every year and the requirements are different. So why do we make a 10-year plan? Why don't we try to do a shorter-term plan so you don't have to revise it every few years? So you know what source funding, just a comment on that. Because if you have a 10-year plan and you know you are not going to have the funding for what you're looking for, then spending the time and the efforts to create a plan and then refine it. As for the funding sources requirements, just wanted to bring it to the attention because I know you're planning to do that. Best case scenarios, you do need to plan ahead. You need to have some type of plan, some direction. You would like to go if the funding becomes available and with the available funding that you do have. You do need to make a plan. It wouldn't make any sense to do this without a plan. And again, some things in the plan may become obsolete. You know, if the funding dries up for a particular thing like transitional housing, then that, it's still a need. It's still part of the plan. And if funding does become available, you've already planned for it. That's a way of thinking too, yes. But you know, if you know the short-term source, the funding is a short-term, right? So going according to the funding. Because if you have a plan and you don't have a fund, you've wasted the money in planning the plan. Yes. But thank you. It was very informative. Definitely. Thank you for sharing that information. I had one more really quick question. It was a short one I forgot to ask. I know you'd mentioned the like average percent of the better utilization. That was kind of just like a snapshot in time. And with COVID, the rates are down. Looking at trends, do you know off the top of your head what the numbers, the percentages were like the year before even, if we're seeing an increase or decrease before COVID to now? I think it's a good question. It's a good question. It's a good question. So that's a tip for that group that's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that it's not aware that of the handouts that were provided. Yeah, I just want to get it all on record here. And then it said the COC ensures the process is fair and equitable? That we do. And how do we do that? Well, by setting up a process to where we've got appeals. If you need, if there's appeal, there's an appeal process. There's a scoring process that weighs what is in the NOFA to what we're looking for. We try to align local priorities as best as we can. Okay. And it's done by committee. All this is done by committee. No, I understand. And then in terms of the point in time, are those questions universal? I mean, obviously the HUD question portion of that is universal. But in terms of, is there anything between the continuums of care where they're asking the same question in each individual continuum of care region? Or are those questions just determined by those individual continuums of care? Yeah, as you stated, there's the required HUD question. Sure. Everybody's got to do it. Many of the different continuums have very similar questions. And so it's not unusual for continuums, and like all the rural ones, may be talking. We do have a northern peer-to-peer committee that gets together on a monthly basis. And we talk about these things. It's like, hey, what are you asking on the point in time? Does this make any sense? What are your challenges? And so these are some of the talks that do happen. All right. And then I think in terms of the community, a lot of what I've heard from my constituency in terms of the point in time is the verification aspects of it. And that there's a lot of work to be done. There doesn't really even seem to be any. Is that something that's been looked into or some possibility in terms of verification or using the HIMS system to do some verification in terms of individuals and their locations and what their past history is? Within the point in time, there are several questions where you qualify the answers. For example, a question might be their identity. I say my name is Don Taylor. Sure. And then there's several questions after that, which the interviewee does not see. The person takes the question. taken the survey. But the person reporting the data says, I saw an ID, so you can verify 100% accuracy that I saw an ID, or I saw pieces of mail. So there are qualifying parts to those answers that the surveyor answers when we do these. And this helps to establish some of the validity. Sure. Have you ever thought of releasing that data in terms of how much we're actually verified versus unverified? I don't know if we have that data, because all these things were done by hand up until the last one. Sure. So I know that there's electronic data for the last one. And for the next one, we're going to go electronic, so I think it'll be much easier now that we're in the 21st century and we can do these things. Yeah, I'm just trying to determine if, you know, if you were actually able to view somebody's license, if you could at least note that in the survey, because then we could, you know, as a community, we could say, okay, yes, there was a verification done on 53 percent of all the people we talked to, or some kind of verification. Yeah, the technology's there, Mayor. It's just a matter of working it into our current point in time, the next time we do an uncharted one. Gotcha. And then, yeah, I'd still be very curious about, you know, the original meat of what I was looking for here, is to get the actual numbers in terms of what was spent each individual year, from year to year, and then, you know, separate it out if you can by area would be, I think, very helpful. I mean, I think that would really provide some benefit to us, so we could talk about how many dollars are coming into the city of Chico, and this is really part of this goal, is how many dollars are coming in, where they're being spent, and how they're being spent. And the more we can understand that, the more the public understands that, I think, the better off we're going to be. So if you could help provide that, maybe, Mr. Orman, if you could follow up on that. So we will get to that with time permitting with staff time, because most of the staff that are working with the COC are funding the COC. So, you know, we're going to have to do a lot of work to get that funded by the COC, or fulfilling the requirements of whatever grant it is, as far as data checks and monitoring and reporting. Well, let's talk about that for a second, too, because I know you had administration costs, and I know some of the grants cover administration costs. But in terms of cities that actually fund your administration costs, which cities in the county fund your administration costs? Currently, it is the county and the city of Chico. And with the county, it's two different departments. It's the behavioral health department. And it's the Department of Employment and Social Services. Do you know those numbers off the top of your head? I know it's quizzing you, but I don't expect you to know. Yeah, I believe behavioral health is $25,000 a year. DES was $20,000 a year. And I believe the city of Chico, it was $40,000. I think it's been reduced to, it's either $20,000 or $25,000. Okay. And I apologize, I can't remember that one. No, no, I understand. And then, I mean, obviously, the city of Paradise, Gridley, Big. Horville, they're still receiving services even though they're not funding the administrative level, correct? That is accurate. Okay. All right. Thank you. Right. Thank you, Kenley, for the invitation and the time. Actually, we have one more question from Council Member Dan. So, in your presentation, you mentioned that the system identifies the priority of the individual, the CES system, the coordinated entry systems. Is it the software that identifies on the basis of the individual? Is it the software that identifies the basis of the information? Who is prioritized? Yes. There. That's how it's done. Thank you. All right. Thank you both for your time. And then, Mr. Orme, if you could follow up with them on those numbers, we'd appreciate that. Madam Clerk, how many speakers? We have three. All right. And I'll get them in the right order. Jessica Gianola, followed by Nicole Nava. Oh, you just moved her to the front. I'm trying to make it up to her. All right. Go ahead. Okay. I just want to voice the appreciation of the detailed information on the COC, the Butte County COC. Just a couple comments. With their sheltering, it's transitional shelter, permanent supportive housing, which is something we really need in this area, not just places to put tents. But we need that transitional housing and supportive housing to get people functioning and real homes. This is how we get them settled. This is how we get them out of that transition. And we need to get them out of that trauma state that a lot of them are in right now. The funding questions, me as an outsider out here, I'm thinking to myself that maybe it might be easier to ask Don or the county of what are you missing and how can we help you fill that gap versus what's being spent here and trying to decipher what that means. Because unless you're understanding what the data is and all the grants involved, it may be really confusing and sparing. And I think that's why we're spending a lot of time looking at that. So maybe just asking what do we need? What kind of housing do you need? What support do you need from the city of Chico? The less barriers we have, the more supportive we can be in getting people housed. I know with shelters, there's a lot of barriers for people here in Chico. If they're a couple or they have pets, whatever it may be, those are barriers. And that's why people are out. So maybe funding and help in areas of other housing resources that we don't have available now. Maybe their grants prevent certain things. I don't know. So I think that's it. Oh, the ID thing. I can see how there's concern for making sure that our funding is going towards people who are from here. But I can tell you, working with people out in encampments, ID is a really, really hard thing to get for people, especially if they have been unhoused. They need to have an address to get an ID. And they don't have the money to get the address. They don't have the ID to get the PO box. So there's like this cycle involved here. So if they lose out and they get lost in the system and they don't have an ID, so many programs become inaccessible to them. So if we're looking at that as proving are they from here, we could be wiping out a population that needs to be housed. But we've put this big, huge barrier in front of them because we want to make sure they're from here. So if we can figure out a different way of approaching that, that would help house more people. So most of our people who are struggling to become housed, that's why they're in the encampments. They haven't been able to find a better way of getting housed because of these barriers. Okay, thank you. So Nicole Nava followed by Jeff Creed. Good evening again. I also appreciated the presentation. And I was able to read the number of reports that accompanied that. And so for those who are interested, I'm going to go ahead and read the first one. So that's a tip that a few of the vereity members expressed that it's not a valid tip that that's not valid for a state that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard plan that's not able to adopt that standard amounts so including like the grant dollars next to that great chart that was on the one slide with the you know this is an annual thing or this isn't would be super the on the part where in one of them it talked about the street outreach and the pit survey so the point in time survey for those who aren't sure what that is and I believe that's done like every other year and I get that we have the pandemic and that data was kind of gathered differently and only from like emergency places where you could find people okay I really find it and I'm separating this part from the county's piece right here this is in general comment it's distressing to me that we're this far down the road and when I've heard conversations it seems like no one can quantify who's out there this is a problem if we're trying to solve a problem so I would suggest we do much better as a community at whatever you're doing at getting that data so that then the other part for it to me is that performance outcomes the measurements the reporting so a lot of this documentation that was out there that I just talked about leans into the what and it leans into the who has what role and it leans into prioritizing what I didn't see it leaning into was what are those performance outcomes so do I need to leap to the 10-year plan do I draw the association that that means just specific to the COC so I think there needs to be a tip for that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means that that means county can and cannot do, and so they really are trying to follow specific guidelines, so we need to lean into the behavioral health side of things to say, we need your help with that treatment piece, and that might mean going to the state, it might mean going to the feds. Coming at the city council is very limited for us as the public, so we don't know. They're doing some intervention with veterans, with families that are rapidly housed, so they are doing some work, thank you. Our last speaker is Jeff Crean. Jeff Crean Sad thing about going last is everybody steals your thunder. So thank you, Mayor, because I was listening to this whole report and having all those same questions about dollars. So the first Greater Homeless Task Force meeting I went to, they said the 10-year plan was just there to get approved for grants. It wasn't really a plan, it was like a menu, you could select issues you wanted to work on. And that was what, four years ago? And today, you know, I don't know. It just, I listened to this as a citizen and as a skeptic of government because I've been disillusioned by or had my eyes open to paying attention to this city, and a lot of things popped up. This really sounds like another organization who doesn't want to have any clarity of what's going on, so they can not get scrutinized. And it was ironic, I was watching a newscast with a, I think it was a major general or a colonel or somebody over in the Israeli army, and he was complaining about, you know, the reporter was complaining about them being over-scrutinized about their actions in the war going on. And the Israeli officer said, no, we want to be scrutinized, we want to be judged, we want the scrutiny, we just want it equally. And it was such a poignant moment because it's like, here's the guy, under fire by the entire world, being scrutinized by an entire world, and he's saying, no, I want to be scrutinized, I want to be judged, I want to be graded on how I'm doing. I just want everybody to be graded on the same playing field. And when you hide information, you go to the COC website, oh, supposedly, you know, next week it'll be up, but, you know, I went through the minutes, all the minutes I could find, you know, to report on a certain councilor not showing up to meetings, and I didn't see anything about dollars in there. I'll go back and double check, there's still, I'll go back and double check, there's still a desk at home. But somebody talked about housing first. The other interesting thing, ID's, so somebody was talking about ID's. When I was homeless, there were half a dozen people who offered, organizations who offered, hey, come here, we'll pay for your ID, it's like $35, and you use this address and everybody knows it, and, you know, it's easy thing. So I don't know if Chico or Butte doesn't have any of those. You know, one of them, was the VSO office in Santa Cruz. You know, so I find that argument funny. The other one, self-identifying as an addict. There's a guy I know out here on the streets, chronic homeless person, he self-identifies as an addict, and he's trying to get disability because he's addicted to first-person gamers. I don't know how you live on the streets and play first-person gaming, but self-identifying is kind of up in the air. Last thing. If a COC is regional and some cities have their own, maybe it's time for Chico to make their own. All right. I actually have another comment, and I'm not sure even how to direct it. So I'm a little bit discouraged of the fact that the city of Chico is about $40,000 a year, the COC, while our other four cities in the county give zero. I don't know if anyone has any comment on that, but it certainly doesn't seem right to me. Anyone? Mr. O'Arm? What do you think? Yeah, you know, I think that in that time when they were putting together funding, the city at that time was notified that they were in need of funding, the city stepped up, and helped support the cause. I don't think there was an expectation or an acknowledgement of the term of when that would continue to be supplied. So obviously that's a council prerogative annually in the budget as it relates to whether or not they want to continue to fund moving forward. I think that having this opportunity, which you requested the council authorized to come forward to better understand it, to make sure that the money is being used in the way that the council desires, will allow you to make those decisions better in the future. Yeah, I'd love to look at that within our budget and actually have the COC go out to the other counties and make formal present, or cities, and make formal presentations and ask for them to contribute their fair share to that piece of the puzzle. So I don't know, do we need directive from anything more? This was for information purposes. I know that we got some direction out of the council to follow up on some of the financial aspects, other than that, if there's further direction, we're happy to receive it, but that's what I have to go back. I'd love to see us at least approach the COC in some discussions about that. Sure. Prefer not to eliminate that item from our budget entirely, but I'd love to take it down a little bit and have the other cities contribute. Have those discussions with the city managers at my regular quarterly meeting with the CAO, county CAO, and other city managers in the county. All right. Any further comment from council? All right. With that, we're going to take short recess. Thank you. Thank you for that opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening opening All right. Are we ready, folks? All right. We'll come back for item 5.2, confirmation of community development director appointment continued from the 6-121 meeting. Mr. City Manager, are you ready to go? Yes. Honorable Mayor, members of the City Council, thank you very much. The next few items here are continued from the last meeting, so bear with us. I'll breeze through these next two for you because they're very similar. Pursuant to Section 605 of the City Charter, I'm requesting Council confirm the appointment of Mr. Brendan Veague to the community development director position. Reliable, trustworthy, highly intelligent, a collaborator, a family man, and really just a cool dude. Kind of one of those personifications of Chico when I first got up here, and he really is reflective of Chico. Intelligent, hardworking, just wonderful, wonderful person. Mr. Veague's proven his dedication and desire to maintain excellence in government service. Therefore, pursuant to Government Code Section 5495.3c3, I have to say, I'm proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Brendan Veague as the community development director and I'm proposing to appoint Brendan Veague with an annual salary of $149,826. I hereby recommend Council confirmation of this appointment and I request your approval. Thank you. I have a question. Sure. Mr. Dowell, you are familiar with Mr. Veague. I've never met him before, but I've heard of him. Has he asked any advice? Any advice on how to influence the Council with, say, baked goods? We can bring him along on that. We can educate him on that part. I appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Further comment from Council? Some nice things said about somebody who deserves that. Nothing from Brendan. You want to chime in here? You're welcome. I support Mark Horm's recommendation. No, thank you. All right. Do we have any speakers on this item? We do not. All right. Motion from the Council? Move approval. Well deserved. All right. We have a motion. Do we have a second? Second. A second from Council Member Tandon. Madam Clerk, if you'd take the roll. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Dinley. Aye. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Mayor Kula. Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absent. All right. Thank you very much. 5.3 confirmation of Deputy Director. Continue from the 6-1-21 Council Meeting. Mr. Long. Yes. Mayor Scott, just for the public's acknowledgement, we still have to operate as city staff as under OSHA guidelines. That's why we're still wearing our masks, even though vaccinations have been in mass given to us. So anyway, that aside, also pursuant to that city, I'm going to take a motion to approve the City Charter. I tucked this in under it, even though these aren't obligated to fall under that as a Deputy Director position, but I think for transparency sake, particularly when I adjust the organization and go from a Director to a Deputy Director position, like on this one, I think it's important for the public to see that. I'm requesting Council confirm the appointment of Mr. Sean Huff to the Deputy Director, Community Development Building official position. I have full faith and confidence that Mr. Veague has chosen the right person for this job. Mr. Huff comes to us from the city of Visalia, has 30 years of experience in the community, and he's a member of the City Council. He has 30 years experience in the building inspection slash construction industry, with 15 of those years in a management capacity. A breadth of knowledge and experience that Chico will reap the benefits of, therefore, and pursuant to Government Code Section 5493 , I'm proposing to enter into an employment agreement with Sean Huff as the Deputy Director, Community Development Building official, and I'm proposing to appoint Sean Huff with an annual salary of $126,000. I hereby recommend Council confirmation of this appointment. Thank you. All right. Should we hear from Mr. Veague? What do you think? Do we have any speakers? No. All right. Entertain a motion? I'll move to approve. Second. Second from Council Member Morgan. Take the roll. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Dinley. Aye. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Morgan. Aye. Council Member Hinton. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-0 with one absence. All right. Thank you very much. Next item is mine, so I've got to get back to my notes here. All right. Mayor Coolidge requests, and this says Community Travel Bank, but I really meant to outline and did not use the right terminology, but a revenue guarantee fund. So is that correct? That is what I'd be looking to establish. I believe it's just another vital step in our progress towards returning commercial flights to the City of Chico. Obviously, we've had the funding which has taken place for the taxiway, and that's been, you know, incredibly helpful, and Congressman LaMalfa was helpful in getting that. We have the road widening coming to Cohasset. I know we're going to have some information out to the public on that fairly soon. So that's a big step in the process as well. And then I kind of view this as the last step, but I'll let Mr. Guffison take it from here. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge and Council. It's an honor to speak to you tonight. I thought I might take this opportunity to formally introduce our new airport manager to you. Mr. Tom Barr from Cholo, Arizona, has just arrived in Chico. Tom comes to us with about a decade's worth of experience in the role, has a master's degree in public administration from the University of Chico, and a master's degree in public administration from the University of Nebraska, the University of Cornhusker. And we're very happy for him to be here in Chico and take the role and take the airport to the next level. Welcome to the team. Well, thank you. And I'd like to say that I'm very happy to be here and to be able to serve the community of Chico. I'd like to say I've been extremely impressed with the public that I've met, as well as the staff that you have here for the city. It's a great airport. There's a lot of potential that it has, and I'm excited to be able to see it grow, to see that service return, and see how we can benefit Chico. Well, and I can say to your credit, too, the first time we had a conversation, you were actually, I believe, loading a U-Haul bound for Chico. So we appreciate your time out to do that and get things underway. So continue, please. Perfect. Thank you. And we just have a couple of quick slides that we just got. One I want to go to and bring you up to speed on our air service pursuit and kind of where we're at and what we're about to kick off here shortly as the industry returns post-COVID pandemic. So this is just kind of a brief roadmap, kind of a higher-level roadmap of some of the key points that we're going to embark on and look to accomplish here pretty quickly. And we've done some of these already and some of them out of order, but at least this is kind of an idea of what we intend to do in the coming months. So as everybody knows, we received a small community air service development program grant from the Federal Department of Transportation for half a million dollars, which is slated for a revenue guarantee fund. We have already propped up a fund and have an existing balance that you'll see on the next slide. But the next square is what we would like to do is form an air service committee with key stakeholders within the City of Chico from the private sector, educational sector, and city staff, potentially a council member or two, and an airport commissioner or two, and to really help shape and guide our process moving forward. We had an air service consultant on board. That contract has expired, and the individual we were working with, that particular air service consultant, has left that organization and moved on. So I kind of wanted to wait for Tom to get here and get his feet on the ground before we select another air service consultant. So that's up next and one of the items we would like to do. Also, we want to partner with a market. We're a marketing firm to help market our air service pursuits and Chico Airport. Pre-pandemic, we put an RFP out and had quite a bit of response, about nine applicants that submitted proposals for that. We've got it narrowed down to two. And again, an item that I wanted Tom to kind of get his eyes on and help us make a decision on that. So two items that we're going to decide here pretty quickly that Tom will do. So part of the task of forming the air service committee is to really start to hold informational educational meetings with the private sector and educational sector. And any sort of stakeholder out there that is enthusiastic, wants to be involved, and has a need for commercial air service. Through those, we hope to identify high mileage flyers in their associated airlines. Again, it's an opportunity for us to engage with the community, let them know where we're at and some of the improvements that are taking place at the airport. The taxiway improvements, the runway improvements, the Cohasset widening, air park improvements. Some of those items that we're doing, we'd like to educate the committee on those functions. And also hear from the committee. You know, we have the opportunity kind of as an hourly basis, Redding's retired airport manager, Rod Vinger, and kind of following some of the items that he was able to accomplish in his pursuits of commercial air service over time. This is really a learning experience. For them as well, it will be for us to find out who's out there and what type of air service needs they have, and who are the high mileage flyers. They were quite surprised. And this will help us form the direction for the key stakeholders that we'll pursue and try to partner with for a revenue guarantee fund. And that's kind of the difference between the two. The word travel bank is thrown out there a lot. It is an industry term. What we're after is a revenue guarantee fund. And that's really kind of a subsidy, if you will, but it's a little bit different. It's some insurance for an airline to come to a new market because they're going to incur immediate expenses as soon as they make the decision to come to Chico. And this kind of helps them and ensures them that they're going to have a little bit of a return through kind of a rough period until they get started. Sometimes they use them and it's there for that purpose. Sometimes they don't. And that revenue guarantee is the funds are returned to those who contributed to it. A travel bank is more kind of a prepayment scenario where you're prepurchasing tickets. It's a little cumbersome to manage. From an accounting perspective, it's not something we would want to manage. We've spoken to a lot of airlines on it. It's not something they're after and not a motivating factor for them to come to a new area. So we're really focused on the revenue guarantee, which again is an item that kind of lets an airline know that they have some guarantees that they will earn a certain return when they make the decision to come to a new market. Tom, if you want to take a couple of those remainder boxes. As Eric had mentioned, some of these items aren't necessarily in the order listed here, such as engaging the TSA. That's something we've already been able to start. They found out that we had received that SCASD grant and contacted the city, and we've met with them to do some preliminary discussions as to what would be needed to have them return for what's required for having air service here. And part of that is some improvements that would need to be made to the terminal. But in order to really make it to where TSA could operate, there's actually not a whole lot that would need to be done to have them come back, which is good to hear. As Eric was mentioning about the revenue guarantee fund, engaging stakeholders and the community is a really big part of that, to be able to grow that, to be able to really engage with them to show how this is going to benefit our community. And that is a key aspect of these steps here. And then, moving on from that, we would begin to market this to airlines, market our community and why it would be a benefit for them to come here. And then the question would be, was it successful? Did we bring an airline in? Did we have enough funds? And if it was yes, obviously we have air service, and that's great, and we continue to grow it. And if not, then we go back to the drawing board and see what we need to do to improve our strategy to bring them in. Thank you, Tom. So our current revenue guarantee fund, we have a fund established as Capital Project 50397. And from two previous budgets, we've allocated about $115,000 from the airport fund, $856,000, into that capital project. We have the $500,000 from our SCASD grant that's in there as well. So about $615,000 of cash. Part of our SCASD grant application included some fee waivers for the first two years, which is extremely common when enticing an airline into a new market. So we've put on paper we've committed to fee waivers for landing fee and terminal use fee waivers for two years, two-year term, and that's what that item is. So total, it's a pretty decent start for our package of about $865,000. At a minimum, we'll need $1 million in there. If we get closer to $2 million, that would really position us to be much more competitive compared to other markets. So that's our goal, somewhere between $1 million and $2 million to establish the revenue guarantee fund. And this is the scenario. We have a business case, and we believe we still have a business case as the industry returns. Last we checked, the industry is just under 70% what it was pre-pandemic. So these numbers from our Cashman Area Study are pre-pandemic, but we feel that they are still useful. And we want to see the industry return a little bit more versus going out at this point and spending some dollars to refresh these numbers. I think they're going to be very similar in the coming months to what they were pre-pandemic. And I'm just kind of going to draw your attention to our Cashman Area. This is our Cashman Area here. As you see, it's Butte County, a little bit of Tehama County, and it goes westerly to Glynn County. We hear a lot from folks, and I'm sure you do as well, Council, comparing us to Redding. You know, they see in the news, Redding has a few flights, or they've added a few more, and why can't we be like Redding? And the response is we're not in competition with Redding. They're not part of our Cashman Area. Our competition is Sacramento. And so what this number says here, this is Passengers Direct each way, or Passengers Daily each way, excuse me. It's our PDEU number. It's close to 700. So what that means is 700 people pre-pandemic were flying to or from our Cashman Area each day. 75% of them are traveling to Sacramento. And our business case is if we could capture 20% of that 75%, we could have two flights a day coming in and out of Chico. So that's our business case, and we feel these Cashman Area numbers are still valid, and this is what we'll continue to move forward with. So was the other 25% probably headed to San Francisco? San Francisco, yeah. Or Elkland or something like that. A couple others, yeah. So our immediate focused efforts, we're going to confirm an air service consultant. We're going to form an air service consultant marketing partner. We're going to form external air service committee and invite businesses to informational educational meetings. And then we're going to continue to engage those community stakeholders to bolster the revenue guarantee program. And that's it. And if there's any questions, we can answer them at this time. All right. Any questions? Well, I'd just like to thank you for being on board again. And, you know, our interim airport manager, Rob, was great too. He's got a lot of information, so glean everything you can from him because he was wonderful to pass along some really good information. Yes, yes. He has a great history, great experience, and we've already begun to use him and will continue. Yeah. Good wealth of resources there, so welcome. Thank you. Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have? Thank you, Chancellor. No speakers. None. All right. So anyone want to handle this motion? Yes. Thank you. So that's it for tonight's meeting. It sounds like staff has already… It sounds like they're already going… …moving down a path. Yeah. Really what staff's looking for is speak now or for…ever hold your peace. We're going to move forward with it… Engaging the community… So do you need some council members to be on the committee it sounded like… If… If the Mayor has that prerogative to appoint folks to… To… To… To… To… To… To… To… To… and we'll have to do a full survey. Council Member Denley will join me on it, if that's all right. That was the- I wasn't volunteering. Yeah, I know you weren't. All right, sounds good. So, all right, we'll move on to our next request, which is Council Member Brown's request, and I know community-wise there was some confusion with this, but we will let her take it from here. Yeah, no, it'll be brief. You know, at the last meeting, I felt like I got a lot of clarity on some of the unclear direction that happened on May 4th regarding community benefit agreements and the direction on cannabis policy. So while at that meeting and the subsequent meeting, I have some concerns. I don't believe a reconsideration is the appropriate place to discuss that, so I will move forward, just move on from this item. Okay. Then do we have no public comment? No. All right. Any council discussion? Anything further? Okay. All right, well, with that, we'll move on to our next item. So item 5.6, shelter, crisis declaration information, also continue from our 6-1-21 meeting. Mr. Owen. Bear with me for a sec here. Thank you very much. And this is another continued item from the last meeting. Bear with me. I know this is an information only item. I'll highlight that here a little bit later. Okay. This item was on the City Council's previous regular meeting, but time did not permit it to be heard. Please note that modifications were made to the original report, and that update of information is contained within the underlying portions of this report to make it easier for everybody to see which changes were made. A flashback in time shows that staff did not adequately express the potential fiscal impact of extending the shelter crisis declaration. I want to personally thank Councilmember Denleit for reaching out, seeking further clarity on an urgency bill, that placed requirements on those jurisdictions that maintain a declaration status. It was Assembly Bill 2553, which amended Section 8698.4 of the Government Code back at the end of September of last year, 2020. The new requirements request the local agency adopt a plan to move individuals from shelter to permanent housing, which would be due on July 1st, 2021. The bill added the submission of an annual report to the Senate Committee on Housing and the Assembly Committee, on Housing and the Assembly Committee, on Housing and Community Development each year as well. Therefore, staff time would be necessary to develop these documents. Showed approval to extend the declaration proceed. As you will also have noted, numerous benefits to the city would continue to be available if there was a desire for the city to create a shelter project by extending the declaration. The primary benefit of enabling Homeless Emergency Aid Program funds, those HEAP funds that we spoke to before, to become available to local entities will have been fulfilled through the term of the current declaration, which ends at the end of this month. With that, I have Homeless Solutions Coordinator, Calkins here as well to answer any specific questions related to any aspects of this item, but would welcome feedback as to direction moving forward. Please realize that this is not an action item, but information only. Three options that I see, I thought I'd kind of try to help square it up a little bit, should council desire my input on that. One option, if you give direction, is to give direction to the to give no direction to staff and let the current declaration expire at the end of the month. A secondary one would be to direct staff to prepare a new resolution and conduct a special city council meeting, should it be the goal of council to ensure there is no lapse in the declaration's status. And or the third one that I threw in there is acknowledge that should the council desire to reap the benefits of and bear the costs of having such a declaration in place in the future, that staff should be prepared to bring back a resolution once there is a need as determined by the council, as such a resolution can be prepared and placed on an agenda at any time in the future. With that, that concludes my report. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Orme. I had a quick question. In the report, Mr. Orme, this may be a question for Ms. Calkins as well. It says the third point down, per government, sorry, the fourth point down, that the city may allow persons unable to obtain housing to occupy from time to time, city designated facilities. My understanding with the emergency, with the shelter crisis declaration is that it could only be city owned property, but when it says city designated, that makes me think it expands beyond that. Can you elaborate there? Can you? It is city owned. City owned. Okay, so. Is what Ms. Calkins meant. City designated facilities, can somebody define that for me? That's just in the terms. Do you want to come on up? Yeah. That designation, it means that it's city owned property designated for the purposes of an emergency shelter. Thank you, I appreciate the clarity. That's my only question. Thank you, any other questions? Council Member Denley. I do have a question, and it would be directed towards the city clerk. Since I seconded this item coming back, I've since had questions about the validity of this coming, and I'm looking forward tonight for discussion based on previous minute orders. Can you clarify? Yes, I did actually just go through the minutes, and what had occurred was at the time that this item came up, it was actually Council Member Brown's item talking about utilizing the BMX site, and they made a motion, Council Member Brown and Council Member Huber, and then there was a friendly, not, excuse me, not a friendly amendment, but a substitute motion. And that substitute motion is the one that is actually being heard, because, and that's what triggered this, because the mayor asked for the substitute motion to come back with information as to the benefits of having the shelter crisis, the amount of funding. And so that's what precipitated this report tonight. So it wasn't actually Council Member Brown bringing back an item for reconsideration or anything like that. So I had, that was actually at the April 6th meeting when that first occurred, and so I had to go back and look at those minutes to get that. Any further questions? Public comment? Yes, we have four speakers. The first one is Jessica Giannola, followed by Nicole Nava. Hi, Council. Since the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the shelter crisis has not yet been extended, I feel like we need to keep reminding what we're up against if it is not. And what, if it's not, then we have partners, nonprofits within our community who work very hard every day to prevent people from becoming homeless or rehouse them if they are. And their funding is dependent upon us and our declaration, so it's really important to weigh that. And I believe that, I think, that we have a lot of work to do, and I think it was Don, don't quote me, but I think it was Don who had made public what those figures look like, and it was a substantial amount of money. So some of the arguments I've heard of why we shouldn't have an extension on the shelter crisis, and it has been said that because we have open beds available, and that's a very slippery slope to go down and equating one with the other. If we have open beds, then we must not have a shelter crisis when we could easily walk down to, you know, a, you know, Comanche Creek, and we can clearly see we have numerous unhoused folks, and we can ask why do we have open beds, and we can ask what the requirements are for using a bed. Maybe it's sobriety. Maybe it's that they have to have men and women. No in between. So if there's anyone who's in between, where are they going to stay? What if it's their husband or their wife, and they're told that they cannot sleep together every night for the next, six months, 12 months, whatever it may be, before they get transitional housing as a couple? So if you were in that position, you can imagine how hard it would be where you might opt to stay out in an encampment with your husband or your wife or your child, their adult child, any of those scenarios, then going into the few options we have for shelter here. So when we're saying we don't have a crisis, we need to look at what do we actually have out here, and we do. This was declared in 2018 before the campfire. We've had the campfire since. We've had COVID recession impacts since. We are growing in numbers of unhoused folks, so we need all of the resources that we have available to us, and we can get those resources by continuing the declaration. So anyway, I will continue to advocate for us extending it so that we can find our way out of the crisis. And if that means we need another two years or whatever it may be, then I think we should really consider it instead of making it a crisis. I think we should be making a political twist on it and going in a direction we don't need to go. So reality is we do have a housing crisis. Nicole Nava followed by Julie Wood. I feel like I want to do like one of those big movie things like I can't handle the truth, because the truth is it is not a sheltering of just we're homeless because we're homeless crisis. What we have is a mental health crisis. What we have is an additional crisis. What we have is an addiction crisis with both conditions being untreated. And so I feel like we sit here railing about things at a city council where there are a couple that want us to be in the homeless business. So I want to acknowledge that, because again, when I came here last time, I said I feel like the question before you first and foremost before any of this stuff when we talk about it is do you want to be in the homeless business or not with the city of Chico? And you guys are up there because people put you up there that want certain things. And I think the overwhelming majority made it clear they don't want to be in the business and they want their city clean and safe. I think there's ways that both sides can be served with certain actions happening. I would love to see us all coalesce and put the energy where it is deserved, which is upon the county, which has behavioral health services, which my understanding is now I don't even know. It was like I can't even remember, but high 70 million or something like that the last time. And again, like the COC topic, I think it's important that that's a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not a part of that plan that's not conditions out there that are crying out for help. And for whatever reason, people at the state and federal level are like, ah, let's throw billions at houses and not having the plans built in where they have to obtain treatment. And I do understand what the mandates are and that we cannot force people to be helped unless they're a danger to themselves or others. I would posit to you that absolutely they're a danger to themselves or others because there are fires happening with propane explosions where there were burn victims of the people themselves who started the fires. And there are businesses and there are homes near these areas where this is happening. That is absolutely a danger to others. At what point will we rise and will we rise at the city level to look to the county and to look to the state and to look to our federal government and insist upon change? I would love to see you all have a day where you get it in an hour. I don't care. I would happily fund everybody. So that means that we need to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to for hearing us tonight. I've been volunteering for the past two and a half months and getting involved and seeing how we can find solutions. And I think that it's absolutely essential to continue the shelter crisis declaration. It is supporting all of the social agencies that are keeping keep
