But hopefully the lights will be green when I go home.  ...  ...  ...  ...  Thanks.  So Council Member  Ori.  You have the longest  record of public service  both on the council  and in the community amongst  us. We've also had  the longest break.  We have had council members  go off council and then come back, but I  think this is something for the  record books. And it demonstrates your  commitment  as a council member,  as a community  activist, and someone  who cares passionately  about our community.  This last  term or sentence  you served on internal affairs,  the Butte County Water Advisory  Committee, Butte County Air  Quality Management District,  Butte County Emergency Services  Council, Housing Ad Hoc  Committee, Chico Urban  Area JPA,  Local Government Committee,  Three Core Economic Development,  and was the council liaison for the  Chico Chamber of Commerce.  Your  role in the community  has just been expansive,  but note  I would say  your dedication to  keeping the farmer's market downtown,  in its current location,  making sure that the Green Line  is preserved,  and was preserved,  created and preserved,  your dedication to the airport,  and doing everything you can  to make sure that we get commercial  air back, and your work  at the Red Cross. So I want  to thank you for your service to  the community.  We have a  certificate of  recognition.  This is signed by our state  representatives,  James Gallagher  and Jim Nelson.  Yes, and a  beautiful plaque  in recognition of your four years  of outstanding leadership, significant  contributions, and a simple array  of commitment to our community.  Thank you so very much for your  service.  Thank you. ! Thank you. So it was 35 years ago when I left the Council after then my second term. Thank you. So it was 35 years ago when I left the Council after then my second term. 35 years, 43 years since I was first elected. So I want you to imagine for a moment that it's, I had to write it down, 2055.  ...  ...  ...  ...  down 2055, 35 years from now.  The perspective of seeing the city grow over 35 years  and how it will grow again continues to grow.  In 2035, I was trying to, excuse me,  2055, imagine that we have returned to the airport,  that we would have a recalibration of our development  policies so that we see affordable housing.  But we'll see families grow, and we'll  see some of you still here, still leading us.  I wanted to acknowledge that my son Sam and his wife  are back here tonight.  Sam was born in my first term on the council.  I won't tell your age, but obviously, we're more than 35.  But thank you very much.  It's been an honor and a privilege to serve the city.  Very few people actually have that great honor,  and I will cherish it forever.  Best of luck to the city.  Best of luck to all of you.  And if I could ever be of help, please let me know.  Thank you.  I'll stay for a minute.  Council Member Lurie, I'll be brief.  I just wanted to say.  It's been an honor to serve with you over the last two years  and to learn with you and alongside you and from you.  Thank you for your grit, for your advocacy,  for your leadership, and for your support.  You will be missed.  Thank you, Alex.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  Council Member Stone, will you please join me?  Thank you.  Thank you all for this wonderful ... Randall, think what distinguishes you most. It is your passion for this community and your intelligence. It's been said that you are playing chess when the rest of us are playing checkers.  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  mayor. The work that you've done for the League of California Cities has brought  distinction to the city of Chico and we thank you for that. Serving on the Finance  Committee for eight years, Butte County Emergency Services Council,  Local Government Committee, BK, Town & Gown, Police Advisory Committee, Greater  Chico Homeless Task Force, Greater Ad Hoc, the Housing Ad Hoc Committee,  Emergency Planning Ad Hoc Committee. I know that you're going to continue to  stay involved in our city. You're proud of your family, your wife and your  sons, so the dedication that you have to making our community a better one for  their future is appreciated. We also have a certificate of recognition from  Assemblyman  Member Gallagher and Senator Nielsen. They actually signed it. And a plaque that recognizes your term as  Councilmember and Mayor, your eight years of outstanding leadership, significant  contributions and exemplary commitment to our community. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm not very good at these types of things, but I will say it's been an honor and privilege that's never been done.  ...  ...  ... I've grown so much personally and professionally and politically through the involvement that I've had with the city and the staff.  ...  ...  ...  ...  through the involvement that I've had with the city and the staff.  And I want to say thank you to all the members of staff who pushed this along  through some incredibly difficult times.  To the new members of council that I'm on,  that involved the League of California Cities.  It changed my perspective in the way that we should be handling policy,  and I think everybody should be driving more and more experiences like that,  and more and more engaging with other communities.  It's been just the love of my life to be working with this community,  and in this capacity.  It's been extraordinary.  So I'm not sure that too much has been changed,  and I don't feel like saying goodbye.  It's been just so fantastic to have been involved with the city in this capacity.  We're changing modes, and I'll go back to the same type of things  that I've been doing before that time,  that I did at Joint Council.  So for that,  thank you very much to all staff.  Thank you very much to the community,  and I've had a good time in my life.  Thank you.  I did receive an email today,  and was requested to read it from Andrew Meriden,  the Executive Director of North State Builds.  And he said,  on behalf of the thousands of skilled and trained construction workers  under the North State Builds umbrella,  I wanted to take a moment to thank Mary,  and Schwab,  Council Members,  and Ernest Stone,  and Carl Ory,  for their time and work on behalf of the residents of the City of Chupel.  While I hope to present these comments in person tonight,  I hope these words still resonate with the three of you,  as they are heartfelt in nature.  The three of you love the community you live in,  and have dedicated many hours to improving the lives of the people you represent.  We commend them.  You have also shown a commitment to supporting the working class,  because you understand the plight of workers.  We can only hope future Councils will show the same respect towards this segment of the community.  You've put people over corporations, science and fashion,  over fear,  wrong-wearing,  and common sense ahead of radical philosophies.  You have truly made a difference in Chupel.  While leaving Chupel's Council is never easy,  regardless of the manner in which one leaves,  please understand your legacy of leadership in Chupel will not be forgotten.  You've each focused on the work you do,  on the core issues that matter to the people of Chupel,  and you've each played a role in bringing meaningful improvements to the city as a whole.  We hope you will each stay involved,  as you each have so much to offer.  On a night that may not be easy,  please remember that you have been friends,  and support and acknowledge the work that you've done,  the time you've sacrificed,  and the changes you've made,  including us.  History will be kind,  jobs will be of use.  On behalf of our members,  I would like to contact your partners and the affiliated unions that make up board members.  Thank you for everything you've done in Chupel.  All right.  Council Member Long, I think it's your turn. You've got to give me six feet, because this isn't going to work. There should be thousands of people here inside on the steps.  ...  ...  ...  ... Annie Bidwell was a pioneer and will forever be remembered as a luminary of Chico.  ...  ...  ...  and education. She was greatly concerned about greenways, they didn't call them that then,  the future of the troop to Native Americans, and education. Many of the things that draw  people to Chico and contribute to its magical nature are rooted in causes championed by  Annie Bidwell. Bidwell Park, donated by her to the city and the very land our university  sits on, are two of the best examples. In 2004, just about 100 years after Annie Bidwell  donated the land for the park to the city, Anne Schwab was elected the Chico City Council.  Like Annie Bidwell before her, Anne Schwab has been dedicated, passionate, and hardworking.  Like Annie Bidwell before her, Anne Schwab has been instrumental in shaping Chico. Like  Annie Bidwell before her, Anne Schwab has made meaningful contributions to many, if  not most, of the aspects that make Chico a great place to live. Anne left her own park  legacy when she worked with city planners and designers to ensure accessibility for  park pedestrians and cyclists long before it was fashionable. A well-known advocate  for Bidwell Park and downtown Chico businesses, Mayor Schwab has always been eager to work  for needed change wherever she recognized it, and as a result, advanced the diversity  action plan, supported the finance committee, boosted the sustainability task force, and  literally helped write Chico's general plan.  land. Crossing the divide from municipality to university, Mayor Schwab has been a powerful  force on the Town and Gown Committee, as well as an extremely popular leader of one of Chico  State's best-known and most impactful student organizations, Community Action Volunteers  in Education, or CAVE. In fact, an untold number of Chico State alumni learned about  community wellness and volunteering because of Mayor Schwab's dedication to both our  city and our university. Not an idyll of Mayor Schwab's work with all manner of volunteers,  civic and business leaders, politicians, friends and foes. While not everyone always agreed  with her positions, those of us that know her well knew we could always count on a fair  hearing and a well-reasoned viewpoint when working through city issues with her. This  is, I believe, the reason Anne was chosen by her colleagues to represent the city of  Chico as mayor, not once, not twice, but three times.  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  half of a grateful community, a grateful citizenry, none of whom will truly know your dedication  and commitment to this community.  Thank you for all you have done and meant to the city of Chico.  This key to the city is a symbol of the awe and distinction in which you are held by the  community you have served tirelessly for over 16 years, and it means you never need an invitation.  You are always welcome back.  And like Annie did well before you, you will forever be remembered as a luminary of Chico.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know what that is?  And this mayor has been a long time coming.  Thank you.  It's my privilege to be here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  my fellow council members, city staff, and community members for your incredible support  during that journey.  Whenever I travel and people ask me about Chico, I tell them about our tree-lined streets,  downtown, the University of Midwell Park.  But I always tell them the best thing about Chico, the thing that makes Chico really special,  is the people who live here.  People like you, who build each other up, who volunteer in our parks, mentor our children,  and care for our older adults.  People who opened up their homes to the community of Oroville after the dam crisis, and then  those fleeing from the campfire.  Throughout my time on council, wonderful things have happened to me.  The best part has been hearing from you.  Members of the community.  Through letters, emails, phone calls, at city council meetings, meetings in my office, meet  the mayor, outreach events, at the farmer's market, coffee shops, or just walking in the  park.  Through thousands of these encounters, I get to hear concerns and dreams, and got to understand  what made Chico, Chico.  That has been a priceless treasure.  It's been inspiring to work hard, to do more, to admit, and to never give up.  Throughout this time being a council member and your mayor, it was never a rut.  It was always a groove.  It was always personal and always a great honor to serve you.  Through it all, there's been a lot of great things happened.  engagement and a lot of controversy. This is Chico after all. What kept me going, pushing, and having  resolve not to give up was that I knew we were making a difference, working in  each of our own ways to make Chico the best community we can call home. My wish  for the council and the community is to embrace understanding the differences in  our community, find ways to work together, put others first, find solutions, listen  with your ears, and act with your hearts. We must do more and work harder to  understand, learn, and make a difference.  We must work together to build support and care and respect for each other. It has been an honor, such an honor, to serve this community. My heart is very full. It's been quite a ride to have a front row seat and so many beautiful acts of kindness and service.  Thank you and good night.  Thank you.  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  And, you know, it's your passion, I think, for the disadvantaged and the people without voices that will be your legacy.  And it's very much appreciated.  Carl, really one of the reasons that I got on the council was the year before I ran, I watched you at every meeting.  And I was just so impressed by your advocacy and your determination and your doggedness.  So thank you for that.  You guys had a bomb dropped on you halfway through this last term.  And you still put your heads down and you showed up to every meeting.  And you got the job done.  Good job, guys.  I just want to say one final word to all of you.  I think what I realized as I was thinking about tonight is that we're losing three fantastic leaders,  but we're also losing a breadth and depth of institutional knowledge and history tonight.  I genuinely look forward to working with you outside of this capacity.  And I'm proud to have served with you.  So thank you all.  Thank you.  If you could just give us a few minutes to gather our belongings, we'll move to the next step of slaying the new leaders.  Thank you.  You can take that.  Gather these things.  Go get your purse.  Gather my pants.  Gather my stuff.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So at this time, I will be conducting the swearing in of the new council members,  and I'll be doing them individually and in alphabetical order,  and that way their families can come in during that time frame.  So I'd like to call Andrew Coolidge in with his family.  And they're in another room, so it'll take just a second.  Thank you.  And the family.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You guys can actually just find a seat, and you can sit down.  And you can sit together.  Okay with that?  Yes, we will.  All right.  So congratulations.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Thank you.  Thank you. her spot. I just want to kind of go over what we're going to do next. It's the selection of the mayor and the vice mayor positions. These positions serve in that capacity for two years, and they're appointed by the council itself.  the council itself. So the way that it works is that I will just open up for nominations and I'll  take them in the order received and then we'll vote on or you will vote on them. And the first  person receiving four or more votes becomes then either the mayor or the vice mayor. I do the mayor  first and then I go and we fill that vice mayor position. Are there any questions about that  process? You don't have to do a motion to close the nomination period. It's just if I just close  it automatically if there are no more nominations. So nothing that formal. Any questions? Okay, I will  open up for nominations for the position of mayor serving for two years. I'd like to nominate  Casey Reynolds for mayor. Thank you. Okay, just a moment. And are there other nominations? I'd like  to nominate.  Casey Reynolds.  Okay.  Are there any other nominations? Okay. All right. So I'm going to take the roll call vote on  in alphabetical order. So Council Member Brown.  Aye.  And this is on for Coolidge. Excuse me, for Council Member Coolidge. I apologize for not  spelling that out.  Council Member Coolidge.  Aye.  Council Member Denley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Reynolds.  Aye.  Council Member Tandon.  Aye.  Okay. That's seven votes. So Council Member Coolidge will become our mayor for the next two years. So for the position of vice mayor, I'll open up those nominations.  Okay.  That's 16 votes on this ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  Mayor Coolidge. Aye.  That carries 7-0. So for  Council Member Casey  Reynolds is now our Vice Mayor.  And so I'm going to call for about a 10-15  minute break and so I can get the  equipment set back up and  I'll rearrange the seats so  that we have the Mayor over where  the Mayor goes and the Vice Mayor. So  thank you and we'll take a quick break.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Alright. Madam Clerk, are we ready?  Yes. Yes, we  are.  Okay.  So at this time we'll call the meeting back to order  and  And we'll ask the city clerk to do a roll call.  Okay.  All right.  Council Member Brown?  Here.  Council Member Denley?  Here.  Council Member Huber?  Here.  Council Member Morgan?  Here.  Council Member Tandon?  Here.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Here.  And Mayor Coolidge?  Present.  All right.  Public participation in this meeting is being conducted in accordance with Executive Order N-29-20.  The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video with the link found on the city's website.  The Engaged Chico Civic Engagement Program was available for citizen input on individual agenda items until 4.30 today,  with all comments provided to the City Council.  During the meeting, public comment will be accepted by email sent to publiccomments, with an S, at chicoc.gov during the meeting.  Prior to the close of the public comment on an item, the public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item,  and not to comment on numerous items in one email.  So if you want to comment on multiple issues, you have to send multiple emails on each of those particular issues.  All right.  So we'll start with business from the floor.  Members of the public may address the Council at this time on any matter not already listed on the agenda.  The Council cannot take any...  Any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda.  Madam Clerk, do we have any public comments?  So, yes.  In Engaged, which just for the new Council members, you'll see this...  The printout of the Engaged comments.  We print those out.  We take comments up until 4.30 the night of the Council meeting.  That's through the Engaged Chico component.  We bring copies of it over to you so that you have it in front of you.  And we received for...  Let's see.  For business from the floor in Engaged, we received 11 comments.  And I'll read the names off while...  I don't know how much time you want to give them to read them.  Yeah, I think just a couple of minutes to review comments.  Okay.  And while you're reviewing those comments, I will tell you and read into the record who they were received from.  Jessica Giannola, Juanita Sumner, Daniel Rodriguez, Ruth Sarnoff, Kim Dietz, Arlene Chavez, Robin Engel, Rob Berry, Taylor Skinner, Michelle Cooper, and Nicole Nava.  All right.  So, if everybody wants to take a few minutes to read those comments, and then we'll move on to the next item in a minute.  All right.  All right.  And Mayor Coolidge, checking into the public comments, we did not receive any under business from the floor.  Okay.  So, those are all that you have.  All right.  So, with that, we will go ahead and move on.  All right.  So, item eight on the regular agenda, consideration of an urgency ordinance of the City of Chico allowing for the enforcement of Title 12R rules and regulations of Bidwell Park and other properties.  Item nine is for parks and playgrounds.  And we have Mr. Tony Lindsey presenting.  I believe there is.  Welcome.  Thank you.  Good evening.  Mayor Coolidge, Westmere Reynolds Council.  I'm Tony Lindsey, Community Development Director, Building and Code Enforcement.  I'd like to present to you this evening an introduction of an urgency ordinance of the City of Chico amending Title 12 parks of the Chico Municipal Code.  Thank you.  Thank you.  12.18 park rules and regulations. Staff has received increasing complaints from the public  regarding public order disturbances and violations of the Title 12R park rules and regulations by  visitors of the park. While staff and park rangers have attempted to enforce the rules by issuance  of code enforcement letters and citations to gain compliance and some voluntary compliance  has been attained many times despite numerous notices first, second, third, final. Compliance  has not been achieved. The ordinance adds chapter 12.18 titled enforcement park rules to the Chico  Municipal Code. The ordinance allows for enforcement of rules and regulations previously approved by  city as codified resolution and currently found in 12R.02 through 12R.32.  Such ordinance will create additional enforcement abilities beyond the administrative process and  allow enforcement of such rules and regulations through citations and prosecution as misdemeanors.  The ordinance is presented as an emergency ordinance to preserve the peace, welfare, health,  and safety. If passed, the emergency ordinance shall become effective immediately. This ordinance  is also presented as an ordinance for introduction with the second reading to occur at a future  meeting.  This additional tool may be utilized by code enforcement officers, park rangers, and police officers.  That concludes my presentation and I, as well as public works guest assistant who oversees the parks, and police chief  man are available for questions.  All right, any questions? Mr. Mayor, if I could add one thing regarding the staff presentation. This item is presented to you both as an emergency ordinance for adoption tonight, effective immediately.  As well as what we call best practices of doing also a first and second reading. So it is being introduced for the first reading of the ordinance. The second reading will happen at the next council meeting. That will allow the ordinance to go on beyond the 180 days in which an emergency ordinance is limited to under the Chico City Charter. So this is a way to have an immediate impact on the city.  As well as a long term effect of bringing these park rules into the part of the city code that allows for enforcement by the police, the code enforcement, and park rangers.  Thank you, Mr. Chair. Council Member Brown, I believe you had a question.  Thank you, Mr. Lindsay, for your presentation. Can you help us and the public understand with the introduction of this ordinance, how does our process change for intervening with violations?  It gives us the additional tool to do that.  It gives us the additional tool to enforce the rules as misdemeanors.  So like in layman's terms, it just would allow us to immediately enforce as a misdemeanor as opposed to notices and citations?  Maybe more of our gross violators, repeat offenders, I mean the people that rise to the occasion that we can complete violations and complaints about.  Thank you, I appreciate it. And this may be a question for the city attorney.  Can you help us understand how the city is going to be able to enforce these rules?  And how enforcement of this ordinance might be affected by the Martin B. Boise case or any other related cases, particularly as it relates to anti-camping against those without shelter alternatives?  So currently these exact same rules and regulations are in the city code as codified resolution rules of the park.  That means that they are not in the city code.  They are not in the city code.  And they are not able to be cited upon and taken to court either as a citation or a misdemeanor.  So as Mr. Lindsey said, a violator of any of these park rules could be issued in administrative citation currently and go through the admin site process.  This will allow things to be taken either to court as an injunction or as a misdemeanor or citation.  Citation violation.  As for other court decisions, Martin B. Boise, the Jones decision, etc.  This will do nothing to alter those.  Those still apply as they have before and will not affect the ability of adopting this.  Will not alter that range of rules.  And will not affect the ability of issues applying to the city of Chico.  Just like really quickly if you could expand on what that range of issues are.  Sure.  So as you're aware, in Martin B. Boise, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal addressed whether or not an ordinance by the city of Boise was criminal and usual punishment.  And that ordinance basically was a criminal and usual punishment.  And that ordinance basically prohibited citywide anyone from camping outside with any type of shelter.  And it was a very overreaching ordinance that was, again, an application everywhere in the city.  And the most minimal amount of shelter including even a blanket.  And one of the rules that came down from that was that the city of Boise was not allowed to have any kind of shelter.  And the only rule that was that it would be criminal and usual punishment to apply that citywide.  And basically prohibiting people from being outdoors with any type of shelter.  Including just merely a blanket.  Unless there was sufficient shelter space available within the city.  And so that stands.  That case actually went for a slight modification of the order.  Upon its first coming out, there was very minor modification.  But that still stands as good law.  And application of this ordinance would still have to abide by that.  Now this ordinance that's being proposed does not apply border to border within the city.  It is limited to park spaces.  And those park spaces are not allowed.  And the reason for that is because the park spaces are clearly defined in the exhibits A through L.  Particularly in exhibit K called parks.  Thank you. I appreciate it.  Alright. Any other comments?  Councilmember Denman?  Yeah. So I had a question for staff.  When I was reading through the staff report, and thank you for bringing that to us.  I was reading through it and I noticed that in the language it doesn't seem like the pine mulberry wedge is the  one that is included in those greenways and adjacent waterways.  And since that is a high risk area with the traffic, I was curious what the view is on that in the ordinance.  Is that the pine cypress?  Yeah.  Yes.  So that question, it came up and we analyzed it last week.  And indeed, I mentioned exhibit K.  It is on exhibit K as an orange dot.  It's a speck there.  But it's clear that the intent when K was adopted as a concrete.  And it's a modified resolution that it would apply to that area as well.  Any other questions?  Alright.  Madam Clerk, public comments?  Yes. In the Engage Chico platform, we received 12 comments.  And I'll read those names in just a moment.  And we did receive one email in public comments.  That one was from Amanda Roe.  Amanda Riley.  And then in the Engage Chico, while you're reading those comments,  those came in from Jessica Giannola, Ruth Sornoff, Daniel Rodriguez,  Margaret Hicks, Amanda Riley, Adri Long, Kim Dietz, Robin Engel, Rob Berry, Juanita Sumner, Michelle Cooper, and Nicole Nava.  Alright. Does anybody need more time to review those?  Yeah.  Okay.  Just take a few minutes to review those comments.  Okay.  Mr. Jarrett, while they're reading that, can I ask you a question?  Certainly.  So, of the two options, the full reading and waiving the full reading, is there a difference?  Yes.  There is.  And they really aren't options.  They can be options.  You don't have to do both.  If you choose to do the first only, then this becomes an urgency ordinance.  So you have to do the first full reading and the second one is adopting.  So, number one, under recommendation, number one is the process for adopting.  This is an urgency ordinance.  And it would go into effect immediately.  If you only did number two, you would have first reading.  It would not be effective as of tomorrow.  Thank you.  You'd have to have second reading.  And then it would be effective 30 days after that.  Understood.  And so, this is what we call...  I'm not talking.  I got it.  Okay.  Well, my recommendation, the staff recommendation is to do both.  Yes.  And I do want to make one note that two other comments on this item, on item 8.1, came in  from Patrick Newman and Eileen Robinson earlier.  And you received that in your email.  And I think that's what you sent in your email accounts.  When was the Patrick Newman one sent?  It was sent earlier this afternoon.  Let me check.  And I think it was in the email.  I think it came in the regular email accounts.  So what you have before you, it's not in there.  You don't have it in your Outlook?  Oh, I've got it.  Yep.  Yeah, I got it.  Okay.  Thank you.  And so, just because I didn't really explain this up front.  So Engage Chico, you will get in hard copy.  Okay.  Public comments, you'll get through your Outlook account as the meeting is going on.  So you may have to go back and forth.  For those who are using iLegislate, you may have to go out and go into your Outlook to  look.  And those will be forwarded from Mrs. Rogers?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Does anyone need any more time?  Okay.  So with that, then we'll have any other questions?  Questions or comments by Council at this point in time, I'd like to make a motion that we  approve the urgency ordinance.  City Council of the City of Chico amending Title 12 of the Chico Municipal Code by amending  Chapter 12.8, Park Rules and Regulations.  And Mr. City Attorney, we'd also need to do the following ordinance as well, correct?  That is staff's recommendation, yes.  Okay.  So moved.  Second.  Read the whole thing?  Yes.  So at this point, the clerk will have to read the entirety of the emergency ordinance.  The other ordinance or the version of it would be waived.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  How many pages is it?  Any comments?  Well, the print might be a little larger.  So I don't know.  Any questions?  It's a few pages.  Council Member.  About ten.  Good to go.  Yeah.  I'd like to provide sort of an alternative.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I don't think that is in any view of this and how it should be dealt with.  So there are, to my way of thinking, there are a couple of flaws in this.  There are a couple of items that are virtually unenforceable based on the fact that we don't  have an alternative.  Those would be 12.18.250, the rubbish ordinance.  And the other would be 12.18.430, which is the camping ordinance.  I don't think that is in any way in any way in any way in any way in any way in any way  I am perfectly fine with everything else in there except those two.  And my reasoning for those is I think that 1218-250 should be put off  until we have sufficient number of trash receptacles in the park.  I don't think there are.  Just to satisfy myself, I drove by that little corner of the park right at the park gate.  And there's, I don't know, a dozen, 20 tents there.  I didn't see a trash receptacle.  There may have been one.  I didn't walk through there.  But certainly with that many people,  if there were that many people camping anywhere else in a state park or whatever,  there would be a dumpster.  Or somewhere for them to take their trash.  So, you know, one is sort of dependent on the other.  The camping thing has to be solved before you can solve the trash thing.  But as long as there are people camping there,  there needs to be sufficient trash receptacles to be able to say that it's okay to enforce a rubbish ordinance.  The second part and the bigger part,  is 12-18-430, which is the camping ordinance.  You know, if we were being asked to approve a rule that said  we should be able to cite people for crossing over the line on the highway,  but we didn't have any plans for painting the lines on the highway,  that wouldn't make any sense.  If we said we're going to start,  we want to enforce a rule about crosswalks,  but we haven't painted any crosswalks,  it wouldn't be worth doing.  It wouldn't be right to do.  And we have not provided an alternative yet for anyone to go.  And if we accept this camping rule at this time,  all we do is we start driving people out of the park and into neighborhoods,  and deeper into the park,  and into other places we don't want them.  The solution is not to put the cart before the horse,  not to approve an ordinance about stopping camping.  It's about the correct thing to do is provide a place for them to camp.  And, you know, as everyone here is perfectly clear,  we have,  we have failed miserably at that,  and with nothing in the foreseeable future.  So, you know, on the Enterprise record this morning,  there was an article about food lines growing all over the country.  People lined up in their cars or lined up on the sidewalks  because the economy is getting so bad.  We are only going to see an increase in this,  and until we solve this with a sanctioned campground,  prohibiting camping is wrong.  Any other comments?  All right.  With that, we have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk.  Okay, and so...  You will have to read the...  I will have to read it.  I've got the whole thing.  It's a little lengthy.  Yeah, I can do that.  So, for the audience,  because it's an emergency ordinance,  and going through the process,  going into effect,  it has to be read in its entirety.  So, it's an emergency ordinance of the City Council  of the City of Chico,  amending Title 12 of the Chico Municipal Code  by adding Chapter 12.18,  Park Rules and Regulations.  Whereas the City of Chico City  is a charter city incorporated under the laws  of the State of California,  and whereas under Article 2, Section 201,  and Article 6, Section 609 of the Chico City Charter,  the City Council has the power to make and enforce  within the Chico City Charter,  the City's jurisdictional limits,  all local police, sanitary,  and other ordinances and regulations.  And whereas Section 612 of the Chico City Charter  establishes that the City Council,  upon four affirmative votes,  has the power to make and enforce  as an emergency measure for the preservation  of the public peace, welfare, health, and safety,  an emergency ordinance by reading such ordinance in full  and adopted at the same meeting.  And whereas the City Council finds  that it is necessary to make and enforce  the existing regulations for city parks  found in Title 12R, Chapter 12R.04,  into the Municipal Code so that the City can abate  and address the issues of breaches of public peace  and threats to the welfare, health, and safety of the public  due to the recent increase in the number of violations  of such established rules by codifying such rules  under the enforcement provisions  of the Chico Municipal Code by ordinance.  And whereas the City Council desires  to protect the public health,  safety, general welfare,  and quiet enjoyment of property in the city  by the adoption of this emergency ordinance,  which shall take effect the day following enactment  and shall be applicable for a period  no more than six months after adoption.  Now, therefore, be it ordained by the City,  by the Council of the City of Chico, Section 1.  The City Council of the City of Chico  hereby determines and finds as follow.

So there you have it. Well done. That was no easy feat. Next time let's just read what we're  allowed to do in the park. Would have been finished a long time ago. So are you ready for the vote?  Go ahead and call the vote. I just have a quick comment. Oh yeah. It's going to start with me  anyway but I'll be voting no to tonight.  Specifically as the ordinance relates to camping and park closure hours. Many of the items in the  ordinance seem appropriate to me. I just had it read to me again so thank you for that. But until  we have adequate sheltering alternatives in place, be that a campground, shelter beds, affordable  housing options or ideally all of the above, we are indeed putting the cart before the horse  as it relates to people living in public spaces. So I hope we're willing to do a lot more than tell  them they can't be in public spaces and I hope the initiatives put into place before tonight and  funding approved to that.  I think the !  I just can't support implementing more stringent enforcement of laws that we have on the books. It's not just. It's expensive. It's been tried and it's been proven to be ineffective in addressing the core issues of homelessness. So I'll be willing to vote tonight.  Any other comments? All right. Madam Clerk.  Council Member Brown.  Council Member Denley.  Yes.  Council Member Huber.  No.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 5-2.  All right. And to give our city clerk a break, we are going to take a five-minute recess.  Thank you.  Thank you. All right. That's all right.  ...  ... We are thankful you did what you did because I certainly didn't want to do that.  ...  ...  Commission of Crimes Related to Prostitution or Unlawful Dumping.  And again, Mr. Lindsay.  Good evening, Mayor Coolidge, Vice Mayor Brown, Council.  Thank you for indulging me again.  I would like to present to you this evening an introduction and first reading of an ordinance  adding Chapter 9.19 to the Chico Municipal Code authorizing police department to impound vehicles  used in the commission or attempted commission of crimes related to prostitution or unlawful dumping.  The California Penal Code criminalizes certain acts related to prostitution and unlawful dumping.  However, despite such prohibitions and penalties, persons engaged in repeated offenses.  Penal Code Section 22659.5 authorizes the city to adopt an ordinance declaring a vehicle used by person  on subsequent commission or attempted commission of offenses, unlawful acts to be a public nuisance.  Subject to immediate seizure and 30...  Such owner or operator of the vehicle must have been convicted of the same offense within the past three years.  The ordinance also creates several exceptions for individuals arrested without probable cause,  stolen vehicles, vehicles used without consent of registered owner, among others.  I can speak for code enforcement as we regularly receive complaints regarding illegal dumping.  Code and building staff pick up rubbish.  You know, in the past, we've had a lot of complaints about illegal dumping.  Some people zooming in and zooming back for pickup trucks as they go throughout the city.  But that amount fails in comparison to the amount of public works.  And Director Gustafson is available to elaborate.  And Chief Madden is available to discuss the impact this ordinance would have on policing and prostitution.  This concludes my presentation.  Available for questions.  Any questions?  No?  All right.  Public comments.  I'm guessing you all had a little.  bit of time to read through public comments  on everything, but are there any further?  Madam Clerk?  We did not receive any on  that item. Okay.  Or on this item. I'm sorry.  And nothing via email.  All right.  So, at this point, we'll  entertain a motion.  Move to approve. Do I have to read  this thing? Just the titles.  Actually, the whole ordinance.  I approve it.  I'll need a mic.  Move to approve  introduction and first reading  of an ordinance adding chapter  9.19 to the Chief  Owned Municipal Code authorizing the Police Department  to impound vehicles used in the commission  or attempted commission of  crimes related to prostitution and or  unlawful dumping.  Second.  Second.  Okay.  And that's  the ordinance of the City Council of the City of Chico adding chapter 9.19 vehicle impoundment  for prostitution and unlawful dumping to Division 3 public health and safety offenses and regulations  of Title IX public place, excuse me, public peace, safety, and morals of the Chico Municipal  Code authorizing the Police Department to impound vehicles used in the commission or  attempted commission of crimes related to prostitution or unlawful dumping.  Council Member Brown?  Yes.  Second.  Abstain.  Council Member Denley?  Yes.  Council Member Huber?  Yes.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries 6-0 with one abstention.  All right.  Thank you.  and then we'll move on to item 8.3, Council Member Huber requests on wintering shelter  options, and I believe Council Member Huber as well as our city manager has information  on this item.  Thank you.  I'm just going to turn it over to the city manager.  Thank you.  Sure.  Honorable Mayor, members of the council, thank you very much.  This is one of those items that we've continued to dialogue over for a number of months, if  not years, in the city.  And more recently, there's been a lot more in-depth discussion as to what is the best  modus operandi as it relates to developing our best option of how to have an emergency  warming and cooling center program.  And so what staff did, pursuant to council directive at the last meeting, is we put together  a report.  And so I know you've been able to look at that report.  But I think to give you a synopsis of it, I'm going to have Assistant City Manager Chris  Constantine run you through what the current status is as it relates to sheltering and how  we would like to see it.  And then we'll have the city manager, Susie Calkins, come up and give you the realities  of what we're facing in trying to stand up with our community partners some solution  on this end.  So with that, Mr. Constantine, if you could take it from there.  Thank you.  Perfect timing.  Congratulations and good evening to all the councilmen.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So back in early 2019, the council took an emergency action to establish or to direct  the city manager to erect a structure to be able to provide a warming center for those  who are unsheltered.  We provided that direction, granted $100,000 as an allocation, and in less than 24 hours  were able to erect a structure providing heat, providing a bathroom to those who are unsheltered.  That should be a great thing.  The shelter was staffed by non-profit providers,  a variety of non-profit providers to include Safe Space,  and turned out to be a successful endeavor at that time.  The direction was then given to come back  and establish a warming center program  using a non-profit provider,  and we had tried at the beginning of 2019  to identify a non-profit provider  that could consistently provide that service,  and we were unable to do so initially,  and so the plan was going to be  that the city would continue to erect the tent  until such time as we found a non-profit provider.  We were able to find one of our non-profit providers,  the Jesus Center, that was willing to step up  and provide warming center services.  They were also willing to step up  and provide cooling center services  during the extreme heat summer months,  and so we entered into a contract  with the non-profit provider.  Initially, that contract was $30,000  for the  first half of the year  when we were opening only as a warming center,  and then council during the budget process  increased that allocation,  I'm sorry, 15,000,  then increased it to 30,000  to provide additional services,  eventually going up to 60,000  to provide full service across the year  for both warming and cooling.  The criteria at the time was for a warming center any day,  dry bulb weather through the National Weather Service  of under 32 degrees Fahrenheit,  we would activate the warming center.  We would first notify the non-profit,  establishing a predicted day that needs to be activated,  and if they were unable to activate that day,  we would activate our backup plan,  utilizing Public Works, Eric Gustafson's crew,  to do rented tents and amenities  to provide that service at Depot Park.  In terms of the cooling center,  we determined that a weather temperature  of greater than 100 degrees for two consecutive days  would trigger an extreme heat event,  both cooling and heat criteria are more conservative  than the criteria used by the county  for their emergency plans.  Their emergency plans back in 2008  would have indicated no activations  versus the five days worth of activations  that we actually had during that year,  and on the heating side,  a temperature I believe of greater than 105 degrees  for two or more days,  while ours was greater than 100 degrees.  Towards the end of 2019,  Council Member Huber brought forward  to the council a desire to change the criteria  for the activation of the warming center,  feeling that the temperature,  just a strict temperature of 32 degrees wasn't sufficient,  because wind and rain does play a role  in terms of the actual perceived temperature  and the health effects on an individual, rightfully so.  And so the council granted a change in that criteria  to both include both wind and rain  as part of that criteria,  and we've updated that in our APNP,  our Administrative Procedure and Policy Manual.  And so I just want to ask for the public  and the new council members  to establish what that criteria is.  For any temperature under,  we still had the under 32 degrees for any day predicted  would trigger a warming center.  At or below 40 degrees at any of the point  during the course of a day  where we saw average wind speeds  greater than 15 miles an hour,  which would drop the perceived and real temperature,  that would create an activation.  Or at or below 40 degrees at any of the points at any point  or below 45 degrees Fahrenheit  where the rain anticipated is three and a half inches  or greater would have triggered a warm and center event.  Fast forward now to COVID  when the restrictions of social distancing,  our nonprofit provider was not going to be able to serve,  not just COVID, but also the transitioning  that's currently happening with the nonprofit provider.  They would not be able to consistently be able  to provide that service,  albeit they were very willing to provide it  and we were very thankful  that they were participating in this at our request.  We sought out alternative nonprofits or organizations  as we had done originally back in the early 2019  to no avail, including the Salvation Army,  which was very gracious and willing to want to participate,  not just on this, but on any other activity  that they could partner with the city.  Fantastic.  That was pretty cool. But unfortunately, the programming that they've been providing during the course of the COVID, the requirements for sanitation that would be required if they were to activate a warming or a cooling center made the ability to partner with us during COVID untenable. or a cooling center made the ability to partner with us during COVID untenable. And so what we were left with now was the city providing their backup plan of attendance. And so what we were left with now was the city providing their backup plan of attendance. In early summer, Council Member Brown, seeing that we had to suspend services because of  found an innovative alternate service that could be provided.  Council agreed to change and modify criteria  that we would use the same activation criteria for a cooling center,  but rather than providing a nonprofit's location or a tent at Depot Park  to provide water and refreshments to outreach workers  and to those that are unsheltered out in their parks and waterways  up to an amount of $700 worth of refreshments per day  to those that would be in need in lieu of an actual location.  During the course of the summer, discussions occurred internally  with the city manager, public works, and other staff  and determined that while we had suspended activity,  we need to get back to being able to provide the service.  And so what we did is we reactivated our ability to put up our backup plan,  which would be the tent.  At Depot Park, and the first activation we had was a multi-day period in early September.  It was a cooling center, so we established a tent,  and we established ministers and a bathroom location  to be able to provide services to those who were in need.  In terms of the long-term solution, when this program first came forward,  we did some best practices research,  and we looked at other organizations, county, and cities.  We found one that looked to be a very good model.  It was Humble.  Humble County started a warming and cooling center,  and within two years, because of dwindling participation  and the return on investment that wasn't sufficient,  found that it was more cost-effective to provide funding to a nonprofit  to expand capacity for a four-month period consistently on a daily basis,  as opposed to having a criteria that we would turn off and turn on  this level of service erratically based on the temperature.  And what we've experienced, we've been tracking daily participation rates,  and we've been seeing the same trends that we saw with Humble County  of a dwindling number of participants,  numbers that range during the course of the entire program  of 10 to 30 people per night.  We've dropped down in the teens more recently,  and a cost per person per night ranging from $12.60  to as high as $30.63,  to as high as, when we were looking at the original tent provided by the city,  greater than $100 per person,  per night at that specific location.  And so, in looking at this program,  we feel that a longer-term solution that provides a more consistent shelter  for individuals, whatever that may be,  may be a better option than the warming cooling center  that currently is a $60,000 allocation per year.  It also would reduce the reliance upon a nonprofit  to provide this as an additional service that they currently provide  on an emergency basis, and rather provide this as a more permanent,  long-term solution akin to the expansion of bed space  at the Torrey Shelter, which the council approved funding for  at a previous meeting.  And so, with that, I'll turn it over to Susie  to provide more details about the long-term and where we are with that.  So, thank you.  Good evening.  For those of you who don't know me, my name is Susie Cockhams.  I'm the Homeless Solutions Coordinator.  I'm going to appreciate everything that,  Mr. Constantine just shared with you,  and I'm going to share with you some of the challenges  that we are facing in trying to solve some of these issues  with regard to cooler weather and getting our homeless off the streets  and into a warmer place and hopefully a bed.  Currently, we have one emergency shelter provider  in our continuum and in our city,  and that is the True North Housing Alliance  and the Torrey Shelter is one of their programs.  Currently, myself, the director of the Torrey Shelter, Joy Amaro,  Safe Space Winter Shelter chair, I believe is her title,  Deanna Schwab, and Don Taylor from Butte County's desk department  have visited at least seven different properties in the last couple weeks.  We have located two properties out at the airport  that meet all of the bells and whistles for emergency housing,  habitability standards for emergency shelters.  There is funding in the COC and some of it already allocated  to the True North Housing Alliance for operation of emergency shelter,  and at this point, their board is in a holding pattern  and is not moving forward with that currently.  I can't give you an ETA on when that will happen,  but right now, that's the status and what I have to share with that.  As you know,  most of you, the Jesus Center is working on their renewal center,  and they anticipate opening the first phase of that on April 1st.  Safe Space Winter Shelters are a typical provider  of short-term emergency shelter and warming center services,  and they have been working typically in our local churches.  This year, they were working on endeavors to open a warming center,  and they have been working on efforts to open a warming center  at a number of different churches,  and have been turned down in many different locations  for a couple different reasons.  Number one, the churches in our area,  many of them were built eons ago  and do not have sprinklers in their facilities,  and our current codes say that they need to have sprinklers  to be housing folks overnight.  The other part of that is,  and I think part of it is because of some issues  with the campfire,  and evacuees staying at our local churches,  that they are just not interested in sheltering  any of our homeless currently.  So Safe Space Winter Shelter has had a lot of difficulty  and is at this point not able to open a shelter  given current parameters and availability.  The Chico Housing Alliance,  I didn't say that right,  Chico Housing Action Team continues to work on two endeavors.  One is on,  the Esplanade,  and the other at Everhart Village.  That is,  both of those endeavors are in the works.  I have concerns about all of these endeavors  that we are invoking, if you will,  in our community,  that we, as a continuum of care,  may not have enough operational money  to keep those sustained past a year time frame.  I've been working with a lot of our state departments  and several of our representatives  politically on what their thoughts are  on how to keep folks housed and sheltered,  primarily from COVID response,  and how we can keep that money flowing  into our continuum of care  so we don't have to exit people out into the streets  or back out into homelessness  after this onslaught of funding dries up.  Are you specifically referring to the project room?  So project room key,  good question.  Project room key is a FEMA-funded endeavor  that's funded every single month,  just today,  and I thank you for how many of the council members  that forwarded me this,  and the city manager as well.  But the state sent out a letter today,  a combination of multiple state agencies  about project room key participants,  and they're really leaning on jurisdictions heavily  to get individuals out of project room key  and into a more permanent solution.  One of the calls I made right after I got that email  was, what if we have no place to put people?  I mean, and that's affordable housing,  we just don't have it.  And all of us know how many houses we've lost  in the last couple years because of wildfires.  So matter of fact, I did get a response  from one of the departments  that they're going to rally the troops  and get me a response by Thursday,  so I'll be able to share that with you.  One of the endeavors that True North Housing Alliance  was working on, one of the facilities,  was to take the folks that are in project room key beds  right now and move them at least  into an emergency shelter bed  versus putting them out on the streets  if and when that program were to end.  You just covered my next topic.  Let's see.  The other thing I have to share is that  tomorrow afternoon, Mark and I will be meeting  via a Zoom meeting with a company called RPM.  They are a firm that,  develops prefab structures and modular buildings.  So this is just an option for us to keep in our bonnets,  if you will, for future endeavors  should the need arise and funding  for such a facility be available.  And that's it for an update.  I'll answer any questions if you have any.  Thank you.  Ms. Cockham's going back to safe space,  which for years has been sort of our go-to  for technology.  We've been taking care of people during the winter.  I know I volunteered there for a number of years  and apparently at places that did not have sprinklers  and that was, there wasn't a problem at that time.  When did that become a problem?  And is there,  is there a precedence for other communities  making an allowance for that use without sprinklers?  Well, yes.  They were able to use churches in the past.  I think the issue came about this year  when I connected the safe space winter shelter  with our own city staff.  And I will let Mr. Jared and Tony  follow up on additional information with regard to that.  I have worked in other jurisdictions  where those codes were not as strictly followed.  And that's a level of risk, I think,  that any city would have to take into consideration  before they, you know, made that call.  Everybody does things differently.  I will let Mr. Jared and Mr. Lindsay speak to that.  Thank you.  So there was a change to the California building code  at one point requiring sprinklers in that type of occupancy.  There was also a change to the shelter crisis declaration code  that was at one point allowing a lot more flexibility.  And in the one hand,  that statewide code has been amended  to allow certain aspects to go forward,  but on the other hand has allowed  or has required additional codes,  including the California building code,  to be adhered to more stringently.  Tony?  Yes.  Yes.  To change the occupancy of a building,  you have to bring it up to current standards, right?  A church is not an emergency shelter,  like an R1 or a group R2 occupancy.  So it's a change of views.  We require the fire life safety systems  to come out in line with that.  So I'm just trying to understand.  So there could be 200 people that belong to the congregation.  It doesn't need to be sprinklered for services,  but for 30...  For 30 people sleeping overnight,  it does have to have sprinklers?  When you put people sleeping in a building,  you change the views.  And there are no mechanisms to overcome that  in emergency situations  or in situations like we're facing  where we've had a huge displacement of people  in the last couple of years?  There is none?  Not that we've...  And I'm a minimum code guy,  so I'm not throwing the code out there  to stop anything from happening.  We've expressed it.  We've researched it.  We've gone through it.  And we see incrementally over the years  how the codes have gotten steeper  regarding emergency housing.  And now it's specifically in the code,  fire code, building code.  It's in both of them.  The California existing code.  The requirement is  when you change the use of the building,  you have to bring it up to current code.  So I'm not sure that that answers my question  as far as whether or not there is a mechanism  that allows buildings to get around that.  So when you look for alternative means and methods,  it has to be higher or equivalent  or higher level of protection.  So alternate means and methods of protection.  For the level of protection that a fire sprinkler would have,  you have to have an equivalent or higher.  So if that occupancy requires a fire sprinkler system,  you know, what...  I haven't found a suitable alternative  that would be the equivalent of that.  What does a fire...  Because I have no idea whatsoever.  What does a fire sprinkler system cost?  I don't...  Years ago, residentially, it was $2.63 a square foot.  $2.63 a square foot?  $2.63, yeah.  I don't know currently what that system will run.  And are there any...  Does anybody offer a temporary...  Sprinkler system for temporary use buildings?  Not that I'm aware.  Let me help a little bit here.  And I think the question that you're asking is,  is there any way to get around the law?  And I think it's the only way to get around the law  is to rewrite the law.  And so I guess one of the questions is,  can the city council create some caveat  within our building code to go around the state?  So, no, typically,  California building codes are the standard statewide.  It's the...  It's adopted every two or three years statewide.  The city then adopts it as its local building code  and can do so about six months or so  ahead of it becoming the de facto statewide ordinance  or statewide code becoming your local building code.  In order for the city...  To amend the statewide building code,  it has to show why local conditions warrant...  Local conditions warrant you having a different code.  For instance, in many communities  where there is high wind or snow load,  the standard building code just won't do.  The winds would blow off a roof  or the snow would cave in a roof.  So a local building code can require  a more stringent requirement.  In this instance,  I'm not aware of there being the ability  to have a less stringent requirement.  There...  Again, it...  I don't know if the legislature intended  by amending the emergency  or the shelter crisis declaration process  and requirements of what specific codes  would apply to specific cities.  If they initially...  If they initially started with a pilot program  of just a couple of cities,  expanded that to some others,  expanded it further,  and now it applies statewide.  In doing so, it created what we've interpreted  as a difficulty here for cities who would have  and may have in the past applied that process  to find a way around all of the codes exemption  that's present in that process.  With that unavailable,  we're left to the California building code requirement  and Tony's interpretation on that is what we've come up with,  that it's...  We...  Sprinklers are required in those uses.  So do we have any other questions?  Okay.  So...  Vice Mayor?  Mr. Lindsay, or I'm not sure who this would be for.  Can you let me know if we do a warming and cooling center  as we did at the Jesus Center?  Where it was a place for people to come in and get warm  and get cool, sit at a table, have a cup of coffee,  charge their phone, do whatever they're doing.  That does not require sprinklers, correct?  Correct.  Okay. Thank you.  Yep.  Anyone else?  No?  I just want to clarify on the Vice Mayor's question.  Is that related to like to sleeping versus not sleeping?  Is that what makes that distinction?  That's where it really breaks down to.  It's when you're sleeping at night, you're certainly doing it.  You know, going in for a warming shelter  and grabbing a cup of coffee is much different.  Thanks.  So...  Go ahead.  Oh, sorry.  To follow on...  Please.  Oh, I said wait.  No, no.  I said go ahead.  Now you're just having fun with me.  I'm just getting it down.  To follow on...  Ms. Brown's question.  So we could have a warming shelter at 2 o'clock in the morning,  provided we let everybody go to sleep,  and we could use any building we want to do.  I don't mean to sound like I'm attacking you.  I'm attacking the stupid code.  You just happen to be the way...  That's a creative solution.  Just proof of thought, Mr. Huber.  No.  Doing nothing is not an option.  And the state has made it impossible for us to do something.  Kind of like affordable housing.  I think there's places for us to go to solve this long term,  and I think we'll be having those conversations,  but that does nothing in the short term.  But I'm just looking for one solution.  A big sign that says masks, no sleeping.  Short term, we still have the tent option.  The tent does not require sprinklers.  Okay.  Mr. Orr.  Sure.  Yeah.  So one of the questions that I've been asked,  and I might as well just ask it,  because I'm sure there's somebody out there thinking it.  Why were they allowed to use those churches before?  I know there's been modifications to the state code,  et cetera, but the bottom line is,  the city never received complaints on those,  so we never had reason to go out and check that.  So that's another reality that we're facing as well.  So just realize that.  This is what's called, between,  a rock and a hard place,  and the state of California,  we find in a lot of things that we attempt to,  that we feel is good and beneficial for our community,  as alluded to by Council Member Morgan,  is we may not necessarily see as a community  as being the easiest path to solving our problems.  And so this is just another one of those instances.  And so we've looked and we've looked,  and I think that the best solution  is working with our local partners,  which we're doing every day.  And I don't know how Susie's keeping her mental health,  because we continue to bang our heads against the wall  all the time.  And so I just want to make sure the council,  the community understands that.  This has been one of the most difficult issues.  This and COVID, and combine the two together,  have been two things that we can't solve  at this very instant,  because there's too many other aspects that we can't control.  And so just hopefully that message gets across,  because that's the reality we're in right now.  But I do want to thank our partners,  who have been amazing at trying to come together,  on a lot of these things.  And particularly Ms. Cockums,  for being at the forefront of that,  to try to get this coalescing with a number of you as well,  council members, so thank you.  All right, thank you.  So, Ms. .  Yeah, Ms. Cockums, oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.  Okay, Ms. Cockums, I was just curious  if you could give me some insight  on what our local providers are looking at right now,  as far as capacity and where they're at.  Do you have any insight on that?  Like how many open beds they have?  Yeah, what's like the average right now,  maybe this week?  Well, they all vary by size.  So True North Housing Alliance,  which is our emergency shelter provider  at the Torres Shelter, has on the average 20  to 30 beds a night open currently.  I think a lot of that, because before COVID, they were full  to capacity every single night, even including overflow beds.  Part of that is I think the fear of COVID and being  in closer quarters,  that some additional people are staying outside instead.  But, you know, the council did authorize an additional 50 beds.  We're hoping that once COVID's over, Lord knows when that will be,  that those additional 50 beds will obviously add capacity  and additional people would like to stay there.  But that's still not going to be enough to get everybody that's  on the streets into a bed.  And so these, one of the first things I talked  about those two additional facilities where there would be  between 90 and 100 additional beds at each facility,  would tackle the folks that are in project room key beds that are going  to be eventually vacated out of there.  And an additional, you know, 100 people on the streets  or in other precarious positions and bring them indoors.  So that would serve more as our warming center  because it would be, both of them would be shorter term  while we're trying to get folks into more permanent solutions.  And on the topic of COVID and how it's affecting things,  do you know if the local providers have access  to the rapid COVID testing at this time?  Most of them do, yes.  They do.  And one way, share, perform, yes.  Okay. And do you know if the service providers have any way  of like going around and like, I don't know, shuttling or picking  up people to get them off the street  and into the current open beds?  So True North Housing Alliance does not have an active,  very active outreach and engagement team.  And one of the things that council approved earlier was a  $20,000, I guess we could call it a stipend,  a contract for outreach and engagement.  Currently I have one potential provider out of all  of our service providers.  Okay.  That are interested in that.  Okay.  And we're going to kind of wait and wait through, you know,  probably another month's worth of time before that happens  because we don't have a place to take people  to if we did outreach and engagement.  You know, there's 20 beds at Torrey's shelter tonight,  but we don't know what tomorrow looks like.  Okay. Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Council Member Brown.  Just a quick one.  Sorry. I think Council Member Denley asked the question.  So are the shelter providers requiring testing?  Particularly rapid testing before allowing folks  to enter shelter?  Yeah.  And you had mentioned  that the 50 additional beds wouldn't come online  until after COVID-19.  Can you explain that a little bit?  So right now there's, I want to see maybe a capacity issue  at the Torrey's shelter and not enough bandwidth to do all  of the tasks that they have on a daily basis.  So they do have a contractor set up to do the expansion project,  but they're not going to be able to start it  until COVID has suspended.  So they're excited substantially.  Okay. Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Any other questions?  No?  I just want to make it known based  on what Council Member Morgan had shared that, I mean,  I would be open to the possibility of looking  at erecting a tent temporarily,  understanding that this is not a permanent solution  and that it's not the most ideal solution, you know,  with COVID requirements adhered to.  So I just want to say that I would support that.  And I think additionally we get communication pretty regularly  from the city manager, from city staff, and I appreciate  that with regards to these solutions.  But I think it can be frustrating for the public to feel  like they're in the dark about the type of progress  that we're making or not.  And it would be helpful I think to me and to the public  if there's time available in each meeting, each council meeting  for a short update about homelessness solutions.  And whether that's Ms. Calkins presenting that or Mr. Orme,  it just seems prudent that we're able to keep the community, you know,  the community informed on a regular basis.  And I appreciate your proactiveness  in communicating with council.  But if that's a possibility, I think it would be of benefit.  Yeah, I don't see a problem with that.  Just as FYI, we, Mark and I and several other city staffers,  had a conversation today about a press release going out  about what we talked about tonight, about the challenges  and the frustrations that we're feeling and how, you know,  it can't be just the city and city staff solving the problem.  We all need to come together.  And that includes the community.  I feel very fortunate to get to work with the service providers  that I do work with because we're all on the same page  and we have the same goals and the same outcomes that we want  to see for our residents.  So I think getting that information  out is really important.  So there's fewer questions and more understanding.  Yeah, thank you.  I appreciate you doing that.  Just to the point of the possibility of a warming tent,  if that's an option that this council would want to pursue,  do we have a service provider that's willing  to provide some staff support?  And you're shaking your head no.  Can you explain that a little bit?  Yeah. We've had this conversation for weeks  and weeks and weeks.  At this point, I think the city manager and I have come  to the conclusion that if we do put up a tent,  it would be just that, for warming.  There would be obviously no cots, no service providers.  It would either be city staff or a rented security firm manning it.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And you've spoken with the service providers to see  if they'd be willing to provide some outreach?  Yeah. So some of it is COVID response.  And a lot of it is bandwidth.  You know, just like every other business  and organization, municipality,  they're all experiencing COVID absences and quarantines.  And they just don't have the bandwidth to expand.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  And Council Member Brown, not anything against you personally,  but it's hard to hear people with the masks on.  And I just am having a hard time.  I'm at the beginning of your statement, what you said.  Okay. I'll keep my mask on.  No, but I mean closer to the microphone maybe.  Sure. Absolutely.  Yeah. Sorry.  Yeah.  And that was just, you know, for my own sake.  So, okay. Will of the Council?  All right.  Just a report.  So at this point we can make suggestions, but Madam Clerk,  do we need to take public comment?  You did receive six comments through Engage.  So that's in the listing.  Okay.  And those were from the people sitting in front of you.  And those were from Jessica Giannola, Daniel Rodriguez,  Rob Berry, Juanita Sumner, Michelle Cooper, and Nicole Nava.  All right.  Everybody had a chance to read those?  Okay.  If I could make a comment, Mr. Mayor?  Absolutely.  And Susie mentioned it and Ms. Brown did as well.  I don't know that we need an update at every single meeting.  It depends on how often we meet.  And I know that you mentioned that you  talked about putting out a press release.  It would be helpful to the Council for people to realize that,  I mean, everybody, including the service providers,  that aren't necessarily following through to the degree I would like to see them follow through,  are pointing their fingers at the City going,  do something, do something, do something, give us money, give us money, give us money.  And we're just like, our hands are tied.  And I understand Mr. Huber's frustration.  It's the exact same thing with affordable housing.  Make affordable housing.  It's important.  It's absolutely impossible.  Why do these people keep saying it?  So I'm just reaffirming, if you do some kind of press release or something to let the general public know,  because right now they get a little blurb in the Enterprise record from time to time  and whatever anybody puts on social media, but it's not enough.  Does it?  All right.  So with that, no request for action, we'll move forward.  Thank you, Council Member Huber.  Reports are coming in.  Reports and communications.  Following reports and communication items are provided for Council's information.  No actions can be taken on items under this section unless Council agrees to include it  in a subsequent agenda.  A verbal report from our City Manager.  Yes.  Congratulations, new Council members, returning Council member, and continuing Council members.  It's obviously a pleasure to be able to serve all of you, and I know that we've got an amazing  City staff, which you'll come to find for those who are new.  Thank you.  Some of you that are going to be able to get a lot done.  And just want to, bless you, just want to go ahead and share our Thanksgiving to you for being  willing to serve in these daunting times.  Just a couple of quick things outside of that.  One of the things that I was really proud of is we are moving up the scales as it relates  to a fiscal prudence perspective.  Our fiscal health rankings went up just a matter of six years ago or thereabouts.  We were number five in the state of California at risk of financial catastrophe.  And now we have gone all the way up year after year after year.  We bumped up to the 50s.  Now we're number 85.  So I will tell you that we have been diligent to ensure that the fiscal sustainability of this organization remains steadfast.  And I want to make sure and highlight that.  We'll probably do a press release of some kind with this regard in the coming week ahead to highlight that.  Because that's something that we haven't heard a lot of vocal praise about other than from the state auditor.  That's a good praise to get, but we want our community to realize that we've been doing as well.  So that's an applause.  Also, obviously, with COVID-19 currently in effect, we're all keeping our eye on that regionalization with the stay-at-home order that the governor put down.  Currently, we're at 18.8%.  And so we have not reached that 15% to go into that new mode.  We're still in purple, unfortunately.  But I will say our community is doing a tremendous job, even though there's a huge influx throughout the state and the nation.  And so we're still at that point where we're working purple.  We're not working that new set of rules that are to go into place.  With that, I just want to thank you all again for your patience tonight and for City Clerk Presson's diligence in getting through that urgency ordinance.  We look forward to implementing your policy directive and wish you a good rest of the evening.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  At this point in time, we'll move on to agenda item 9.2, Councilmember Request Percent to APMP 1010.  Councilmembers may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting.  After stating what the item would be, majority vote of the council is needed in order for staff to agendize.  Councilmembers may also submit requests in writing.  And actually, tonight, I'd like to start this off with a request to look at our behavioral health in the county and bring back some information to the council.  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  perhaps Mr. Dowell as well,  to just look into that  and see what percentage of that dollars is coming here  and what it's spent on.  I think a lot of people in our community  have questions about that.  I'll second that request.  Madam Clerk.  Just a second, I just need to get it in there.  Council Member Coolidge,  you're just wanting some research to be done  as to the percentage of the...  Yeah, basically I think we need to lot out...  Mayor Coolidge, I apologize.  No, no, absolutely.  So in walking door to door and talking to people,  a lot of people had questions  about where the behavioral health money is being spent.  And they were absolutely shocked  about how much money it actually was.  And obviously I don't even have a pinpointed exact number  of how much it is,  but they wanna know where it's being spent  and what it's being spent on  and why isn't more being spent in the City of Chico.  I think we all have that question.  So I think it's worthwhile to explore  and find out an answer to.  Okay, Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Dinley.  Aye.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries seven zero.  And thank you for letting me go first.  Anyone else?  Yeah, I would like to agendize at a future meeting,  bringing back the discussion  to unfreeze  the police staffing that we currently have frozen.  Second.  Sorry.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Dinley.  Yes.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Aye.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries seven zero.  All right.  I had a second item.  I wanted to bring back the Housing Committee report.  We previously just accepted the report as it was.  So I just wanted to bring it back and review it  and see if there's anything that we need to review  for further consideration or things that we need  to operationalize and get going for our city.  So just wanted to review that.  Okay.  Second.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Dinley.  Yes.  Council Member Huber.  Yes.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries seven zero.  Okay.  Any further requests?  No.  Okay.  That was ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... !  Council Member Denley? Yes. Council Member Huber? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 5-2.  Mr. Morgan, I think you were trying to... Sorry, I was waiting until you said I could speak again. There you go. I'm sorry, I haven't had any in a while. I have two.  Two. The first one, I would like a reconsideration of my vote and review of the cannabis fee schedule, and this is why. We were sold cannabis... Well, first of all, some number of the voters said this is something we want in the city, which, fine, that's what they said, and I have no problem with that.  Then we had a big committee, and they came out, and they said, here are all the positive things that this is going to do for the city. One of those things was tax revenue.  The fee schedule came forward with no tax revenue, so we're going to have all of the downsides, which are plenty, none of the upsides, so I would like to bring that fee schedule back, reconsider it, and figure out how we would add taxes to it.  It's important to say I'm not trying to undo the, I don't want to say legalization of marijuana, because that wasn't what it was, but the ordinance allowing for marijuana, but the fee schedule is wrong and not what was...  ... ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... questions? We're not supposed to. Yeah I believe we're just supposed to bring in. Questions on ! Before you vote you can obviously have a discussion whether or not you want to agendize  ...  discussion whether or not you want to agendize it or if he has questions if  councilmember Huber has questions to help explain he may change he may vote  accordingly so councilmember Morgan is your understood was your understanding  not that it was implicit in the acceptance of the original fee schedule  for cannabis that discussion would follow it's not my understanding it is  the fact it's not in there a tax has to go on the ballot I'm aware of that why  would it be on there you were part of the group that said here's what we're  gonna do with marijuana we were sold a bill of goods that said this is good for  the city because there's taxes involved we pass an ordinance we approved a fee  schedule and we're going to do it again next year and then we're going to do it  again this year this schedule this schedule this schedule this schedule this  schedule this schedule this schedule this schedule this schedule this schedule  this schedule this schedule this schedule this schedule this schedule this  schedule this schedule this schedule this schedule this schedule this  schedule this schedule this schedule this  schedule this schedule this schedule this It's very possible that it comes back and people say no don't tax the stuff. We like the drawbacks and none of the positives. Then that's fine. All right. Madam Clerk. Council member Brown. No.  Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carrie  Six-One. Mayor Coolidge, I had one more, and this one's very recent. I would like reconsider.  Madam Clerk, hold on. I'm sorry. Scott, did you vote no? Oh, you did. He voted yes. Sorry,  I misunderstood. All right. Sorry. Doubted your clerk. I'm just saying. You're up to me,  down the clerk. My apologies. Mr. Morgan, apologies. Oh, that's my last guy, right? Go ahead.  Go ahead. I cracked myself up. I would like to request to agendize a reconsideration of my own  vote regarding special planning areas. I think it was made at the last meeting.  Last council meeting. I'll second that. I'll give her just a second here. Okay.  Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Denley. Yes. Council Member Huber.  Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Could you please repeat that? I really didn't get  it. No, don't be scared. I do it all the time. One time we were in closed session. I fell  asleep. I fell asleep. I fell asleep. I fell asleep. I fell asleep. I fell asleep. I fell asleep.  I fell asleep. I woke up. It was 1 o'clock in the morning. I had just voted yes right after Mr.  Ori, and I went, oh, my God, what have I done? Turns out it was the right thing, so it was fine.  I was requesting to, so a number of weeks ago, we talked about special planning areas,  and it had to do with how housing and development would move forward and not move forward.  And having learned a little bit more about special planning areas and the way that I voted,  I would like to reconsider it and let this council consider how the city might,  move forward or not move forward with special planning areas. Yes. Thank you.  Vice Mayor Reynolds. Yes. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 6-1.  All right. Any further requests? All right. Seeing no further requests,  we will adjourn to the regular scheduled council meeting on December 15, 2020, at 6 p.m. in the  council chambers.  Here at 421 Main Street. Thank you very much.  It's in the books.
