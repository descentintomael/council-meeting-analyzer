 Thank you for your leadership. I really appreciate all of you. It's been a hard time. We've only been called together for such a time as this. So thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm as anxious as anyone to talk about the Housing Committee report. 5.2. 5.6? Yes. But it's unlikely to come up to us at a sensible hour, so I would like to move that we continue 5.6 to the next council meeting. I would agree. I don't think that we have enough time to, even, start on it. And it's an important issue for our community to consider and being fresh for that discussion. Okay. So Council Member Ori has made a motion. Is there a second? I'll second it. I'd like to note that this is an item that I've been pushing since April to come before this body. And some other items were jumping ahead of that that clearly could not have come out before that meeting. I'm just concerned that this will continue to slip away further and further. I thought it was highly unlikely with a council that likes to end the evening at 10 o'clock. I found it very unlikely that this would be heard today. But I wanted to make sure that we reserve it in the queue and stop the volleying back and forth on these things. So I'll second the motion. I'm prepared to postpone and to honor Council Member Stone's request. Implied request? Maybe we put it toward the top of the next agenda. Please. Please. Okay. So we have a motion and a second. We'll take a roll call vote, please. Okay. I'm sorry. Just a second. Okay. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0 to continue it as the first item of the regular business of the next agenda. Okay. So just to make it very clear to those in the audience, we will not be hearing 5.6 tonight. Very good. Okay. A couple of notes before we get started. Public participation. This meeting is being conducted in accordance with executive order N-2920. The public may attend. The public may attend the meeting in person at 421 Main Street. Speakers must sign up to speak by checking in at one of the speaker card tables located inside City Hall. All speakers will be given instructions to queue in the speaker line. We have remote public participation during the meeting. The public may view the meeting on Comcast Channel 11 or via streaming video found on the city's website. The Engaged Chico Civic Engagement Program was available. For citizen input on individual agenda items prior to the meeting and that was closed at 430. However, if you missed that timeline, you may also make comments this evening by email, which can be sent to publiccomments at chicocca.gov. That's P-U-B-L-I-C-C-O-M-M-E-N-T-S at chicocca.gov during the meeting prior to the closing. The public is encouraged not to send more than one email per item and not to comment on numerous items in one email. We have the consent agenda. The consent agenda is for items routine in nature and may be enacted in one motion. Please note that item 2.1 is being continued to the next meeting. Thank you. Is there any public comments? On our consent agenda items. Yes, I believe, and I just need to get them entered into the system. So, I believe I have three, maybe four speakers on the consent in person. But under the Engaged Chico component, I believe we did not receive any public comments, nor did we receive any via email as well. So, each one. I have a couple. It's on 2.2. 2.3 that I'd like a separate discussion on. So, you want to pull 2.2 and 2.3? Yes, please. But we will take the public comment on all of the consent agendas at this time. Right, at one time. Okay. Okay, and so I'll go ahead and queue up the individuals for consent. Joe Famazzi, Rob Berry, and Patrick Newman. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Can you repeat please? The consent agenda, we have item 2.1 which will be in the next agenda and we're talking about consent agenda items right now. So my worry about all these things that you have under this program is I don't see any family housing. We've talked all about apartments and I don't agree with that. Where's the family housing? Seriously, it's all about apartments. What about the families? I feel that there's not enough focus in that particular plan for family housing. Okay, thank you. Mr. Berry? Mr. Berry? Mr. Berry? Before I begin, just to let you know that the speaker is not working in the lobby so people that are waiting in line cannot hear the speaker say. Okay, thank you. We'll look into that. Okay. Baby switch is a sales tax. We are all familiar with how it goes. Show us something we might want and then sell us something we don't. This is what is going on with the homeless and the disabled. The homeless are the ones that are in the middle of the industrial complex in Chico, specifically this item. A little history here is instructive. Way back in October of 2018, we were employed, implored by the homeless industry to declare a shelter crisis to capture our share of four and a half million dollars. We did. And what did we get for that effort? Then we were told that if we would sell the BMX property to the JC, we would close their Park Street location and the city would receive $329,000 for the land and BMX would move to a better location. There was no mention at that time that the city would be paying for that relocation. One thing after another transpired to bring us to today and what do we have? We have a lot of money. Go ahead and put your name in the door to see if we have any door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door funds to the private NPO for extremely low-income housing in a reconfigured Park Street building, the one that was supposed to be vacated and repurposed. What did the city of Chico get for all of this? A bigger Jesus Center project than originally approved, permanent subsidized housing on Park, a campground on the BMX land, and a bill for $10 million, and one more member of the homeless industry complex in Chico. Yet nowhere is there mention of what you will do with those who will not be served by any of the new homeless services infrastructure. I have nothing against Jamboree or providing some level of subsidized housing, but where is the community support for what you were doing to Chico? Where is the community engagement? How dare you put the public through the hardship you imposed merely to try to get a token three minutes in your presence and call that public participation? Everyone, including you, knows that this is a farce, and we are living with it and will be living with it for generations to come. Stop trying to change the world before November. Thank you. Our final speaker is Patrick Newman. Thank you. I'm speaking on 2.3, Chamboree housing. For the record, I think it's important to recognize that this didn't just happen. We shot Jesus in the head here. It's like Jesus, the city was married, in a sense, to a soup kitchen, and there was a history there. And we provided hospitality to people in the most primitive Christian sense, which is to just give stuff to people without condition. There's a long history to that. There's a lot of reasons why it ought to be part of our culture. We started destroying the Jesus Center before it even got where it is. There was five arson attempts on the Jesus Center in the mid-90s. You can look that up in the Chico News Review if you want to. This was always controversial. Its position on Park Avenue was controversial. Bill Such, who ran the facility for eight years, was controversial. Why? Because he was a hospitality Christian, and he believed in that core approach to generosity and what it means at the heart of the gospel. So we can all pat ourselves on the back and talk about how wonderful it is that Jamboree is going to come in and provide 58 units. But there's a shadow to this that we ought to think about and it ought to be on the record that we destroyed that place. And when Laura Kitsona was hired in 2015 and Bill Such was fired by a board with seven realtors on it, he was fired for a reason. He wrote a letter objecting to the offenses against public properties ordinance and he stood up for the homeless as an advocate and he didn't play ball with the downtown the way he was supposed to. So he brought somebody in to dismantle the thing and if anybody wants to go through that history I can tell you month by month year by year how it was dismantled. Ultimately the memorandum of understanding between the city of Chico was a quid pro quo which said we will give you this land over here to build a compound. If you'd vote for it, you'd get a land over here. If you'd drop your facility on Park Avenue and that was accepted with open arms and the community didn't object to it. But that's in our history now. We destroyed the only soup kitchen in this town and I've been here a half a dozen or a dozen times to say that I think that was wrong. Sandra O'Neill was the only other person who came up here and said that. So now we have a city where we have intake facilities and we have warehouses for people. We don't have anywhere for someone to go to get food, clothing and a shower. Nowhere in this town. That's what we're eliminating. It's not going to be replaced by some vague promise to do provisioning. I don't believe it. We don't have a soup kitchen. Thank you. So we will close the public hearing. So the consent agenda consists of is there any council members wanting to pull anything besides Mr. Orey on 2.2 and 2.3? Or any other? Any council disqualifications? So the consent agenda at this point just consists, well it doesn't consist of anything, does it? So 2.1 has been continued to the next meeting. So item 2.2, Mr. Orey, proposed amendment to the 2021 HUD annual action plan. I just had a couple questions for staff and I think we're taking, I would like 2.2 and 2.3 at the same time. Okay. It's the same project. Okay. Marie, are you going to come up or? I'm going to introduce you to Mary Jo Alonzo as well. Excellent. Housing specialist. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you. It's great that we had extra CDBG home dollars that we could allocate towards this. I think we have a couple of questions. Could you explain how this project got picked over, say, any others? Sure. So we, in the budget that was approved in June, we had already allocated CDBG and home funds. It was a natural partner because when you've already got home dollars in there, you've got all these federal overlays. So this project needed additional funds. So that's basically why it was chosen. And it's an important project for the city. It's in the corridor opportunity zone. Basically that's it. And I just want to call out the loan terms because I think we may want to consider those later when we talk about other grant funds to other nonprofits. It's a 55-year deferred residual receipts loan at 1%. Is that? That's pretty standard. Right. And it's done, yep. It's consistent with our policy or what we've done in the past. And so they won't be paying anything back on an annual basis unless after they spend everything else, there's funds left over. Correct. And there's a comment that they're hoping for tax credits, probably pretty integral to the project, on October 18th, I think. 14th. October 14th, right. And they've all received, they've received their letters basically being recommended. So it is dependent on those funds? This would not, yeah, this, there's a few things here with home funds. There's a few things that have to happen. One, the NEPA needs to be completely finished. It's in process right now. And then obviously it would be contingent upon them receiving their tax credits, et cetera. But it's kind of a chicken and egg thing. They need to have the financing in place for the investor at this point. It wasn't a requirement for the tax credit during this particular, because of the special nature of the disaster credits. So they didn't, typically in a, in a tax credit deal, they would have had to have all their soft financing committed prior to applying. But in this situation, it wasn't a requirement. You know, I'm very sympathetic to the high cost of per units in affordable housing, permanent affordable housing projects that you have to put a lot of money upfront so that you can maintain the affordable housing. Do you have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Do we have any other questions? Okay, I have to actually, for the system, take them individually. I'm sorry. I wish I could do it easily. So we have a motion to approve item 2.2. Second. So motion and second. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carrie 7-0? I should have just moved approval of the consent agenda. I move approval of 2.3. Second. Second. Okay. Give it to Scott. Okay, so second to Scott Huber. Okay. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Ori? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carry 7-0. We will now move to business from the floor. Members of the public may address the council at this time on any matter that's not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as determined by the mayor based on the number of speakers. The council cannot take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda. Let's start with public comments via Engage Chico. Did we have any? We did and in your packet that's in front of you you have three comments from Engage on Business from the Floor. And did we have any emails? No, not at this point for Business from the Floor and we do have, I believe, 11 speakers in person. Okay. So each one of the speakers will be given three minutes. Okay. While we get them queued up, let's just take a few minutes to read the Engage Chico public comments. And then I'm going to go ahead and queue up the speakers that are in person. Jay Fumazi, followed by Robin Engle, followed by Carrie Krueger. So if the three could line up in the lobby. Would you also please read the names of the people who submitted comments on Engage Chico? Happy to do that. The comments were received from Claudette Ritter, Linda Wolfe, and Nicole Nava. Thank you. Thank you. Sir, I showed that we got a comment from four people. Okay. Claudette Ritter, Jackie Smith, Linda Wolfe, and Nicole Nava. You have Jackie Smith in there? Okay. Yes. Missed that. Okay. Thank you for noting that.

Okay. Good evening. I am not very happy with some of the council's direction that they've been taking the city. I take it highly offence that certain council members were more worried about opening Chico State and still are our public schools here in Chico. I feel that you've lost focus on families. You're focused on 1% of the population of Chico. But I hear nothing come out of this council for families. All I hear is let's move the BMX track. Those are our kids play there. I hear nothing about, hey, let's clean up the equipment so the kids can go play. Instead, I hear let's shut it down because of COVID-19. But we'll place homeless inside our parks. They don't have fear of COVID-19, but our children cannot go play in the park because of COVID-19. It seems like I have not heard one thing out of this council pushing forward for kids and family activities here at all. All I've heard is homeless talk, transients, the police department, but nothing about families. So why don't you come back and start focusing on the families that live here? They matter too. Thank you. So Robin Engle, followed by Carrie Kruger and Rob Berry. Good evening. What I'm going to talk about is related to 5.2, but I take a more ideological, less specific approach. And that is our perspective of, if we don't solve the problem, which is our housing crisis, if we don't shift that perspective, we won't have any success whatsoever. That shift needs to be a shift from a punitive, divisive approach to one that sees everyone as equal in value, regardless of how much money they have, regardless of the fact that they may have no money whatsoever. And how do you help people who don't want help? I heard that. I heard that from you, and I really respect you and the work you do, Mr. Orme. I could not begin to wrap my brain around all the dollars you manage in such a detailed way. And I know that's a perspective that a lot of you come from, and I really respect that. I come from a very different perspective. I don't manage dollars. I manage emotions. And I think the question of how do you help people who don't want help, needs to be taken out of the context of this discussion about solving our homelessness crisis, unless we agree on what that help actually entails. I go out as a therapist to homes, and I knock on the door, and sometimes I've spent my own money and gas and time, and the services are going to be free, but they're not even home. So sometimes people don't want help because they have other priorities. What we know from Abraham Maslow, and I think that's what Abraham Maslow's work in the 1940s, going back to the 1940s, is that unless you have your basic needs met, food, water, shelter, you can't access other parts of your brain to take in mental health resources, to take in case management support, or other things. So we know that much. We've known this much from a very long time ago. I encourage us to, as we get deeper into all of the housing issues that I'm very grateful for, and I'm very grateful, are on the agenda, I'm very grateful for all your work on this, Mark, and everyone here who's worked so hard on this. I urge you all to please take a perspective of human kindness, decency, and respect. Know that shelters have a lot of rules as far as accountability, and Torres Shelter still has 50 beds open. I hate to see $300,000 going in that direction, when they have such a high level of responsibility. But I want to say that we need to take a perspective of accountability that is punitive. People can't even access that service. So that's another term that just needs to be hashed out, so we can come to an agreement on what accountability means, and what help means, so we can move forward for the good of everyone in the community. Thank you very much. Carrie Krueger, followed by Rob Berry and Michelle Cooper. This smoke that we've all been experiencing in our community triggers a lot of memories, a lot of traumatic memories for most of us. It also brings back memories of a time when we came together as a community, when we persevered, when we collaborated and partnered together. Here we find ourselves in the midst of another tragic season. My hope is that we would draw from the strength we gained during that time, that we would all partner and work together, that we'd take the important steps necessary to make things better. I'm calling on each one of you, the elected public servants, paid by the citizens in whom you serve, to lead that charge. Leaders lead by example. As a mother and advocate for the children in our community, I am charging you to collaborate. And I am calling on you to collaborate. And to do whatever it takes to make this city a better and safer place for our children. On a personal note, one of my daughter's favorite activities is swimming in the creeks in our parks during the summer. That really wasn't an option this summer. It just wasn't safe. It was a super sad summer for her, for a lot of reasons, but that was just one of them. Our kids need better than what we are giving them. They deserve better. I'm also calling on the citizens of our community to be the change that you want to see. We all must do our part and take the high road to ensure that Chico is a safe, beautiful, healthy, family-friendly, and thriving community. I know all of us want that. In this current climate of uncertainty and unrest, civility and common sense have been thrown out the window. The division seems to be growing with furthering agendas. What are you all going to do to help bring this community back together? Set an example for us to follow. As leaders, the community is looking to you. This is your time. Maybe your last time for some of you, depending on the outcome of the election. Chico needs a change. Make it Kent. Thank you. Rob Berry, followed by Michelle Cooper, and then Andy Wilhoyt. I'm talking tonight to what I call the supermajority, the five of you that are driving the agenda tonight. I just want you to reflect on the agenda just for tonight's meeting. You are trying to pack... Sorry, my glasses are fogging up. You are trying to pack every policy program and all your other grand designs for Chico into a single meeting at a time when citizens who wish to participate in their local government must stand outside, unable to follow what you are doing in here, while you sit comfortably in your conditioned, filtered air and comfortable seats, and cast your grand and what I consider to be delusional fantasies about a world created in your image. This city council supermajority is characterized by pathological conditions in my view. Grievance politics and narcissism. Grievance politics always makes you unhappy to someone else's problems. Republicans, conservatives, white privilege, racism, homeless haters, NIMBY lawyers, etc. etc. And the narcissistic notion that Chico citizens need to hand over all that they hold dear so that you can manifest your grand self-aggrandizing vision for the world by transforming Chico, even if it's against our will, because as you know, it's all for our own good. Well, you were wrong. And if you were not afraid of November, you should be. Voters are mad as hell, and we're not going to take it anymore. Your reign of oppression and destruction is coming to a close. We will take our parks back. We will take our plaza back. We will make Chico safe, clean, and beautiful. And many of us will be safe, and we will be safe, and many of you will have a lot more free time come November. Thank you very much. Michelle Cooper, followed by Andy Wilhoyt, followed by Larry Halstead. Good evening. A lot of people like to get up here and say how long they've been here. I guess that validates whether their voice counts or not. So. I was born and raised here. My children are fourth generation born at Enloe. My great-grandfather worked with Dr. Enloe at Flume Street. So I think that makes me a pretty established Chicoan. This past weekend, I participated in a refreshing, patriotic event in Chico. Hundreds, if not thousands of people gathered to celebrate American freedom. There was no fighting, no looting, no fighters. Just good people celebrating what they love. It was truly a breath of fresh air, even on a smoky day. These patriots, my family included, drove through the streets of Chico with friendly waves and honks. Of course, there were a few bystanders opposing. I guess the notion of American flags and support for our president is just too much. But those were very few. There are three of you that currently sit on the dais that are up for reelection in four weeks. Two of you should be worried about your seats. The will of the spirited citizens of Chico that I personally witnessed last Saturday tells me the people are tired of liberal agenda being pushed onto our once beautiful city. The people are ready to reclaim Chico and put it back on the map as a safe, peaceful, and free city. And a great place to raise a family. To those of you that will be leaving office, Mr. Ory included, let this be a lesson to you. You own the weight of the destruction of our city. I hope to see more of these patriotic parades and events in our future. Wouldn't it be nice if Chico was once again filled with pride and respect for the city we love? Thank you. Thank you. All right, Andy Wilhoyt, followed by Larry Halstead, and then Patrick Newman. This town is home to a national gem, a resource that few cities are fortunate to have flowing through their urban core. I'm referring to our local creeks and our wonderful Bidwell Park. You know, we've been through a lot of bad things in our history. But we're going to take a step back and take a step back and take a step back. This is a natural resource so spectacular that Hollywood chose to film Robin Hood here 82 years ago. While most sensible city governments would cherish and protect such a gem, I stand before a council majority that has blatantly and intentionally opened the floodgates of degradation and pollution to our waterways and Bidwell Park via the Brown New Deal. Each of you should be ashamed of the damage that you have allowed to occur to our local waterways. Having spent the majority of my childhood enjoying these local creeks, I wanted to give back to this community. So 13 years ago, in the fall of 2007, I sat down with the City of Chico Stormwater Department and proposed a project that could foster community awareness and participation in protecting our creeks. I proposed an annual calendar that would feature photographs of our local creeks, taken by local photographers, both professional and hobbyists. Each month featured a special place within our creeks and presented watershed friendly tips, or BMPs, for residents to adopt into their daily habits to help keep pollution out of our creeks. The calendar was called Chico Clean Creeks and became a very popular production printed for eight consecutive years. The last printing was 2015. I think it is safe to say that such a calendar could not be produced these days because vast sections of our waterways are now under construction. The waterways are choking on trash and needles, and many photographers would refuse to venture deep into the creeks' meanderings for fear of their own safety. I was also one of the City's first local businesses to sign on as an official clean water business partner, pledging to adopt business practices that are watershed friendly. And as such, I am encouraged to educate my customers and fellow tradespeople to adopt their own BMPs at home and at work. Is it not sad and ironic that our home waterways are now under construction, and that our hardworking City staff create and implement such wonderful programs, only to have this Council majority unravel it? The five of you have left a filthy legacy that will take much time and work to undo. My hope for Chico and for our precious creeks is that those of you on the majority now running for re-election will each be defeated and replaced with the candidate who has pledged to undo your damage. To my fellow residents of Chico, who want their precious waterways back, vote Sean Morgan for District 1, Cami Denley for District 3, Andrew Coolidge for District 5, and Topeka Tandon for District 7. Larry Halstead, followed by Patrick Newman and Jeff Crean. Good evening, Mayor, City Council. Staff, and citizens of Chico. My name is Larry Halstead. I've been a resident of this fine city for six months now. And I have been wanting to come down here and speak, and haven't gotten around to it, but after I had the pleasure of meeting our Mayor just over a week ago at the Farmer's Market, I had a great discussion with her and decided I needed to come on down here. I really wanted to come here today, and speak on issues of the homeless, the parks, drug addiction, and police issues. And I'm glad that I chose this particular one, because it will allow me to come and take another bite at the hour. Did I just run out of time? No, sorry. It hasn't started? We have about two and a half minutes left. Can I have your picture all the way up? Mr. Halstead, can I have you put your mask over your nose? Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry, it keeps fogging up my glasses. Anyway, it will give me the opportunity to speak on some of these issues at a little bit greater length, so I'm going to use this opportunity to kind of give a little background so you have some context in my comments as they come up in the future. My educational background is in political science. I hold two degrees in poli sci. I have spent my entire life as founder and CEO of my own business enterprise, so I'm part of the business. I'm part of the business community as well, but I've also been a lifelong community activist, focusing on environmental issues and all kinds of stuff like that. I also happen to be someone who has been battling PG&E because we lost our house. We moved to Magalia a decade ago, and a family of seven, and we evacuated barely on the morning after everybody else on December 9th at 4 in the morning. Our vehicle broke down. It was a harrowing experience, but what it did was it made our family homeless for nearly six weeks. We were over in Fort Bragg before we were finally able to get a rental house over there. And because of my educational and civic background, I immediately, as my response to the fire, was to both study the whole issues surrounding PG&E but also the homeless issues involved. Back 21 years ago, I was involved in a Black Lives Matter issue in Riverside, California when four young Riverside police officers opened fire and murdered the young 19-year-old Taisha Miller while she lay sleeping in an epileptic seizure. In that process, we sustained protests for a year and a half. During that time, I got arrested with Martin Luther King, Al Sharpton, Dick Gregory, and other very, very great people like that. And so what it's done is it's made me study the police issues ever since. I've stood witness in the last six months to my own share. I've been documenting it since I've been here. And the hostility, it's a war on homeless. And I will look forward to saying more, but I'm very concerned about a lot of the policies and what's coming forth because the wrong people, the people that are instilling fear, the hate on homeless, the war on homeless are the ones that are being the most vocal. And we've heard them here tonight. I will look forward to coming back with more comments. Patrick Newman, followed by Jeff Creed and Nicole Nava. If you say something enough times, I guess it becomes true. But this whole thing about our creeks being destroyed by the homeless is a fiction. And if we look at overall environmental impacts, degradations of ecosystems worldwide, it's not the homeless. Yeah, we've got environmental problems, but there's no science behind any of that. It's not documented. It's bullshit. Okay. Can you speak up for me back here? Sure. One comment that I heard, imagine what a super sad summer it was for those children, but imagine what a super sad summer it was for the brain-injured man, living in the bus shelter at 108 degrees, breathing smoke all day. I don't think people who have houses spend much time thinking about, when they speak this way, about the suffering of people who are out there living this life. Or in Butte County Jail, for that matter. A couple of quick things. If every election, there's a council meeting on that night, and I was just going to suggest, maybe this has been thought of already, but moving that, we move the council meetings a lot. How about moving the council meeting from the election night to another night? Okay, it's probably covered. But anyway, the plaza closure that's happening right now, I had many jobs in my life, one of which had to do with landscape maintenance and an applicator's license, pesticide. It says the plaza's being fumigated. I don't see any documentation out there. I don't see anybody doing anything. This makes me, as a homeless advocate, very suspicious that the plaza's being fumigated. The plaza's been closed for one simple reason, and that's to get the homeless out of there for two weeks, so that we can reestablish that turf, literally. Again, for the record. I was here for the special meeting last time. I listened to all four hours sitting on the porch out there on the steps. I really wanted to come here and give part two to that three minutes that I talked about, or I spoke that night. It's impossible in 57 seconds to hardly even begin. But one of the things that I wanted to do, one of the themes that I was talking about was human rights. We don't have our human rights house in order, and yet we're proceeding with solutions. To cram it in a little bit more, what's going on with that four acres by Torres? When I look at the chart that was produced, there's 80 by 200 acres, I mean 80 by 200 feet, it's designated for use. Again, another one of my checkered career things. I'm not sure if you've seen the survey. That's less than a half an acre. Why aren't we driving hard to put tiny houses on that four acres? I really think somebody needs to pick that up, because warehousing people is not humane, especially when you drive them in there by way of criminalization and deprivation. Tiny houses are actually a humane way to provide people with real shelter. So, four acres, tiny houses. Jeff Creed, followed by Nicole Nava, and Jenea Beatty. Good evening, Council. Sorry, mic is up a little high tonight. So, let's talk about Chico for a minute. If civilization is based on agreeing to a set of rules and people following those rules, then I would think a city's first responsibility would be to establish those rules, get a consensus, and then enforce those rules. When I look at Chico, Chico doesn't do any of that. Chico tries hard to get people to comply to rules, but they don't enforce rules. I brought that up, what was it, four years ago? Three years ago? About code enforcement, and I pleaded with this council for two years to get code enforcement on the agenda. The former Mayor Stone pulled it down. Good time, it was a good thing to do, but it never found its way back. And my intention of having the council look at the policies, procedures, and actions of code enforcement was to get you to realize that Chico can be better, and Chico should be better, but it never will be better with this current leadership following the practices that's followed for the last, how long has Mayor Ann been on this council? 18 years? 25 years? I don't know. My point is, Chico is monumentally screwed for the next decade. So if we look at just the law and order issue, how many cars do you see rolling around Chico without a front license plate? How many cars do you see rolling around Chico with other vehicular violations and they never get pulled over? It's not the police officer's fault. They don't have the manpower to do it. They've been here for years telling you they don't have the manpower to do it. So we look at all the other petty crimes, so to speak, and they're out of control. When I go to other cities, I don't have bicyclists or scooter people blazed by me on the sidewalk like I do in Chico. And Chico's tiny. How hard is it to control that in such a small downtown? Evidently nearly impossible. So to put more officers on the street, you're going to need a sales tax, but nobody trusts you with a sales tax. That's going to take about two years to see that money. Then you're talking another two years to get officers on the streets in sufficient numbers to make a difference. Now you're talking about another two to three years to actually change the culture in Chico. You're talking about a decade before Chico starts to see the light. And if you're at home, verify my numbers on this. Check this out. You're talking about a child entering high school right now will probably never be able to go to the Creek Road with his friends at lunchtime and play in the creek until he goes away to school at another city at a better college. Think about that child in eighth grade looking forward to high school next year and the freedoms that should come with high school. It's disgusting. Nicole Nava, followed by Jenea Beatty. Good evening. So tonight I think where I would like to put my focus is we're talking about solutions this evening. And so across the street, you have the Chico Plaza, and it is under repair, getting cleaned up and all of that going on. And so what I submitted as a plan that you could follow, easy action plan was, okay, you've got a two week period where it's cordoned off, being cleaned. You have two weeks to get a regular COVID test done on people, not just a rapid, a regular COVID test done so that they could be cleared. There is space in the shelters. We all know this. And those people could enter those shelters and get assistance. So it is like the perfect setup. If people choose not to go after getting a clear COVID test and having the shelter bed, to me, it's quite clear. We've met the conditions of Martin V Boise. And those people should be entering. If they're not, we heard the prior gentleman speak about code enforcement. That is what should be applied here. And so I would direct this to the city attorney to do some homework and look into the step that, that involves people who are noncompliant and don't enter those shelters. Because to me, we cite that as enforcement. That is what the city is charged with doing. If they cannot afford the fine, because they probably won't be able to super duper. We have the form to convert that over to community service hours. Enter apparently city attorney, because the DA will not deal with our situations. You know, this to me is untenable. I don't understand why we have even a code enforcement and we have officers. If we're not going to allow them to do their duty. And I'm sure that they would love nothing more. They are residents here too. You've heard a theme tonight and you hear people saying it's not collaborative. You know, people are polarized. Well, we are polarized because we're sitting here with leadership who has failed us time. And again, I would love nothing more than to make nice with a lot of people and, and think the way they do. But that's where we went down this road of our community, looking the way it does. And we have begged for solutions. And now your solution is to say, we're going to spend the taxpayers money instead of put the housing obligation with the county where it belongs. And the addiction and mental health treatment services where it belongs. You want taxpayers on the hook for years to come. And I think you want to lodge yourselves over having these things that we're on the hook for that are solvable. We have empty shelter beds. What are you doing? We don't even have the money to take care of infrastructure. Now, we heard the county say they didn't even put in for the funds. Why are you not asking what's wrong with that? Get yourselves over to the board of supervisors chamber. The last speaker is Jenea Beatty. So last time I was in here for an emergency meeting. First of all, I appreciate you looking at me this morning. I appreciate you being here this time, Alex Randall. If I walk out of this place and you have something to say to me, I need you to address me directly when I'm in this room. Don't go on a long tangent when I am not here. So I cannot address you. Can we be understood with that? Thank you. Now with an emergency meeting, Miss Anne, you're the man. Can I please have you cover your nose? Because you think this oxygen deprivation mask is helping anyone? You have this plexiglass. Seriously. So let's talk about masks. Let's talk about the, why you want to enforce this when there's only studies that show that they don't work. But I'm not going to go there. I'm just a nurse. What do I know? But I'm also a mom. And I'm a community member. And I think that the lack of caring about your community, your constituents is absolutely disgusting and all very apparent. The lack of care for. Please cover your nose. My nose is covered. Thank you. It is now. Okay. So, Because you would like to silence me. Guess what? In slavery days, that's exactly what they did. They made my ancestors wear masks so they couldn't talk. Again, regaining my time. Let me just tell you this. Your emergency meeting is absolutely asinine. We have children suffering from PTSD in your city. How about an emergency meeting for that? How about we focus on our police officers? I listened to police chases. Chico police department doesn't have a health care system. They don't have a helicopter. But you want to waste money on supplying and continuing to ruin the city. How much can this city take of you five? How much? Alex has done ruin the environment when she's so environmentally minded. You are calling for emergency meetings, not realizing that there are children being raped and molested and women being beaten while being at home. Kids matter. All children matter. And you need to start addressing the community that writes your paycheck. You're talking about homeless people all the time. That's all I hear from this board. We're not talking about how can we support the police department to make Chico PD better again. How can we support community members and children? We've gone through the fire. We're going through all of this smoke and all the floods. Let's try to make Chico, better again. But I have a feeling that will be happening on November 3rd. And that was our last speaker. That was our last speaker. May I suggest a break? Yes. Let's take a 10-minute break, please. Thank you. Let's talk to the air. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. We'll call our meeting back to order. Item 4.1 is a hearing on the appeal of the City Manager's Administrative Review affirming the Public Works Director Engineering's determination that the sewer fee calculations for PM 1503 were applied correctly per Chico Municipal Code Section 1536190. Hello. Good evening. I've forgotten your name. Chris Duffy, sorry. That's fine. Good evening, Mayor Schwab, Vice Mayor Brown, Council Members. Item 4.1 is an appeal of the City Manager's Administrative Review affirming the Public Works Director's determination that the sewer fees calculated for parcel map 1503 were applied correctly per Municipal Code Section 1536190. So, on behalf of their client, Mr. Steve Seidenglanz-Norstar, submitted the appeal letter to the City. The letter had some items that I'd like to clarify. Number one, City staff received... the sewer application as a condition of recording the final map for the property located on Hagen Lane. In accordance with Chico Municipal Code Section 15.36.190, engineering staff processed the sewer application and the applicable fees. Norstar Engineering, on behalf of the client, is appealing the fees charged on the basis of not being able to construct and that the payment of the fair shares of the facilities does not exist. So, for clarity, the fees in question related to the sewer main fees, which are assessed based on the length of the property frontage, at roughly $52 per linear foot. This fee is only a portion of the actual cost to install these much smaller diameter pipes. According to some of our capital projects, it's roughly about $150 per foot to install. So, roughly a third is the fee that's collected. Sewer mains, by code, are the responsibility of development or the property owner when they connect. Not to be confused with sewer trunk lines, which are larger diameter pipes and collect wastewater from many sewer mains. Truck lines are identified in our sewer master plan and are associated with our development impact fee program to accommodate build out of the sewer system. The first point of contention relating... is relating to not being able to construct. North Star used an incorrect design criteria when they provided their recommended design. A prior study adopted the Hagen Business Lane sewer design criteria for this industrial business complex. North Star Engineering designed used a much steeper slope than was what adopted in this plan. When utilizing the appropriate sewer pipe slope, the end of the pipe has roughly 3.68 feet of cover, which is within acceptable standards and therefore it's constructible. On the second point of contention, the city has made errors in the past in not implementing sewer to the extent required, then being left with paying for an extension in the future. There are unknowns in the future and therefore intended on serving sewer to the limits of the property line as required by the Chico Municipal Code. There is a potential for other properties to hook up and therefore would not want to limit those future sites or add an undue financial burden on the city sewer program. Therefore, based on the information presented, staff recommends the City Council deny the appeal on the basis that the sewer main fees are consistent with the Chico Municipal Code section 15.36.190B. And that concludes my portion of the appeal hearing and I'm available for follow-up questions if you have any. Council have any questions? I might have to hear from the appellant. Okay. I'll stand by. Okay. So we will open the public hearing on this item. Did we have any public comments via Engage Chico? No, we did not. Nor did we have any via email? No. Okay. We have three speakers. We have three speakers. So each speaker will be given three minutes. Okay. And our first speaker is Jay Fumazi, followed by Jim Stevens and Rob Berry. Okay. Can I answer a question here? Since it's an appeal, doesn't the appellant apologize? Oh, that's true. I apologize. Okay. I have my same question. I talked to a colleague. Okay. Let's go over those ground rules first. So that would be... So it would be the appellant first, and that is Jim Stevens, I believe. And how much time would Mr. It says in the policy that 15 minutes. Okay. Well, then you will have up to 15 minutes. You don't have to take all that time. Exactly. No worries. That would be impossible. Okay. So let's reset his time. I know. I've just got to add. Well, that's... Yes. Vice Mayor Brown is just asking if we have to disclose communication. Ex parte communication. Okay. And the city attorney is saying yes. So let's ask Council Member Morgan. Vice Mayor Brown, yes. Did you have any ex parte communication? Yes. I met with Mr. Stevens, and he showed me various maps, plans, and how he thought the code was perhaps applied correctly, but it doesn't actually fit in this circumstance. Most of our other conversations are over privilege games, and he's losing. Okay. Vice Mayor Brown. Okay. So I'm going to ask Council Member Morgan to tell us what he thought. No ex parte communications to disclose. Okay. I did not have any communication. And just the emails that are part of the public record. Okay. Ms. Reynolds? I have none. Ms. Dorrie? I'm just a . Okay. Never tired of her writing. And did Council Member Huber have any communication? Mr. Stevens sent me an email. We didn't have a chance to connect. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Readings. It's been a while, but I'm up here. First time in the cage. It's kind of nice. I'm here to... I'm Jim Stevens with North Star, representing the applicant, Mr. Seidenglanz, who owns the property at the intersection of Huss Lane and Hagen, to the west to the airport, and to the north to Aztec Drive. We have a parcel map in the case, and we're going to give it to the City of North Star. And I'm here for consideration and the mitigations for that parcel map. The conditions of approval are what we were talking about tonight. And I'm here to present our case that to appeal the staff decision to pay for the sewer mains fees in Hagen Lane, which amounts to about $60,800. And I think this is... This disagreement is just some poor communication. Unfortunately, we don't have documentation because of timing. We first applied for this map back in the spring, early summer of 2015, and went through the first iterations with it with a completely different staff. Brendan's here, but the people that were working on this were no longer here. And currently, we just don't believe that the ask for $60,000 to fund our share of the of the sewer line in Hagen Lane is appropriate. And I don't think the city did earlier as well because in our sewer service application, which you apply for and then they respond with what you'll need for your development, back in 2015, they anticipated a front, a mains front fee of 530 feet. That happens to be very, very close to the final front footage between the BKG parcel on the northeast corner of Hagen, I mean southwest corner of Hagen, or of Aztec and Huss, and the end of the line out by the railroad tracks. That was what was anticipated to be paid. And we don't feel that is the case for two primary, we wouldn't feel it's justified for two primary reasons. One is that we have, we don't need to use any sewer out in Hagen Lane. When the, when Aztec was built, Northstar did the plans by the way, we left a sewer lateral from the middle of Aztec coming out into this property between two buildings. There's two kind of long, skinny commercial buildings on the west side of Huss. And we poked a sewer line out there to be able to connect to this property. And, and so we, and we, when, when Lulu's moved out there a couple of years ago, the city staff did a great job of accommodating that movement. And only had them pay a portion of what their sewer fees were for, that are due for the entire property. The conditions of approval say you're going to pay for your trunk line fees and your plant capacity fees, the sewer plant out by the river, when you pull a building permit. There's two existing buildings on the property at the time. They were both on septic systems and they were both operating on their septic systems. So the idea is when you intensify the use, and pull a building permit, that's when you pay your trunk and main, and plant capacity. But at the, at the, at the recordation of the final map, you have to pay your sewer mains fees. And since we're not using the sewer mains on Hagen, we don't see a necessity of paying them. There's a second reason. Chris and I did disagree a little bit about, about how to construct the mains. And I'm not going to disagree with him now. You can actually do it. It's very, very flat slope. And, you know, I don't think we'd, we'd put it that flat to get it down to three and a half feet at the end, at the westerly end of the Hagen Lane line. That's pretty shallow, although it meets code, but it tells you that you really can't extend it any further, or it won't. And it tells you that you can't bring anything from the south, or it won't get into it because it's going up against Greg. But another reason that we're really concerned about, is, is that this is, this imposition of the fees is an exaction. It's what, what the state allows cities and counties to do to offset the cost of infrastructure. They want you to pay your fair share of everything. And the $52 and 88 cents a foot now is, it was initially thought to be half of it. And as Chris correctly pointed out, it's not quite half of it anymore, maybe closer to a third, just because, the costs keep going crazy. But there, there are, there were some, in my research, I found a couple of interesting court cases. In 1971, the California Supreme Court, concluded that it's a legitimate use of city's power to exact these fees, to help offset the cost of, of infrastructure that pays for your development. So you have a development, you got to pay your fair share of the infrastructure costs. Then, and I think it was 76, the state attorney general, further opined and said that, yes, I support that conclusion. And this was in my letter. It said, provided it furthers implementation of the city's general plan and bears at least an indirect relationship to the impacts created by the development. So, one of the anomalies of that project is that the north right-of-way line of Haven and the south property line of Hagen, the city's largest land line of the property, also happens to be the city limit line, the sphere of influence line. So, when, when we did our improvements out there, we actually had to go to the county and have them approve the plans. So I would think that it's impossible, to implement the general plan, by constructing, or assessing money for future construction in the county. It just doesn't seem right to me that you can say, well, well, that's in the county, but we may need it one day. And my argument to that is, well, if someone in the county wants to connect to the city sewer under the current code, they're going to have to annex. They're going to have to apply for annexation. And I would suspect that part of the discussions in that annexation would be, okay, you're going to use our facilities. You've got to pay your fair share. And since no one in the city is using that facility, it should be on the people that will use it. That's kind of what the Supreme Court cases say. So there are a few other issues, but these are the two primary ones. I just don't think that it makes sense to rely on implementing your general plan on facilities that are outside of the general plan area. Theoretically, a mains fees are based upon costs. And your nexus fee studies that analyze what it's going to cost, and then you fairly implement the cost over the remaining development property. This isn't in the city. It's not in the sphere, and it wasn't analyzed. So I think it's a little incongruous to try to assess a fee based upon that. And that's a lot of down-in-the-weeds talk. I'm happy to answer any questions if you have them. Thank you. Mr. Stevens, I have a question. Knowing that you hadn't spoken to any of my colleagues, I am not sure that I could have followed what you just said without you showing the maps when you did. When you showed the maps, it was crystal clear. So I was following that in my head. I don't know how this particular appeal would go, but just if it were delayed, could you come back and show that? I certainly could, provided that... Which maps are you looking at? Oh, I just showed him some exhibits relative to where the city limit line is, relative to Hagen Lane and our property. And where the line was coming in and who it would serve. When you just talked about the depth of how it would go, where it can go and can't. I've looked through the report, and it's just not as clear as what you showed me. Sure. If... I don't want it to go... I want it to be... Right. Whatever right is. But I don't want us to decide not having the information as clear as I have it, if that makes any sense. Okay, thank you. I have a question. Sure. Mr. Stevens, you mentioned... He's in the cloud. You mentioned that there was already a line that was put in down Aztec. And I'm trying to understand whether you were indicating that you could look into the Aztec, line rather than hook into the Hagen line. Is that what you were implying? Well, let me see how to phrase this. The Aztec line is about what was initially anticipated for the fair share, this development's fair share. Since then, Sierra Nevada has put their development out there at the end of Aztec. And Sierra Nevada and my client helped. They paid together their share of... Of that sewer line. And in the materials you have, you saw that for the code, you have a choice of either installing the sewer or paying the mains fees. In the Aztec side, we installed the sewer. It's just the 1,030 feet of frontage on Hagen that we're being asked to pay for, even though... You can't get sewer all the way to the westerly portion of the property. And you certainly can't extend it any further. Not to mention the railroad and all that. So... Yeah, I'd have to say that I agree with Mr. Morgan that I would definitely like to see some maps and diagrams that give us a better representation of what it is. As you're saying, before I feel comfortable making the decision on this. I'd be happy to do that. Do we have a time restraint with an appeal? Well, it's my understanding that if the appellant's willing to delay the appeal, then we're okay. But if we're trying to force a delay, then that probably... We should probably... And they're demanding an answer tonight, then we probably should conclude the proceeding. So if they're willing to delay... If they're willing to delay it and it's Council's pleasure, then obviously that can be done. Well, I have a question that might help. And that would be, if I'm permitted to ask Andrew, if this isn't in the general plan area, is it possible to make an exaction for it? By its own definition, it cannot implement the general plan. Mr. Jarrett, would you be able to answer that? Well, I'm a little reluctant to jump in and be answering questions of the appellant. If that's the question from the Council, we should take that up after testimony has been provided and the public hearing portion closed. So Mr. Stevens, would you be open to delaying this and providing more information at a future meeting? I don't think it would be objectionable other than the fact that we have an upcoming termination of the map. And we apologize for that. Things got crazy out there and we ended up with kind of a hair on fire effort to... to get the map recorded. And we're ready to record it with the exception of getting this fee issue settled. We had another issue on paying the trunk and plant capacity fees for the larger parcel, for the rest of the parcels. But we got some great suggestions from staff and we've been able to avoid that until the building permit process occurs. We just, I think, I think that there was an emergency declared by the city and that freezes all tentative map timeframes until such time, from what I read, until such time as that emergency is declared over. So as long as there's an emergency, we don't have a timeframe. But once we have a timeframe, then I think we have either 60 or 90 days. So I think there's plenty of time to come back and I'd be happy to prepare some exhibits. For your review. Madam Mayor, I'm unaware of that statement that he's just made that that's all solved while there's an emergency. I would not rely on that. So I'd like to make a motion that we table this and allow the appellant the opportunity to provide greater documentation of what he's talking about so we can make a better decision. Mr. Stevens, can I ask a quick question? Certainly. I might second that, Mr. Huber. I just have another quick question. So if we brought this back at the next meeting, being the 20th, and if what Mr. Jarrett says is correct, that under the emergency it's not extended, would that get you enough time to do your map that you need to do if it was on the next meeting? Or when is your map possibly expiring? Or do you know that? It would be expired now. If it were not for this extension. And I checked with the planning staff. They concurred. But I'm not going to be in town on the 20th. Okay. So the following. The following. Election day. That comes to be shortly. Pardon me? That's going to be shortly. Oh, yeah. Before we consider a motion, would we need to either continue or close the hearing? You would actually keep. You said that there were a couple of other speakers. We do have two. We would need to. Two additional. And I would recommend keeping the hearing open for purposes of continuing. Okay. So any other questions for Mr. Stevens? Thank you for your time. I guess I'm going to wait. Okay. Okay. Who was the next speaker? Jay Fumazi followed by Rob Berry. Jay Fumazi followed by Rob Berry. It doesn't look like anybody is waiting in the lobby. Okay. Yeah. They're coming now. Okay. Just a second. They're in the other building. You know, G. Yeah. I'm just not sure how I feel about this. This is a commercial project, which we want, connecting to county sewer lines, which we don't control. But according to our local ordinances and our city staff and city manager, we can collect fees, which we also want, and it's only $60,000. And as we know, if you can bill the commercial operation, money is freely available. And we all know that since Proposition 13, cities have to make up the lost revenue in any way that they can. If you deny this appeal, I suspect North Star might be forced to sue. That is going to leave a mark, but then we heard we have millions of dollars sitting around for one-time use. Of course, we might have to cut back on our quality of life plan, but as you know, lawyers' fees are always worth it. Maybe you could waive all the fees instead, including development and sewer fees like you did for Simplicity Village. What's money when you have a project you really, really like? For that matter, what do rules matter if you can waive fees for one and not another? It's all just so confusing and complicated. It's not like we can count on everyone being treated the same. No, because that would give advantages to the wrong people. We need to reserve taxpayer money for only the right people. I can see how you're torn between competing interests, and especially how important it is for you to not be accused of favoritism or bending the rules to favor projects you like, and being very, very strict, indeed, for projects you don't like. Subjecting projects to the rules is not a good thing. Subjecting projects to your political litmus test is something I guess we'll just have to live with since you have so much power and we are so ineffective. If the current state of Chico is any indication, your tenure on this council has been a miracle, but probably not like you think. Here's hoping you can sort all of this out and make the right decision. Good luck. Thank you. He's actually our last speaker, our only speaker for this item. So it is the council's pleasure. Move the table to next meeting. To November 3rd. November 3rd, correct. And that's keeping the public hearing open? Yes. Okay. Second. So was that the same motion I made? The motion was just timed, incomplete, and then moved. Was that the motion I made? It was... Out of order. Okay. So the motion will be... Whatever. Whatever it says. Council Member Huber motion. And who seconded that? I'm sorry. I seconded it, but we did it before we had public hearing. So I don't know if it's a proper motion. Scott, make your motion again. I don't see the motion to help this conference. So Council Member Huber's motion was to delay it to the next meeting. The city attorney weighed in and indicated that if the council does consider that, that we need to keep the public hearing open. So if Council Member Huber is okay with me adding that into the motion, I will do that. Yes. And Council Member Huber, can we table it till November 3rd since Mr. Stevens is not available at the next meeting? Yes. If he promises not to make a long presentation on November. Okay. So we had a motion from Council Member Huber. Who was the second? Was that Council Member Reynolds? Yes. Earlier. I just want clarifying question to Mr. Stevens. Does that mess up whatever it is you currently have planned? You're good. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Council Member Huber? Yes. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member Orry? Aye. Council Member Reynolds? Aye. Council Member Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 7-0. Item 4.2 is a hearing on resolution amending the city's fee schedule. We have a report from Catherine Mathis, accounting manager. Hi, Catherine. Tonight I'm presenting the 2020 fee schedule on behalf of the departments. The existing fees have all been adjusted in accordance with the municipal code, exhibit B details the calculations of the inflators I used. The development impact fees, which require a public hearing are included in exhibit C. And there are four changes to the fee schedules that have been brought forth by the departments. The directors who brought those forth are here this evening if you have any questions for them. And if you have any other questions I can address, I'd be happy to. Any questions? Hold on. I have to get to the right item. The Chico builders asked about the difference in the construction cost index, the 3.89 versus the 6.33. What did we go with? I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing. Oh. Thank you. Can you hear me? Mr. Autoboney could come up and answer that question. Yeah. Sorry. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes. Yes. Yes. Would you mind repeating the question? . The Chico builders, I know you went back and forth with them, and they're fairly content with where you arrived. The last question I got from them was on the cost index, the 3.89 versus the 6.33. Where did you land? I believe we landed, that was the Caltrans Highway Construction Cost Index. Yes. So we met last month with finance, and we went through the methodology, and we had revised that methodology. So I don't know the exact number we landed on. Catherine might be able to comment on that. But for context, in 2018, when we adopted the new Development Impact Fee Program, we had municipal code changes associated with that, and utilized that Caltrans Highway Construction Cost Index, because it's relative to highway construction, and it's related to the construction components, like asphalt paving, storm drainage piping, those kinds of things. So we continue to have that dialogue. We'll continue to have that dialogue in the future with them, that being the developer group, and look at appropriate mechanisms for future cost indexes. Do you want to answer the question on that one number? Which one was it? The 6.2 versus 3.8. 3.89 versus 6.33. 6. On the construction cost index? They're proposing using a weighted average rather than an annual average. And so that's not what's called for in the municipal code currently, so it would require a change in the municipal code. Okay. Thank you. Additional questions? So we will open the public hearing. Were there any public comments on the engaged Chico? Yes. We had two. One from Kim. One from Nicole. Any email comments? We received the one late email from Kate Lydon that is in, that dropped into everyone's inboxes. And I believe we have two speakers on this item. Okay. As you are getting people queued up, let's take a moment to read the comments. Okay. Our first speaker is Jay Fumazi, followed by Rob Berry. Go ahead, Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Council, have you had enough time to read the comments? Mr. Huber, have you had enough time to read the comments? Yes, thank you. Okay. All right. So our first speaker is Jay Fumazi, followed by Rob Berry. All right. Good evening. From what I understand, this proposal is affecting all city fees, schedule fees, and you apparently want to raise them. I don't agree with this. We have a pandemic going on. People are in money crunches. So automatic. I know this only happens once a year. But still, why would you want to raise fees in a situation like this? This is going to affect everything from housing, anything to do with the city. And I don't understand why it needs to be raised now. Why it couldn't be put off. Thank you. Our last speaker is Rob Berry. I look through the proposed changes to the fee schedule, and I see that except for correcting your overcharging for airport drop-off fees, you are increasing others and adding new ones. What are the new fees? Great. I know the city has big plans, and all of that has to be paid for. And since you didn't have the courage to vote for a special tax increase, because you know that voters just don't trust you with more general fund dollars, and we see from tonight's agenda just why that is such a reasonable position for voters to take. That's why we are constantly looking for more money, like getting into the cannabis trade for millions of new dollars that will come into the general fund, you hope. I see a pattern. We do have increasing costs of living, salaries and retirement benefits of city employees to take care of. That is not cheap, and the burden is growing all the time. Better to squeeze every cent from those trying to build something here in Chico. Business people have plenty of money, and it's only fair that they give it to you and give you a bunch of it. We need it, or you need it, more than they do anyway. I see that much of the increases are for employees increasing hourly rates. A fire permit technician costs over $100 an hour, for example. And that is far from the highest paid employee on the payroll. I see, for example, that the change in payroll rates is increasing hourly rates. The payroll costs are increasing by about $2 million in 2021. That is more than the consumer price index rate of growth. But hey, developers should be happy we don't use the construction cost index to raise fees. That is growing three times faster. I wonder why. There is no limit to what you can accomplish when you spend other people's money. Good job. Keep raising them. That way we can all find out at what point businesses will go elsewhere. Did you notice, for example, that Boeing is moving from Washington to South Carolina? I'll bet South Carolina has very high fees, and that's why they're moving. Washington just wasn't charging them enough. Another lost opportunity you certainly won't repeat here in Chico. Way to go. Thank you. With that, we'll close the public hearing. Look for comments, questions, or direction from counsel. I'll move approval of the fee schedule. Is there a second? Second. Okay. We have a motion from Councilmember Ori and a second from Councilmember Huber. I do want just to make one comment. There was a question from someone from the public as to why are we raising the fees now. We're raising the fees now because this costs the city money to... These costs are reflective of what it costs the city to do this business. We had made a decision probably 10 years ago not to raise fees for a period of time, and then when we did go to raise fees, the difference was exponential and very, very difficult. Anytime we raise fees, it's difficult, but taking them incrementally I think is a wiser way to operate. Any other questions? Any other comments? Okay. Have a... Okay. Councilmember Huber? Yes. Councilmember Morgan? No. Councilmember Ori? Aye. Councilmember Reynolds? No. Councilmember Stone? Aye. Vice Mayor Brown? Aye. Mayor Schwab? Aye. Carries 5-2. Okay. We'll go to the regular agenda. Okay. 5.1 is fiscal year 2021 department budget presentations and discussion. We'll start with a presentation by city manager Orm. Yes. Good evening, everybody. It is... Here we are again talking city budget. Obviously, this is one of those items that encourages a lot of discussion and interest. Unfortunately, in these times, it makes it rather difficult because of the fluctuation. We've got a lot of discussion with regard to the economic activity nationwide, let alone here in Chico. So, you'll hear a lot of the same reflections that I've given over the past number of years, but I've synopsized it. I did have a speech, actually nine pages worth, but I have boiled it down to a page and a half. So, but I'm just being honest with you. There's a lot to say, but we've accomplished a tremendous amount, so I'm really pleased to be able to share. Every year, it seems like I open the budget discussion with a reflection upon the difficult task this organization is facing. organization has endured year after year. For the past seven plus years, the city has put its head down and managed through ever-changing conditions from a financial disaster to the effects of a natural disaster to now managing through a pandemic. Regardless of the challenges, my overarching goal and strategy has been to point the way toward the difficult path forward to get Chico to a point of financial stability and strength. But that can only be achieved by a laser-focused city staff, a city council who will remain vigilant, and citizens who have a great deal of patience and who are able to withstand diminished levels of services, strategy, and responsiveness from their local government, which many cities are able to deploy due to having adequate means. Along the path, the city has had to manage through pre-existing conditions. I almost hesitated not to mention these. But I think from a perspective of the city, I think it's a great opportunity to do that. The city's first steps, which I think are very important, consisted of rudimentary financial policies and procedures, deficient checks and balances, a certain level of unrealistic expectations, all in conjunction with various external financial realities and burdens that were, and still remain, largely out of the city's control. I don't mention these hurdles to impugn the integrity of anyone who previously served by any means, as I genuinely believe they had the best interests of the city and community in mind. But a perfect start to the city's journey is to give the city the opportunity to take a step back and reflect on the challenges that have been faced by the city's past. I think the city's first steps have been to make sure that the city's financial system is in place, and to make sure that it's not a place where it's just a place of! The city has now reached a historic point in relatively short order. Due to the city's extreme internal financial focus, this organization is now at a pivotal stage for the first time. I am proud to recommend the city's emergency and operational reserves be fully funded. I also want to make a point of note that, along with this recommendation, which will be memorialized should Council agree in a subsequent action at your meeting of the 20th, I realize that the City Council also desires to be fully funded. I would like to hear from individual departments to discuss specific areas of interest asked about in City Council prior discussions. I want to conclude my introduction by stating that this organization needs to continue its focus on maintaining the financial prudence that has gotten the city to this point, but the city now needs to extend that focus into operational strategic initiatives, which have been lacking due to the extreme focus on the financial recovery. One aspect of that focus will be on evaluating a restructuring of the city organization to fix a very basic principle related to span of control. As your CEO, I have had the dubious distinction of managing through a span of control double of what is typically recommended in all business management books. Therefore know that I will be bringing back next fiscal year a modified organizational structure that will enable a more operationally strategic model to fulfill the needs of the city. I will also be bringing back a more strategic design to align a more tactical and results-oriented city government. However, for now, I would recommend that you hear from the department directors, give direction to any specific matters of import, and have staff return in January with another quarterly check-in as your professionals continue to monitor the COVID-19 economic impacts. In the meantime, I am very pleased to not recommend. I am very pleased to not recommend. Go ahead, Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Rosalia Good to be here. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. I'm sorry I didn't have my pie. We'll get to that in a moment. You'll be very happy with the pie selection tonight. All right. Well, very good. What I'd like to do tonight is start off with kind of an update of where we are financially. We talked at our finance committee last week and kind of gave the finance committee an update. And so I just want to briefly go over some of those same factors I talked with the committee about. You may recall back in May, we came to you and kind of in the midst of the pandemic, really concerned about what our future was looking like. Not really sure how everything was going to shape out. That's why we wanted to kind of get the rollover. We wanted to get the budget, come back at this point here in October to give you an update of where we're at. So that's what we want to do. As City Manager Orm explained, we're in a far better shape than we expected to be. And so that's something that as the finance guy, I'm very happy about purely talking finances. That's the only thing I'm focusing on at the moment is just the finances. That's a good thing. So I want to just show some indicators to you to kind of lay this out for you. To show you how much better we're doing than what we anticipated. So this first sheet here is, it was on your PDF. I think it's PDF 3. And this shows you really our cash flow. Again, if we don't have cash, we can't pay our bills. So the very first line item shows you cash flow for all city funds. June 30th of last year, 2019, was $106 million. Now, of course, if you go to the forecast at 1231, it was $131 million. Yeah, just $131 million. The actual at June 30th was $136 million. So a change between last year's $630 to this year's $630 is a $30 million plus. That is really good, obviously. If we look... At our December 31st figures, last year, actual December 31st, $104 million. We're projecting $112 million. So even over the next few months, we're still looking to be in better shape than what we were projecting, or actually for last year. So I lay that as a foundation. I want to show you our general fund, give you a summary form here. Here's the summary. And this is just fund 001. That's the general fund. We have about six or seven funds altogether that make up the fund 001, or make up the general fund for our CAF or our annual financial report. But this is the one, 001, that really kind of shows you the meat and potatoes. And this is a summary form. So you can see that it highlights the revenues, the major revenues that we have. Now, I've shaded the areas that I really want to focus in on. So the second line down is sales and use tax. Last year, we had $25 million. This year, we ended up having $24 million. Our budget was $22 million. You may recall that we had to tweak our budget. When we were coming back to you in May, when we were listening to our advisors, they were like, going, hey, you know, danger, danger. So we took a very proactive approach of reducing our budget. Well, I'm happy to say that. The revenue came in higher than what we projected. And you can see it's $1.7 million. Some of the factors associated with that, one of them was, you may recall, we talked about a deferral where people in the first quarter and the second quarter could defer paying their sales tax over the next year. Most of them did not. Most of them paid on time. And so we're happy and excited about that, that that worked out along those lines. Some of the areas that we're looking at, it's kind of, we were looking at like a 40% reduction in these second quarter. And it really only ended up being like a, I think it's a 14% reduction. So our estimates were incorrect. But you know what? We'd rather be very cautious than overly, you know, liberal in our thought process for revenue recognition. So that area was one that came in higher. The other area is this other taxes, which comes down a little bit lower, $900,000. The big item in that, other taxes has transient occupancy tax. We were anticipating that our TOT would go down to about 30% occupancy. During this time, it went between 50% to 70%. So that's where, like a lot of the building, and then unfortunately recently because of other fires, that occupancy rate increased. But that came in higher than what we projected. So that was good news along that line that happened there. The other item that is included in there is the franchise fee. The franchise fee increased about $330,000 over, so it's closer to $1.9 million instead of being budgeted for what we thought it would be. So it came in higher. So those two brought in more. The intergovernmental revenues, the reason I highlighted that is that is, you see it's $5 million. Last year it was $1.4 million. And the budget, you may recall we brought a supplemental a couple weeks ago to you on that. So that's why the budget has been reflected. But that includes about $1.4 million of CARES Act revenue. So under our guidelines, the government guidelines, we were able to accrue that back. And that's why we're doing that. The way we have been working with the CARES Act is that's really a reimbursement of our actual costs. So we haven't incurred anything. There have been some one-time costs associated, but it's also recouping payroll costs and things that can be directly tied to that CARES Act. The other item of revenue that I think is, this shows the geek in me, the geek accounting in me, I kind of get excited about, is the use of money and property. That's our interest, our investment revenue. You can see how it grew so much. Well, last year we had some good returns. This year, don't expect that return. We just renewed some CDs here. And for five-year CDs, we were excited to get 0.5%. That's 0.5%. So, yeah. So we'll see a drastic reduction there. But at least for this last year, we had not done that well. And obviously, or we really did well considering the cash balance that we had. And we've really tried to monitor our investments and maximize those. So you can see the revenue here jumped considerably and was even higher than it was the year before. Our expenditures, again, city manager Oram back in, and when COVID started happening, really stressed departments to really watch our pennies, really conserve. There was a hiring freeze enacted at that point. Those ended up saving, in comparison with budget, save $1.4 million. The other area is the capital projects. Now, these capital projects is more of a timing deal. And those are just kind of major projects that the general fund is doing. And the general fund was paying for. Most of these will get rebudgeted into the next year. So it's just a timing difference. But a timing difference is still accounted for at June 30th. And so if we drop all the way down here to what we call excess deficiency after funding sources and uses, this is a fancy term for net income. Last year, we had a very, very good year. We attributed that to the effects of the Camp Fire, purely what we thought was a blip in revenue. Here this year, because of these blips in revenue and the reduction of costs, we had another term for this is surplus of $8.8 million. Okay? If we take that, plus the beginning fund balance, and the fund balance is kind of the carryover from the prior year. You take that carryover. Just this fund, 001, would look like almost a $22 million fund balance. Now looking back historically over our fund balance over the last 20 years, it has not been that high. Okay? So we're kind of in historic land here. With that as a backdrop, I want to take you to what City Manager Orem was talking about and recommending. This is taking that fund balance overall, for the general fund, which is that fund 001 plus about four or five other smaller funds together. A lot of numbers here, and this is to reflect our CAFR, which is our annual financial report that we provide. In fact, we're going through our audit right now. It started this last week. And that's why these are preliminary numbers until we really get it audited. We call them draft or preliminary or pre-audit. Here's last year. Here's actual. Here is what it looks like our CAFR for 2020 will be. And then over this, we have what's called our target. Based on our policies, where would these figures be based on our targets? This next item is what we're proposing some reallocations to where it would be proposed 2020 if you take action on the City Manager's recommendation. So the sheet I just showed you roughly showed about 20, a little over $20 million in these different allocations. And these, when it says assigned or unassigned or reserved, they're little buckets of money that is set aside. And there's accounting terms set aside. But if it's unassigned, that means you can use it for anything. Okay. Reserved one particular purpose. Assigned. And committed. Have basically you have had some restrictions put on there. Okay. Or some outside restrictions. But there's been action that says you can't use this for everything. Okay. So this top area is what I find quite interesting. Is there's that $21 million. If we were to look at our target, these items here, we can't really touch other than this is something that we're assigned for capital projects. Remember I told you that some of those capital projects get carried over next year. So we're taking that. We're saying that money is used for those capital projects next year. Then we have an amount that when we were doing our budget for this year, 2021, we said we're to in order to make that budget whole, we need $5.7 million so we don't go in the negative. So that money is earmarked for this next year to make sure we stay in positive light. So no fear. Those are good things. This next item is the operating reserve, which is based on seven and a half percent of our operating expenses. How did the general fund? As long as I've been here, we've never been able to reach that target this year. That's our hope is that you'll you'll approve that. The lines down here are donations and grants. We're kind of, you know, we're kind of a little bit of a We have outside restrictions. We have to use the grant money for a specific purpose. But I want to focus your attention here, if we could, to the long term reserves. We have some long term reserves. One of them is a pension trust. You can see that that continues to grow. I think we made a contribution of $400,000 this last year. But that has continued to do fairly well. Through June, it looked like the return was over closer to 4%, which was a lot. But that was not bad. We have a compensated absentee reserve. Basically, when someone leaves the city, they have their accruals, their accrued vacation or sick leave. We have to pay that out. This reserve has been set aside to help alleviate that. Sometimes there's some big payoffs that we haven't been able to budget for. So this fund helps us with that. We haven't we've been really good and haven't utilized that. But what we're looking at is potentially we have a target of $2 million. What we would like to do is get that up to $1.5 million. And then the emergency reserve. This is the one that is really awesome. This is based on 20% of our operating costs. So $10 million is if we reallocate $5 million from the excess up here down into this. We will be fully reserved in that emergency reserve. That's about five years ahead of schedule because we were putting $1.5 million a year in. Now it could free up that $1.5 million going forward. Although we'll still have to because our costs keep going up each year. We'll still have to fund that a little bit more, but it won't be $1.5 million. One of the reasons we want to, we're advocating for this. Obviously it's preparing us for the next disaster. God forbid there's another disaster. But it's sure nice to have some funds set aside there. The other aspect is you may recall this last week we closed on issuing sewer bonds. That turned out far better than what we expected. We're going to end up saving the rate payers $180,000 a year. We were projecting $160,000. But what we've been told is we timed it just right. We didn't sit there and go, let's do this date here. It all just worked out. We're at historically low interest rates. We went from a 2.4% to like a .87% return or interest rate. So it worked out very, very well for us. So with that in mind, one of the things that we had to go through is we went through a rating process. Just for the sewer fund. And the higher the rating, the lower your interest rate. So we ended up getting an AA-. You can get an AA, you can get an AA+. I think you can go AA++, I think, depending on which group you're doing. We use Standard & Poor's. So that AA- was very good. In our discussions with the sewer fund, we had a lot of questions. And then we had a lot of questions with the rating group. We spent some time talking about reserves. I'm not meaning to point it here, Vice Mayor. Sorry. I meant to point up here at the board. So here it is. If we have these opportunities to close our books and make this allocation, we can say we were fully reserved. And it's documented in black and white. So if we decide to go in the future and issue bonds, it looks really good for us. So I threw a lot of information out at you here. But I wanted to basically reaffirm that as long as I've been here six years to this month, this is the best that I've seen our financial picture. Again, I'm only talking what we have on our books. We know that there's things that we need to do. But purely looking at our books, this is the best that we've been. And it's a kudos to you as the leadership body and the leadership that has been here. And I think that's what we've been doing for the last year leading this ship over the last few years. So I just want to say kudos and answer any questions on this before we kind of transition to our departmental presentations. Kudos to you and your staff, Mr. Dow. I'm going to brag on my staff here in a moment, if you'll allow me to, because I'm very proud of my staff. And I know all the directors are proud of their staff. And it really is great to be part of a great team that works together. That sewer bond coming together was multiple departments working together, which was just awesome. Because we sat there and we had a unified front. We were able to say, hey, this, and each person was able to give their speech. So it really is citywide. Appreciate that. Thank you. Other questions, comments? I'd be interested in digging in a little bit more about franchise fees. But I can do that with the department. Sure. Discussion. Which department would talk about franchise fees? I believe Mr. Albano is prepared to talk about that. Great. Thank you. I also had a question about we had budgeted $1.5 million a year to refund our reserves. And you said that that was for a five-year period. So we think of those as one-time funds rather than on-line. Are those ongoing funds? Because when we think about savings, and some people would say, well, we've got $20 million. Why don't we hire more police officers, firefighters, code enforcement, park rangers? Those are ongoing costs that we would need to have the commitment to be able to pay year in and year out. But the one-time savings that we have accrued of $20 million, some going to reserves and then some extra, those should we, I always feel philosophically that we should think of those as one-time funds because we would not be able to afford taking that forward. How should we look at that $1.5 million? I think what we talked about internally is that we're going to come back with the budget process and give you a proposal at that time, say here's how it's looking. So it would be an annual. Okay. And then we would have a full adjustment. Yeah, I think, you know, you're seeing a little hesitancy on our end because, candidly, we don't know what this third quarter is going to end up at. We don't know what the fourth quarter is going to end up at this fiscal year. And so that's why we're cautious. We're cautiously optimistic. My hope is that that $1.5 million is ongoing. I anticipate it is. However, I can't guarantee you that, so I can't say that. And so that's why, you know, the ultimate recommendation is, look, we're going to let everybody blast through, have the questions answered, have any modifications Council desires, and come back in January. And we're just going to make it a quarterly thing. Unfortunately, that's the situation we're in. It's quarterly check-ins, and if there's any reductions necessary, I'll obviously recommend those. But if we do see light at the end of the tunnel saying, okay, this is going to be ongoing, I'm going to let you know that as soon as I can. So, yeah, it's a good question. I think that one of the secrets to our success is looking at things on a monthly basis through the Finance Committee, reviewing those reports to see if we hadn't made our targets or if expenses were going up, what was the cause, and stopping it right away, or making those adjustments. So continuing on looking at a quarter, I think, is a very, very good thing. It is through being cautious in our forecasting for revenues and being very conservative in our expenses. We don't have to be. We do need to make sure that we don't become so conservative that we dig ourselves into a hole where it's very difficult to get out of thinking about the hiring freeze, which is now a hiring slushy, perhaps, a chill. But if we lose our talent and institutional memory and just we have some very talented staff. Yeah. But if we don't invest in them, in resources, then we're apt to lose those. And that costs the city even more money. Yeah, it's a balancing act, and I think those are some poignant statements. I believe that one of the first comments I heard, and I know it was jokingly in the moment, but there was also some sentiment behind it as well, is, so does this mean if the city has done this well, does that mean that there's at least going to be a cost of living increase given? You know, to some of the employees that haven't seen one for over 12 years, candidly. And my answer had to be no. But there comes a point, there comes a breaking point at some time where, which you're referencing. And so we're going to have to really be cautious in our approach on that front. However, that reality is there, and we do want to keep talent here. I think people are hungry, and you heard my initial statement. They're sick and tired of not getting the service delivery that they really want and desire. And we've been so internally focused. We've been so focused on the financial situation. There's these breaking points all over the place in the public, internally to the city operations. So they're all over the place, trust me. It's a burden that we bear every day that we walk into the building. We know that they're there, and we know that that burden is being placed on council, and that burden is being placed on management as well, because we do know that our staff is doing a tremendous job under these circumstances. So thanks for recognizing that. And I think looking forward into these budget presentations, we see some investment in perhaps some studies or software or, you know, that old phrase of working smarter, not harder. It's like, well, how much smarter can we work when we don't have the resources to make our systems more streamlined? All right. Well, thank you for that feedback and those questions. We're going to kind of transition into the director's presentations, and I'm going to give a brief intro from me. This year we're going with a virtual pie. So I thought about it. I just don't think there's a good way to deliver pie. So here's your virtual pumpkin pie tonight. Wah, wah, wah. All right. Sorry about that, Mr. Morgan. All right. So we're kind of doing a little Hollywood kind of theme, probably maybe in honor of our new drive-in theater here. I haven't been there, but I've heard some good things about that. But our city manager has already presented it, and you'll see presentations from myself, and you can see the directors that we'll be following. And they are going to give great presentations. We're all kind of using the same template. So you kind of see familiar statistics just based on each department. And our last department will be with Chief Madden. So I'll kick it off here. And, again, I'm the administrative services director. And administrative services, our mission to serve the citizens of the city of Chico, the city departments by providing accurate, efficient, and timely information, service, and support. Obviously, we do a lot of, we're doing internal services. But, again, the role with finance is important to provide transparency to everyone that our funds are being utilized properly. We are financed, the finance department is financed through the general fund. Internal service funds the IES department, the information systems department. And we're doing a lot of work. And roughly the finance department, here's what it looks like. Just under $2 million budget. And then personnel cost of that is $1.4. And then the internal service fund for IES is $2.2 million. And included in that is personnel cost of $1 million. There is a total of 22 positions in our department. So just to highlight a little bit more on, we'll kind of talk a little bit about finance first. And Mr. Stone pointed out, and I appreciate that, that complimenting our team. And I'm here and I'm very humble as I say this. You have a fantastic finance team. And our deputy director, who's hiding back there, Barbara Martin, Deputy Director of Finance, does a wonderful job. She is the budget guru. I tell you, I'm so thankful that she is here. Because she really keeps track and she's the one who, with her team, puts this budget together. And they monitor it and they keep track of that. They're working with payroll. We have an excellent payroll team. Payroll is really, really tough. Especially for a government agency. And they do a fantastic job. We've gone through an audit with Cal State. Go to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door to Rosalia's door I'll see accounting and keeping track of things. We all do accounting, but Catherine is busy this week putting together our CAFR report. And that CAFR report is so important to what we do because that gives you a historical document of where the city has gone. I don't know what I was thinking about. About six months ago, I was sitting down, and I was actually looking through old CAFRs and reading it. Only what an accountant would do because no one else would do it because it's just kind of morbid to read through it. But thank God we've got those that we can look back through. So Catherine's team does a wonderful job. They're the ones that are receiving everything and paying the bills and keeping track of those and monitoring those. So doing a great job. I want to highlight a couple of things with the area. So that CAFR, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, is one that we go through, and we have submitted. We sent that to another organization, GFOA, Government Finance Officers Association, and we have received an award for that, for our financial statements, for 17 years running. And that is really fantastic. One of the things that we've done this year is we've submitted for two additional awards. One is for the updated investment policy that you approved. We missed the award by one point. So we're going to fix that. We're going to. We're going to come back to you and hopefully tinker with that and get that award next year. And then the other one that we're doing is, through the GFOA, you can get an award for your budget. To my knowledge, we've never gone for that award. This will be the first year. So we're going to try to make you proud again by having an award issued by an outside organization that we're following guidelines on that. So I'm excited about that. Our team is working hard to do that. So that's our finance team. And just to highlight the information systems team, I'm also very happy and proud of that team. They have really, over the last few years, have really, and I think each of the directors and teams here can see how the team has come together and is really doing some dynamic things for the betterment of our city. And they do so much. But they're the guys that if something goes wrong in a computer system in the middle of the night at PD, they can do it. They get the phone calls. And they're going over and they're fixing those things. They are a positive group of gentlemen that do a fantastic job. And Josh Marquis is our IS manager. Many of you have met Josh. And he's been a manager for now about a year and a half and just doing a fantastic job. Just to brag on them for just a second, when this COVID-19 thing was coming along, we were all kind of talking internally. What do we do? How do we do it? How do we protect ourselves? How do we protect our staff? In a matter of three weeks' time, our team was able to get 70, almost 70 people working remotely. That's just amazing to me how they came together. They were putting some time in and we were trying to be very strategic. And of course, look how it is. I mean, still a lot of our finance team and a lot of the city departments are still working remotely to protect our workers. So fantastic job. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate them doing that. One of the things that's new to IES is dealing with the radio systems. So last year, we were able to hire a radio systems analyst who just does a fantastic job. And so they're working with fire and PD and public works to make sure our radio communications are working properly. And there's some good things in the mix that are coming down very soon on that. So we're excited about that. So thank you for letting me just brag on the team. They're just wonderful. Wonderful. I appreciate it. The whole team. All 22 members of them are fantastic. So the last area is each of the departments was proactive. And you may recall that we talked about this in May that we came up with cost reduction plans for each of the departments. So there's a 2%, a 5%, and 10%. So tonight, each of the directors can share with you, and I'll show you what it would look like if we had to go to a different department. Go to your door to your door to door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door We're thankful at this point we're not able to do that. So that amount would be about $77,000 in savings. 5% you can kind of see, those would be a full-time position, account clerk and IT technician. So two full-time equivalents. And then that line item down there next to the bottom says non-FTE amounts. Those are non-permanent positions. So it's like it might be cutting professional services or cutting training. A lot of departments, in our case, we'd be cutting training. That would be one area of some professional services. No one would want to do this because we're pretty bare bones in these areas anyway. There's not a lot of fat. You know? To. To buckle our belts. But if we had to, this is where we would go. And so you can see 1%, I'd be looking at four full-time equivalent reductions in my department, which would be devastating. It would. So with that, if you, that's kind of the conclusion of my report. I'd like to transition to the next director, unless you have any questions for me. Thank you. I hope this doesn't throw off the rhythm. I've had a request for a break. So can we take a 10-minute break and then resume? Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. I think it's down. Yes. It's either down or right. Down. It's down? Wow. Call our meeting back to order. Mr. Orem? Yeah. Let me maybe help out a little bit here. When staff puts together a presentation, obviously in May we came forward to the council, and it's very direct with you that we would be coming back at the first meeting in October to present each department. We're more than pleased to continue to do that. However, we also realize there's a vast number of items that there's an interest from the council on specifically discussing, not necessarily hearing from every department and the great team that we have. And so one of the things... One of the things that we can do is we can effectively have each department director continue to come up like we have been. We've got PowerPoint presentation. However, our anticipation was that we would likely be considering reductions. And so this PowerPoint presentation is based primarily upon that, and I don't think that's necessarily needed right now. And I don't want to waste council's time if you believe that it may be wasting your time. I know it's all valuable. It's the only thing we have that we can't get back is that maybe what we can do is we can just have each department director step up, say if there are any questions, I'm happy to answer them, and then sit back down and just go through each department that way rather than them walking you through what 2%, 5%, 10% reductions would be if that's the pleasure of the council. I would be interested in knowing a couple of their highlights and a couple of their challenges. Okay. No, I agree. And not to take away from what anybody has done. I agree. My colleagues are well-versed in what each of the department does, and I agree with the mayor. What's going on in your department? What do you think we need to know about? Nothing against Mr. Dowell, but since the reductions aren't coming, while we appreciate the hard work that goes into making sure we were ready to do them, I don't need to know how they would have happened if they're not going to. Got it. That's the consensus of council. It looks like I'm seeing some heads nodding. All right. Great. All right. Next up is. HR. You got that. Is it already planned? Yes. Okay.! I'm going to ask you to go back all the way through it. Okay. That's fine. Close your eyes. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain for a hot second. There might have been an easier way. I apologize. I like what Jamie does. We're all. You're welcome. This is how we'll do the rest of the presentation for good measure. There are no other departments. There's only. I don't know. I don't know. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. it trained and then eventually we help them depart in whatever method that is. As you know, the City of Chico's HR department is two divisions. We're both human resources and risk management. On the HR side, we administer all of our labor agreements. We have over 10 bargaining agreements. Those are MOUs and PBRs for just under 400 employees. So that's extensive. We have all of our training programs, labor law compliance in accordance with the City Attorney's Office. And we're one half of the legs that does the most important thing in the city is payroll. We pay our people and that's why they love HR and why they love finance. In the simplest concept, we are literally the resources for our humans. So we joke in human resources that we're free marriage family therapists. We deal with employee issues on career advancements, marriages, divorces, babies, and whatever order that comes. Concerns about with their supervisor or with what's happening with the city and what's happening with the city. We deal with that. We deal with that. We deal with that. Our job is to listen, be trustworthy, and make sure they believe us. If HR is toxic, I think personally, maybe because I'm biased, the entire organization becomes toxic. And you have a very amazing HR department and I'm just, the HR staff is incredible. So happy to have them. So the other side of our hat is risk. So what do we do? The biggest thing we do is we contractually transfer the risk. And that's done by the City of Chico's risk department, looking at all of our contracts, looking at all of the insurance requirements, the various endorsements, very time-consuming function. We also process all tort claims against the City of Chico. And then we work with the City Attorney's Office on all claims. I have three quick brags and then I will sit down and we can keep rolling. We have continued to reduce the city's costs for workers' compensation. When I first came in five years ago, it was looking really gnarly. It has gotten better and better. And that's done through amazing department directors who will work with the city on a limited amount of time. And I think that's a really good thing. And I think that's a really good thing. And I think that's a really good thing. And I think that's a really good thing. We have been eliminating or reducing lost time. Very big kudos to my team. Also, we have made giant leaps towards making HR paperless. Our recruitment process is nearly paperless. Our annual evaluations are paperless. And payroll has become a paperless process. Everything we send to finance is electronic. So we're also helping the environment in our system and keeping it so where working remotely has not felt that stretch for us. And then finally, we do an amazing health and wellness fair every year. We do a lot of things. We do a lot of things. We do a lot of things. We do a lot of things. We do a lot of things. We do a lot of things. We do a lot of things. We do a lot of things. Except for this year in light of the current pandemic. So we're doing it virtual and it is open enrollment, which is a key time for our folks to make any changes to their health insurance. Other than that, happy to answer any questions. I believe there might have been one question on bias awareness training. Yes. Okay. So my rough estimate is to do a citywide program that was, say, mandatory on anti-bias training or awareness, we're looking at $15,000 to $20,000 roughly. And that would also have to include the cost of overtime, because a lot of our folks are production workers and require backfill. When we did the spring training earlier this year with Dr. Jones, that was a minor cost to the city. It was fantastic. He was a very small honorarium. It cost us just under $1,500. However, it only touched 35 of our 400 employees. If we did something like a factuality desktop-based training, my guess is we're spending about $2,500 per 100 employees, and again, plus that overtime. So just to give you a rough idea, those monies are currently not in the HR risk management budget. Any other questions? I had a question about our health insurance plan, and I know we do very well with premiums and because of the performance of the health of our city employees. Is that still tracking the same way? Are we still seeing that? It is. Last year we had almost a 3% decrease in our premium structure. This year we had a minor 5.92% increase, so flushing it out, 3% average over the last year. We've had a lot of changes over the last two years. Still looking great. We've had some rough claims. In the past year, a lot of cancer issues, so that unfortunately really affects the city's utilization and then affects our pool comparison within the, now they're called PRISM, but it used to be SUSEC EIA pool. Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Connie. Thank you. Director Lindsay is next. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Good evening, council. Let me scroll through here. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here I am. Community Development Building Code Enforcement Division exists to protect the public against hazards associated with construction, use, and occupancy of building structures. The division ensures the city's built environment complies with the codes and design safeguard public welfare such as life and property. Our primary funding is to provide the public with the necessary infrastructure to provide the public with the necessary infrastructure to protect the public from the effects of Our primary funding source is enterprise funds. Thirteen percent of our department's operating budget is funded by a general fund, which equals 0.6 percent, a little more than the interest Scott Dowell's CDs are making. Our total budget is $2,686,072, and I have 18 outstanding staff members. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to speed through here and go through our cost reduction and highlight some of the highlights of our department and divisions. So from one emergency to the next, building continues to see growth in housing units. Code enforcement workload spikes with each new emergency, and under city manager's leadership, we have maintained a focus on continuity of services. We were up over 11 percent over projected revenues. That's a 19 percent increase in revenue, 18-19, and a 12.5 percent, 19-20. Building activity, single family residences, 256 permits, 55 multifamily, equaling 539 units, and commercial. We have 33 permits. Currently, I have permits issued for 153 single family residences, three duplexes, and 43 ADUs. We have 690 multifamily units under construction, as well as we have 15 commercial buildings. Mr. Lindsay, just real quick, how does that compare to prior years? Is that way up? Is it down? Way up. Okay. So we're building stuff. Multi-family is huge. Stuff is getting built. We're consistent with our single family stock, but this is more than double our traditional multifamily units. Thank you. And on the other side, I do a residential conservation retrofit certificates. So we had 419 pre-1991 homes that were sold during the fiscal year. Code enforcement cases are 1,800. We had 246. And at printing, I had 238 COVID-related cases. Currently, we have investigator that had complaints of 451. So COVID-related complaints have really, obviously, during the pandemic, has spiked up. So let's just take the last second here and look at our voluntary compliance rates, which is really an outstanding percentage. We have 93% code-based. We have 99.2% of our weed abatement cases were voluntary compliance. That means, you know, this is violations or citations issued. And 99.2% of our weed abatement cases were voluntary compliance. I have... The council has provided me with the enforcement tools, and my officers use them effectively to accomplish their mission. Mr. Lindsay, a question about that weed abatement. Those other three properties. Was that less out of defiance and more out of the property owner just wanting the city to take care of it in the first place? Because I know that happens. Yes. That's just it. So it wasn't even that you were missing out on the three. It was that they just said, why don't you take care of it for me and send me the bill? Exactly. Okay. Good to hear. Mr. Lindsay, quick question. On the code enforcement cases, the 1,700 cases, is that June to June? Yeah. That is fiscal year. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. So to complete, I have... In both divisions, I have very dedicated and professional staff, and it's an honor to serve amongst them. And that concludes my presentation. Do we have any other questions? Thank you, Tony. Yeah. So the next one's going to be Director Brendan Veague. Good evening, Mayor Schwab, Vice Mayor Brown, and council. I'm Brendan Veague, Community Development Director, overseeing the functions of planning, housing, and GIS. I'm here to discuss the! I'll try to be quick here. A lot of words up there, but I'll focus on the fact that we do get some general fund to support our efforts. Mostly we do focus on private development. But for the general fund, I just wanted to highlight what you're getting from us are a commitment to the community to be available to answer questions. And in addition, of course, dealing with council priorities, state mandates, as well as regional collaboration. And again, I keep reminding folks that, to me, in my mind, we're still in a very post-campfire mode. We're still in a period of greatest need for this collaboration with state and federal agencies regarding housing and economic development. So again, you're fairly familiar with all the boards and commissions we serve and housing and all the work that they do. You saw aspects of that tonight during the consent agenda. Again, what I wanted to highlight here briefly was I think you know what our different departments and divisions do. Again, as everyone mentioned, we're not going to lose staff with the cuts that may ever occur. It really comes down to capacity and serving your needs and the things you're looking for us to do. Planning highlights. I just wanted to stop for a second because, again, Tony mentioned the development activity. It's at an all-time high and it's going to continue. We have some large projects. It's coming through like Valley's Edge that will be coming forward this year. But I wanted to focus a little bit on long-range planning because what we've been doing, I think, is incredible and a lot of it's based on your leadership and direction. Again, I think you've seen us promoting the accessory dwelling units and those free building plans and we're promoting those with interesting commercial-type quality bits that are being available to the community. Another thing I'm really excited about, we're using some of our money from the state and so is the county and we're collaborating. We're literally working on an area that's within our control. We're working on our sphere and their jurisdiction, the special planning area, North Chico. They're using their money for the planning. We're using our money for the infrastructure planning and we're both lobbying the BCAG to give us money to help support the CEQA effort. This is right in line with how things should be working in this community. We're also doing active community engagement for the climate action plan update right now and we will be pursuing a number of municipal code and general plan amendments also using that state money. I also wanted to highlight really quickly, though. Again, I'm not going to go into too much detail. Again, we always have these emerging emergencies and COVID-19s are most recent on top of the many others. I think you saw a reflection of the planning efforts team when we came up with some temporary outdoor dining parameters, provided a free option to really help those businesses continue to function under very difficult situations. Again, a lot of the work that's being done on long range is being done with money from the state, which is really exciting. I want to take one moment again because housing has been incredible. Again, I think you may be aware due to the Camp Fire, there's approximately 40 million in annual federal disaster credits that have been made available for multifamily development. We've kind of referred to it as the affordable housing gold rush. We had three projects that were in the queue that we were aware of when we were working with these groups. And then within about a month, we had four other groups trying to come in, get entitlement, get letters of support, and it was all hands on deck, not just the housing and planning, but engineering and all the other groups. And with that, I want to thank you all for coming. I think what's exciting about that is that if all of those projects are to receive their funding and were to get built over the next two years, we would be looking at 734 new affordable housing units. And again, this is incredible given how we've seen the last five to 10 years. So I think those were the highlights. Oh, I do want to highlight that's not the end of the money funnel. There's more stuff coming in and it's really exciting. The CDBG disaster relief funds are going to allocate over $32 million for multifamily. And so we'll be looking to get that. And that's for Chico alone. That doesn't include the entire region. And there will be also some other monies available for under that program for infrastructure that serves affordable housing. And so we're coordinating and collaborating with our friends down the hall in public works to get our take of that. And then one more highlight is the housing element update is underway. We're about to bring a consultant on board. And so again, that'll be a big year and a half planning effort. So I'm available for any questions. Thank you. Thank you. Looks like Carl has a question. What's your crystal ball on the CDBGDR funding stream? So the $32 million? It is ours. It's not on this. HCD has already promulgated regulations and it's available to us now? No, it will be in the coming year. I'm sorry. In the coming? Yeah. Over the next year. Next calendar year. But we think perhaps half way through six months from now we'll have better guidance. Okay. So thank you. Next up we'll have Director Eric Gustafson of Republic Works Operations. Good evening Honorable Mayor and Council members. Looks like the Council's desire is to accelerate through this pretty quickly so we will move fast. You know who I am. And our mission in public works OEMs is to maintain safe reliable modern infrastructure and services for the greater Chico community. Those are our funding sources. Total budget requested this year is just under 19 million. Total personnel costs, we separated it out just to show as many city departments, we don't make widgets, we don't produce a thing, an item. We provide services, so a lot of our costs are in personnel. Those are our areas of responsibility. As you can see, we're highly diverse. We have nine different divisions within Public Works, operations and maintenance, and those functions highlight the responsibilities of all of those nine divisions, we are essential services. And as it was mentioned earlier, kind of the original intent was to talk about if there was any cost reductions that were being proposed with this budget, and we've submitted 2%, 5%, and 10% plans to the city manager on how we would work those. If we're very thankful and pleased that we don't have to have that discussion tonight, we'll continue to monitor those things closely. However, if we do, here's our cost reduction plans. It would be catastrophic to an already lean staffing deployment model in O&M. So we could get by the 2% with just materials and supplies. When we get to the 5% level, it gets into people. You can see there's two and a half people. We'd move one, we'd lose a maintenance aid, maintenance worker, and then reduce another maintenance worker to half time. 10% is extremely catastrophic, that's five people. Maintenance aid. So we need two maintenance workers, one senior maintenance worker and one field supervisor to make that target number. So we're very pleased that we are not having that discussion tonight. And that just kind of highlights where we would be with those. So really, again, everybody who's existing staffing model is extremely lean to provide the community service expectations. We struggle with that daily. The Chico community, and rightfully so, requires, or has a lot of expectations, and we try to meet those on a daily basis. And we do struggle at times. One of the other highlights too that I do want to mention and get this on the radar, because we are going to have to start talking about it within the next year or two, and have some serious conversations about it, is the fleet and facility replacement funds are underfunded. We haven't contributed to those as we should have over the last few years, but just mainly due to budget constraints. But we recognize that and realize that, and we're going to have to have those discussions and really look hard at both of those funds in the coming years. In the asphalt management world, we commonly refer to, you know, the high-flying, the high-flying, the high-flying, the high-flying facilities as being to have these facilities underfunded to these facilities that we don't have to pay for to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these facilities to get to these real quickly, I've been with the city for 13 years and in my current role for five. And since I've been here, we've always been in cost-saving and cost-cutting mode. In pre-COVID, I was excited to, we have, you know, rebuilt certain things and done certain things in O&M incrementally, and it's been very surgically. But for the most part, we're always in cost-saving and cost-reduction mode. So I was very pleased pre-COVID that, you know, the outlook was that, hey, we're going to have a pretty fruitful budget season. And thanks to the city manager's leadership and discussions we've had with him, that I was, part of my existing duty is not only director functions, but I also perform daily fleet manager functions. And for the most part, airport manager functions at this time. We do have an interim manager that's here once a week, but 90% of the day-to-day lands on my plate. And it's just not sustainable long-term. So I was really looking forward to requesting a fleet manager, a senior maintenance worker for, as a utilities director, excuse me, utilities locator, not director. As you know, we're members of USA 411, call before you dig. So anytime a contractor does any sort of excavation, they call 811. And that call comes to us, and we have to go out and locate those utilities. As it stands now, we're pulling from different divisions to make those functions work. And it is really a full-time job. And so we were looking for a dedicated utilities locator physician. A storm drain maintenance crew of one senior maintenance worker and one maintenance worker. We have just under 300 miles of storm drain infrastructure and no dedicated crew to service or maintain that. So we were looking forward to a dedicated crew to make that happen. And then an encampment sweep team, a dedicated encampment cleanup crew. And that included a senior maintenance worker, two maintenance workers, and a sworn ranger to direct and manage the notification component. Right now, again, similar to some of these other functions, we have no dedicated staff that just do encampment cleanups. And so when we do an encampment cleanup, we pull from crews. We pull from traffic safety division, the right-of-way division, the parks division, former crew, and focus on encampment cleanups for a day or two. And there's a significant opportunity cost there. So we're stopping our normal functions and our normal daily maintenance activities and deferring those when we have to do these ancillary functions. So we were pretty confident that we were going to recommend four-year approval. The fleet manager position was a little bit more than we had expected. But we're going to continue to do that. And so we're going to continue to implement these facilities to the point where we have to put these facilities to work to the point where we have to put these facilities to work to the work on. Fire Station 1 remodel is nearing completion. This has been a challenging project, a bit of an onion to say the least. It's a facility that was built in the early 60s and for the most part hasn't been touched. And so we knew we would be riddled with change orders and things of that nature and that has definitely happened. When you go into a facility that old and you're moving plumbing and electrical and sewer and all kinds of stuff, you run into a lot along with lead and asbestos abatement too. So that's been a challenging project and an opportunity to thank Chief Standridge and his staff for their patience and fortitude with those challenges that we face. But there's light at the end of the tunnel and that remodel is nearing completion, so we're excited about that. Our 911 dispatch server room is complete. We found several years ago the condition of that server room was very undesirable and unreliable and it caused for a lot of sleepless nights. Thank you. Thank you. So we know that that critical piece of infrastructure was in that condition, so we embarked on a significant remodel there and now you have a state of the art dispatch server room that's secure and has a pretty significant fire suppression system attached to it as well. Good opportunity to thank Director Dowell and his IS team for their collaboration and support and we delivered a fantastic project with their help. So very proud of that. We're also embarking on a dispatch center remodel that's in process right now. Many improvements to the water pollution control plant the upper park road project real quickly that's currently in the environmental review process we hope to have a summer 2020 construction schedule however the environmental review process is taking a bit longer than i anticipated and i'm learning once when you do a roadway improvement project even on a dirt road and some of it's being redesigned and reconfigured next to a waterway that takes a significant environmental review so that's in that process right now but it's looking good and we're hoping for an early summer 2021 construction schedule can i ask you a really random question sure yeah it's related to upper park i was up there pretty recently and saw some new signage to indicate uh um the swimming holes up there and i was curious if that was a if that was a new project yeah that is a new project in conjunction with explore butte county and we've we've partnered with those folks and and uh that i think the result is fantastic i personally like it so we're looking to do that for more of the swimming holes and some of the other features in upper bidwell and lower bidwell park excellent that's exciting thank you thank you yeah great question vegetation management plan for all city parks greenways and open spaces is also underway that's a significant plan that will give us a prescription on how to manage those open spaces and greenways as far as you know vegetation management fire fuels reduction and some preservation that type of thing and so that's in the environmental review process right now and we're excited to have that project complete you and then of course the ongoing pg e sustainable solutions turnkey program which is bringing exciting energy savings and even more importantly cost saving measures to the city and we're in phase one of the implementation right now installing diffusers at the wastewater treatment plant uh reconditioning over 40 hvac systems and replacing the other side of the city hall hvac system system which is significant and then bringing some central controls to both city hall in in this facility phase two we're working on now you will hear shortly in the in the coming month or so which will include some large solar installations a cogen replacement at the wastewater treatment plant and some battery storage opportunities along with a full landscape irrigation control upgrade and consolidation effort real quickly i'll end on and i don't want to touch too much on this my colleague bernard abani will is going to go into more detail on asphalt maintenance and i think there's some specific questions surrounding the waste haulers franchise and where those funds are going in the in the capital site and i'll be able to answer those questions as we go through the next few minutes but we're going to continue with our asphalt maintenance program in conjunction with engineering we have a great pavement management plan and are moving forward in our maintenance zones we've broken the city up into seven maintenance zones and focus our efforts there and um onm works a year ahead of engineering to perform dig out repairs and other items before engineering comes into the large capital project and i think you most recently saw that with the esplanade where we came in and did dig out repairs and installed some other infrastructure before engineering came into the large capital project and of course we're going to deploy that model moving forward next year we've already completed our portion of it but next year is park avenue um pine and cypress and the mulberry arterials and engineering will come in with a pretty large project there so excited for mr audubonny to talk more about that so we'll continue that collaboration in that joint effort where engineering focuses on arterials and collectors and we focus on pre-repairs for them and then residential streets that are connected and outside of that area that we've designated for repair so with that if there's no further questions i'll hand it over to my colleague bernard lucky you you have airport operations under your many wings mark and i cut our teeth together on airport stuff by six years ago so um and this would be my last chance to really review airport with you on this side of the aisle we it was good to read that our million dollar grant is or so whatever it is 500 for operation subsidy has a four-year life and perhaps another year after that if i remember mike's letter recently correct it has a four-year starting from the spring um term and then there's the option for annual renewals after that and i you know given the state of airport operations we'll need all that time absolutely but i i would think would be helpful to have a four-year plan that each of our budget times we see things that we need to have fixed in order to implement that grant uh hopefully not a lot as uh i forget to name the our airport uh airlines to Shanghai is all we need is a stiff brush, you know, good paint job. I'm sure it's going to be more than that. So I think if we could take advantage of the fact that we have a little time on it and we're going to need that time, that we have an incremental way of getting there to it so we're not caught flat-footed on it. So I just wanted to make that appeal. Also, I understand that we're going to need to eventually move the composting facility because of it, among other things, its conflict with airport operations. Can you talk about whether or not that's a budgeted item in the next year, or is that further down the line? Absolutely. We're having continuing conversations and planning sessions with the county, our waste haulers, on moving the compost facility. Each year, the FAA, during our annual inspections, notes it, and each year the comments get a little more aggressive, a little more aggressive. So we know that we have to really confirm a long-term strategy to move the compost facility. So those talks are ongoing. And I do appreciate the focus on the airport, and can quickly comment if you don't mind that, yeah, the airline industry has significantly changed, and our airline contacts have told us everything's so much in the air. There's reports of some are doing between 15% and 30% of what's going on in the airport. I think that's what they normally do pre-COVID. So the industry is changing completely, and I think we're all aware of what United and American did earlier in the week and last week. With that said, I think we're in a unique position where we do have a SCASD grant. We're one of very few agencies, the only one in California that received that, it's half a million dollars, and then we have some fee waivers that contribute to that, along with budgeted money that we've put aside for a revenue guarantee fund in the previous year. So we're positioned to do that. We're positioned well for when the airline industry does come out of this in regional connections or regional airlines are looking at areas to go back into. We have a SCASD grant, and then we also have the business case, and we'll, of course, need to update those numbers post-COVID, but pre-COVID, we had a very strong business case. So we'll continue to keep our eyes and ears on the industry, continue the dialogue with our industry contacts, and do everything we can to make that happen when they pull out of this. And I... Question for the years now that I've been involved with the airport, why it's an enterprise fund where it seems like there's really little chance of us generating operating costs for the airport, but related to that, have we looked at a solar farm for that large acreage we do have out there as a way of helping the revenue side of the airport? We have, and that's part of the PG&E Sustainable Solutions turnkey, which is a program that we're working on right now. And we're working on a program that's going to help the airport. The challenge at the airport is the connection to the electrical grid. It would take pretty significant infrastructure improvements and expansions to connect to the grid out there for a large solar farm, but it's definitely not at the table, off the table, excuse me. Currently, the direction, the most cost-effective location for additional solar is the wastewater treatment plant. But the airport is definitely on the table, and they're still kind of vetting what makes the most sense and which is the most cost-effective. And some of those proposals, and we'll be bringing those to council in the near future. And the route through that is through the PG&E program? Correct. Thank you. At this point, yes. I just had a quick comment, Mr. Guftison. I believe that it's a lot of your staff that has fallen under the 12 years of not increases, and I just want to give a huge shout-out, because I know those guys and gals are out there all hours of the night, all hours of the day. And as we do continue to see minimum wage going up year after year after year, I'm very cognizant of the fact that this is something that's going to have to be addressed soon. So I just, I don't want those employees out there to feel like they're not being thought of. I'm sure there are in other departments, too. I'm just not as aware of them as I know there are quite a few in yours. So I just wanted to throw that out there. Yeah, I appreciate the comment, Council Member Reynolds. And, yeah, just to take a quick opportunity to thank the women and men of the Pub Works Operations and Maintenance Department. They are a fantastic group of individuals. They make me proud every day. They do amazing work, and they continue to do it, and they're tenacious, and they really, truly care. About the city of Chico. They're reliable all hours of the night, and they respond all hours of the night. And they're a great group of folks, and I couldn't be prouder to represent them. So I appreciate that, and I want to thank them publicly. I was going to mention something as well, because you have the most employees of any department, don't you? Nothing compared to the police department. Okay, okay. We're getting there. But getting up there, I was just wondering about your recruitment. And retention, and what challenges you might have with that. So that just complements. Sure. No, it's a challenge. And as you know, we're in a bit of a hiring freeze, and we're looking at those individually. And working through that. And I appreciate City Manager Orm's leadership on that. And we've had great conversations, and are really looking forward to when we could pull some of those back in. Again, there's a lot of unknowns and a lot of uncertainty. And we share the same vision of we don't want to hire someone. We want to hire somebody, and then turn around three or four months later and have to lay them off. So we're being very strategic, very surgical in that sense. And we'll continue to be that way. And then, you know, areas where we're extremely comfortable and confident, we'll make those decisions. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Director Ottoboni is up next. There we go. Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council. Thank you for hearing us out this evening regarding budget items. And these first couple slides, I'll kind of move through, obviously, a mission, vision, goals. It's always a critical component to managing a department. We use very limited general fund for the most part. We are enterprise funds, special revenue sources, grants. And so we... Actually do not have any positions fully funded through the general fund. Only partial components, and then most of that goes into capital improvements. I will talk specifically more about the roadway maintenance program here momentarily. Because of the fact that we are almost exclusively non-general fund, we did not have a proposal to do 2, 5, or 10% reduction. So I'm going to pause on this slide and take advantage of the opportunity to talk about the roadway maintenance program. I know that was one of the Council requests for further consideration discussion. So a little context. As you know, several years ago, the Council directed the waste franchise revenues into capital improvements for the roadway maintenance program. So the first project we utilized those funds for was the Cohasset Road reconstruction. And then the year after that was in... S. The first project we used was the Esplanade. Post-Camp Fire, some staffing limitations, we were unable to do a project that year. So we then combined two years of funding into one large project, and obviously just completed the Esplanade, and did a complete reconstruction, essentially for the entire stretch of that, about 3 miles. That project ended up being... It was about a 4.7 million dollar project, construction-wise. By the time we added in contingencies, inspection costs, and all that, design costs, it was about a 5.2 million dollar project. Again, that was two years of savings. One thing that's also come to fruition since the waste franchise revenues were directed towards roadway maintenance, was that Senate Bill 1, SB 1, came to fruition. Again, that's mostly geared towards capital improvements. So they have the accountability aspect of that. And we have to bring forward a resolution each spring to the City Council for adoption. But then we have to turn around and submit that once adopted to Caltrans, which goes to the CTC. They approve that, then we get the funding. Currently, we're, I think, at our top amount of about 2.1 million dollars per year in the SB 1 portion. Sounds like the waste franchise revenues might be up too, so that's always more stuff we can do. For context, in 2016, we did our first pavement management program, PMP. I'll use from here on out on that. It's a mouthful. Our first update was... In 2018, we had a PCI, Pavement Condition Index, of 61. In 2019, we did an update and our PCI was a 52. Currently, we're at a 59. So as we've... Or sorry, 49. As we've gone through and communicated that PMP, one of the components in that 2016 was, in order to improve our PCI by one point each year, the recommendation was 10 million dollars per year into roadway maintenance. Subsequently, in the 2019 update, with a lower PCI, we had a PCEI of 61. With that PCI, since we did not meet that goal, the roads continued to deteriorate and the costs go up. So that update resulted in a recommendation of 12 point 5 million dollars per year based on that PCI of a 52. Even with the three mile improvement on the Esplanade, our PCI implemented into the software, our PCI is still a 49. We have over 300 miles of roads and that's three miles and that's our entire two years of budget. So for context, we're not meeting that objective right now. Moving forward, in April, U.S. City Council adopted the accountability component of the SB1 for our 2021 project. So the intention for the 2021 project is to improve Park Avenue from 9th Avenue to East Park Avenue, as well as Mulberry from 12th to 20th Street, and then Pine and Cypress from 9th to 12th Streets. That would be a grind and repay, so we'll get a brand new asphalt surface. And then we're going to slurry seal due to the condition as a more cost-effective treatment on 12th to 19th Streets between Park Avenue and Mulberry. So we're getting a rectangular section there and hopefully addressing that. So we're in the design phase of that. As Director Gustafson mentioned, we work very closely with our maintenance folks to be able to do those more cost-effective treatments. So we utilize their skill set and their equipment to go out and crack seal, do dig-out repairs so that an effective treatment is a slurry seal. We don't have to bring in a contractor to grind out the entire roadway and repave it if we don't have to. If there's any questions on that, I can address those right now as well. All right. So just to kind of touch on the slide here, in engineering, again, we kind of handle everything in the city. And we're really more the program-level aspect, whereas the operations and maintenance side does a lot of the maintenance components. So everything from, again, our roadway maintenance program, our stormwater program, traffic signal program, all those types of things is really where we kind of, that's our niche. So I'll move to the last slide and hopefully wrap it up here. As the engineering department, it's not probably common knowledge, but we are the largest city budget, with probably one of the fewer, the lower budgets in terms of staffing costs. Because we do so many capital projects, again, a lot of that is invested in putting the projects out to bid and actual physical infrastructure improvements that we see. The project is going to be a lot of work. So quality of life improvements with upgraded, functional, safe infrastructure. But also economics and investing that money. Hiring contractors that have trades workers, whether that's laborers, electricians, carpenters, cement masons. They're doing all the work where that money is being expended. Sports local businesses. Buying the materials, renting the equipment, doing all the elements that are required to deliver that project. We've been extremely successful in the last several years on grants. So about $88.15 million on grants on infrastructure projects since 2015. For context, the prior seven year period, we only got about $21 million. So again, that's $88 million into the economy, but also the benefits of upgraded, improved infrastructure. One thing that we did several years ago was we initiated, the indirect cost allocation plan through Caltrans. We worked very closely and ultimately financed. Amanda Magar led that effort. And we worked very closely with her on the capital side. She is phenomenal and really helpful. And what that's enabled us to do now is on those grants, charge those state and federal agencies overhead. So on average, it's over $100,000 per year that is then going into the general fund through those indirect cost allocation reimbursements. Has it always been about that amount? It's been pretty consistent. I thought it was higher for some reason. Say that again? I thought it was higher for some reason. That's just the overhead component that goes into the general fund. Just from grants. Yeah, okay. We're talking about the same thing. Anyway, okay, thanks. So 2020, obviously we're wrapping up the construction season. We did about $17 million this year in construction between, I think it was four or five months ago, with the nitrate projects, the S-28 project, Bikeway 99 phase four, Comanche Creek phase two. A ton of work went into that. Again, our staff is just phenomenal. They're working at all hours of the day, weekends, getting the job done to make sure we're keeping the projects moving, getting it done the right way. I couldn't be prouder of our folks. With all that, we still, with all the success we've had on the project, we're still working on grants. Grants are typically not for maintenance types of projects. So even with that, between roads, bikeways, sewer, stormwater stuff, we're about $14 million per year unfunded. So that's obviously a big gap. Another issue that we're dealing with is recruitment. And so we compete as engineers not only with other agencies but with the private sector, and then also agencies like Caltrans, a state agency. And so we're working with the state agencies to get the projects going. And we've kind of looked at that, and we're I think around 15 to 20% below what those agencies offer. I've had a couple positions, actually one specifically that's been open, ongoing recruitment for about two years. So that really handicaps us in our ability to deliver these projects that we've been getting through these restricted sources. That concludes my report. If there's any questions, I'm available to answer. Thank you. I'll ask a couple. I just had a note of that. What you're seeing as unfunded needs is just about what we would have gotten with a one cent sales tax. So it is doable. It's well within the city's reach. So how are we spending all the franchise fees in the coming year? So sorry, that's a good question. I did not elaborate on that. We are going into the 2021 project. 2021 project is the second year of the franchise. We're going to be spending $1.5 million on the project that I mentioned along Park Avenue, Mulberry, Pine, Cypress. One thing from a programmatic level, when we have a limited number of limited funding for the projects, we're really focused on arterials and collectors, major roadways, so that we're getting a bigger bang for our buck. Those arterials and collectors carry higher volumes of traffic. So it's hard to justify spending maybe a lot of money or a lot of money on a project that's not going to be able to get a lot of money. So we're sitting in the door of Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's Rosalia's and then we as staff spend that on the design cost and then we also use that to put that out to bid and the construction cost plus our inspection we are heavy on consultant usage so we're spending about 2.1 million dollars per year on consultants i'm not getting to my question because i'm asking it wrong last year we deferred some before we moved some of that money i think 300 000 to public safety are we able to use all of it on roads this coming year that's probably beyond me yeah so so uh in the budget policies it says through the 21 22 fiscal year 350 000 dollars was transferred to the police department um and so that is that transfer does take place uh this this fiscal year and then again next fiscal year so um we can have the chief speak to that piece uh when he comes up here in a little bit if you want him to which is not no okay you sure but maybe the council needs to talk about taking one-time money which we're basically doing anyway and fully funding the franchise fees agreement of putting all that money into road maintenance you know maybe we would have to worry about where that money is going to come in 2022 but we have to worry about that anyway and it it seems we've gotten away from that that's you know we can follow up on that but i definitely want to follow up on that would you also talk about diff the uh bruce road grant amazing great job was it why do i want to say 30 billion 22 billion 22 billion yes yes would we have gotten that 22 million out of diff eventually was that part of the nexus study and the my my of development impact fees? The quick answer is no. And it's no because our DIF, our DIF fees for streets only goes from the back of curb to back of curb. So for the Bruce Road grant, we actually expanded that and we included a 12 foot wide concrete bike path on the west side of Bruce Road running parallel to that, as well as an interior roadway to the Merion Park subdivision on the north side of Little Chico Creek that will connect Bruce Road and Notre Dame where the affordable housing project is anticipated. So it goes beyond what just the DIF would have paid for. Would there have been some DIF funds? Yes. And there's about $4 million. It's $22 million grant with, again, design, environmental costs, inspection costs, all those components. It's going to be about a $27 million project. So we have about $4 million of local funding. between DIF and our Fund 212, the Transportation Development Act funds. So that's supplementing that $22 million. Where I'm coming from this is that if we do have some kind of inclusionary zoning policy, some way of encouraging developers to serve a different market than they currently are, and we had grant funds, state grant funds that would have freed up DIF funds, it could be a good policy to see if we could, capture some of that funds as a fund towards encouraging more affordability in housing projects. Yeah, my statement or my response to that would, the DIF is a very specific project list, so it can be used for project specific. So in terms of funding, that would obviously be a policy decision that would have its own separate process for inclusion. I would be curious, as few million as it might be, whether or not the Bruce Road grant or similar grants has freed up some room in the development impact fee structure. And so we're looking at then accelerating other projects like the Notre Dame Bridge over Little Chico Creek. We've got the Cohasset Road widening project out to the airport, which will also improve some turn lanes that access the airport. I know you just talked about that, Director Gustafson. So we're waiting to hear back, hopefully in the next month or so on that. It's a $13.3 million, $13.3 million grant. Also Eaton Road 99 off-ramp roundabout is planned to go to construction next year as well. So a lot of those DIF type of projects, it's freed up money that then we can do more with it. But the pool of DIF funds is set. It's based on all those developments and incremental funding from developments, right? So if suddenly we did have, maybe not this example, but 30 million freed up that we were planning on with DIF, it does get to the point where we're like, well, we're going to have to give it to some discretion to the council. There's some legal implications on that and how those funds get utilized. Again, the nexus of the collection of those fees is for very specific roadway projects. Right. And if they're funded by somebody else, I understand the argument. And I guess it's a question when we get to housing policy of whether or not DIF funds are legally available for the public. That kind of use. I'll ask that question when we get there. All right. Thank you very much. Madam Mayor, could I just interrupt for a second? We still have, I'm sorry, but not for you. We still have police and fire to go? We do. We have a rather large item coming up that we can't start talking about after 10. And I wonder if the direction of the council might be to decide now to push that item since it may have to be moved. I don't think that's going to happen anyway if we go past 10 o'clock. And discussing what is likely to be a controversial and lengthy discussion at 10 o'clock is probably not advised anyway. Right. And the other items after that. And the closed session. Well, the 5.3, the 5.4, the 5.5. We won't get to those either. I'm not trying to push it. We're going to have the discussion. We've been having the discussion. Yeah, I think that we were rather optimistic in our agenda management. Well, that's fine. The budget conversation, I mean, we used to put a whole day aside for this. And I'm super excited that we're not having the discussion that we all feared that we'd be having. Yes. So this is, but at the same time, I don't want it to be 10.15 after we've taken another break. And send all the solution providers and the people outside and all those people home. And then people are going to come in and be like, this was this and this was that. And you don't care. Which they may do anyway. Remember, what's your proposal? We got to push that item. I'm just asking to say, take. I think we've got several items to push. Yes. I would say if we're going to do something, we say we end after the budget discussion. I would agree. I would agree with that. Of course, we will do things like, the reports and communications. And closed session. And closed session. Yeah. Yes. So do you want to make? I just don't, I don't think we're going to get to it anyway. And it's better that we're honest with who's here. Right. So that would be my motion to move this to the, and I know now we're moving into the next meeting in October and the first one in November that we want to be short and whatever, but we're not going to get there. And I think it's best to be honest with the public. So that would be my motion. And I'm fine with the mayor and the city manager working on the agenda to figure out. How best to get through it in the future. And your motion is to end after the budget discussion? Yes, ma'am. Second. Did not take anything in. Yeah. Second. Yes, correct. Okay. Was there consideration for an additional meeting? As long as it's not next Tuesday, as that will be my 25th wedding anniversary. And my wife was shocked that she made it that far. Yeah. That would be my last wedding anniversary. My tenure was last year. I decided not to be there. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not. Yeah. I'd like to see us clear some of this backlog, but I'm open to which days. Well, we will explore that possibility. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Okay. We're going to take a vote. We got to vote first. Yes, and just . Okay. So we're reconnecting with Council Member Huber. He's lost connection. Oh. Council Member Huber. Yes. Council Member Rosary. Aye. Council Member Rosary. Aye. Council Member Rosary. Aye. Council Member Rosary. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. So for those folks waiting outside, there won't be any discussion of the homeless quality of life proposals tonight, right? Right. So my staff is listening, and they will inform everyone. We do have speakers on this item, 5.1, but the remaining items, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5. 5.5, the speakers that have signed up to speak will now know that they will not be continued. And then item 5.6 was already removed. And that we are amazingly sorry and appreciate that they were here. Yes. They can hear you say that, so thank you. The alternative was doing exactly what we're doing now an hour from now. Yes. Yes. Well, good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayors, Council Members. I will try to make this as brief as possible to get you to the next phase of this meeting. I do want to take just a minute, like everybody else, it's hard not to express my amazement, my gratitude, and appreciation for the men and women of Chico Fire. The last... Since I've been here, starting in 2018, and certainly before that, this has been probably one of the hardest working, most resilient group of people I've ever met. The things that they've endured the last couple years alone are unprecedented, quite frankly. And so they live up to this mission. It's not just a quirky little mission statement. It really exemplifies the efforts. These men and women put forward each and every day to protect our community, to give the highest quality effort they can to protect lives. And they do so in a very caring, compassionate, and unprecedented professional manner. So I'm eminently proud of the people that work for this fire department, and hopefully you do too. And it will come into play when I talk about some of our challenges. And I'm going to go a little off script because, obviously, tonight we're... We're trying to get to the meat of everything. One of our challenges clearly has been staffing. And it's been a longstanding issue. Obviously, this body knows that very well. And fortunately, City Manager Orm has been really instrumental in helping get us continually, incrementally towards a level of sustainability. And while it's not obviously where we'd like to see it, as I would like to see it as a chief, we're certainly making inroads. And I want to say... I'm very appreciative of the council for approving a reorganization that was part of that sustainability that was absolutely necessary. And what it got us was two additional FTE allocations. And one of those positions was a battalion chief. The other one was a training officer that was not funded this year. But hopefully, if things continue to improve, we look forward to implementing that in future years or next year even. What it has done for us, some of these incremental improvements in our budget has allowed us to maintain 16 firefighters a day for the first time without safer grant funding prior to the cuts. We are at 16 a day. Now, I will say it is not without some sacrifice in so much as we have not filled a fire prevention officer. And we've made do. And fortunately, I have a really great colleague in Tony. That is really helpful. He helped out on the technical side of that. But it really does create a pinch when we're growing as a community, not just in terms of the new growth, but the growth of another 20,000 or so people in the community and the pressures that puts on code enforcement. So we look to rectify that in future years while not diminishing response. And that's my number one priority is making sure that the men and women who respond on low frequency, high risk events. Have the proper, at least the minimum staffing we need to manage that. So 16 a day. And then we add in the battalion chief. And we have at least something that looks somewhat normal for the city of our size. This is more for the public because I'm not sure they realize the extent of some of the things we do. Obviously, emergency response. We are also responsible for emergency management. And I should say it's not so much pre-incident planning as it is pre-disaster planning. And I will say that is another challenge I'll speak to a little bit. Code enforcement and public education will bypass the two and five, thank God, and 10%. And I'm just going to go through. These will be initiatives that we've either completed this last year and or have initiated or will initiate into this fiscal year. And they're critical initiatives for a variety of reasons. For one. Like I said, we maintain 16 a day. And that's an achievement that I'm really proud of. It allowed us to put a fifth piece of apparatus into service. And so it gave us a little bit of breathing room in terms of response. We are. And only because of the fires, we haven't been able to finalize it. We are on the last legs of a cat to cat interface with Butte fire and Chico fire. And that is a substantial improvement. It gives us automatic dispatching without phone calls going between the two dispatch centers. Better data collection. It's just a much more smooth process. Code enforcement. And I've got to give Marie Picker. If you know Marie, she's been around for a very long time. And she did a remarkable job knocking out 100% of the inspections of our mandated facilities. That includes our R2's apartments and educational facilities. That is no small accomplishment on her part. So we achieved that. And we are required now because of state law to report on those mandated inspections every year. How we achieved those in large part came out of the ghost fire. Another huge achievement, which has actually been incredibly important for us, is we collaborated with Beauty MS. And we leveraged their EMD, their emergency medical priority dispatching protocols and system. To reduce our responses to low acuity calls. Those calls that are low in nature. They're not going to result in death unless, you know, something really bad happens. But it's typically something like a bloody nose, broken arm. Something that wouldn't necessitate even a code three response by their protocols on Beauty MS side. And so that's given some capacity for us to do additional training that we couldn't do before. We were very. Very. very incapable of doing multi-company trainings without it being interrupted. We now have the capacity to do that on a more frequent basis, and that's important for what we call a team sport in firefighting. And that leads into the training center upgrades. So we've included now a virtual command training lab down at the FTC. We've added additional training aspects to the tower itself with some connex boxes in there. And I'm happy to say we are on the verge of having the first ever real-life burn building in our training center, which is absolutely huge for us because the only place we can do it now is going up to Butte College. Now we'll be able to do it at the FTC and bring all the units together and operate as if we're a team. And again, I stress it's for these low-frequency, high-risk events like structural damage. And that's where firefighters get themselves killed. We've implemented a number of increased efficiency programs or processes. We have now a pre-fire planning program for those commercial facilities in our jurisdiction. Along with that was Community Connect, which allows our residents to sign up and give information that might be critical for us as we're responding to those incidents at those residents. We've also implemented a new program called the False Fire Alarm Monitoring Program, which went into effect in August. Hopefully we'll start to see a curve down on some of the false fire alarms as people start to be incentivized to fix their systems and maintain them. And then an inspection compliance program as well that will help us capture some of the systems we don't even know exist out there and get us on a track to help manage the frequency at which they maintain those on an annual basis. Thank you. This leads into some of the goals that we're then looking for this year. We reorganized as of July 1st. So now for the first time in 25 years, we have battalion chiefs. And I have never heard a sweeter sound than battalion one, can you call dispatch? So it was a huge accomplishment. And we have three really great battalion chiefs in place. And I will say being a battalion chief, running an incident is a perishable skill. So having people in those roles doing it day in and day out is a huge accomplishment as well. We are now in the process of initiating a CAD to CAD interface between Chico Fire and Beauty MS. And again, the importance of that can't be underplayed because now we have access to sharing data, sharing those resources automated, and we don't have to rely on phone calls. And we can reduce our response times as well and then tweak our response protocols. To fit this program as well. As you already know, we've evaluated adding advanced life support capability into our service model. It's been a goal of mine because I think it's essential for the fire department to have some level of ALS. Because we can't always rely on our Beauty MS partners for some high critical incidents where we wouldn't be able to put them, for example, over the edge to attend. And to a patient in the park. So having some capability in our own agency would be very useful and essential. And you've read the report. I have been purposeful not to come back with a full presentation on it for several reasons, not least of which is COVID sort of screwed everything up. And then also with the timing of the budget and some of the recommendations in there, the timing of that wasn't optimal. I will say I will leave it up to the council. If you desire a presentation on the ALS study, some of the recommendations and some of the pathways we have to achieve that, I'm happy to come back and make a formal presentation to you at your request. And I'm happy to do so and would love to do so. I would appreciate it. Thank you. This leads into various collaborative partnerships. Again, we're seeing the bearing the fruits of that with Beauty MS. We have a very strong relationship with them. And we hope that the CAD2CAD may lead to other collaborative partnerships. Or opportunities with them. We'll continue to evaluate different cost recovery options. We always look at, for example, our deployments. We'll go after a higher administrative fee as well. It takes some effort because there's a complex formula with that. It also ties to the ALS. There are some first responder fee opportunities that we can pursue. And again, it's a controversial subject. I understand that. But it's worth the discussion. And at least it helps us understand what it is we want to pay for within the city. And then are there other ways to achieve that. Expand our public outreach and education. I think that's one of our deficiencies right now. Quite frankly, we just don't have the capability to do all of that. And then we're looking at replacing an agent. So I'll talk a little bit really quickly about our challenges. Staffing I spoke about. But it's not just the number of people responding to calls. Last year was an incredible year. We had a really challenging year for us. We averaged one person off a day on workers' comp. That's pretty remarkable. That means we had three full-time FTEs not available for an entire year, dropping our staffing level down. Code enforcement, I talked about not having an FPO. That has some implications as well. And then our turnover at the command staff. And we've taken that first step to try to make it a less problematic issue for us as well. Station coverage. And I'll highlight this. With the closure of station 42, Cal Fire 42, we have a huge what I call a donut hole. An area of our city that is largely unprotected right now by a close-in unit. And so my proposal has been to put a station at the Hicks and Eaton interchange. And we've started to evaluate that. We've run the response times, the flame maps, if you will, for that. And it is a very good idea. And it's a very optimal location that gives us very good coverage. So that would be a high priority to pursue if the funding were ever to materialize. You're referencing your notes of station 6? Correct. Correct. Thank you. Was it the airport station? That's 3. 3. 3. As long as we're at it, we're not going to go out there? No, not at all. How would we handle station 3 going forward if we have to? We would have to figure out a way to incorporate that into the fees that are coming, landing fees, takeoff fees, a fee that's added on to that. It's a costly proposition. And I've provided, well, when Linda was our, I'm sorry, Sherry, when she was here, provided her several options. But it's not an inexpensive endeavor. And the problem is, Councilmember. Okay. No worries. Yep. Yep. 6 would be a standalone station for day-to-day response. Infrastructure tied to that as well, as Eric had talked about, station 1 has been very challenging, to say the least. And we have station 3, which was built in 1963 as well. And that is a very small station with a lot of issues, so to speak. And it's a really, it's a station in doubt. And we have a dire need of either being completely replaced or a significant remodel that would really just completely change the orientation or look at that station. Apparatus, we continue to push those back. And even though we're getting a new apparatus now, we're actually down to only two reserve units as of today that are available. And we use those quite frequently. When we have units that are, that we have a large fire that we're calling people by name. We're trying to pull back to cover the stations. And we only have two right now. And our ladder, our reserve ladder truck is truly on its last legs. And we're coming up on the 10 years of our SCBAs. And so we're going to be looking for a grant through FEMA. But that is one that is a high priority, obviously, for us to replace as well. And as I spoke about the other challenges, proactive emergency management. Being able to create comprehensive plans for the city. Yeah. with disasters mitigation work and so forth as well as revamping our EOP which has been nine years since it was last when it was created and then associated training and building that that aspect and then a comprehensive operational plan for continuity of operations for the city itself building out a plan so all those elements exist under emergency management we only just barely scratch it so that's my end of my report if you have any questions about the town thank you chief Madden's next good evening mayor vice mayor council it is my distinct honor to be standing up here representing your police department let me get through slides here so I know it's late so I'm going to try to just kind of zip through this clearly the police department is a general fund department and out of that majority of our budget goes to personnel costs personnel right now is 160.91 for 24-7 operations that also is responsible for the public safety communication center the obviously we have the police department and we also have the management of our Chico animal shelter but I will say that our animal shelter manager does a fabulous job and certainly makes my job much more easier in that area so I think we all know what the essential services are for our police department is and as we talk about some of the highlights of the last few weeks of the last door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door organizations in our area. I think you've all recognized our involvement in the Camp Fire, the Carr Fire, the Oroville Dance Billway, and now this devastating fire, Bear Fire. So very been taxing, been a very difficult time, but they continue to show strong leadership and get us through. I'm not going to go through the reductions, but I will note when you talk about the police department and our budget being primarily personnel-based, when you get into reductions, you go right into personnel. So some of our concerns, obviously, are the frozen positions, but I will tell you that I appreciate City Manager Orm and having those discussions with me and helping me lead the organization when we didn't know what tonight was going to look like, right, and not being up here telling, you know, laying people up. So I do appreciate that. It's been a little impactful, but we'll get through it. What's interesting about these slides right here is we typically meet with City Manager around February to start discussing our budget. So these are all things that we requested back in February before pandemic and before some of the other issues that have come up, social justice issues. So we had already recognized that and we're going to come to you and ask for an additional $80,000 in our training budget, $40,000 in our overtime. $18,000 in new hire background investigation costs. And then we were also asking for additional evidence clerk. That position really was just multiple hourly employee positions, but the level of training and security that they have to go to work in evidence, I think we'd be better served with actually having an FTE there. So again, talking about some of the concerns, hiring and retention is always an issue for ad hoc members in here. You've had, you've had lengthy discussions on what it takes to hire and actually get somebody through police training and get, get them out on the field working. Same with dispatch. So we have had some turnover that we're dealing with on retention issues. And we continue to, you know, deal with the hiring concerns that we have at the police department. So with that, I'll answer any questions if you have them. Chief, I have a quick one. Is dispatch still working mandatory overtime or mandatory, whatever you call it? They are. We had three dispatchers recently leave our organization for other organizations. And so we do have, we have several frozen positions and we have, we've just hired three that just started their training. So we're, we're a little bit behind on staffing. Okay. And traffic is still at one sergeant or is there another one back there? One. That's the whole unit. Okay. There's one, one sergeant and one officer. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Just a couple of things, and I'm not sure if this is the appropriate time to address them. There's a couple of items on our kind of council member requests for budget consideration that have, that are related to the Chico Police Department. One of those is looking at enhancing our response to domestic violence. And that collaboration. So I was wondering if you could speak to that. And then the other piece was the conversation about additional crisis intervention and de-escalation training for all officers. So I was curious if you could speak to that as well. Yeah. Yeah. So I do remember the issue coming up as far as concerns, as far as referral to victim advocacy groups. In the 23 years I've been with Chico, I've built those relationships. That's been a good part of my career as a criminal detective for body crimes. And so I had those relationships. One of the things that I did as I assumed the interim role was I reached out to the executive director based on the comments from council here of Catalyst, somebody I've known for a really long time. And what we do recognize is some of the referral issues that we had, because one of the things is you have to, you have to receive consent and permission from a victim of domestic violence to give Catalyst access to their information, the report. Certainly, I want to promote that, because the more you can get advocacy groups to support victims of violent crime, one, you're going to reduce crime. Two, you're also going to provide support to the victim. So that was something that I looked at. So what we've done to enhance referral system is a couple things. One, we did some roll call training with the officers to make sure that they know how important it is to spend a little time with the victim and promote that consent. And make sure that they know what Catalyst is. can offer them as far as services we've met with catalyst personally on several different levels starting with the chief and executive director and working down to more of the working staff we do recognize that catalyst currently has an advocate assigned to this area specifically to chico pd and so with that training that we're doing on top of the ability right now with this remodel we're also looking at potentially creating some workspace for that advocate directly inside the police department and if they become more of an agent of the police department they will have more access to that referral system one of the things that domestic violence advocates will tell you it's really the sooner the better that they get that information you know before we go back and and we have these problems again so so there's kind of a there's a 10-day window in there that catalyst really talks about so we're going to really thrive to improve that in addition to that i've assigned a detective to be our you direct liaison with catalyst and currently there is a a lieutenant that's moving over to that detective lieutenant position who spent a long time in his career lieutenant brian miller was actually a detective assigned to domestic violence cases so he has those relationships to continue to promote those so we're doing everything we can i recognize the that somewhere along the way uh some of those relationships appear to be strained i guess but i can tell you as your chief of police uh victim advocacy is incredibly important to me and we'll work closely with catalyst so those are some of the things we've done since uh since our first conversation thank you chief i'm very satisfied with that answer i appreciate it got it training and then the training question training got it okay so not knowing you know one of the things that that came up is we actually talked a lot about training in this ad hoc committee i really kind of talked a lot about training in this ad hoc committee and i started off with these fours talked a lot about training uh really got a lot of information as to what that looks like um and so really the direction that i've got is come up with some kind of let us know what it's going to cost for this 40-hour cit plan right now it's not a mandatory course only for field training officers we've talked about in ad hoc committee in your ad hoc reports you're going to see a lot of information from post we actually had the post uh regional coordinator um on the meeting he was very educational both stands for peace officers standing and training commission on post peace officers standing training they are the uh the um they govern uh and really oversee police training in the state of california anyways the uh so this 40 hour is not a requirement but is desirable um you know coming from council and that was the direction that this tends to be going so with cit training there is post reimbursement for certain trainings and there's different plans right now a majority of that 40-hour cit training is under what they call a plan four plan four would allow for tuition lodging per diem to train but it does not supply backfill so when we send somebody out to that type of training typically we have to backfill that position while they're gone on overtime so you're really getting down to overtime i've been doing this for a long time and i will though caution council uh from my 28 years of doing this is every time the state gets in budget crisis they pull post reimbursement it's almost one of the first things they do so just just cautious with that right now we're good and then who do you send because really it needs to be from the top all the way down or anybody that's out in the public and communicating including your dispatchers that are taking these calls so i broke it down for you strictly on the overtime because if we know generally speaking we're going to have to do a lot of work to get this done but i'm going to be speaking post is going to cover that that for you uh you're lodging per diem and training tuition now you're talking about overtime so if you take and i broke it all down into groups but let me get to the point if you train your chief of police all the way down to your youngest officer your dispatchers your sergeants and your community service officers that are out there tied to patrol teams that are out there and do a lot of the custodial stuff so overtime costs for all the employees to get everybody to to cover that overtime is 286 585 dollars so that's the overtime and i can break it down into the different ranks so if you just wanted to talk about um you know and that also includes our sworn parker injury as well so uh that's where it boils down to the lodging is typically covered but it's 132 300 per diem is 46 200 tuition is 3500 so the training actually is the cheapest of the whole thing the tuition for it chief yes do those numbers exclude the um chico police department staff who have already received that 40 hour it does not this was just a this was just an overview for generally what that's going to cost uh the people that have 40 hour or some of our training a few three training cadre and a number of field training officers okay thank you so 200 286 585 dollars so that's a overtime cost it would take now we've also talked about what are some different options and one of the options that we talked about could chico pd potentially create their own 40-hour post-approved class and hosted ourselves we could and we can you know if we get that direction we can look in that we might even be able to look a little more on a regional level get with some of our partners out there our colleagues from the different in northern california law enforcement agencies see what what what training cadre they have and maybe come together and put together a training and we'll be we can do it regional the bottom line is you're always the issue with this type of training it's the overtime that you got to cover the streets and so even if we do that we're still going to have a cost associated but again you know if we're not sending them all the way down right now the only cit trainings that are up online on post uh of course kovitz got them all shut down is the bay area and southern california so so it may be time to look at we talk to post and we ask those questions is you know does chico pd have the ability to do that we do the cost associated would really just be top staff time getting them one post certified to be instructors and two creating the curriculum that staff time it would take to create the curriculum that would ultimately be uh approved by a commission on post when you when you um shared that with me that that might be great to hear but yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah $300,000? For the trading, it's something south of $300,000? The overtime. Yeah, the overtime. And the training costs are negligible. It's the overtime costs, yes, sir. Okay. All right. Thanks. I wanted to follow up with a conversation I had with City Manager Orem about the hiring freeze and how long we know that it takes to get a police officer through the academy, through field training, and being able to be operational. So I asked City Manager Orem what the plan was. Yeah, so Chief Madden and I have been talking about that, trying to find out, and I think that's why you referenced it as a slushie, because I'm trying to be reasonable with the freeze. And there are times when it has to move around. Obviously, a couple of those positions that we froze, we've already unfroze, so the chief's position being one of them. And then also you've got a couple of folks that are out doing enforcement for meters in downtown, so those are part-time positions. We did those as well. On the police front, one of the things that I'm very hesitant to do is to hire full-time positions, acknowledging that if we do in fact see this dramatic decrease in funding, we have to lay somebody off. It's the last thing I want to do. So, one of the things that we've talked about, which I think is a prudent approach, because we're not getting the lateral transfers coming over, no departments really are, seemingly, every once in a while we'll luck out and get somebody, but to get some hourlies into the academies. And that way it's not a full-time position, but it's hourly. So that's where the slushie comes in, because it's not hiring the position. If in fact the numbers come in, which I don't think they will, and I hope they don't, below, and we would have to go through reductions, we will keep that person in the academy and then be able to hire them once they're out. But at least that could potentially get them in in January is what we're shooting for, I believe. Yeah, you know, the problem is a lot of other agencies are the same way. So, we may have to get creative with the academy and other potential academies in our area to get that done. But I do agree with the city manager that, you know, if you go down the hourly rate positions right now and you come back in January and your numbers have drastically reduced, you're not laying anybody off. In fact, you provided somebody the potential to finish that academy. And either us picking them up or them having the ability to potentially get a job somewhere else that might be beneficial with them coming back. So, that's definitely an option that the city manager and I have been talking about. Just out of curiosity, from an operational perspective, do you do all of the background checking prior to sending to... So, that's the other issue, right? The things ad hoc we're talking about, backgrounds and psychological exams. I can't even... I can't even give them a conditional job offer. I wouldn't give anybody a conditional job offer until we have fully vetted somebody out. So, yeah. So, that takes anywhere from an average four to five months from the time they turn in their application to the time that we're even in a position to give them a conditional job offer. And that's pre-academy? That's pre-academy. Okay. Yes. I have a quick question for you. Yeah. So, if you, for instance, know you have two people that have turned in their... Retirement papers or whatever coming in November, December, January, are those positions, if you know that they're going to be coming open, we can list and hire for those, correct? We can, but one of the things we're not seeing, we actually... I'll take that back. We did get one incredible lateral that we just formally gave them a job offer, so we're really excited about this lateral. It came highly recommended to us. But, see, that's the problem because... Most of the positions we're using are that police academy training. So, as soon as someone tells me I'm retiring in three months, it'll be five months before I identify somebody. It'll be six months after that, depending on when the academy starts and when it graduates, and it'll be almost six months after that before they're out on the street. So, that's the whole juggling match with your police department is you're almost a year from knowing someone's leaving, whether retirement or they're just going to a different organization, to actually... Getting the position filled and having somebody filling a staff position. So, that's just the challenge of it. That $80,000 additional in training budget, can you speak a little bit to how that funding will be... Yeah, how that really came up was what we really realized is... So, in addition to commission on post-training, we have patrol schedules, which is... And sworn schedules. Allow us to train on duty. And so, if you work... So, you have two schedules on patrol. You have the teams that work Monday through Thursdays, and then you have the weekend teams. And each month, those two different teams cover their training. So, the 12-and-a-half-hour teams every month are actually come up in a 28-day cycle. They come up 10 hours short. Well, that's... They build an extra workday for them to cover that other team so they can train. And then the next month, they train for 10 hours. So, you have a 10-hour training built into their schedule. One thing that we've seen with commission on post is how much mandatory training, and I call it maintenance training, has been piled on us. And so, what it's done is it's tied up all this training time to do more specialized type of training. And it's everything from CPR, driving, perishable skills. I mean, it just goes on. And I think that's what's going on. And so, one of the things we're not being able to do is get that specialized training that we need for detectives in child abuse investigations and sexual assault. You know, technology is changing how we do business, right? Every crime is associated with a cell phone, right? And having the ability to obtain evidence in those things is very, very expensive. Technology is really expensive. So, that's what we identified even before we started talking about 40-hour CIT. We were already talking about it. We were talking about, you know, we need to have this training because we're just not getting the people. And we're young. And so, with more movement and people moving around, every time you get an officer promote to sergeant, there's a two-week mandatory supervisor school right there, right off the bat for post that they have to complete in their first year. Same with the lieutenants and captains. And so, with all the movement that we've experienced, that specialized training and some of that mandatory training just wasn't being covered. And so, that's... That's where that came from. Thank you. Yeah. Great. Good questions. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Bring to counsel's attention that it's after 10. Our guidelines say that we need concurrence to continue to 1030. We'll change the guidelines. I was just reading them here. Let's see. With concurrence of counsel, the meetings may be expended. 1030 in order to complete the item being discussed. We just can't add stuff. You can't add stuff. I'm certainly for finishing what we started. Yes. Okay. Okay. So, questions from counsel before we open the public hearing? Public comment. Okay. How many public comments did we receive via engaged chief? Okay. We received five comments in engaged. I did not receive any comment from the public comments. Okay. And how many speakers do we have? We have five speakers that are in person. Okay. So, each speaker can speak for three minutes. If you could read the names of the people that communicated with us through the... Okay. So, from engaged Chico platform, we will read those comments and get everybody queued up. Okay. So, from engaged Chico, we received comments from Andy Wilhoyt, Casey Croninger, Jackie Smith, Linda Wolf, and Kim Dietz. And then to queue up outside would be Jay Fumazi, Jeff Creed, Rob Berry, Brock Winborn, and Jenea Beatty. Okay. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. Go ahead and put your name out to the door to see who's sitting outside. I'm apologetic. I'm so sorry. Followed by Jeff Creed and Rob Berry. Good evening. I think I'm owed an apology by the council. I had to take my time off work tonight to be here for all the agenda on the list. And this seems to become an occurrence. People waiting out there for hours and hours to speak on agenda items and then we're told, ah, it's going to get moved to the next one. My time is just as valuable as yours. Yours, yours, yours. And I feel like I'm being treated disrespectful. First thing I'd like to say is, I'm talking about the budget. Maybe if we wouldn't have put homeless people inside the parks, I think it was such a good idea. Now we're spending more money cleaning up bathrooms, repairing busted items. Thank you, the new Brown deal. I just don't get it. I don't get it. We're spending more money than we need to. The parks are busted, everything. Across the park here, we're fumigating for the first time in how long? Why? Because people are leaving garbage over there, destroying it, treating it disrespectfully. And now we're talking about building a $2 million complex for them? Is that all right, Brown? You started this cataclysm. The collision. Causing us more money in this deal. Putting those people in the park. Last time I looked... Mr. Fimasi, please don't want to take personal attacks on council members. I'm not taking personal attacks. So, thank you, Mayor. But I don't get an apology for being stuck outside, not here to speak on the agenda items that I come to speak to. Right? Thank you. Thank you. I listened to the police budget. And I hear there's... New stuff that's being added in there. More training above and beyond what the state mandates. It sounds like to me, you're going to spend more money taking officers off the streets for training that's already covered by the state. I don't know why you consider that a good idea. We're down officers. The overtime insurers off the chain. Making officers work longer shifts. Not taking into consideration the higher replacements to help them. You cause burnout. You cause depression. Do you even think about that? I didn't see that addressed in your ad hoc committee. But what you could do to help alleviate the stress for officers. So, instead of adding more training, how about you think about helping the officers have better working conditions? Yeah, thank you for your time. And your lack of apology.

So, yeah, I missed my counter. Sorry. Thank you. So, it's kind of hard. There we go. I don't know why. I'll pause, give you your three seconds back. No, it's going. So, the budget, you know, we're talking about all these details, and, you know, I heard former Mayor Stone say that $300,000 is a trivial amount or insignificant amount, but correct me if I'm wrong, that's another entire police officer off the street at Chico every year just to conduct that training, which is already covered by other training. So, you know, it's not insignificant. And when you look at this budget, you know, my big issue with the budget is when some of you came on this council back when there was this financial crisis, you had a budget for a five-bedroom, McMansion, and because that's what Chico is, right? Chico's a five-bedroom McMansion. And so you took that budget and you crunched it down to somebody living in a one-bedroom apartment in the shittiest apartment in Chico, and you said, hey, look, we're saving this amount of money every month or every year. You're going, look, we saved, we banked $19 million or whatever. We're in the black. We're in the black. But you're not in the black. You're not paying the basic maintenance. You're not paying the basic maintenance for your McMansion. You're not providing the basic security for your mansion. You're not, you know, your budget has shortfalls in every department. And in the parks is a perfect example. When I came to Chico, I was riding my bike down. In one mile, I was going the wrong way. I didn't even know there was a wrong way. I just moved to Chico a few months prior. I had a ranger stop me, threatened to ticket me, because I was going to Chico. I didn't even know it was a one-lane street. I came in off a side trail. So I turned around and I rode way up and around to get to where I was going, right? Go down the streets in Bidwell Park and tell me when was the last time anybody ever patrolled there. Because I went down the street this morning, and I had all these locals giving me a hard time, giving me dirty looks because I was driving in my car down a one-way street. But I had bicycles. I had bicycles coming at me head-on. I had dogs off-leash after 9. You know, it was after 11, actually. And it's just a joke. You know, if you're at home, you need to understand that the Chico budget has never been in the black. They're just not paying their bills. And there's no solution to this. The way this is going, they are running you, this town, into the ground, and nobody's even talking about a real solution. Nobody's talking about taking you to the ground. Nobody's taking care of what they have. They're just talking about doing the best they can with their meager budget. Well, guess what? At some point, the landlord's going to evict you, right? Because you're not taking care of the property. Think about that. November 3rd. Eviction. Rob Berry, followed by Brock Winborn. I suspect we're all pretty tired by now. And so uncharacteristic for me, I'm going to be brief. So we've all been led to believe that with the campfire and the COVID mess, that we are headed into fiscal disaster. But tonight we hear that we're kind of flush. And at the same time, one of the items that we didn't get to tonight, plus a number of things that were highlighted in the staff report, which I'm not going to mention tonight, we've got this plan to spend two and a half million bucks to build something new, to supposedly indirectly benefit the citizens of Chico by providing something new. And that's something over here that is going to indirectly have some positive impact on our quality of life over there. And it just seems curious to me that that amount of money is almost exactly the amount of money that the city is saving by freezing the police department positions, 11 positions. And as we heard tonight, I was kind of gratified to hear tonight Mr. Orme and the chief talking about some of the conversations that they're having about these positions. But, you know, when you freeze those positions, what we heard tonight and what I was coming to talk about is, these are, you can delay things for six months or eight months, even if you reinstituted the hiring today because of windows for academy and the amount of training and recruitment and all those things that are necessary. So this is my point. Stop trying to do things indirectly. What we need is we need a fully funded, fully staffed police force that has the latitude to deal with attrition, to deal with people leaving the department and recruiting new people to keep the police force to the proper level. That should be the number one priority for this council. And why you think that social services or anything else should trump that priority is just beyond me. Effectively, what you're doing is you're indirectly defunding the police by talking about spending money on other things, while at the same time you're freezing that amount of hiring in the police force. So you've made it very clear what your priorities are. And it's not safety. It's not policing. It's not environmental quality. It's growing the homeless industry. That's your priority. So everybody understands that now. It's reflected in your budget. It's reflected in your agenda. And thank you for being so transparent about it. So Brock Winborn followed by Jenea Beatty. You guys ready? Get my email today? You guys see what happened today? See what happened to me today? All right. Well, good evening. You're going to hear the story. Today. I went on a bike ride with my. Family through the park and noticed multiple encampments. One place in particular really bothered me. It is a newer encampment under the beautiful redwood trees just east of the 99 bridge. This area used to be really nice and really fun to take my daughter to look at all the big trees. It is now trashed and there is a huge encampment inside the Grove. As we continue our ride, we saw multiple other encampments in the park right next to any Glen bridge. There was a huge one. I've never seen it this bad. Just by emailing all of you multiple times. Speaking to all of you at the city council meeting, calling the police department multiple times. I'm feeling frustrated and helpless. I called the Chico non-emergent line to report all the encampments today. I decided to go down there and take pictures of the encampments in order to show you all what you have allowed to happen. What you are failing to enforce and the impact it is having on our beautiful park. I had no idea how to truly unsafe this park is until now and what I had to encounter today. I rode my bike. I rode my bike back down there alone this time. I began taking pictures and was immediately harassed and assaulted by the people who were living in this Redwood Grove encampment. I politely and respectfully told these people that camping was illegal in the park and that this was a public area. I was taking these photos to show the council members and the leaders of this city that these encampments are destroying our park. These people became very upset with me and one of them pushed me. Another one began flashing gang signs at me, spit on me and then swung at me. I retreated and then was pepper sprayed by a female who was in the group. I called the emergency police line. I quickly realized that I was in a very unsafe situation and was now fearing for my life. Simply for taking a picture and trying to make our community better. Luckily I was able to get away and rode to one mile so I could wash off all the pepper spray and spit. In a COVID world that just got spit on me for just simply taking a picture of an encampment. and I had to go down and wash all of it off. I don't understand why there isn't a group of police officers down at that encampment right now telling them that they need to get their stuff and they need to get out. And I don't understand why they're not arrested and brought away, and I don't understand why their tents and everything isn't just thrown into a garbage truck as soon as they go to jail. And guess what? When they come back and they get out of jail and they do it again, then guess what? You go in there, you arrest them again, you take all their crap, you throw it in a garbage truck, and you stay on them. You don't build a multimillion-dollar facility to go put them at and just keep feeding the problem. You're feeding the problem. You need to enforce it and set the rules, set the boundaries, and not allow these people to take over the park. I don't get it. I'm sitting here with pepper spray on me. Thank you. Your time is up. Yeah, well, you know, I got assaulted in the park today, so I figured... You guys can sit here and listen to me for another 15 seconds after making us wait outside for 10 minutes. Jenea Beatty is our last speaker. Jenea Beatty. So, Ms. Mayor, I walked out of here to have your council member and apparently calling somebody out for self-accountability is not what you want. But I am so sorry, Mr. Horry, if a black woman's tone is toxic air for you. Suck it up, buttercup. You work for the city. No. No. Your time is not to talk about me when I walk out of this room. Ms. Beatty, the topic for discussion is the budget. Do you have some comments on the budget? So I've been waiting out there for all of these hours to talk about the budget, and I will talk about it. But I do not appreciate the way that you will not address your council members. That's ridiculous. What I want to talk about the budget is the safety in this city. And we want to hear you. The safety in this city that you want to defund the police effectively by spending so much money that we do not have on an encampment where homeless people do not want to come. When I left this council meeting the last time, there was a man waiting out there, a homeless man. He moved from Carmel to live at this park across the street. But I see what you're doing. Like a snake in the grass, you want to spend all the money in the budget so that you can take from having police. Now, my family, my children, and every family in Chico deserves to have enough police officers in this city to make sure we're safe. And that's not happening. And then it's a damn shame that we have a man assaulted in a park. But yet you want to sit on the bench and harass people who come here to spend their time. And unlike you, I'm not paid to be here. But I do pay taxes for you to sit in that seat. And there are many, many people in this community that do. And we pay taxes in this city and you don't care about us. You care about giving homeless people shelter when they don't want it. If the Torres shelter has 50 available beds, and you can walk across the street right now, I really dare you to do it with all of those men. Because look at the studies. Most of our homeless in Chico are pedophiles and rapists. People who their family don't want to take care of. And drug addicts, thanks to the passing out of the needles, who you have a free zone to come and get all your supplies. We see this bust today in Chico with all the heroin and the crack cocaine that gets busted. We need police. And Chico. So this whole deal and Ms. Brown, I am speaking. You are absolutely atrociously rude. Ms. Beatty, would you like to talk more about the budget? I am talking about the budget. But you know what, Ms. Mayor? It is absolutely rude when you have somebody who is not looking at somebody who pays their paycheck. It is absolutely disgusting. The way that this budget is being written and the way you're defunding the police, because you want to go along with the burn, loot, murder agenda. I see it. November 3rd can't come too soon. Good. So we'll close the public. So, City Manager Orem, we've heard the budget presentations and we've had some discussion. Are you ready? I don't see that there's any action being asked for. Do you want additional comments from us? Staff was simply looking for any direction. We'll come back with a supplemental appropriation at the next meeting. If there's any action that Council desires, direction that wants to be given, and there's consensus by Council, then we'll bring that back in in a supplemental at the next meeting. So with that, otherwise, we're going to come back in January with another budget update. So we'll be back in just a few months. We're going to need it. I won't see you in January. But I would like you to take a look at moving the monies around so that 100% of the franchise fees goes into roads and maintenance, even if it means that we have an increase of that amount into roads because we're, what, 12 million a year short, and that that means a small hit to reserves. So that's what we need to do. We need to move money around, to pay for whatever you need for public safety, to put 100% of franchise fees into street improvements, and, if necessary, take that out of whatever one-time monies you have. Perhaps kicking the can down the road one year on how we truly support public safety without borrowing from other funds, but I think we could do that in this year without having to go through what we had to do a year ago because of the one-time funds. So that would require a motion. And then we get into start allocating these budget items. I didn't make a motion. I know you didn't, but it would require one to ask the skipper to do what you're asking him to do, is my point. I don't think it takes a motion. I'm not making a motion to ask the city manager to do that. I think it's within his discretion to recommend full funding of franchise fees to roads. And if he doesn't do it, I'm going to be long gone. If you want to spend time discussing that motion, you supported it two, three years ago, 100% of the fees going into roads. I didn't support it, sir. It was actually my idea. I'm not opposed to what you're saying. It was Mark Sorensen's idea. No, I was actually at the meeting, and you weren't. I was, sir. Anyway, what I'm saying is, if we're going to start discussing single budget items, which is what you're doing, we're not actually waiting for the city manager to come back with supplemental appropriations. And so if you want to make one, I might make one. Alex might. We could go all night. I'm just saying, are you going to make a motion? Because then we could start doing this all night, or are we going to wait for the skipper to come back? I'm sorry. I interpreted it as this was a suggestion that Carl wanted to, to bring to light and have the city manager consider it. Maybe it was for us to consider later. I guess I shouldn't interpret what Carl was saying, but I... It's not a motion. It's fine. I just, I don't understand what we're doing. We're having a discussion, not necessarily looking for any motions, giving feedback on what we had just heard. Does anybody else would like to give feedback? I will say I'm supportive of what Councilmember Ory has requested, if that's helpful, and giving direction. I definitely want us to continue evaluating and looking at the best means for getting forward the hour CIT and de-escalation implemented. When I brought that request forward, it was over a two-year period, so as we're talking about budgeting, it's not just for a single expense, it's for two years, and so that cost can be broken down. I'm interested in the Chico Police Department creating and getting a post-certified course together, both for the regional impact and for the cost efficiency of that. I would like to... I would like us to pursue that and to move down that road. So if that's a motion, needs to be a motion, I'm happy to... Make it. I share your thoughts about the CIT training. I think it makes us have a better police department by having additional training. I think from what we've discussed in the ad hoc committee, I'm very impressed with the training capacity of the Chico Police Department, and heard Sergeant Pena express that he would like to have some questions about how the training hub for the North State is developing and how the training hub And I think we have the caliber of the training and the capacity to build those courses. Yes. And he was talking about the difficulty of having courses developed, and so it would be wonderful to have that. It just makes us have a better police department, and that's what our department wants, to be the best department that they can be. So, yes. And definitely we were talking about how their training budget works. They receive $185,000 a year for training, gets reimbursed a lot of the courses through post. However, that reimbursement goes straight to the general fund instead of staying at the police department, and that doesn't really make sense. It's a way to build that budget. Okay. Thank you. So, do you want motions from these things? That would be helpful. You know, obviously I could take direction, but I need consensus, and it's hard to get consensus unless there's a motion option. Sure. Yeah, I'd be supportive of both Councilor Ory's and Vice Mayor Brown's directions that they've proposed. I don't want to interrupt you, Scott. Are you done? I couldn't hear what he said. He's supportive of your idea and Alex's. Thank you. I'm not necessarily, I'm certainly not opposed to Mr. Ory's idea because it was mine, and Alex's as well. But for the Skipper, we've got these maybe one-time monies. We heard from almost every department said, this is something I would like to have, this is something I'd like to have. It gets to be a little dangerous when we go, well, we're only focusing on here, and we'll take this and we'll take this. We haven't heard the homeless opportunities plan or whatever it is. I know the acronyms hop. Where that money's going to go because we didn't get to that part, which I think is a good thing because we need to do the budget first. If we are going to come back before we make any motions, it would seem prudent to ask the city manager to say, well, here are the funds that are available moving forward. We have hiring freezes. Do we want to change those? The council said, these are your priorities. These are the different places it can go. This is the best way that I think I can build that public. That's what we hire him to do necessarily before we start going, this one, this one, this one, little darts, and then all the money's gone, and we've done that before. Not very long ago, we sat in this chamber, and we debated asking the citizens for a tax increase for public safety and infrastructure. And public safety certainly could include train, and then at one point, it was public safety infrastructure and other infrastructure. Some of the proposals we heard about tonight aren't on there. There's a lot of them, and certainly part of the HOP program wasn't on there, but we were going to go to the citizens and say, give us more money so we can do those things. Now we found out we have some money. Are we going to do the things that we told the citizens we would have done with extra money? And that just gets down to what initiatives do we want to fund? And I think we're looking at this too much piecemeal, and we need to see it all together. Which is why I would be opposed to going through this and making motions one at a time and piecemeal. Not that I disagree with anything either one of you are saying. Well, it is budget. But would it satisfy concerns if whatever's been brought up, which are two things, come back as an agenda item in the next council meeting or the next meeting you can attend? Well, no, and I think, and that's why I asked, and I didn't mean to be rude when I said, I thought, were you making a motion? Because I was afraid we'd get into exactly what I'm talking about, this, this, and this. I think if the skipper has the direction for your item, you're like, yeah, you know what, that's something we want to continue to do. And for Ms. Brown's item, can we do that? And what about these other things? How does it all fall together? Because we know if the seven of us start having that discussion, we will be here until next Tuesday. Right. How about if we make sure that these two items are definitely in the plan that you bring back to us? So that we can see it in context of the other items. That's what you just said, Sean. It's nearly uniform. Everybody's nodding their head yes. So these two items move on? Okay. Are we good? If you want a motion and a second, I think you're bringing it back anyway. I think I've heard from over four people here. Yeah, you've got six or seven. We have several other departments that made significant requests. We need a fire truck. We need a fire station. We need to take care of our roads. And we have equipment that's failing. So I think to pick one department and say this is the most important thing, it just doesn't feel right to me when everybody has needs. But I agree that these are two important items. So Mr. Orm, sorry, I didn't mean to step on you. So Mr. Orm, if we could have a breakdown of a few packaged options, I suppose, that have these contained within them. And then with the expectation that some of that may be a la carte. You guys are all so much better at articulating thoughts than I am. Okay. Yes. All right. So item 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 have all been continued to our next meeting. Reports and communication. City Manager, do you have a verbal report? Not tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. We were provided monthly financial reports and budget monitoring. We were. Yes. Are there any council member requests to consider? Wow. First. So we will, so we've got closed session. Are there any public comments for closed session? I had one and that was Jay Fumasi. I can't even say it anymore. He was. And I don't know if he's still here. Okay. He's gone. I believe he's gone. Okay. Any council disqualifications? So we will recess to closed session in conference room 1. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Scott, did you hear that? We will call you from the conference phone because we don't have it set up in that other room for WebEx. Okay, I'll call you. Bye.
