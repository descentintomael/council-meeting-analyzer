 Members of the staff, do we have all of our commissioners who said they would be present?  Okay, good to know. So we do have everybody who said they would be here. Great. Okay, thanks.  And I guess we can call the meeting to order at 6 p.m.  Meeting has started. Let me get my agenda. I should have done that.  So the first item of business, 1.1, Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. Please stand.  Salute. Pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  You may have a seat. Thank you.  Roll call. Staff, could we get the roll call, please?  Yes.  Commissioner Wall? Here.  Commissioner Poulin? Here.  Commissioner Cooper is absent. Commissioner Scott? Present.  Commissioner Ober? Here.  Commissioner Goldstein? Present.  Commissioner Deremedy is absent.  Thank you.  All right, so we can move on to recognition of outgoing commissioners, 1.3.  So, I'm Debbie Preston, city clerk, and I just wanted to let you know that that recognition is going to be done at the council.  The council really wants to acknowledge the outgoing commissioners for their outstanding service and dedication to the city, so we have plaques and everything, and we will invite everybody.  Now that the meetings are open, it will happen.  Okay, so, we have a few minutes left, and we'll get to that.  So, thank you.  Thank you for the update.  Yeah, it's been wonderful to work with the commissioners who have left us, and it's exciting to turn a new page, and I'm glad they're getting council recognition and plaques.  That's fun.  Do you know what meeting that'll be, if we would like to attend?  I will get that scheduled.  I don't think it'll be at the July 1st meeting, but probably the first meeting in August.  Okay, thanks.  And we will do that.  Great. Maybe if staff can send us an email if we'd like to attend and clap.  We will.  As soon as we get it on the planning calendar and we get a date certain, we'll send it out and invite everybody.  Okay, sounds great.  Thank you so much.  Okay, 1.4, oath of office.  So, thank you, Chair Goldstein, and welcome, Commissioner Pullins and Commissioner Wall.  This is the greatest honor that I have as a city clerk is getting to swear in dedicated people who just want to help our community.  So, I would ask Commissioner Wall and Commissioner Pullins to stand and raise your right hand.  And if you want to turn your microphones on so it can be picked up on the recording.  Thank you.  Okay.  I know the microphones are a little different.  It's a little different from when you were here before.  It's on, it's green.  It's on.  Okay, got it.  Thank you, Chair.  Oh, actually, I'm sorry, you are, you do have to take the oath of office.  I apologize.  Commissioner Scott has been on here for a long time, I was assuming she's still there, and I need to be sworn in.  I apologize.  Okay, so, raise your right hand. I apologize. Okay, so raise your right hand. I do solemnly swear That I will support and defend The Constitution of the United States Constitution United States and the Constitution of the State of California and the Constitution That I will bear true faith and allegiance To the Constitution of the United States To the Constitution of the United States And the Constitution of the State of California  California, against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I take this obligation freely  without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully  discharge the duties upon which I'm about to enter.  Congratulations and thank you for your willingness to serve.  For anybody just tuning in, those are our new commissioners and it's wonderful to have  them except Toni's also been an old commissioner and she just, old and new.  How many years have you been on the commission so far?  I'm starting my third term, so eight years so far.  Awesome.  Cool.  So I'm not sure, are we doing item 1.5 tonight, the selection of new officers?  Typically it occurs if you would prefer to wait until you have your full commission.  I'm fine with that and you would continue on as the chair.  It just depends on what the majority of you would like to do.  If you'd like to wait for the full body, we can do that and then I can come back at the next meeting,  swear Mr. Cooper in and get back to you.  Mr. Deremedy, I am happy to do that and then we can do the selection of the chair and vice chair.  I think that's great.  I do too.  I think waiting for the full.  Waiting?  Okay.  Yeah, hopefully we'll get full attendance and either way works for me.  So do we need to make a motion?  Are you okay with that?  Yeah.  Okay.  No motion.  It's more of just a procedural item so we can do it and I'll come back.  Okay.  Sounds good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  Item 2.  We have approval of the minutes under that.  Do we have a motion to approve the meeting minutes from last time?  I move to approve the consent agenda.  Second.  Great.  We have a motion and a second.  All in favor, please say aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  Any abstentions?  Yeah, I'll abstain since I was not here.  Okay.  And that's still four of us.  So I believe we're good.  That carries.  So consent agenda approved.  Bruce is already ready for...  Let me see which item that is...  We had business on the floor next on the agenda.  Is that what's up or...  Okay.  Bruce, you're welcome to comment on business on the floor...  We'd love to hear...  So business on the floor...  When we had members of the public address the Commission...  That makes...  That makes...  not already listed on the agenda, with comments being limited to three minutes.  We can't take any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda.  So, do we have any members of the public wishing to speak at business from the floor?  So, I believe, is it 4.1?  It's 3 on this agenda.  Okay. So, I don't see any cards for business from the floor.  At this time?  Okay. Great.  Well, then, we can probably have Bruce stand back up for item four, public hearings.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This is a proposal for an ARCO AMPM gas station and convenience store  with eight fuel pumps and a 3,464-square-foot convenience store  on the side.  This is the southwest corner of Esplanade and Eaton.  This is a...  On the right, you can see an aerial of the site where this is identified.  It's identified as a project site.  On the left, you can see the zoning maps.  The site is currently zoned.  Office makes use.  The general plan designation's office makes use, and the zoning is office commercial.  The proposed zoning is...  Community commercial, and the general plan designation is commercial mixed use.  That's what the request is for.  This project, though, includes a number of entitlements.  They're requesting a general plan land use amendment from office mixed use to commercial mixed use.  They're also requesting a rezone from office commercial to community commercial,  a use permit for a gas station,  which...  Which is required in the community commercial zone,  and site design and architectural review of the development itself in the building and the site.  The planning commission will be making a recommendation on this project to the city council  since it involves a general plan amendment and a zone change.  Just in terms of background,  the staff is supporting this request because the community commercial zone...  would be differentiated because it allows a wider range of commercial and retail uses,  including a gas station with approval of use permit.  It would also, if approved, create a contiguous stretch of CC zone properties to the...  from the abutting property on the south...  on the south, and this is on the west side of Esplanade,  all the way north to the opposite corner on the northwest corner of Esplanade,  to have a strip that would be contiguous,  and of CC in community commercial, general plan designated areas.  This would also be...  Locating this at this intersection would be consistent with planning principles  that call for locating commercial uses at intersections, at arterial intersections,  and especially if you have light uses on operations,  at the opposite corners of the intersections.  Another factor of this would be that it's consistent and compatible with the light use context at this intersection.  It would be wholly compatible with everything around it.  And probably most important is that it's not adjacent or abutting any residential uses.  Here's an overlay of the site plan.  I want to call your attention to a key point.  It's a key feature here.  You see that shaded area at the corner?  The area has been needed for a roundabout at this intersection,  and between their design engineer and our public works people,  they have worked out a schematic for the eventual dedication of the right-of-way  for that roundabout to be built at this intersection.  Even with that proposed dedication that's schematically shown in gray,  there's still enough room on the site to accommodate the required landscaping, parking,  and all the facilities and ample room for maneuvering and parking and so forth.  The request involves eight fuel stations.  It would be open 24 hours a day.  There's EV charging.  There's air and water service.  The underground tanking,  the tanks are located to the Westerly property line.  And on your site plan and your exhibits,  you can kind of faintly see where they've kind of stippled in in a real subtle pen,  the turning radius.  They've overlaid like a turning truck where you can see how a truck would maneuver in for the fuel deliveries  and could circulate through the site,  do the deliveries and exit the site.  You might be able to see it better on your staff report.  But again,  a key feature is that the site is open.  there's been,  this will help facilitate the build out of that round out with just dedicated right-of-way at that intersection.  Here's a copy of the landscape plan.  As you can see,  it's a pretty,  there's a lot of landscaping at the corner.  And that's that area that's planted out.  So,  it'll have,  in addition to the required area,  it'll have extra landscaping because they'll need to reserve that for their eventual right-of-way dedication.  The,  there's,  these are the elevations.  I call your attention to that rear and side elevation.  Condition number six on the architecture,  from the architecture review committee,  is that they're recommending additional screen plantings be put on that elevation and break it up along that rear elevation.  And then along,  also screening part of the trash enclosure and that side elevation facing Esplanade.  To kind of break that up architecturally.  And that kind of blank wall.  So,  that condition has been recommended by the architecture review board.  Next,  these are the,  there's the trash enclosure and then the fuel canopy.  Materials are identified there.  Earth tones.  And the material selection.  In terms of the use permit,  the site has pretty good visibility for a gas station.  It has access,  adequate access,  good access.  And it has ample room.  It's a large site.  So there's enough room in the maneuver for deliveries,  parking,  and all that.  Even dedicated right-of-way.  And they still have plenty of room for,  for the facility to operate.  They've got the buffers that are required for gas stations.  They meet the parking requirements.  The bicycle parking is provided near the front entrance.  And it meets those requirements for parking,  circulation,  landscape buffers,  and setbacks.  In the environmental review,  we felt that this was consistent with the,  the general,  the current general plan environmental impact report.  If the planning commission is comfortable with that,  as we are,  then this project would be considered categorically exempt  from further environmental review as an infill project.  Lastly,  our recommendation is that,  you know,  you consider the staff report.  If there are any questions to us,  we can provide some comments.  Hold the public hearing on the project.  And adopt the required findings in the resolution.  The findings are in your resolution.  And that's in exhibit A,  or attachment A to your staff report.  And,  and recommend that the council approve this general plan amendment,  rezone,  use permit,  and site design and architectural review,  subject to the recommended conditions.  I'll note though,  I've got a new condition in here.  Condition number 12 has been modified from the version in your staff report.  We're recommending,  oh,  the wrong one got put in here.  We're recommending that a new condition,  let me read that for you.  .  We're recommending that the condition,  the condition 12 be modified to require the recording of the right of way dedication  and the merger prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy.  And that would be the change to condition number 12.  Lastly,  we did have some,  oh,  so,  we're going to explain to the environmental review and why we believe that this is consistent with the general plan.  And,  oh,  here's the condition.  I'm sorry.  So,  condition number 12 was prior to the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy,  the applicant should record the right of way dedication in the minor land division that was previously approved on this.  And I would also like to note for the record that we received,  by now,  Nicole,  is it 13 emails?  12.  12 emails.  11 are opposed and one is in support of this.  One of the emails is in opposition to gas stations in general.  And then the other,  the other is in opposition to this.  I believe that housing would be more appropriate,  a more appropriate use of this location.  And in response to that,  the site has been remained vacant.  It could have been developed for a apartment.  Any time in the past,  it's been vacant.  And now there's a proposal at this time.  So for this project,  and we think that's the one the planning commission should focus on.  That concludes my presentation.  If you have any,  and we've made those,  we've attached those emails to your,  your correspondence file.  And that concludes my presentation.  If you have any questions,  I'd be happy to answer them.  Great.  Thank you,  Bruce.  I know I have a few questions,  but if anyone else wants to go first,  feel free.  I do have some,  some questions and things I want to explore a little bit.  I think I want to,  I'd be okay hearing from the applicant first and then start going back.  Okay.  Let me pull up a couple notes.  That's just for myself.  Either of you have questions for Bruce?  Okay.  I think I have one for Bruce and one for Matt.  So Bruce,  going back to the CEQA and the negative declaration there,  what's the highest intensity of what could be on that site right now,  as far as what it's zoned?  So it's zoned office mixed use.  So what would that look like?  Would that be one office building?  Would that be five?  You know what?  I can show you what that is.  I have a slide of that actually.  That would be terrific.  Yeah.  So let me show you what that looks like.  So I don't know if you can see this,  but on the left,  you can see the office mixed uses.  And on the right,  you can see the community commerce,  on the right.  And that's a matrix of the,  the allowed and permitted uses.  It's also exhibit B to your staff report too,  which exhibit B.  So it has a detailed listing,  but in essence,  it allows a more robust range of retail and commercial uses.  So that could be a problem on a more,  it could be a store or a full retail store.  So a supermarket conceivably.  So I think Matt,  when I think of consistency with the general plan,  and CEQA,  probably the first thing I think is the number of trips.  This seems to be a lower intensity on number of trips than say,  a health and fitness club.  But was there any sort of traffic,  additional traffic study that you would have to do with something like this?  Or do you see this as being consistent with the number of trips we've already planned for that area?  I don't think that would be significant enough to warrant a traffic study.  I think it would be a little more of a traffic study itself.  Although I have to add that you're aware this last year,  maybe it was the year before,  we redid the Esplanade from way downtown here up to that 20th Street,  not 20th Street,  Eaton Road.  We're currently working on those plans to take that widening and complete it from Eaton northerly to Nord Highway,  and then maybe some to the north to the bridge there.  But the roundabout, like Bruce mentioned, the right of way,  it's just something that we're looking ahead on.  I don't know quite when they were planning to do that,  but we are planning ahead.  And like with the roundabout at that location,  it would be sufficient to handle the additional residential trips generated out on the west end of Eaton  and then the traffic that's coming off the freeway.  So anyway, we feel confident that our traffic analysis  for that capital project would cover this change in use or change in general plan.  Thank you.  So Bruce, I do have a couple questions.  So when I was looking into this site,  it looks like it's in a corridor opportunity site,  which expands the potential density for housing units and such.  And I calculated based on it being in the office area,  it's mixed use, land use designation,  and 1.25 acres that it could feasibly, in a vacuum,  hold up to about 75 housing units if somebody chose to do that.  And I think that's where some of the concern about it being underutilized,  whereas somebody could feasibly develop housing there,  I think that's where that came from.  But can you confirm that if it's in a corridor opportunity site,  and if that would apply?  Yes, it would.  The density would apply,  but it still would require a use permit in the OC zone.  We just went through one of these down the road,  and that was appealed, and they're still challenging it.  But yes, in theory, the allowances for the opportunity site  would permit them to go higher.  They would be eligible for density bonuses,  and it would trigger a use permit.  Okay.  Thanks.  Let's see.  Oh, and another thing that I found when looking through the municipal code was,  and I don't know if this applies here,  but maybe you can clarify it for me.  I saw something about in the corridor opportunity sites in that zoning  having a minimum requirement of six dwelling units per acre  in commercial mixed use and office mixed use,  but is that only for if you're already building residential?  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Good to know.  Yeah, I think that I'm good for now,  and if you would like to take a break,  we can move on to having the applicant speak.  Great.  Unless anyone else has more interrogation.  Great.  So moving on to the public hearing,  we have our public hearing guidelines say that we'll have any announcement  of ex parte communications first. We have our public hearing guidelines say that will have any announcement of ex parte communications first So do any of our commissioners of ex parte communication? Cool and the Yeah Opening the public hearing for public input We generally go no longer than around 60 minutes with the applicant speaking about 10 minutes first  We do.  We do.  We do.  We do.  We do.  We do.  We do.  We do.  We do.  We do.  Good evening. Thank you for your time. My name is Mike Singleton. I am the applicant along with my partner, Chase Partners, and we are a retail developer up and down California.  This is a site-specific driven opportunity for us. We are not a speculator. The market and the interest, i.e. AMPM and other units to getting us to this point have chosen this location as an ideal opportunity to open up another unit in this trade area.  They feel for the going to work side, the morning traffic, being the first signal to the west for the eastbound traffic is very ideal for them and are very comfortable with the opportunity here.  We've worked with staff for a long time to get to where we're at through the MLD and through the right-of-way dedication and the ARB, and we're in full support of adding the additional elevation requirements and the dedication with the recordation of the CFO.  So,  all of those conditions are acceptable to us.  We would look for your support, and I'm here to answer any questions you may have.  Great. Thank you.  Questions?  I'm not sure.  I'm assuming you did some sort of market study to see what's in the area.  There's that one gas station on the northeast corner.  But from there, do you know where the nearest gas station is?  The one that I could think of was at  east and correct.  Okay.  So, distance wise, do you have a sense of how far that is?  So, that's the northeast corner of east and Esplanade, if I'm correct.  And I want to say that's 1.5 miles, maybe 1.2 if I remember off the top of my head, is what we're thinking.  Once again, it's a different traffic pattern.  These retailers look at things differently.  Starbucks want to be, as an example, going to work side.  The Chipotle's of the world.  And I do those up and down the state too.  They want to go on the coming home side when on your way home.  Pick up dinner for the family and vice versa.  So, both units have, both businesses have different traffic models that they prefer.  This one fits right into going to work side, which is why we have chosen it.  And basically, as I said, the tenants that I work with, they're like, Mike, I would like  to get a unit here.  Here's your trade area.  And through our site investigation, we were able to start to deal with the current landowner  and get it to the stage where we're at today to present to you and see if there's some  support for it and get this project going.  It's been about nine months, ten months.  So we've been going through this a long time.  And we're excited to get going on it.  Great.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Other questions for the applicant?  Okay.  Great.  Then I think we can move on to, do we have any other speakers from the applicant's team  or anything?  We have two speakers.  From the public or from the applicant?  From the public.  Okay.  Great.  Then let's move on to public speakers.  The first one is Addison Winslow.  Welcome.  Hi.  I did once live nearby this project in Eaton Village in the apartments there.  And I rode a bike to school around there.  And my major concern was like housing is a big one and I think the automobile orientation  of that is a big one concern of mine.  Okay.  Thanks.  Thanks. That and so so we mentioned that this is you know, for one it's across street from another gas station  Thanks. That and so so we mentioned that this is you know, for one it's across street from another gas station The nearest gas station then would like like distance wise would be East and Esplanade There are two more on the next off ramp down on East Avenue going one way and going the other way and then  does have eventually the opportunity for housing to be built on it.  And whenever we discuss the opportunity to produce housing,  like a particular nonprofit that has millions of dollars looking to produce affordable housing somewhere,  they can't get a site like this to do it because there isn't enough areas that are zoned for that scale of building housing.  So if we're in this land shortage simultaneously, this is like too much undeveloped land we can't do anything with,  I think there's some level of disconnect to the fact that a gas station and Chipotle developer is able to access this land,  but a local nonprofit that builds housing is not.  And across the street also is the Northwest Chico specific plan.  And so this is described as it's supposed to be like a village that incorporates everything a neighborhood needs.  It's supposed to be a pedestrian-oriented street on Esplanade, even though it's six lanes.  And I think the best argument for this being like of any value to the neighborhoods, which are behind there,  like I said, I did live in apartments and I did walk here for things,  is that it's so inconvenient to cross Eaton and Esplanade that they would want to go to a market right here  rather than walk to the PDQ, which is a pretty decent market as far as gas stations go.  And so I see it as like the intention, the spirit that goes behind both the opportunity sites  and the Northwest Chico village plan as being spoiled by a project like this.  Like this isn't, it creates an urban eat highland effect.  It's unpleasant to pedestrians, it's unpleasant to everybody.  You have people turning in and off.  And so going into this,  and I think that's a really important point.  And I think that's a lot of people are going to be thinking about this roundabout.  There's going to be all these points of conflict where people are like waiting for traffic to come around.  So they're speeding up to the roundabout.  Someone else is coming out.  So I don't know that it doesn't warrant an environmental impact report in a traffic study.  And you know, this is oriented for people who are like can't find the time to get to a gas station across the street.  So they need another one that sits right there.  To people who are living far away from this area and they're commuting.  And that's the type of thing that it makes it easier for you to live so far away and drive into town.  And all of that, that wears away.  on the infrastructure. That costs money. This is a very, relatively speaking, it's a low  investment project. It's not going to generate a lot of return  for the city, but all that commuting that encourages  this suburban sprawl, that does cost money in the long run.  As far as the strip of community commercial, I see  that that sort of makes sense. Philadelphia Square is a big office complex on the other side, right?  And I don't know why this was designated office mixed use in the first place, but as far as  compatibility, what community commercial is  compatible with the gas station? It's like a strip.  Time's up.  Thank you.  All right, our next speaker.  Julie Wood.  Hi, yes, thanks for hearing me today.  I just found out about this meeting, and  I was shocked because I know everyone's put so much work into this. They've invested a lot of money to figure out how to do it.  There are all these nice things ready for everybody to just go ahead and sign.  Let's just build a gas station. Well, I'm a single mom.  I don't make a lot of money. I make, you know, 15 bucks an hour.  And I clean houses. And I raised two kids that both went to college.  They don't have a place to live in this town. I don't have a place to live in this town.  We can't afford.  Rent. I live for free with friends. My son, you know, he's going into debt paying rent.  You guys work for the city. We pay your taxes.  I don't know how much this gas station's tax is going to pay, but to me, it's inconsequential for the benefit that we're going to get.  We need 4000 houses in Butte County, according to Ed Mayer, the housing authority.  We can get 75 or even 25 houses.  That's going to be huge. You know why? Because there's no land in Chico to build.  I've been talking to developers. I've been looking into affordable housing.  There's, the city doesn't loosen up any land for cities to, for people to build.  And I don't know what's stopping housing being built there.  That's the argument that, oh, well, there had, nothing's been built there.  Well, I want to know that too. Why hasn't affordable housing been built there?  I know developers want to build. They have money right now for affordable housing from the federal government, from the state government.  Okay, and this, it's just another defeat. I mean, I just, we're taking so many hits.  We need something that is a plus, so we can feel like, okay, Chico, please let us live here.  All right, thank you very much.  Thank you.  Okay, so that's all of our public speakers, right?  All right, okay, I believe we can close the public hearing, unless,  we wanted to ask any more questions to the applicant?  Does it, do the applicant, he gets a rebuttal?  Of course, if the applicant would like.  Both of the speakers' feelings do not fall on deaf ears.  You know, I respect that wholeheartedly.  We experience that up and down the state.  Financially, I'm not a low-income housing or a housing developer,  so I can't speak to the economic viability of the housing.  I can't speak to the accountability of that, the government funding that's there for it or not.  And I wholeheartedly respect that.  This is, as I said, we're not a speculator.  We have, you know, the gas, everyone thinks about gas,  and says, oh my God, it's just gas.  What is going on inside these mini-marts, C-stores, between the 7-Elevens and the AMPMs?  This is nice stuff.  I mean, this is fresh.  They're really focused on health-conscious products for the consumers that go there.  And I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to speak.  And if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.  If there's anything else that you need from me, we'd be more than happy to work with you and staff again.  Thank you.  Great, thank you.  All right, we can close the public hearing then.  Okay, so Commission discussion on this item now.  So I'll jump in.  Thanks.  It does strike me that what we're being asked to do,  instead of executing on the general plan,  we're being, you know, the request is to change the general plan.  And I'm not sure that that's really the right thing to do, particularly in this case.  So the general plan calls out specifically, and Chairperson Goldstein mentioned this,  that this is, and one of our speakers mentioned it too,  that this is an opportunity site.  It's actually identified as an opportunity core site.  It's a corridor of which the general plan only identifies a total of four in all of Chico.  And by designating this as an opportunity corridor,  the general plan mentions a number of things.  It mentions the fact that the Esplanade,  it describes it as a world-class boulevard up to Lindo Channel,  where it goes through this dramatic transition to being something very different.  And I don't have in front of me the language there,  but, you know, it's obviously a very different street.  And that's a large reason, in addition to the fact that there are properties  that do have the potential for a very different kind of use and urban landscape on that particular corridor.  That's why it's identified as an opportunity corridor.  It has an opportunity for execution of the general plan.  The general plan calls for things like, you know, walkable, bikeable neighborhoods,  reduction of, you know, automobile traffic,  you know, et cetera.  And so I think that this is one of those prime cases where the,  well, I understand totally the application.  I mean, it's a pretty clear project.  The part that is giving me trouble is the idea that we would be changing the general plan  to accommodate a project that is actually,  it doesn't have to be a project.  It does not fit with what the general plan expects us to be doing for,  you know, for the future of that part of Chico.  And so I think I'm coming down on the side of opposing this project because of that misfit  and because it seems like this is, again, it's called an opportunity.  This is an opportunity to protect, for now, this stretch of that corridor  for a potential future use.  It does match the general plan.  It does meet those criteria.  It does increase density.  It does encourage affordable housing.  It does encourage walkable, bikeable neighborhoods.  It does get us out of automobiles and reduce greenhouse gases, et cetera, et cetera.  All of that is in the general plan.  And so this doesn't, to me, fit that.  And the last thing I'll say in respect for the applicant,  who has done a perfectly fine job,  and there's nothing, nothing,  nothing outside of the general plan that I find objectionable about it,  this does appear to me to be the kind of project that could fit in any number of places  and places that aren't right at the end of this opportunity corridor.  So I would encourage my fellow commissioners to, you know,  to take a close look and think hard about what the general plan asks us to do.  And I don't think I'll be able to support the project.  Thank you for your comments, Rich.  Yeah, reading through this, I had some similar concerns.  My impression is that it doesn't quite align even with some of the goals and policies  of the general plan that were outlined in the staff report,  such as the ones, this one, maintain a land use plan that provides a mix  and distribution of uses.  That meet the identified needs of the community.  That's a lot of gas stations and convenience stores in one corner.  And I mean, I walk to a convenience store,  so I understand that that might be helpful to some people.  But I think that the intention of this site,  especially the corridor opportunity sites in general,  is to have that mix of uses and having, as it says,  places to gather jobs, daily shopping needs, walkable access.  So, of course, we can have all types of uses in Chico.  But I share the concern that in a corridor opportunity site,  this has been specifically outlined as a site to encourage development  of dense housing, other uses.  And of course, if this doesn't become a gas station,  there are plenty of other uses that are available.  And I'm not saying that it won't be.  I'm not saying that it would necessarily become one thing.  It looks like in our table of allowable uses,  there are places of worship, health clubs, and libraries and museums,  outdoor recreation, et cetera.  And one thing that I'd like to note is that I'm not necessarily opposed  to it being community commercial either.  I do like the idea that there are more allowable uses under community commercial.  But I don't see a compelling use to do a reason  for the purpose of a project that doesn't currently comply  with the land use designation.  So I might have some more comments,  but for now I should let my other commissioners speak.  I think those are good comments.  I think one thing that maybe the public's missing,  and maybe we're not using the terminology absolutely correct.  So this site is not zoned as a corridor opportunity site.  The site is currently zoned off of the site.  It's not this commercial.  It's not zoned residential.  It's within an overlay district that allows us to go up to a higher density,  if we want to, on sites that are zoned residential to maximize that.  And when we were looking at the general plan,  the idea was not everything within this corridor zone would be residential.  It was on the sites that are residential,  we're providing the opportunity to go higher.  So we're not in essence trading housing for a gas station  because it's not currently zoned for housing.  Yes, it's allowable with the use permit.  Yes, this would be allowable with the use permit too.  But that's not really the trade that's happening here.  So I feel like we need to be clear on that.  The other thing is I know there might be other places that this could work.  You might want a compelling reason.  A compelling reason for me is he is a person  who owns the property right now,  and this is the site that he has to do something with.  I don't know if there's other property that's owned in the city of Chico,  but somebody's willing to develop something on property that they own  in a process that we have said should be consistent and allowable.  So there's not, we can't wish for a better project.  We have to decide a project based on the merits of the application,  if that fits and aligns with what we have.  So I think it's fair to say what I see on the application in front of me  doesn't fit and align with what we have if that's where the conversation goes.  But I don't think it's fair to say this aligns with everything,  but it's still not good enough and I want something else.  We can't make that decision.  I would agree with Ms. Scott.  And I think that the general plan and the staff  report is subjective in the sense that I think it is within  the guidelines for that area.  There's only one gas station and convenience store at that intersection currently.  If you go to most intersections within Chico, there's at least two.  I think competition is good.  In this sense, it's maybe not the ideal project for that place,  but it's the, like Ms. Scott said,  it's the one that we have to do.  It's the one that we have in front of us.  And if it was, you know, a perfect site for affordable housing,  I feel like it would have already been developed as affordable housing.  I lost my train of thought. Sorry about that.  Oh, I did have a question for staff.  Has any local nonprofit approached the city, to your knowledge,  approached the city or the landowner  about developing dense multifamily at that site?  Not that I'm aware of, no.  I think that's all I have for right now.  Thank you.  I have one question.  During the course of this whole thing,  have any of the neighbors provided you with adverse comments  within the 500-foot radius circle?  The only comments we got, we got four yesterday,  and the others, Adrian,  and I got four or five or nine today via email.  I think we got a call, too.  We had one call.  Nicole took a call from someone, and they sent an email in, too.  But nobody's called to discuss the project with me, no.  Within, that lives or works within 500 feet of the project?  No, I don't know where those, where exactly those folks are.  That, where it says that came from outside the city on your email,  that just means came outside of City Hall, not an internal email.  So those could very well be people that live locally here in Chico.  That just meant it didn't come internally from City Hall email.  Okay.  I'm ready to make a motion.  Okay.  Can I ask for clarification on, okay,  so you don't have knowledge of if any of those people live, like,  behind the proposed site or anything?  Just what they've indicated on their communication.  Okay.  Absolutely.  Great.  Thanks.  I have just a couple more questions of staff.  Some of the feedback that I received was there was concerns about AMPM  and the existing ones that we have and the cleanliness of those stores.  Is it within our authority to put a condition on the,  an additional condition in the sense that we would have to ask the owner  to pressure wash, say, for instance, the sidewalks and parking lot once a month?  Or just make sure that, is there anything that we can do to help address some of the  concerns of the cleanliness that I received?  Yeah.  I think it would be, I would recommend we get the applicant's feedback on that and  see if that's something that they'd be willing to do.  Could you clarify, sorry, when you say feedback you received, I didn't see any formal emails.  I think you said you had a lot of emails that we have on that.  So is that ex parte communication or is that just discussions that you've had?  Just discussions in general and particularly the one that was proposed at a different location.  A lot of the feedback were concerns about the applicant.  Sorry, I should have clarified.  I wanted to make sure I didn't miss any emails.  Thank you.  Bruce, were you suggesting that we ask the applicant now?  Yeah, I would.  That may be in their program.  I don't know.  Maybe we can give them a chance to address it.  Would you like to speak to that?  People are happy to.  Thanks.  Appreciate it.  Great questions, by the way.  I'm actually dealing with the same situation in Bakersfield where we're buying the hard  corner.  The developer we're buying it from owns the 13 acres around it and they're like, all right,  what happens in this particular case?  That one was settled up.  What happens if it closed?  So we've, now we don't have that situation here because there's not a property owner  that we're buying it from.  But they have asked us a right to.  You know, a maintenance obligation right.  So I would imagine in your city code there is nuisance factors.  There is trash factors.  There is all that.  And just so we're all clear, I don't own the property today.  I'm an escrow.  I'm here to get it entitled.  If I don't get it entitled, it'll be there.  The gentleman who owns it is not a developer.  It'll, I'm not trying to, it's not a threat.  It's just going to stay there.  It's just not what he does.  He actually owns the building next door and it's all one parcel currently that has been  subject to an MLD, which is freeing it up so we can do the dedication.  They're fair considerations.  I can't speak on behalf of the tenants that I lease and build the premises for.  So as much as I would like to say, yeah, put that condition approval on me, I can try.  I mean, I would think that the city code as far as cleanliness, graffiti, nuisance, all  that would be the vehicle to suffice your concerns.  Adding belt and suspenders on top of that.  You can ask me.  I can try.  I don't, I can't speak for that answer.  You know, this, this is going to be a corporate store.  You know, and to know this is to get a zoning for this use.  As you know, gas station flags change.  So predicate on the price of oil will determine, you know, which flag is flown.  So I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.  And this is for a fueling station with a C-store.  I'm not going to say anything.  I'm going to say, you know, we're going to be under these parameters with those elevations  and this use.  But I don't disagree with your comment.  I think it's a fair and legitimate request.  I just don't know how I can't answer for a major billion dollar corporation at this  time.  But I'd have no problem trying to get it for you.  We're a partnership here.  This is what we do up and down the valley.  So whatever we can do to make it work for you.  I'll do the best I can.  I'm the CEO.  I'm the trash man.  I'm the decision maker.  So there's no board to go back to at all.  So if you need me, call me.  Send me an email.  Whatever you'd like to do.  Thank you.  Did that answer your questions?  Okay.  Great.  I want to circle back on this concept of whether, you know, so I don't think I didn't  hear anybody say that this was, you know, zoned as an opportunity site.  But it is designated as an opportunity site in the general plan.  And so my point was, and still is, that what we actually are being able to do is we're  being asked to both amend the general plan and change the zoning to accommodate this  use.  And so we are actually being asked to cross what should be a relatively important and  serious hurdle for any project when we're asked to change both general plan and zoning.  So and I also, my concern about what, whether this is a good fit given the opportunity,  site, the corridor, isn't necessarily predicated on what should go in there.  I may have my wishes, but that's, I set those aside at the door.  That's not the point of what should go in there.  It's more are we following the guidance that is given to us by the general plan and are  we doing the right thing for this strip of the urban landscape that has been identified  as our goal?  And so I think that's a big opportunity for something different than what's there now.  And so that feels totally appropriate to me to raise those questions and to say that because  we're being asked to clear this higher hurdle, making both of those changes, and also we're  kind of philosophically, I guess, being asked are we willing to change the general plan  to take us in a different direction.  that the general plan asks us to take,  that's a pretty serious step to take, in my opinion.  And that's a step that, in this case, because of,  and I know I keep saying that,  but because this is one of four opportunity site corridors  that have been identified,  I really feel it's important that we honor that  and that we honor the general plan  and we try to do our best to get us  to where the general plan is directing us  and not go a different direction  based on individual projects that come up and say,  well, if we just change the general plan,  then we'll be okay.  That's my rationale for not being comfortable  with this project in this location.  Madam Chair, I just wanted to add,  the opportunity site designation, the overlay,  doesn't imply residential only.  It also implies commercially.  It's a commercial development, too,  where we provide more intense commercial development.  And if someone were to come forward  with a pretty robust commercial project,  the opportunity site part of that  would work for this site also.  So it isn't a preference, so to speak,  towards one land use or another,  just more to get activity generated in these corridors.  And so I don't know if it's a fair characterization  of the project.  I'm just saying there's a preference  for residential versus commercial.  It's a preference for intense development  that stimulates activity.  That's a fair point.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  But I do, again, think that the language,  both addressing this specific corridor,  both in the language in Appendix B  of the general plan that addresses opportunity sites,  as well as the general plan itself,  I'm talking about,  the things I mentioned before,  which I agree, it does not say,  and I'm not arguing that it should say,  this has to be a housing.  I'm not saying that at all.  I'm just saying that the general plan  does point us in a direction that looks different  than the direction this project would take us  for that corridor,  the way I interpret the general plan.  And Bruce, can you clarify,  what is the general plan amendment specifically?  Is it something that we are being asked to do?  Yeah, it's just to change the designation  to community commercial.  From office, but not out of the community corridor.  No, no, that's still,  the overlay doesn't, it's still going to be there.  Yeah, the overlay will still be there.  It wouldn't modify the overlay.  One of the things that strikes me,  and I heard Larry earlier say that he was ready  to make a motion, and I want to respect that too.  But when we approve projects,  particularly when they require us to change zoning, et cetera,  we want them to succeed.  That's the whole point.  We want them to, we want them,  by approving the project for a development  where somebody's investing a tremendous amount of money  and building something that they feel  is meeting the community need,  we want that to succeed, and we want that project,  that business in this case,  to be there for, you know, in perpetuity.  So there's no, so,  there's no going back.  And we should not expect that, you know,  that, well, somewhere down the road,  maybe we'll be able to meet, you know,  some of what the general plan's asking us for.  Once we do this, we should do it, you know,  if that's what's there forever,  because we want them,  we want the business owner to be successful.  And so I'll just say it again.  I feel like this would be a missed opportunity  to execute against the general plan.  I think you've made really great points.  And I think I just have a fundamental,  on what the overlay is.  So I see the overlay zone as an opportunity.  It's like a lever that somebody could do  if they wanted to build more intensively,  but not the floor of what they have to hit.  So I think if I saw the opportunity zones differently,  I would wholeheartedly agree with you.  But I see it more as an incentive  if somebody wants to build more,  not that that's what we have to have  as the entry level, I guess.  That's true.  Although this is zoned in a way  where this project currently is not feasible.  So when you purchase a property  that's zoned off as commercial,  there shouldn't be an expectation  that you'll be able to build a gas station  or other noncompliant use.  So we would be removing a barrier for them  by allowing for the general plan amendment.  And do we allow that for everybody?  Like, what are our,  what criteria do we use to determine  if that's something we do or not?  And I'm pretty unclear on that.  Like, I haven't seen a very compelling,  I haven't even seen a study that says,  like, this is the market that's going to use this facility  and this is why it will benefit the community  to rezone it and allow for this use.  So that's where I'm at.  I think we have a pretty clear process.  They pay us, what, $8,000, $7,000  to come before us and see what we think.  With that.  So it's really up to us today.  This is part of that process.  And maybe part of the reason  that it has been vacant for forever  is because that land use hasn't been the right land use  and maybe this should have been rezoned years ago.  You know, we're focusing on infill  and trying to take advantage  in all the opportunities that we can  and I think that this is a perfect case for that.  Thanks for sharing.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, since you offered to make a motion first, I will.  Okay, I'll move that the Planning Commission adopt  Resolution Number 21-04, Attachment A,  recommending the City Council approve  the General Plan Amendment, Rezone, Use Permit,  and Architectural Review for the property  identified as APN006690-022.  Thank you.  Do we have a second?  I'll second.  Thank you, Tony.  Okay.  Any further Commission discussion?  Well, I'll add I'm really thankful  for the public that did come out  and we appreciate your comments.  I certainly take those into account  even if I don't vote the way that you compelled us to.  And I do really appreciate  when we're able to have discussions like this  and not...  just rubber stamp things,  but really talk more about what the General Plan looks like  in real life.  So, thank you.  Thanks.  All right, let's move to a vote.  All in favor, please say, aye.  Aye.  All opposed, aye.  All right, any abstentions, no.  All right, it seems like the motion carries, three to two,  although I don't know if that's quorum or not, but...  Yeah, that's good.  Okay.  Cool, well, we're going to wrap up here, though, so,  I think that's our last agenda item,  unless there might be something I'm missing.  Let's see.  Getting lost.  Okay, five is regular agenda and there's nothing under that.  Six is reports and communications.  Do we have reports and communications?  I don't have any, Madam Chair.  Okay, thank you, Bruce.  All right, then we can move on to adjournment.  So, when do you think we'll have our next meeting?  Not the following, not this, I think our second meeting in July.  Okay.  That's when we'll have one.  Oh, later July, okay.  Yeah.  We'll see you then.  Have a good night.  Thanks, Bryce.  Thank you, everybody, for your consideration.  You always know better than anyone's next on the meeting.  I bet you get on record.  I'm not free.  Thank you.
