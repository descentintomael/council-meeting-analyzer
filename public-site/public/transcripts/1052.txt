Based on the number of speakers, the Council cannot take any action at this meeting on request made under this section of the agenda. How many speakers do we have? We have six. All right, three minutes, please. Okay, and if I call your name, if the first and second speaker can get up. Our first speaker is Nicole Nava, followed by Jeff Creed. Well, good evening, everyone. It's very nice to be back and see all your faces. I am here basically on a couple of topics. One is that I kind of was hoping by now to have heard a plan on enforcement. I'm not sure if I heard that. On ourよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく because I believe that seems to be primarily only happening at Comanche and maybe here, but there's other places that it's getting pretty foul, just if you didn't know that. The other thing is that it's really hard to see in the news and other places for some community members who have been trying to speak about accountability and wanting to see a positive push forward and that we still don't see any actual plans related to what we can expect to see at the pallet site. And there's no contracts to pull back from the city of Chico. I did try to do that so I could do homework and go, okay, are there some key elements in there where people will feel like this is a good, healthy, safe environment for both the people who will be residing there and surrounding areas? So it would be nice to get a target date when we can expect to hear that as well, because before we get to that, we're going to have to wait and see what happens. So that's something that I would expect as well. To the enforcement piece, I know there's been much made of what was and wasn't said by the judge about what we can and cannot do in this city, and I still will posit to you that there wasn't a blanket thing that you can't have any enforcement. I get that it was specific to moving humans. And so again, there is much that can be done to protect the entire community if we kind of pick up the phone and say, hey, can you hear me? And I'm like, okay, I'm going to go ahead and pick up some action in that area. And I think we have only to see arrest logs to see that there are things going on in certain areas, but it's certainly lagging in others. And then there's been things right outside of our council that is unacceptable. It's unacceptable to have out of area people come to shop and enjoy and have children see what was on display out there this past week. And I think you all know what I'm talking about. For those who may not, it's out on social media, and it's just not open to the public. So I think it's going to be a little bit more of a! I went to that training or strategic planning meeting. I wanted to kind of come and be all happy, happy about it. But the more I thought about it, the more it sank in. There isn't really a good reason to be all happy, happy about it. I'm happy you did it. It was left undone. And frankly, I was kind of offended that somebody put down that too much public input or feedback or interaction was a major impediment to getting things in the city done. I just can't wrap my head around that. It's like a ditch digger complaining about there being too much dirt in the ditch he's trying to dig. That's the job. That's the environment. If you're going to complain about the environment, maybe you should seek life elsewhere. You know, the other thing that really struck me about that was a lot of the misinformation that's out there and the lack of communication. One of the things I struggled with young soldiers and young people in retail was getting them to understand that people treat you the way you ask them to treat you. By how you stand, how you dress, how you talk, how you shave or not shave. 99, 95% of the public treats you the way you tell them to treat you. And you all have been telling people as a council and as a city that you're not going to treat them the way you ask them to treat you. You're going to treat them the way you want to treat them. You're going to treat them the way you want to treat them. So when people ask you direct questions and you try to obfuscate and talk about the sunshine, no, we asked you about a contract and you couldn't give a yes or no answer. That's cowardly. So if you want to know what's holding the city back, it's a lack of leadership. It's an abundance of cowardice. That's what's really holding the city back. If you can't stand up to a fat old man like me and say, hey, this is what I did and this is why I did it, then how can I walk away believing that you have the intestinal fortitude and the courage to question your peers and your subordinates about hard subjects that need questioning? Why are the roads shit? Because five, eight, ten years ago, nobody put a plan in place. It's obvious. Go back through the record. I have. It's clear as day. To not address that now is cowardly. To not address direct questions is cowardly. What's the most dangerous thing in the world? A coward in leadership. Carla Struble, followed by James Hutchinson. There's no microphone. So I have a rhetorical question that I'm going to ask to camp out on the city grass where I just counted. I think it's 15 tenths. Do you have to be homeless or is bankrupt and poor good enough? Because I have to tell you, if the city's climate action plan is implemented, you're going to have a lot more of all three in those categories. I personally, after hearing rumors in the community that the city of Chico is going to become gas carless and there's not going to be any gas. in the city in two years and that all of our hot water heaters are going to have to be replaced with electric water heaters and that um what was the other thing i heard i don't know there's a number of rumors going on the thing is i pay pretty darn good close attention to what's going on and i never heard anything about this update to the plan now i finally downloaded it the plan is a two and a half to three inch thick document and most people's computers won't even hold that much data let alone it cost me what i consider an arm and a leg to print all of that out and even as a former geology major it's going to take me a while to figure out take me at least two months to go through it because it's three quarters full of charts and graphs. So I think what I'm asking you to do is to make bigger statements about the availability of this PDF or about the effects that it's actually going to have, the economic impacts that it's going to have on the majority of the people in Chico. My suggestion is that one of you have this put on the agenda for discussion as to how you're going to educate and get it out to the public. I'd recommend that we have an open meeting like we do here where people can make comments and there can be discussion. Either that or start printing that document. I'm not sure if you can get that document out in the ER, something. But the people of this city have a right to be educated about something as potentially devastatingly dire economically. Thank you. James Hutchinson followed by Patrick Newman. I want to thank the City Council for responding to my emails. Do you remember what you responded to my emails? Do you remember the name? I wrote you because a certain member of this Council is not qualified to be sitting on it. Why are they not qualified? Because underneath the agreement that they signed, the Council vacancy application was a direct statement that said they had to file the Form 700 with the City Council. I want to thank the City Council for responding to my emails. Do you remember the Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press Press you had the guts to respond once. It's a legal matter. This was not just my interpretation. I went to a state website and confirmed it, and it confirms that you have 30 days. The only excuse acceptable for filing late, that particular 700, and in this case it's referred to as 700A document, is if you were called up on military duty. In that case, you can file late. Mr. O'Brien doesn't qualify. He failed to do his job. It says right on his application that in fact you are required to file it on time. Mr. O'Brien didn't do that. You know what it said on the bottom of that application. You want to read what it says? It says this application and a statement of economic... Now, forgive me. My eyes bother me right now. Statement of economic... The 700 form has to be filed with... in the required time. The form was not filed within the required time. Look at the application. It's here. Did he do that? No. You bring leadership to this council, Mr. O'Brien, when you can't even do the basic thing, that you're required to do to get the job you're in. It was part of the requirements of this job. You know it. I know it. But instead of replying after several emails, I have this. Blank pages. I don't think there's one of you I would vote for again. There's three of you that I did vote for, and I won't ever again. And I'll get out and I'll walk the districts if you run in my district. I'm in District 6, the place without... representative. And it's clear we don't have a representative because nobody responded. Thank you. So, Council, I would just like to add that the Form 700 form is required 30 days after the date of being sworn into office, not the date that you signed the application. Because at that time on that application... I misstated, but nevertheless, he's still... Okay. I just wanted to let everyone know that. Anybody who wants to see this, it's right here. I went to the database, and it's required. It's on the application that it is required. You know it. That's fine. So, that is so... That is written right on it. Do you want to see his application? Would you like to read his application instead of talking at me? Did you read it? Sir. Did you read it? Sir. I asked you a question. It's past your time. Did you read it? You were the one who raised the question, not me. I'm on your time. I'm responding to a question. You threw it. Thank you. Once again. You know you can't put all that up. Is it okay? Can I talk? Yes. You want to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and All right, so next speaker. My microphone. Patrick Newman, followed by Katie Posey. All right, thank you. Yeah, so segue from the last one. My job is to try to pay attention to homeless human rights as much as I can, and violations of homeless human rights. The last time I was here, I had my three minutes, and I was trying to address the talk by Scott Kennelly, and I made a couple points. But real quick, we met since then. It was a really nice conversation. Fundamentally, I don't think we're going to solve our housing crisis issue and our lack of services by diluting civil liberties. And so... That's just a fundamental position. Second item. We had a little protest last Saturday. Please join us next Saturday, 10 to 12, because I really believe that the fence around City Plaza is there, continues to be there, as a deliberate attempt to cut off that space from use by homeless people, and we're talking about the only water fountain within a mile. We're talking about just a place to be a part of the community. We see that real differently, and I just think there's a game that goes on here where public spaces are seen as spaces where we try to exclude a population that we're not comfortable having around. I think we should get comfortable having them, and we should be able to get them around. We failed to provide housing over the last 40 years. We failed to provide social services that they need, and now they're on our streets. There's a long history of this. So we'll continue to make a point about the fence. I've been pretty patient. I think it was put up three times in the last year. This last month, nothing has happened inside that fence. City can claim otherwise. I've been watching. Lastly, the pallet shelter program. This is going to take more than 35 seconds, but I don't see the incentive on the part of the city to fill that place. I think there's every incentive to not fill it. Mayor Coolidge has already said he doesn't want to pay the power bill, so I think we need to pay real close attention to how that program develops and whether there's really a sincere effort to match those 170,000 people that are in the city. We're only seven units up with chronically homeless people that are on our streets that really probably could use a space like that. Maximum occupancy is what I'd like to see, not by coercion, but because it's a really good program. So that's something that's going to bear scrutiny. Thank you. So our last speaker is Katie Posey. Good evening, everyone. It's a change to be here and seeing people instead of just seeing a timer on a screen. Although it is helpful to see the timer up there anyways. But glad to be back. Just a couple things. I noticed that when we were having the meetings on Zoom, we had some different voices that were able to call in. So I just wanted to suggest that you think about whether you could ever integrate that option for the in-person meetings, having people call in. Because I'm sure that there are some that would be interested in speaking, but maybe don't want to come in person. And then there were others, obviously, that weren't speaking on Zoom because they wanted to be in person. They didn't want to talk on Zoom. So I don't know if there was any possibility of using some of that COVID funding for that, but that's one thing. The other thing I wanted to circle back to, something that some of us spoke about in one of those Zoom meetings also had to do with public comment. And forgive me if you already fixed this, and I haven't gone to check it, but the fact that you can only put in a certain number of characters and you're not going to be able to talk about it, you're not going to be able to put in your public comments. And so it's really hard because three minutes worth of that is definitely, it's not giving you enough space for that. So that was the other thing I wanted to check on because again, some people that might not want to come in person, they might want to just do an electronic comment, but then they can't really do their entire comment that way. That was the second thing. And then the third thing is the plexiglass. How long will you guys need to have that up? And could you get rid of it? But you might want to save it because I heard that it's really expensive in case you need to bring it back in. But that was just an observation I had while sitting there. And the fourth thing is speaking to something another speaker said earlier about the climate action plan. I was taking a look at that as well. And there's different parts of it. You know, by 2027, I think that's the year, you know, all the heaters have to be replaced. 2040, we're all going to be living in mud huts, that kind of thing. I just wanted to encourage you to take a look at that in smaller bits because as the speaker mentioned, I think there could be some concern from the public by this year, we have to be doing this. What's that going to cost us? I had mentioned on one of the previous meetings, this idea of a community coffee with a council member like once every two months. I don't know if maybe the climate committee could do coffee with the climate committee and a couple of council members. The thing is, I know that members of the public can go to their Zoom meetings, but they might want to have more of a question and answer period that's longer than what their meeting would allow. Just an idea in response. To the concerns that were voiced. So thanks everybody. Have a good evening. That's it. All right. Thank you. All right. Move on to item number four, public hearings redistricting city council districts in the city of Chico, public hearing number two. And I think it's, I believe Mr. Ewing, you have the report. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge. Yes, I will pass this off to the consultant demographer for this item. Briefly, the council had held its first of four mandatory meetings. The first was the public hearing on February 1st, 2022. The city's redistricting process must be completed by April 17th, 2022. The city must also make available all draft council district maps to the public at least seven days prior to the presentation of such maps. The second public hearing is conducted to invite the public to provide input regarding the composition of the council districts after ARTA demographics presents the potential council district maps to the city council and to the public. These maps will not be available to the public. The city council will include those created by the demographer as well as those submitted by the public and have been made available for public view on the city's website. That concludes my report and I will turn this matter over to the demographer. Hi, good evening, Mayor and City Council. I prepared a brief PowerPoint presentation as well as through the presentation we'll go over the total of 10 maps. So, once again, just to give you an idea of the current boundaries. So, district proposals, there are a total of 10 proposals being presented, three by myself, the demographer, and seven from members of the public. We also received one community of interest from a resident requesting a specific neighborhood be kept together. All public submissions were compliant and eligible for consideration. The community of interest in question was referred to as the Cal Park Community of Interest, a neighborhood roughly east of State Road 99 and north of Highway 32. It was a request by a resident that this area be kept together and this was factored into my maps as well as looking over the various public submissions. We'll now go into the various maps. We'll start with the demographer map, proposed one, which is what I call the right-sizing map. As I mentioned, the main one where you start off is simply taking what already exists and adjusting it for the boundaries. That's the main criteria used to get them within the legal boundaries of 10%. So, that's the main criteria used. That's why when you see it, it doesn't look like much has changed, only to get it into compliance. It creates now a deviation of 7.75% when the original map was almost 20% deviation. And the district with the highest Hispanic CVAP is District 5 with 20.48. Also standard practice due to the CVRA issue was to try and create a district where, at least one district where, Hispanic were over 20% of the eligible voters. It's not required by law, but it's considered best practice. Demarque for map proposal 2, main criteria was to try and keep it among main thoroughfares, natural boundaries, as well as trying to maximize the citizen voting age population. So here's a brief look at the map. Has a 7.71 deviation. And a citizen voting age population District 5 of 22.2% Hispanic CVAP. Demarque for map 3 was, was, was to follow as closely the police beat areas as possible. And that was a factor taken into it when we, when I designed district 3, or map 3, was to follow as closely the police beat areas as possible. When allowed. It creates a 7.56 deviation. And, and District 5, once again, has a 22.05 citizen voting age population. Now we received seven submissions from five different groups or people. Public submission one was called Chico Council mindful map.

The first one called Goldstein 1000. Same thing, fairly compact, follows natural boundaries, main thoroughfares, does split the Bidwell Park in two, but that is considered a natural boundary, the creek. Has the lowest deviation of the proposal at 4.37. But it creates a 22.37 CVAP for Hispanic population in District 4 this time. Public submission three, Goldstein 2000. Similar splits Bidwell Park. And the middle. Creates a spin line here between the unincorporated area, although I understand this decade this will be incorporated into the city. Has a deviation of 5.42%. But it does not create any district that where the Hispanic population is. So the Hispanic citizen voting age population is over 20%, but it does have two that are hover around 19%. Public submission four, Goldstein 3000. It's again splits Bidwell Park down the middle. Does not keep the Cal Park community of interest whole. Has a 4.75 deviation. So it is on the lower end. And it does not create a district that has a 20% or more Hispanic CVAP. Although District 5 is fairly close at 19.74. Public submission map five, called Fair for All map. This one is a bit different from other ones as it has District 5 kind of arch over District 4, but keeps the Cal Park community of interest whole. Has one of the higher deviations at 8.6%. But it has the highest Hispanic CVAP of all the maps at 23.08% in District 4. Public submission six is called Help People Vote Map. Okay. Okay. This one does not keep the Cal Park neighborhood whole. For some of it, seems to use the 99 as a boundary, while others seems to disregard it, mainly in District 7. It has the highest deviation of all at 9.2%. But it does create a... A... On our list here, and onlyよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく! On our list here, and onlyよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく On our list here, and onlyよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく! On our list here, and onlyよろしくよろしく! On our list here, and onlyよろしく thoroughfares has one of the higher deviations at 9.20 percent and it does not create any um district where hispanics are over 20 percent of the citizen voting age population but um two are at a around 18 17 or 18 percent and with that what we do is um turn over for any public comments and then happy to take any comments or questions from the city council all right i think we should have questions to him first shouldn't we it's up to you yeah why don't you come back for questions from the council first so so so!! we'll open the public hearing we'll start with okay let me just get it back to the other screen so our first speaker is nicole nava followed by bryce goldstein good evening again so first off i just asked to process two weeks is pretty inadequate for most people to gather their data compile maps that are equitable population wise voter pop wise take in communities of interest all of those things that one must do and use the tool um we tried to meet with some folks to encourage people to put maps in care about their neighborhoods care about fire hazards whatever might you know to them denote communities of interest working together and it was challenging for people and we're talking people with degrees and such so i just thought i'd bring that to your attention that it was a really harsh timeline in there um and you know the um chico has a specific makeup as we all know and so trying to work within spreading the love if you will so um liberals conservatives whatever that's not supposed to be taken into account but everybody knows that once you start crunching things that's how people tend to go and it's not pretty and so can we all just get along and figure something out right so um when you're looking at voter blocks and having equitable voters of a specific age should you try taking 90 and keeping them in a contiguous area and making them a little moreよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく andよろしく and and that when people speak about growing things, you have diversity, socioeconomic statuses and all that, and you tend to be crowding folks in one district. You're putting all the services in there, and then people wonder why we have issues with disparity in housing and all of those things. I think a mindful city does look at putting different diverse people throughout our fair city, different socioeconomic statuses and mixing things up is healthy. What's happening now is more and more is being shoved in one end of town, and it starts to get where then how do you make sure that those voices get heard or the other voices get heard that then they have zero services? Those were some of the things that made it difficult. I just wanted to let you know. Especially districts five and seven face that. Do you want those voices together to be a strong maybe Hispanic voice, or are you saying, no, we need to spread everybody out so that we can all be heard? Everybody feels equally empowered. There's that push-pull, and we feel it. I just think also that when we do this again in 10 years, maybe think about going down to five council members. I think that simplifies the map process, saves money, and gives the public more time for interaction with you all and gives you more time to interact with each other and work across the aisle. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Nicole. Bryce Goldstein, followed by Julie Three. Greetings, Council. Those of you who've been here for a while have probably seen me before. I'm happy to be back talking about maps. My name is Bryce Goldstein, and I submitted three maps this time. So I'll talk a little bit about those, but also my thoughts on this process in general. First of all, I am a proponent of having the citizens decide on our districts, so I hope that you'll be able to see that. I hope that in 10 years, we can have a citizens redistricting commission so that it's not just the people in power deciding on the districts. Actually, members of the community could help make those decisions instead of just speaking at city council. But until then, I also have a few comments on the process. Like the previous speaker said, it was a short window for public comment, but also I found there was one issue. Basically, there wasn't information on the redistricting web page about submitting communities of interest. There was that I saw it anyway, as an average citizen who's pretty involved, I didn't see anything about the need to submit communities of interest testimony, which is important in letting the demographer know which communities need to be kept together. So because I participated before in the city and county redistricting, I knew I needed to do that, and I included multiple community of interest, testimonies in my public comment. But we were told tonight that only one community of interest testimony was submitted, and it was not any of those. So that seems to be missing. So yeah, I'd like the record to reflect that I did submit community of interest testimony regarding the barber neighborhood, the avenues neighborhood, and student population neighborhoods. And I think those were the main three, at least that I submitted, maybe South Chico and Chapman Town too. So, my belief is that we need to have fair maps based on logical boundaries, easily distinguished districts, and complete neighborhoods. I submitted three maps. Each of them have my last name, Goldstein, and a number. And I based my maps on those criteria. I also especially focused on the core of Chico, trying to make sure that our neighborhoods that have unique interests and would like to be able to vote and organize together are not split up. And I am concerned with the way that some of the proposed maps split up the neighborhoods. Particularly, I noticed the avenues tend to be split into three or more when the population only really justifies maybe two or more. I mean, one or two districts. My neighborhood, the barber neighborhood is split in demographer proposal two. You can find most of all these comments in my email to the council too, since I'm running out of time. And then demographer proposal three could be acceptable, but I noticed it splits up rancher, area drive, which is a low income neighborhood that needs to be kept together. Maybe that district line could be moved to West Sacramento. Of yeah, thank you for your time and have a good night. Good luck. So Julie three followed by David Welch. Everyone. Okay. I think what you're seeing is we're all burned out from these maps completely map hell. And I think I'm wearing green because I'm voting green map tomorrow. I'm going to be in the school board meeting green map. Um, but it's, and I think to all these points, it's the process because we went from the county, which was heavy, heavy focus on neighborhoods, actually community of interest. Everything was driven by the community of interest, whether it came out on verbal things or on written comments or in the way people did the design maps. I, and I pushed, push, push for Cal park. I came in here. Cal park is the only one I'm like, thank you. That was me. Cal park. Finally, Cal parks getting some recognition, but it's, it's the process that somehow it's not capturing everything. And then we went to the school board right now and it's about philosophy. It's all philosophy. Do you want to have a trustee supporting one high school, two high schools or the elementary schools? And then everything flowed from there. So you really could dig into them in the detail until they want to like draw their own map. And then it was by stone, their home address. So no orange maps. It's based on their home address. So I'm, I'm feeling kind of too, like I'm not, there's parts here, but I can tell I was like Barbara, Barbara neighborhood. I would never break that up. Those, Barbara stays together. So I don't know how we can maybe capture that more. I've got to think about it. Now I've been looking all these seven maps and trying to digest the orange and the green, but the street levels aren't usually important to you. And so I think Bryce's comment about the citizen committee, that's where I see a lot of value because once you set a philosophy and you go, okay, here's the philosophy we're going to go with this map. We dig down into the street levels and we can see where there's a break on a power line instead of one that's on some weird street. Cause you want to look at this at the actual street names and we know that we drive them every day. So somehow that's, that would, I think be a wonderful thing. I don't know if we could incorporate that now, but it's the street level. So I don't know. Um, Claudia, if we could find us online, can we find the streets? You know, if we look at them to see which streets these are cutting, cause there's some word cuts in here. Um, streets, Cal park. I did the, I did the, uh, the police beat. I think that's that map looked great to me. So maybe in the future, six should counsel me by then or seven. Let's add seven beats. Um, the philosophy, I mean, I can tell the philosophy, I think that was where I was missing too. And then going on from there. So thank you. Thank you. I'm David Welch followed by Curt Mumford. Good evening. Um, I'm an admittedly partisan person, but I have absolutely no information about the partisan implications of any of these maps. So I'm looking at them entirely through the lens of what sort of good maps, what sort of good maps are there in the neighborhood. And I think that's a very important part of the map making process. Um, and it's a lot easier to say which maps I don't like than which ones I do. That's a, that's easier to find, uh, as has been pointed out demographer map number two splits the barber neighborhood. And there's probably no neighborhood in Chico that has a more, a greater sense of cohesion, a greater sense of, of a neighborhood identity than barber with the possible exception of the avenues neighborhood. That's a very strong thing. So I think demographer map number two needs to be rejected. Just on the basis of splitting the barber neighborhood. And it's really the only map that does that. So it's clearly an unnecessary thing to do. Good maps should have districts that are as compact as they can reasonably be, and should have boundaries that are easily recognized and described that follow natural features or major streets. There's three maps that all have kind of the same features in common along with their ever so wholesome mom and apple pie names, numbers five, six, and seven all have at least one district. That is just bizarrely shaped with jagged boundaries that are, uh, that are hard to describe, hard to define that would make it difficult for a person to even understand what districts they were supposed to be in at a quick glance. And all of those to me have kind of a strong smell of somebody who had an agenda to either, um, protect an incumbent or favor a potential candidate somewhere in the future or something like that. So all three of those can't all three of those five, six, and seven, seven of the public submitted maps share that, uh, those common features. The other neighborhood with a strong consciousness of itself as a neighborhood is the avenues. No map keeps the avenues entirely intact, but it, perhaps it's impossible to do that, but it seems like public submission to seems to do the least violence to that neighborhood of any of them. Um, the map that also does the best at boundaries, which are naturally clear, and easily recognized and defined also seems to be public submission too. So I think that's one that is worthy of strong consideration since it shares those two virtues of, um, keeping neighborhoods as intact as possible. And also, um, also, uh, having good sensible, easily recognized boundaries that make it easy for someone to describe what a district is. Um, and, uh, and as it happens also has, is extremely, extremely close on deviation. So I think that's a map that makes good sense. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Kurt Mumford. Hi, I'm Kurt Mumford. I live on third avenue. Uh, I'm also active in the Cana neighborhood and have been active on their board for some years. That's the Chico Avenue neighborhood association. And I remember from my years on the planning commission, there was very few issues that would pull the whole community together. One of them was the park. Uh, I suppose we've got a couple more since then, but these neighborhoods tend to organize like Cana and Barber. They tend to organize around an issue. Or a couple issues. And for the avenues, it's the hospital. I mean, we've been dealing with that for years and it includes the avenues. Uh, Barber has to deal with the Barber yard, a diamond, old diamond match site. And they've been organized and they've put a, a, a community action, a neighborhood association together. And, uh, one thing I find troubling about all these maps is they split up these neighborhoods that already are, are united by a common interest. Uh, I mentioned just, uh, oh, you spelled my name wrong by the way. K-I-R-K-I-R. Sorry. Sorry. Anyway, uh, I just noticed. Anyway, the, the, uh, I mean, and we, I like the demographer's map too. As David just pointed out, uh, uh, demog, uh, the demographer map too, sort of keeps, uh, the D4 area together, but it cuts it off at, I think, uh, the Esplanade. And, uh, we really kind of lamp over into, uh, Mangrove. I mean, we go, we, we embrace the avenues because that whole area is impacted by Enloe. And we've been dealing with Enloe for years. And some of our board members come from, uh, that area that's between the Esplanade and Mangrove. Uh, everybody in that area, he, here's the helicopter and has to deal with traffic. And we've got to deal with the traffic problems that come from the hospital. And we all fought this last couple of years to get that little park put in that, uh, the, the, uh, developer's agreement required. And we continue to work together on these things, right? And we are, that's our planning. Anyway, I, I asked the demographer, uh, to try to fiddle around with trying to recognize really communities of interest. And I, I only know two of them, and that's the barber yard and, and, uh, the avenues. So that's my, my, I, I saw that you had one community of interest submission, and it seems like that the area that that map proposed made some kind of sense. Uh, I don't know Chico well enough to say what other communities of interest are out there, but, uh, I do know that those two, maybe those three, have something in common. And they band together and deal with issues in common. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. That's it. All right. So close the public hearing. Questions from council? Anything further? I have a quick question for the demographer. Uh, one he already answered, and that was, is the city required by the voting, rights act to draw minority, minority opportunity districts? You said we weren't, but it was best practices. Is that correct? Uh, that is correct to try and maximize as much as possible and keep it above 20%. It's not absolutely required. Okay. Uh, second question in your opinion, are all of the maps that have been submitted legal? Yes. Those are my two questions for you. Thank you, sir. There's probably more. All right. Further questions. No, no, I don't think so. All right. I have a quick question. Councilman Brown. Um, what, uh, how did you learn about what communities of interest exist in the city of Chico? Uh, so, uh, one, um, did some research on, um, Chico looked into, you know, as much as I could on the website and other, um, um, websites. There, you know, various neighborhoods as well as certain input from certain, you know, some of the maps submitters who, who gave me their input and points of view when I was helping them kind of construct the maps and they had questions. So as I mentioned, one of the person who submitted the COI gave me some information to go on on creating Demog for Map 3. Thank you. I think the previous process was mentioned because there was, and I understand the limitations of COVID and contracts and all of this, but there was some pretty intentional outreach done with communities. There were actually forums where people had an opportunity to kind of define those communities of interest. If I do a search online in Chico, I'm not going to find all of the facets of Chico that the community is aware of and can define for us. And so I do wish that at least that previous process had been referenced by way of the community input that had been provided for some of those communities of interest because I share some of the concerns that were shared about dividing up Barber Yard, not as much consideration for the community of interest, but toward Cana in terms of dividing it up into three or more districts, et cetera. And so I think that could have been potentially softened if we had done a little bit more research, but I know there's limitations in terms of getting input from the public. So one of the things the council can ask is to take one of the maps and say, you know, ask to adjust it, such as Demog for Map 3, there was input saying it could, it could work if you tried to move it to this street. If it's the council's wishes, we could do that so that it can be posted in time for public hearing number three. So that is within your realm. Thank you. I appreciate that input. And the only thing I'll say about the maps is there are some that to me, when I look at them, have clear lines, clear divisions. If I'm going to look at them as a resident, I'm going to pretty much know which district I'm in. There are some that do loop-de-loos and jagged lines. That I think create a condition where it will be difficult to know which district I'm in. And sometimes the logic of connecting certain parts of the community just feels very off to me. So we might not need to dive into those specifics, but as I'm reviewing these, I'm looking at the ones with clean lines, follow clear boundaries, and they stand out to me. Okay. All right. Further comment? If there were suggestions from the council on adjusting this, I would pick Demog for, for map number three. How long would it take you to do that? And it's an unfair question because you don't know what it is yet, but let's say some minor tweaks just to put it in context. So we just have to have it up on the website by next week. And as soon as I get the instruction, maybe via email or, you know, I'll be at my computer typing it in. If you have it, I can get that done within a day. Okay. And would the council need to make those suggestions in this session or does it come after the fact? And I'm asking the council if you have any desire. And can it be done now? Can it be done tomorrow? So, I mean, obviously the email would be subject to public review. So, yeah, you know, you could have in mind it can be emailed. Obviously it's subject to PRA request and would be put in, probably put in with that proposal as well, with the changes. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Go ahead. So we had some pretty clear direction. It seemed like last time that we were doing this on the area, the communities of interest. Is there not the possibility for council to have a discussion tonight to say we would like to have those overlaid on these maps? So we know there's Bobbery Yards. We know there's the students. We know there's the avenues, Cal Park. I don't know what other ones you want to consider, but my question is, can you take those? Because we, as Ms. Brown said, we had a lot of community input and a lot of, and all that information is still available because it was, I mean, I know Debbie can pull it up and get it to you if there's a need to. And then can we take these maps and put them into something? I don't know, HTML, Google Maps, Google something. Like I can't tell what street is cutting off of what. Can they be converted into something so people can actually zoom in on them when they're not in a PDF? So we can, well, we can do what they call map book. It has, so when, and this is what some cities do, we, when they elevate certain maps for final consideration, we can put a map book together. It's still PDF, but it has each individual district. So it's zoomed in more and certain streets are, you know, more residential streets. You can see where those lines are, as well as one thing we can do is an overlay of the COI. Right now, we only have one COI on the record. So if we can get more in, such as the exact boundaries of the Barber neighborhood, happy to overlay those onto the Esri maps. Can I, please. So, I agree with Ms. Reynolds and partially Ms. Brown. There are a lot of communities of interest and everybody's named some. I don't, I think I know less than everybody. I don't like the park and no one's mentioned Chapman town. I don't think Chico state student housing, Miriam park has come up, a wildfire concern. Residents have come up. So I don't know to Ms. Reynolds question. Is this a time what we list out? So communities of interest that we know of that would like to see show up that way. Um, I don't think that I'm ready to start tweaking maps. And I'm a little surprised, honestly, at the, uh, the small amount that we got. I mean, we've got 10, but they're from three or four total people. Uh, I expected a little bit more community engagement given that this is Chico. And I don't know if we didn't get the word out enough or not. Um, I'd like to have more to go on and I don't know what we need to give you in order to get that. But if it was some of these communities of interest that we could, you will have the news of interest that I'm completely unaware of. And I'd say vice versa, except I don't think I know any. Thank you. Well, and then I would say, and this came up repeatedly, I know, although I don't live there, the avenues keeping that together to the extent possible is a big deal that came up last time and it got broken up because of where council members lived that we should probably avoid that. Just for your safety and the safety of others. So what do we need to do at this point to move forward? What do you need from us as I go? So, um, I, I mean, if, um, one residents can actually still go on, download the tool, a color in our color in, or even on, um, days redistricting, just do only the community of interest that they feel is their boundaries. Council members are also welcome. To do that as well. And we'll take that and throw that into, you know, as well as the instructions on council member Bennett, um, plans to send regarding demographer map three, and we can put together overlays to give you a good idea where, um, some of these communities of interest lie and give you a better idea of which map. So would you prefer that we did that through sending you information after this meeting or do it now? Um, so I can bring my computer up and take some notes. Right now I have word up. So all right, I've actually, I've got the listing of the communities of interest that I can get to him. Um, or that that works. And I think we'd be able to have council members submit additional communities of interest. Yes. And you can send them either to the redistricting email account or just send them to me and I will forward them on over. I'm happy to do that. I guess I'm just curious why we wouldn't do that in front of the public. Oh, it's fine. I was just saying, I know that I know you're not dictating the process. I'm, I'm talking to my colleagues right now. Um, why wouldn't we in the space where the people are watching us have this conversation rather than make them PRA the emails that we've sent privately? Well, well, it's close. They bring it back, but I mean, you know, for discussion, I mean, obviously they'd be listed at a future meeting, yeah, I'm happy to do it here. So the, just so you know, the information is already noticed and it is public. Yeah. So, and we'll put the link into this meeting as well. So, um, but whatever the council wants to do, I'm just going to share with you the neighborhoods of interest that I have interest in. I'm repeating some of the things that people have said, and actually here we can, I can bring up one, a sample map right now. Count council member Brown. Would you mind doing this in the order that we take role maybe so we could just all get through it? I don't understand. Well, well, I mean, okay, we can bounce around. You want to do it privately, so I'm not, no, I don't want to do it privately. I'm just trying. That was actually not what I said at all, but just trying to make the process go as quickly as possible and as easily as possible. I volunteer, um, Kena neighborhood. I am Kena Chico avenues neighborhood. Yeah. Uh, I am fully open to that being in one district. I think it could fairly be split into two. The only reason that, I mentioned that possibility is because I think multiple representation of that area, which is a very vocal, very active area could be very valuable to the Kena neighborhood. So I'm just noting that and boundaries. Oh, geez, that is, but yeah, that's, you got to figure that out. Can I can probably send you some, some details about that? The association. Okay. Uh, Cal park. You already made mention of student neighborhoods and student like density neighborhoods are important. I think one to two, um, compact, uh, uh, areas where students are, are concentrated would be useful. Barber neighborhood. Keep it whole. Uh, again, you're going to need to talk to the association about the specific boundaries of that neighborhood. Chapman town. Keep it whole as much as possible. Miriam park. I would say keep it whole. Chapman town. And what was the last one? Miriam park. Okay. That one's pretty easy. Cal park. Yes. Got that one. Sure. Yeah, that was the, yeah, Cal park got submitted as a, so we have that one on the record and same thing. If people submit it, they will be on the website and see, be able to be seen for 10 years. So they stay on the city website based on the fair maps act for the entire decade. All right. Do we have anyone else? A question for future development? Are you, how in, did you get information? Uh, did you get information on what could be coming in the next 10 years? Yes. And so what we factored that into, obviously you only have 10% deviation to work with. So if you know 20,000 people may be coming in there, there's only so much you can consider. So we can look at areas where there's likely going to be development and underpopulate, make those the ones you underpopulate. Um, and then those, and that was the general practice was when, um, the ones that had to grow, that's why the right sizing plan is important. That gives you the idea. Those are the districts, the ones that had to grow in area that you should probably overpopulate because they're clearly grown, you know, growing at a slower rate will likely probably have to grow some more in 2030 compared to say districts one or three that were very under are overpopulated at the census. Okay. Do we have any other communities of interest that want to be added? Okay. I have a couple. Okay. So obviously Amber Grove, uh, student areas, but particularly the highway 32 corridor. Okay. Because of its proximity to highway 32, they share a lot of the same. Okay. So, um, Cal park, but I wouldn't drop Cal park all the way down to, uh, highway 99 and actually stop it at forest. Because in the COI that you had, it drops all the way down to 99, but obviously anybody in that area is more park related, but also have a lower park, both sides of the park, uh, area, or the area of interest. Um, the area surrounding, uh, pleasant valley high school. And then also, uh, a lot of, uh, constituencies that shared the same thoughts and processes or, or, uh, anyone close to the window channel that runs throughout the entirety of the city. And I realized that'd be difficult because of the length of the channel through the city. Right. But, but a lot of the residents along the channel share a lot of the same. So maybe limit the amount of districts that it goes through. Yeah. Uh, it, you know, it runs the entire length. So, and kind of through the Northern part. So it would be complicated, but a lot of those folks share a lot of the similar interests. Got it. So, and then the avenues association or the avenues definitely, but that have to be carefully, might carefully negotiated with student areas as well. Uh, Warner might be a good place to look at some of the vision there, but not saying, you know, you can look at that as you see fit. So I think it's going to be difficult once you get into the avenues and where it gets a little challenging in that area is the density as well. Right. So certain block will make the population. Jump more. So then say more less dense areas towards the North and Eastern parts of the city. Yeah. All right. Um, okay. Further thoughts. We want to go from there. So is it a lot of work to have you turn all of these maps into that, um, mapping so we can see all of them in that way and then do the overlay. So what I'll do is, um, create like, um, um, once I get the, um, clerk, um, I put it all on one map and then do we do an overlay so we can overlay it onto various maps. And then what I can do is if I can log in here, it can do demonstration on, um, ArcGIS right here. Um, or, or even via, you know, if I'm via zoom through the, um, screen share. I think what I was referring to is, uh, we have the 10 submissions of maps. Can we turn those 10 maps into not PDFs, but maps that we can actually, get down so I can see what streets, because sometimes it looks like it's a really quick, but it's actually not, or it's not going down a street. It looks like it's going down a street and it's not, it's going through three streets in a PDF. So can you turn that into that mapping? We can see what we can do on that one, right? Or if not, we can do the plan book that has each individual district. Okay. All right. Thank you. Anything further on the side? All right. Thank you very much. So, and at this point we'll take a quick recess and, uh, readjourn in a few minutes. Okay. So, I think we're good. Okay. So, uh, I think we're good. Okay. Okay. So we can resume item 5.1, internal affairs committee recommendation, commerce court extension. Vice Mayor Casey Reynolds. Oh, I forgot this was me. Um, so we had a pretty robust conversation in internal affairs about commerce court, the court and the extension of it and the need for ingress, egress, all that kind of good stuff. And so I will turn it over to Lianne and she can update the council on what we talked about. I will. and why we're here today. I have a couple of, well, first, good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Council members. Leanne Sutton, Director of Public Works Engineering. This is the first time I've had the opportunity to be in here in the Council Chamber since I started, so good evening to everybody. So I'm just getting familiar with how everything's laid out in the format and everything. I'm gonna pull up a couple maps and I'll give you some background information. So this is a project to connect Commerce Court with Westfield Lane. Westfield Lane has been an alley, and the idea of connecting these two roads in the Myers and North Industrial Area has been around since at least 2008 or before. In the 2008 Southwest Chico Neighborhood Improvement Plan, that was included in that plan. And then it was also identified in the general plan and then in 2007, sorry, 2011, the city purchased a portion of Westfield Lane, the alley, to make it a road in preparation for a future secondary access. And the reason why we've been able to connect these roads is because, as you can see on this map up here, in the Myers and North Industrial Area, there's only one way in and out of that area for any business in that area, and there's about 120. There's only 25 of them. So if you're along Myers and Ivy, you can't go to Commerce Court and get back out to Park Avenue, and vice versa, if you're coming down Park and you're going into Westfield Lane, it dead ends and you can't get to Commerce Court to go around Ivy to Myers to get back out. So because this is an industrial area and for safety reasons, I recommend connecting those two roads and continuing with the project that's been identified since 2008. It's approximately a $1.6 million project, which includes construction, right-of-way acquisition, design, and soft costs, such as project manager, project management and construction management. So in summary, this project will improve traffic circulation, improve safety and emergency response in the Myers Industrial Area, and if approved for budget consideration, we could bring back a supplement. So that's the first step. the project's supplemental appropriation, identifying the funding for this project. And that concludes my presentation. All right, questions from Council? All right, thank you. Madam Clerk, how many speakers? We have four speakers. All right, three minutes. So the first speaker is Barry Jones, followed by Matt Galloway. Good evening, Council. I'm Barry Jones, and I have a business on Myers Street and Ivy, I am that corner. A little history about that place. We built that in 1984, and actually we've been down there so long, our address didn't even change. So I've seen a lot of things happen down there. We built that with the opportunity that we were told that Otterson Bridge was going to go through, over Eggersfield. So when you guys might not know what Eggerslew is, Eggerslew is Command Jig Creek. So there's a lot of history there. So that's why that road is so wide. And even at that point, it's been a very unsafe road just because it was supposed to be two lanes, and they got a lot of speed going on down there. So it's kind of a problem. So we kind of dealt with it, and as time went on and more businesses came down there, you saw more and more problems, and we started seeing the need of, there's a need in other way out of here. And then when the campfire hit, a lot of us businesses kind of got together and, man, what if something happened? What if? And what if? And then there was a pallet fire across the street on Park Avenue. What if we got blocked off? How are we going to get out of there? What if we had a heart attack? And I have employed 75 people there, probably one of the larger people in the area, and I got concerned. I know we need another way out of there for safety. I really wish you guys would really look at the safety issues down there more than just that exit. I'd like to have an address of no parking on the southern side of the Meyer Street and Ivy Street corner. Just paint it out and post the signs. You can't see them. And I do support another exit out of that industrial park. We have been in need for that for many, many years, and I see no other way than doing that right now to get out of there. So I thank you for your time. I hope you please consider taking care of the businesses down there. Thank you. Matt Galloway, followed by Richard Bilson. Good evening, Council. Thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to voice my support for this connection. Barry and I have both been in this region for a long time. We purchased the property on the corner of Park and Myers in 2005. And on occasion, we will see some very serious connectivity. And traffic impacts in that area. Whenever there's a power outage, Barry mentioned a pallet fire that was in there. Closed down that entire intersection. And literally, it is the only way out for 125 businesses back in that area. And in the interest of good planning, we wouldn't do that on a new project in any residential neighborhood. There's limitations to how far we can go with cul-de-sacs and how many different residences or businesses can be served. So we just really need to kind of follow through with the commitment. To have that connection. To bring some safety back to the back people. And also to bring some relief to those of us up on the front. Who see a lot of traffic and a lot of impact from all those businesses being served off that roadway. Thank you. Thank you, Matt. Richard Bilson, followed by Ruth Sarnoff. Good evening, Richard Bilson. We've been back on Commerce Court. Owned two buildings there for about 22 years. And I was... The first more opposed to the idea of that going through. Because we like the quiet neighborhood. The street. More security. As the end of the cul-de-sac brings. But I see the need. And I wish the money was going toward more fixing other roads in Chico. We had a conversation when we did the internal affairs Zoom thing. And there's some common interest on some of the streets we all know about. But I wish that money. Money was going toward fixing other streets. But I see the need. So I'm not so much opposed to it anymore. Thank you. And our last speaker is Ruth Sarnoff. Thank you. The thing that gets me about... Dispersion. On ourよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく for about three stories in some areas. And it's not unlike the situation here at the ice rink where a lot of work that's going on there is basically never really explained. And people have been calling for taking those fences down and letting people use the park. Now, right now, there is absolutely no place in the public for anybody to go to the bathroom. So even people that are not homeless or are not facing stress... Point of order. We're talking about the extension of Comanche. It is... Ms. Narnoff, if you'd just keep your comments relative to the road. That would be great. Or related. We just had a point of order. We just had a point of order about your comments. So if you can just keep them relative to the subject, that would be ideal. Okay. We'll stay with the conceptual design to the Internal Affairs Committee. The Internal Affairs Committee is part of the Internal Affairs... How much of this has been really... It's a question. And you obviously aren't going to answer it now. But how much of this do people really know that are on the council now? How many details? Do you ever take this, the council ever go out and just look at some of these projects and see what in reality they are? We don't have any water. We're still in a drought. And I have documentation for... I have a big, thick book of weather maps. And you all ought to learn how to read a weather map. And you would know... that most of the country is in a deep freeze right now. All over the country. Every major city. And when the heat comes soon, it's going to be flooding. And then it's going to be something else. We're in climate change now. If you don't want to talk about climate change, it's okay with me. But you could talk about the ramifications of flooding and that kind of thing. Thank you. That is it for our speakers. All right. Thank you to all our speakers. Will the council? Discussion? So I don't know if this is possible. But I would love to see this happen and love to see it go through. However, I also know that this is not a budgeted item. So can we make a motion and move this forward as yes, and then have a motion? And then have it re-looked at during budget season as to whether it comes on this year or next year, or however that looks? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds, one of the things that we've just kicked off this week are our budget meetings with each of the departments. And honestly, today, we actually sat down with Leigh Ann and her team and we're looking at the CIP and we're looking at those capital projects that are pressing ahead. So if the council gives me an affirmative wink and a nod, saying, yeah, we want this one to be a part of that, I'll do consideration. Thank you. And if the council does not approve of that, then we will get it within that conversation discussion and bring it back during the budget process if that's the council's liking. The other two options are saying yes, and we come back with a supplemental appropriation, which goes outside of the budget process. Or the other answer is no, and we know that it's not an important item at this point in time just to keep it in the queue. So thank you. Mr. Arum, can I ask a quick question? Didn't we at a last meeting, a very recent meeting, put funding into a specific congestion fund related to this area of town? There's... Reallocation of funding or... Yeah, the reallocation of funding is for traffic flow in the area of Park Avenue and the Otterson and that area there. Okay. So it's a little bit off of that, but yes, we did. Okay, just checking. Yeah. Well, I'd make that a motion then to move it forward and to look at it at budget season and see if it's appropriate for now or later. I'll second that. All right. We have a motion from Vice Mayor Reynolds, a second from Councilmember O'Brien. Councilmember Bennett? Yes. Councilmember Brown? Sure. Councilmember Morgan? Yes. Councilmember O'Brien? Yes. Councilmember Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Aye. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Item 5.2, authorization to sign a letter of support for AB 2020. Mr. Arum. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Council. You'll recall this issue coming back and forth between the Council for quite some time now. And really, it was stemmed when Mayor Coolidge back in December of 2020 had asked for information surrounding Butte County Behavioral Health, what they do, how they do it. It then went back and forth over a period of time. In January of 2020, 2021, it was discussed, November of 2021, and then finally in December of this past year, the City Council authorized the Mayor to sign a letter seeking our elected officials, Senator Nielsen, Senator Gallagher, and Governor Newsom, in an attempt to find ways to help mitigate the impacts of the overwhelming level of burden that's being placed on local governments as it relates to managing through the issues that we're witnessing on our streets. And so one of the things that we've been talking to here recently is, and I've mentioned it in one of my city manager reports recently, is the amazing turnover of the city's mayor's office. And it's been a turnaround that we saw from Assemblyman Gallagher's office. To get something together, to get people together, the mayor and the vice mayor have been a part of those conversations as well, and it's been amazing to see this come to fruition so quickly with a proposed bill with one aspect. And as you'll see before you, there is a draft letter to authorize the mayor to send a letter in support of AB 2020. Basically, what this would do is it would amend state law, modifying the definition of gravely disabled, which is used to evaluate the need to establish a law that would be able to establish a Lantern and Pietras Shore LPS Act conservatorship. This would remedy a statewide issue that all jurisdictions are dealing with right now in staff's opinion. And I will tell you that without the ardent input and support from our own local Butte County behavioral health leadership, Scott Cannelli is here tonight to show where that leadership continues to stand behind these types of initiatives to find ways of mitigating the impacts, this wouldn't have come to fruition as quickly as it did either. So thank you, Scott, for your time. Thank you, Dr. I appreciate your continued due diligence on this front. I will say that there is continuing discussion as it relates to potential amendments to this, and two of those I think would lend an effort to garnering more support statewide for a bill of this nature. One of those potentially that we're talking about is amending the bill to enable it to be an opt-in type of situation. Some counties may be experiencing these scenarios that it's working just fine. I haven't found any counties that are saying that, but it may be that. So if we can lend credence to allowing them to have an opt-in provision, that might be something. So that's one of the potential amendments they're talking about. Another one is to ensure that there's funding behind this legislation. And so that's a key element to ensuring that we have counties across the state that would say, look, you know, it's wonderful to change the law, but if we don't have funding to actually institute these measures, we're at a loss still. And so I want to commend our partners at Butte County Behavioral Health for helping to conceive some of those ideas to help. And I want to commend our partners at Butte County Behavioral Health for helping to help coalesce a larger group to see if this legislation can get through. With that, that's my report. In the meantime, you have that attached draft letter. And as it currently stands, and staff seeking approval from council to have the mayor sign that letter and send it off. All right. Do we have any speakers on the side? Can I ask a quick question before we go? Absolutely. Mr. Orme, I believe you when you say you haven't found a county who's not. Have you been consulting with counties that are dealing with a similar issue? Do you feel that there is a level of support and engagement from counties throughout California to address this? I have not personally, but I believe that if you would like to ask that question of our behavioral health expert, he may have an answer for you on that one. I'd be happy to ask that question of Director Kennelly. Mr. Kennelly, if you come forward, we'd appreciate it. Good evening, Mayor, members of the city council, Scott Kennelly, Director for Behavioral Health. I'm here to answer any questions you have about this. And I think you asked what the temperature or the pulse is from other counties. I'll be honest, it's mixed. There are advocates on all different sides. The LPS redefinition of rape disability has come up before in many bills and has been squashed or has not passed, partly because people believe that it's potentially going to take away people's rights. If you go back to the 60s and the presentation I did before, that was the case. People were locked up against their will. They were hospitalized and there were a lot of injustices done. And many people believe that if you want to talk about both sides, that housing first is the more important issue. That if you offer housing to every mentally ill person, that you're going to scoop up multiple people who are going to be successful and no longer be housed or no longer be homeless. The reality is if you don't put treatment in concert with housing, people fail in housing. And in Butte County, we've seen it over and over again. We've seen it happen. We've seen it happen in our community where our clients or people we brought off the streets who aren't quite stable and we get into housing because we're trying to get them off the streets, blow out of those housing places and the landlords say, enough. I don't want anything to do with behavioral health. Furthering the issues of NIMBY where people don't want any behavioral health facilities or any new housing projects. So my organization has members in it, directors that are very supportive of this and others that are not so supportive and say, we don't want this to just be your silver bullet. We want the state to be a part of it. We want to fully fund mental health services that they have not funded despite the fact that the population has grown by one third since realignment came out and also offer housing. I'm taking a different stance which says you're never going to have enough housing in Butte County in time to say that people are dying every single year because they are untreated and they're psychotic and they're manic and they're doing things to themselves or to others and they're getting shot or getting in situations where they are found dead in dumpsters. So for me, this is not a silver bullet. It's one tool. It's a tool in many tools that we're pursuing. Behavioral health is also pursuing significant number of grants for housing and we are looking now and shifting from funding master leases and working with landlords to becoming actual landlords ourselves because we recognize that there's a lot of stigma about this population and we do it well when we have contract providers managing facilities or apartment complexes. So we're doing housing acquisition. We're trying to reform the grave disability law. Our village is coming online. We're also doing the rest project which is that intensive homeless team I talked to you about. So we're tackling it on many levels. Absolutely recognizing housing is critical and you've heard critics about that but also the fact that every day you can go downtown Chico and see someone who is psychotic, who is doing things that are not making sense and sometimes wandering into traffic. This bill would qualify probably 10 to 15 people in this county over 200,000 for this level of care. So it's not mass hospitalization of people. It's the ability for us to take someone off the street, try and get them into treatment, medicate them if we can and have them come out of that psychotic fog or that mania or come off the drugs they're on and then try to voluntarily get them into services. Not coerce them or force them. Of that 10 to 15 people that we are able to do that to, some of those people will still, despite our best efforts, refuse treatment and have no insight. It's called anosognosia into their illness. They don't have to go down the conservatorship route to try and assist them but that's a much smaller number, probably three or four of those people. So it is a mixed bag and as Mr. Orms said, allowing this to be an opt-in or opt-out feature gives counties who have the appetite for it the ability to say I want to try this. Other counties have been vocal, we don't have enough housing to house the people that you're not going to qualify for the service. Well, we have Everhart Village coming online with 15 to 20 homes that is exactly for this population to get them off the street and get them housed. Can I ask a couple more questions? For the good of the public, who would be making the termination of gravely disabled in this process? So currently gravely disabled or 5150 is typically written by law enforcement who we have close contact with and we do mobile crisis co-responses with or our behavioral health staff and a few staff that are in the Orville Hospital that are trained in writing and rescinding 5150s. You answered one of my questions which was, I think, the question was in your reading of this bill, does it heavily infringe on the rights of people? I think your comment about the amount of people that it would affect kind of speaks to that. The one other question that I have is, is the Board of Supervisors also signed on to support the bill? So the Board of Supervisors just voted and unanimously supported this. Law enforcement is supporting it. The public defender is supporting it. The head of Department of Social Services is supporting it. This is the first time we have an absolutely unified approach to this bill. government and city government potentially to move forward a bill that has repeatedly been failed to move forward. And for the advocates who say you just need more housing or you just need more peer mentors on the street working with these people, the last five years is exactly what we've been doing, providing housing, providing peer support, providing mobile crisis teams, and we still can't get that small subset to consent to treatment. Their brain has been hijacked. And in addition to that, you've heard about fentanyl and you've heard about the intensity of the street drugs that our clientele, or they're not our clients, the people that are taking, is causing dramatic neurological damage very quickly. It used to take years for methamphetamine or marijuana or things like that to get you to a psychotic place. It's now taking one to two doses. And so the longer these people are allowed to stay on the street and do this damage, the harder it is to ever remedy that or to fix that because sometimes you get to a place neurologically where you're past the point of no return. Mm-hmm. And so we want to keep you safe and secure in the community. We want to get those people before they get to that point of no return where the neurological damage is so bad. Yeah. Thank you for your candor. The last question. In the presentation that you'd previously made, you mentioned something about long-acting injectables as a part of the stabilization for folks who are experiencing psychotic symptoms. Would that be a part of this process if the law were to be redefined? So that would not. It was part of my list of recommendations to the state and the city. It was called the Reese hearing where when they are in the hospital, they can be assessed to be involuntarily medicated. Currently, the law has not changed around Reese hearings to allow for involuntary long-acting injectables. It only allows for an oral medication on a daily basis. So you're still going to have that struggle where there are potentially people who are going to get out sooner. But the definition of grave disability where they have the anosognosia, the lack of insight, and they have the untreated medical issues now added to the definition will allow us to have a little bit more ability to contain people who aren't necessarily ready to go out on the street. Because we have discharged people sometimes who still have untreated medical issues and we have no ability to remedy that. This will allow that piece to be addressed as well. Thank you. Appreciate it. All right. Further questions? I concur with that, Councilmember Morgan. I just want to commend you, Director Kennelly, Scott. This is a tough issue. I get it. I agree with you. And striking a balance between constitutional rights and the need to take care of those that cannot take care of themselves is a really tough one. So I commend you for looking at solutions. This does not fix everything. We know that. You admitted that. But it does help. And we need to find those things that help. So thank you. Thank you. And just to remind people, behavioral health primarily is voluntary. There's a very small piece of what we do that is involuntary. And people in the community sometimes think this is us just taking everyone's rights and we want to lock everyone away. Our primary goal is to provide treatment in a voluntary manner. And if we can get you into housing as well, we're going to do it. But this is just a small piece and one of the tools that we want to add to our belt. Other questions? I'd just like to say thank you, Director Kennell. Thank you. We really appreciate your candor and forwardness here and coming forward to Chico and doing this as often as you have. It's much appreciated. And I want to just end by saying thank you. City Council, I think the efforts and the work you're doing with the county has been commendable. In the 22 years I've been here, I've never seen this level of collaboration. So I appreciate it. Thank you. All right. Any other questions for staff? All right. Speakers? Okay. We have three. Nicole Nava followed by Katie Posey. Good evening. You know I'm a fan of this. I 100% support you guys doing this for ABE 2020. And I would like to add my thanks to Director Kennelly's. But I want to mindfully say thank you to the Director as well because I think that was all very valuable information he just gave. I hope the citizens all watch that back and get an understanding and supportive and understand that behavioral health is a great entity and trying their best in very trying circumstances. I also want to thank the City Council for their support. I also want to extend my thanks to all of you for being willing to put this on an agenda. I think you are all to be commended for partnering with the county in having these conversations and kind of working in tandem to get important work like this done. So, you know, these people really, really need help. And it just breaks my heart. I have family members that have been in these situations. And I cannot tell you the grief it has caused the family. I know that they are trying to get people seen, trying to get them be willing to go to the doctor and then only to have them finally agree and have appointments maybe be months out and not be able to be there because you don't have maybe the proper regulations in place to support their specific needs or whatever. This will help button some of that up. I am well aware that this is only a small piece of a larger puzzle. I also had a different family member, very dear to me, who worked down in the Sonoma Hospital when all of the other families were there. And I know that we are not in those days. We are not in those days. Citizens are very plugged in. We have alms buds like crazy and other oversight that I really hope to see us move to a more robust approach to mental health services. But again, I think we all need to just kick the can down the road in the right direction. And also together. And so thank you guys so much for these past couple of efforts that you have been doing with the county where you are being supported and supported by the county. And I know that you are being mindful about this. What I would love to say and close with is I think it would be fantastic if you could then look at something else that's an important item. Where is something where you and the county Board of Supervisors can find something like this again to kind of nudge at the state where you do need support. You do need some funding to do some things that maybe there's not a greater willingness to do unless they hear from all of the municipalities together. Together you guys are strong. So that makes sense. Thank you. And I think that the more network across county lines you can do, the better. And use those entities that you have, please. I look forward to seeing this go through with full support. Thank you. Katie Posey followed by Ruth Sarnoff. Hi, everyone. I just wanted to echo those sentiments and again say thank you to everyone that's been working on this. And you may know the bill was introduced on February 14th. And I have here what the Board of Supervisors has been working on. On our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our list and our I think in December about recognizing that the number of mentally ill people in the criminal justice system had increased and that this hopefully is going to mitigate that because that is a tragedy. So thanks to everybody just echoing those sentiments that we've just spoken and thank you. And I hope also other counties and cities do get on board with this as well. Thank you. Our last speaker is Ruth Sarnoff. This is Sarnoff. Would you be more comfortable if we brought a microphone to you? Would you be more comfortable if you sat and we brought a microphone? I like to look in your faces. Okay. No worries. It's the first time I've been able to see you. You've always been dark for so long. And now I see you. If I see you out in the community, I can say, hello. Hello, so-and-so. Hello, so-and-so. All right. That's great. Anyway, so I'm fine. What I wanted to say was that the changing of amending state law is a serious thing, number one. Number two, the whole, I don't know about the Lanterman-Petra Short Act, but the act of conservation, conservatorship, but is that something that's mandatory for people that are having difficulty on their own? And, you know, after I've been to things in Sacramento before, and I know over on N Street where many good bills get kind of whittled away until the purpose of it is all lost, I am very skeptical that things are being rushed right now. The refusal to even mention the word water availability for all these projects that you're approving all the time. I mean, you can't get water on the agenda. You can't get supply line on the agenda. You can't get so many things can't get agendized. And it's just very frustrating. I have documents that will show. And I have them, well, they're right over here. Some are here and some are in here. Now, this is based upon weather maps. And if you could learn how to read a weather map and you stitch it together, you can get a lot of information. You will find that we have been in extreme weather globally for about at least two and a half, three years. Point of order. Before that. So these are documents. Ms. Sarnoff, if you could just keep your comments relative to the subject. We'd appreciate that. Yes, please. And so as of now, I also have another kind of document. And I'm going to be using this document through articles. This is through weather maps. This is through articles about what's going on on the planet. And so it's my desire to move a lot of documents that I have out because I'm almost 90. And I can't, I might not live forever, which would probably make you unhappy, Army. Mark would probably say, ooh, she died. But anyway. I'm going to keep this. But whatever. You are gone. My time's up. We will miss you. We love you, Ruth. All right. We have no other speakers. Okay. Thank you. All right. Well, the council, any further discussion or questions? If we don't, I'll make a motion. Second. So the motion is to have us, City Council authorized Mayor Coolidge to sign the attached letter of support in support of this bill. AB 2020. All right. We have a motion. We have a second. Council Member Bennett. Yes. Council Member Brown. Aye. Council Member Morgan. Yes. Council Member O'Brien. Yes. Council Member Tandon. Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds. Aye. Mayor Coolidge. Aye. Carries 7-0. All right. Thank you. We'll move on to item 5.3, specific planning areas, consideration of possible action. Ms. Prussell. Thank you, Mayor Coolidge and council. This item is before you because after doing an audit of our agenda planning calendar, it came to our attention that we dropped an item that was brought forward on December 8th by Council Member Morgan. And it was specifically for the planning of the new planning plan. And it was specifically for reconsideration of a prior vote that was that had taken place in at the last meeting in November of 2020. And so it was regarding the specific planning areas. It was a motion, I believe, by Council Member Orr. Seconded by Council Member Huber. And Council Member Morgan voted in the majority on that item. So he had the right to bring it back. And council actually voted to bring back his reconsideration. It just got dropped off. So at this time, it has been it's past that year where actually any council member could actually bring it up. But I wanted to bring it to the council's attention. I wanted to own that in addressing it and allow the council to provide staff with any direction. I know that Mike Sully is here from planning and he can speak to the specific plans. And I'll just turn it over to the council to see what you would like to do with that. But it was authorized by the council to be agendized. And it was a 6-1 vote, I believe. And it didn't get placed on the planning calendar. Thanks for your honesty around that. Just for the purpose of process, don't we have to have a motion made to reconsider now that it's the request has been made and it's back at council level? Well, actually, it would have. If it had been. If it had been during that first year. So the council's AP and P10 outlines reconsideration of an item. And during the first year of any decision, anyone on the majority side can bring back an item for reconsideration of vote. Since it's past that year, and we can ask the city attorney to weigh in on it, but to me, any council member could actually bring this item back because it's past that one year as set forth in our approval. And that's a policy. Yeah. I think the point of clarification for me is I voted yes to hear the conversation that council member Morgan brought up to reconsider his vote about a specific item out of courtesy. Right. You're very welcome. It seems to be out of order to bring an item back that hadn't been approved specifically by council. The request for reconsideration was voted on by council 6-1. The item was not approved. And the motion to bring back the item itself has not been voted on by council to be brought back. Well, it was voted 6-1 to bring back the discussion and reconsideration of his vote. Correct. And I'm letting you know that this is the first time that we've ever had an item like this ever drop off the planning calendar. So I do apologize for the confusion. However, I wanted to rectify it and bring it back because it was something that was requested by council member Morgan. It was voted on to agendize. it got dropped. And so it's up to the council what you might want to do with that at this point and the discussion, and perhaps the city attorney can weigh in. Mr. Morgan? I couldn't tell if you were. Yeah, so it's at this point with a year having elapsed, it's up to the council as to what it wants to do. Yeah. So I have two comments. The point of my reconsideration, because I voted in favor for a reason, was to end the delay of special planning areas, of which I don't know that we've had any come forward anyway. In finance committee, we talked about how the coffers of the city are being largely driven by development because we're trying to do so much. Scott Canale talked about housing. We're trying to do all these things. So special planning areas could be good, but so we don't have to split hairs. We could deal with this tonight. And turn it over in the delay of special planning areas. I would like to hear from Mike Sala if he has anything to say. But if we think that we're playing loosey-goosey with the rules, I could also make this a council member request at the end of the night, and then we don't have to worry about it at all as far as the rules go. Well, it is on the agenda, so you could, under this one, make a motion to agendize it for full discussion. But I don't know if you want to hear from Mr. Sala first. The time to... Then the time to hear from Mr. Sala would be when we have the discussion. Yeah. Okay. That keeps it really clean. Fair? Okay. Do we... I'm not running the meeting. Sorry. I will make the motion to bring it back for full discussion, but there may or may not be speakers. Oh, I'll second that. Well, you can't make it yet because we have to listen to the speakers, but it sounds like... And Mr. Ewing, would you concur that that's... We could just do it under this item and we wouldn't have to do it under it. Council member request. We can just bring it back next time for discussion. I do. Yep. All right. All right. Speakers? We have three. Jared is our first speaker, followed by Alexander Smith. All right. Good evening, council, staff, and everyone. I recall when this was approved back in 2020, I thought it was a really sensible decision. The housing element, correct me if I'm wrong, planners, but I think it was approved in 2011. So it's pretty old. I'm sure as all of you are well aware, we've had significant changes in our housing stock in this county and in this area since 2011. So these SPA special planning areas are the potential to increase the housing stock significantly. And so I have concerns of developing the housing stock. I have concerns of developing the housing stock. I have concerns of developing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing housing And it really just makes a lot of sense to wait for that to be finalized. I think in a couple months, it's really, it's coming up soon. I think I heard April 19th was, I don't know the dates, but it seems like it's really an odd time to bring this back and an odd decision to overturn. Just because it makes so much sense given the huge changes in housing in our area in the last decade. Okay. So, yep. Housing decisions have a lasting impact. And if these special planning areas are developed based on outdated plans, then the housing is less likely to meet the needs of our community. And yeah. And so I urge you to not overturn that decision and to let that decision stand and wait for the housing element to be updated. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Alexander Smith, followed by Ruth Sarnoff. Hello, Council. As my friend over here, Jared Geiser, recently said, this whole decision seems a bit out of the blue. In fact, it seems rushed, so rushed that in the title of the agenda item, it says specific planning areas instead of special planning areas. And honestly, it does seem a little bit... like this is a little bit encouraged by some sort of development called Valley's Edge. Valley's Edge being a luxury housing development for those coming from areas in the Bay Area who have decentralized from their technological jobs in order to come and buy a nice cheap home in the Chico area. That is not affordable housing. In fact, it is mandated by the state of California that they plan a specific amount of affordable housing. But obviously, it seems like affordable housing is the direct need in this neighborhood. And in fact, for our demographic and what this man over here said on a recent radio show on KZFR, I would highly suggest you listen. We have plenty of housing for those with incomes that are over six figures. We do not have adequate housing for those who have or are living at the poverty line, which are many of the residents. That live here today. So I would highly suggest that you not consider this agenda item and table it until further discussion. Thank you. Thank you. Ruth Sarnoff.! You know, there is a lot that people learn just in the day-to-day things that happen to them. So that like on Monday, you know one thing and on Wednesday, you know something new that you didn't know on Monday. Pretty soon, it kind of... Builds up until you have kind of like a whole wardrobe of ideas. And you have a wardrobe of clippings and articles and data. So I want to say to you today that I want to describe one place which is probably pretty well known to everybody in here. And that's the Englewood oil field. Okay. And that's Blair Hills. And that is a place where there's three stories underneath the ground. Where people crawl in and work under the ground. So a lot of the things that look like... You see them from the surface. A township is 36 square miles. It's six by six. They're all over. They've been here since the British rule. Okay. And that was the way it went. It was called, you know, whatever. It was like the straight lines and it was 36 square miles. It's a flat surface area planning. But underneath that, there's all kinds of stuff going on. And Englewood oil... Ms. Sarnath, if you could keep your comments relative to the... I'm getting to the point. The planning areas, we appreciate that. I'm getting to the point. I know that whole... I know, but we need to keep you on the subject. You can separate it into little pieces. You can hide it from the public. You can hide it forever. But if you put it together like in a coordinated thing and you really research it and you have all the facts there and you present them, it's a whole other thing. And you do this over and over and over again. Stay on the topic. Okay. Let me try to stay on the topic. I was talking on the Englewood oil field. Okay. That's the same as Blair Hills Community. It's a primarily black kind of middle class community. People bought homes on that property. Now, today, it's all the way three stories down. And they wrap their tools in whatever because they get vibration all the time in Blair Hills. And we have a lot of places like that. And we have a lot of places that are just like it. Thank you. Ruth is our last speaker on this item. All right. Thank you. All right. Council discussion or action? So, I'll make a motion to agendize a discussion to end the delay of special planning areas. I will now second that appropriately. Thank you, sir. All right. We have a first and a second. We have a motion and a second. Take the roll. Okay. So, we have a motion to approve the second item. Just a moment. Council Member Bennett? Yes. Council Member Brown? No. Council Member Morgan? Yes. Council Member O'Brien? Yes. Council Member Tandon? Yes. Vice Mayor Reynolds? Yes to the conversation. Mayor Coolidge? Aye. Carries 6-1. All right. Item 5.4, no items posted after the...no items added after the posting of the agenda. Item 6 reports to the board that the City Council has approved the second item of the agenda. Reports and communications. The following reports and communication items are provided for the Council's information. No action can be taken on items under this section unless the Council agrees to include it on a subsequent agenda. City Manager's report, item 6.1. Mr. O'Rourke? Yes. Honorable Mayor, members of the Council, I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to share a couple of things that we've had questions about over the past number of days. One of those is the ice skating rink, and you even heard a comment earlier today about that. And engineering staff did finalize the data surrounding the ice skating rink within the past week. And so I was able to get a copy of that, and I will tell you that it was an overall success. And the duration of the event, as many will recall, went from November 19th through January 30th, 2022, this year, wrapped it up. There were approximately 20,000 paying guests, which is incredible. And there were also four...there was about 20% of people that ended up showing up there that were free skaters that were four years old and younger. So there were a lot of youth that were using that. And the estimate is somewhere around 45,000 viewing visitors, 45,000 extra people downtown just to see the other people skating. I was one of those that were skating. So it's really great data. I will tell you that the bottom line numbers with regard to the operational expenses were $376,386.06. The total revenues and sponsorships were $340,000. That's $47,394.12, about $28,000 short. However, as you very well know, the City Council did give $300,000 as a kicker for this to get it going. And all of that will be paid back to the general fund. You have all of the figures that we got for our revenues and sponsorships. And then the data that we don't have yet, which I am expectant to share with the City Council, is the sales tax generation that was additionally brought in. And that's something that we will talk about throughout this scenario. And when you add in that around 45,000 downtown visitors, the increase was likely significant. I look forward to seeing that sales tax data. In addition to that, outside of the general fund, I'm going to skip over outside of the general fund, parking revenues were up between 5 to 10 percent somewhere in there. That's a separate account. That's not general funds. So I'm not going to include that in revenues towards this. That was another large increase for the downtown, which I think shows evidence of the fact that the sales tax probably was a little bit higher. It probably went up because of the meter. And that was based upon 2019 parking, not COVID-19 2020 parking. So we're being fair across the board. So overall, a great success. I know that people have been champing at the bit to hear about that. And so I just want to share that with you. And I feel like I should share as well. There were five instances throughout this whole occasion where, and I'll just tell you, in December alone, there was 20 percent. More rain than average the average month of December this past December, which was really interesting. There was also a time in January where there was heavy rain, which basically took out another weekend. Staff anticipates that that would have drawn at least another 25 to 30 thousand dollars and 35,000 in anticipated revenues because a lot of it was over the Christmas week, unfortunately, when a lot of folks are out. So I want to give you that holistic and that overarching perspective on that scenario. And hopefully that helps you out. And it looks like I may have a couple more minutes. I'll ask a question before I move to my next item. Yeah. Thank you so much for the report on that. Obviously, one of the issues in implementing the ice rink for folks was public access to public spaces. We all know that the fence around City Plaza is still in place. Obviously, Council has been advised of some of the reasons behind that. Would you be willing, for the sake of transparency, to share with the public? Because I know that's a major concern for folks as well. Yeah. It's a concern of staff as well. We want to get it back open again and allow public access. Unfortunately, there are a few different facets to that. And I know Eric can speak better to it than I can, but let me give it a shot. The plaza had, it was overarchingly changed to facilitate the ice skating rink in conjunction with when it was brought down and taken down is exactly the same time when we're working on a pallet shelter site. So having to prioritize resources was one of the primary areas why it hasn't been done yet. But there's also other issues. One is there is a transition. There's a transformer issue over there. And I don't know the specifics of all that, but I know that staff is working with PG&E to get that remedied. And Eric, if you want to take it from there, go for it. Oh, just that PG&E switch gear was installed. Yeah, that's going to be energized on this Friday. Okay, great. And then there were also some bathroom-related issues. Yeah. Prior to opening the ice rink, there was pretty significant vandalism that took place to the City Plaza bathrooms to the point where it backed the sewer up through the entire plaza. So there's still some remnants of that that needs to be repaired, a significant amount of lighting issues. The interior of the plaza, landscape issues, irrigation issues. So part of that is truly a bandwidth scenario where in November, December, and partly into January we were in our leaf pickup season. So during that time we allocate all of our Public Works operations maintenance crews to leaf pickup. And so when that concludes, there's kind of a mad push to really catch up our other maintenance programs that have sustained neglect, if you will, for several months. So along with that and constructing the pallet shop. So we're working towards reallocating our resources to the plaza. We hope to have the restroom component open next week. A portion of the plaza will still remain fenced while we still complete some of those other maintenance-related repairs, take the Christmas tree lights down and so on and so forth. So that portion will remain fenced for probably another week after that and they'll be completely open. Thanks for the 10,000-foot view. This is like a concern I heard from only a couple of people on our team. I just want to assuage their fears. Nothing, the fountain is not being replaced or hasn't been completely removed as a feature in the downtown plaza, correct? Absolutely not. No, absolutely not. And speaking of the fountain too, there's still some work that needs to be done to the fountain. There's some jetting issues that we need to take care of that were issues prior to the ice rink being installed. And there are some pretty heavy sand work or dirt work, if you will, that took place. We had to put about 40 to 50 cubic yards of leveling sand on the plaza. To accommodate the ice rink. So that was removed just last week. So that was kind of a component that we knew. That was a large hurdle that we knew was going to take quite a bit of staffing and mechanical equipment to do. So it was kind of one of those items that we had to schedule accordingly. And once we got that completed last week, we'll be on to some of the smaller ancillary repairs and look forward to get it opening soon. Thanks for asking the question. I know a lot of people have been asking about that. And there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there. So thank you. And then the other item I wanted to make sure and hit on is a recent update that staffed brought to the Finance Committee. We had an update from our revenue consultant, Clifford Moss, as it relates to the sales tax. And I will tell you that in order to ensure that we can leverage our resources better, that sales tax may come in handy to give Eric some extra sets of hand to get some work done. But anyway, that's another point. But Clifford Moss gave an update to the Finance Committee. I will say that it was well received by the Finance Committee and that it allowed them to understand kind of these phases. We got three phases. The initial phase was in January that we've already gotten through. We met with Clifford Moss. We went through a lot of the ideas of where we need to go as it relates to educating the public. Phase two here we just wrapped up in February developing this timeframe of how things are going to roll out and now we're starting phase three starting here in March. It's March 1 already and so this is the implementation phase and Clifford Moss has worked with city staff to create and manage the production and materials for outreach efforts needed to engage and educate the community. You will see me out there a lot. My calendar is already filling up with engaging with a lot of different community groups to be able to share and get feedback. Really what this is going to be in the next two months is me listening. And that will enable me to come back to you as a City Council, go back to our consultants to give that input as well, to make sure that everything is fully aligned with what your vision is and hearing the community so you understand what they're saying as well. And I think it's a beautiful approach on how best to move this forward. May through July we'll have that continued public engagement and then there in July the Council will be able to look at that potential ballot language and hopefully give approval to getting that on the ballot for November. So really it's going to be about education and the first next two months is going to be about listening. So that's the latest update on that and your City Manager is going to be very busy in conjunction with the other things that we're working on right now. So with that, thank you very much and have a good night. Mayor Redekopoulos. Mark can I back up and ask one quick question about the ice rink. Absolutely. Can you just give, they do ice rinks all over. This is not the first one that they've done. Have they said how successful ours was compared to other cities where they've gone in for the first time? Yeah I haven't seen a comparative analysis but I will say that they thought it was extremely successful. That was the original feedback we got. I haven't taken a step back to see how it compared to others, especially during COVID. But one of the things that they already told us is that if the City does move forward with it again this year, because of all of the efforts that were undertaken this first round the cost will go down by $50,000 just to even do it so if you take even this year's I will I will be candid this year's was constrained by the fact that there was some controversy at the front end of it and so a number of sponsors that were willing to participate didn't so that's another element of reality to that I to be transparent I have to share but it'll be a part of the budget process as we evaluate that and knowing that this entity looks at it throughout the state and the prior conversations I had before this final these final numbers came out was that they thought that this was a very successful event and very appropriate for our city because of the special downtown we have great thank you so much you bet all right council member requests pursuant to AP and p 10 10 council members may verbally request an item to be agendized at a future meeting after stating you! what the item would be a majority of the council is needed in order to first staff to agendize council members may also submit requests in writing do we have any council members request? all right seeing none we'll move on to the monthly financial reports which are they're provided for information only and close session do we have any speakers on closed session yes we do we have two Nicole Nava followed by Jeff Creed andよろしくよろしくよろしく andよろしくよろしく andよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしくよろしく the judge signed off that we're still holding these things behind closed doors where we, the citizens, don't know what is being discussed. And as I had denoted earlier, it's distressing to me to have people be contracted to run the site, whether they're equipped to do so or not. We didn't get to see the proposals of anybody. We have not seen any contract. One did not exist about whatever the last, before the last meeting when I put the PRA in. And so that's distressing to me because we have no idea, like, what are the plans? What are the criteria for entry? What's the exit strategies? How are they going to run things and make sure that the residents respect one another and respect the staff and vice versa? How do we know what the staff are supposed to do and interrelate with them? I don't know. I don't understand any of that delay. Again, I'll harken back to the enforcement piece as well. It just seems like we keep hearing the platitudes of, you know, it was February. Now it's March. And before we're going to feel the impact in the city, lightning with all the encampments. And, you know, we're all getting out. We're antsy. It's spring. It was like I'm sitting on my porch. I'm seeing all the people bike and run. And that's super fantastic. But what I'm not seeing is the amount of people I used to see because people are circumventing the areas where encampments are where they used to feel safe and go. And they used to take their kids and explore back in there to find little things. And now they just don't feel comfortable doing that. And I feel like it's time that we all get to hear what the plan is. And things like that are have you worked on the template for the forms where you're going to notice the homeless individuals? Can you precede it with legal services information and all the other little things so that you're ready to go on day one? Maybe you're doing that. But we don't know. So these are some of those things. Like maybe you just come out and you make a statement like here's how we're going to be ready to go on day one. This is what we've accomplished. Here's what we're seating with our police department, with our fire department, with our behavioral health partners, and all the rest. There are elements that it feels like you could be sharing with this community so we can get our faith restored, that you do have our best interests at heart. And that includes all the residents, those who will be cared for at the site as well. We already know that they don't have to be compelled to work on their treatment. So it's part of that plan to really embrace what is voluntary for signing up that they can do to be a part of that community. Thank you. And Jeff Creed is our last speaker. Let me just apologize. Mental note, always speak in front of Nicole because she steals everything you want to say. A lot more eloquently and a lot more intelligently. But I had the same question. I saw that on the agenda. It's like, what are you still talking about behind closed session? And when I talked about cowardice earlier, you know, why wasn't the proposal put out there, hey, we're looking for contractors and this is what they need to be doing. I forgot what that's called, RFP or something. I don't remember. But, you know, as a city, you're putting out a request for a contract. Why wasn't that public? And why wasn't it advertised? And was it public? Maybe I just missed it. I don't know. There are things I don't know. As Mr. Morgan likes to reiterate. But I didn't see that. And you're talking about a sales tax. I stood up here a little over two years ago when we had the whole shelter crisis thing. And I just kind of laughed and said, you know what, you're never going to get a sales tax because you voted for this. And look what they spent the money on, that HUD money. Okay. And why would anybody ever trust you with more money? And so when I talk about cowardice, it's things like this. If you want people to trust you, you have to be courageous and you have to step up and say, this is what we're doing. And you can dislike it all you want, but this is what we're doing. But when you try to hide these things and then you pop it on people and you try to say, oh, well, that can be renegotiated. Well, yeah, people can live on Mars too, but it's not very realistic. And tell me what you think. Telling me that a contract can be renegotiated after it's been signed by the judge is pretty insulting. Right? And I don't think, you know, a lot of you or some of you get that, that it's insulting to be talked down to like that. You know, people spend time to do their research as much as they can and you hide as much as you can. And if you want to be trusted and you want to be leaders, you have to step forward and stop. You know, moving on to 7.3, the negotiations for employees. You know, I've been talking to city employees for years and some say I haven't gotten a raise here. Some say I haven't gotten a raise there. I can look at management pretty easily online and see their raises. So I just hope you're as fair all the way down the line as you have been at the, or previous councils have been at the top end. Because there are some city employees that I'll be flat out honest, there's one or two that need to go. But most of them are great employees and the city doesn't deserve their service. So do what you can to keep the great ones. Thank you. He's our last speaker. All right. Thank you. And closed session. Council will recess in the closed session in conference room one. And after that, council will adjourn to be adjourned. Council meeting on March 15th at 6 p.m. in the council chambers. Thank you so much. Yes. Ten minutes. Thank you.
