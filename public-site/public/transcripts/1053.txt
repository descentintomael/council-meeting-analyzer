Mr.  Ewing, do you have anything to add to that or are we good?  I think we're good. All right. I'll assume we're good. I'm not sure he's. No, he's on. I'm not sure he's on mute or not. Anyway, we will move forward. Note on public participation. Due to the recent. Universal masking indoors. Man. Universal masking indoors mandate issued by the California department of public health. And to protect the health of its citizens. The council. Is meeting virtually. On zoom. And the public is invited to participate in council meeting,  council meeting using information found on the city's agenda as noted on the city's website the  public was also encouraged to submit written comments via engaged chico which all the council  members should have now anyone wishing to speak on an item should raise their hand in the zoom  application when discussion occurs and the speakers will be taken in the order received  so once we begin discussion on a particular item if you can raise your hand at that time and then  when we reach the discussion period we'll call on you in the order that you raised your hand  if you're on the phone you may press star 9 to raise your hand when you're asked  and hit star 6 to unmute yourself  all right and moving on to the consent agenda all the matters listed on the consent agenda  are to consider routine and acted in by one motion and do we have any speakers on this item  we do not  okay and then do we have any council disqualifications or no votes  okay hearing none um we'll move forward with a motion  second all right we have a motion by council member o'brien a second by vice mayor reynolds  madam clerk you can take the role okay council member ben  yes council member brown hi council member morgan  yet council member o'brien yes council member tandon yes vice mayor reynolds  yes mayor coolidge hi carry seven zero all right uh this time we'll move on to business  from the floor members of the public may address the council at any time uh on at this time on any  matter not already listed on the agenda with comments being limited to three minutes or as  determined based on the numbers of number of speakers that we have the council cannot take  any action at this meeting on requests made under this section of the agenda  and if you want to speak on business from the floor if you could please raise your hand at this  time okay so they're starting to come in would you like me to go ahead and start calling them in  order yes please okay our first speaker is nicole nava and stina will time her and um  cena will also assist with unmuting okay and we have the uh screen again correct yes okay perfect  all right thank you  so nicole are you there  okay can you hear me okay  yes okay hello council so i wanted to speak with you to basically highlight again concerns i have  about the situation we have out in our streets with the numerous encampments  that are also in our parks i do understand that you are not allowed to move tents and the humans  that occupy those tents but what i do not understand is why the community seems to have to  put up with the vast amounts of litter and trash that are all around the encampments and all  throughout the parks even kind of away from the encampments and some of the other areas  downtown around chambers etc and it does appear that none of our local ordinances such as the  no smoking in those spaces no glass containers in those spaces  and numerously  other things I could say even doing drugs publicly right there seems to be okay and I know that I  won't get an answer but I will ask the question anyway as to why it seems we are taking a broad  interpretation of an enforcement by the judge only on an injunction that nowhere can I find in that  injunction nor in Martin v Boise any language that would preclude you working with our chief  of police city manager public works and parks department from addressing all the devastation  that is going on in our parks in our waterways and so I would ask that we don't keep us in this  state of inertia just because of this vague feeling that  maybe it would be perceived as going after the homeless or something I'm not asking for that I'm  asking for equal treatment and it feels like only certain people are being held to a standard so  I think that the community would love to hear that we are going to push forward regardless  of the injunction on upholding our city's laws and there are very clear code requirements for  U.S. fish and wildlife  and other state and federal obligations to protect and preserve our natural resources that are not  being adhered to and I really feel like it's incumbent upon you as our representatives to speak  out about that and to begin visible enforcement so that we all know that all of us regardless of  our status are being treated the same and that you have care and control of our city such as we  elected you to do so thank you so much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you so much for your time.  Thank you and our next speaker is Katie Posey.  Good evening Council.  I just want to say thank you for all the hard work you're doing on the Council I know it's not an easy job right now and there are multiple challenges in the last meeting you voted to hire a revenue measures strategy console related to the proposed 1% sales tax so the public could be educated about it.  However, what the public can do is to give you a little bit of a sense of the importance of the  revenue measures strategy.  The first thing that we need to know is whether any of the revenue from the sales tax would go to secure a bond, such as a pension obligation bond taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for the city's pension deficit we know that's there so if the potential relationship between the sales tax revenue and a bond is not completely transparent, then I would hope others would share their concerns and oppose the sales tax.  If that's true.  Second, in light of what Chico residents are observing around the city.  And in lower park in relation to encampments at the moment Nicole just spoke about it it's clear there's impact being placed on the environment in addition to wildlife.  Due to the way people are treating where they're camping. I know it's a complex issue but one aspect that should be addressed no matter what is the way our parks and environment are affected.  I absolutely care about the people who need shelter but here I just want to put this concern on your radar. Could the council nudge the climate commission to place this item on the agenda for their next meeting.  Their December meeting.  I think was canceled but for the next could they brainstorm and think about how to generate a cleanup or talk about other solutions, specific spaces in the park in the wildlife are affected by these encampments.  Additionally, could the parks and playground commission also jump on board and chime in. Could the two commissions work together and take input from the public.  We know there might be some issues over by kick breakers I grew up visiting that playground off and I'd like to see it continue to be an appealing place to go.  Finally, I again ask you to open up the chambers for in person meetings.  I know that's a big issue.  Secondly, it really is a really fun moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment  here on Zoom, we're just disembodied voices. We can't show our faces. That's not fun. We need to  get off Zoom and get back to in-person. Based on the data, we know that Omicron is less likely to  cause serious illness and death and is less harmful. Two years down the road, it's clear the  virus is here to stay. Even Butte County Public Health at the last Board of Supervisors meeting  talked about moving towards seeing COVID-19 as endemic. So our local government is meant to be  for the people. So please take a stand for the values you campaigned on and open the chambers  up to the public. Looking forward to seeing you in person. Thank you.  Thank you. And our next speaker is Joe Cotolago from Waste Management.  Okay, Joe. Yes, good evening, Council. My name is Joe Cotolago with Waste Management.  I'm here just to give a brief update on an item that came up last week regarding an outreach item  that we sent out erroneously to some Chico customers. And it's a very important item.  So we sent out an order to Chico customers. And I just want to provide an update on that.  So what happened was we sent out a notice to Butte County customers. It's part of our annual  outreach that they received. It's part of a service calendar. And with a service calendar,  it shows all the services they have and the schedule. Unfortunately, what happened was we  sent that calendar that was meant strictly for Butte County customers to Chico customers.  And it has driven a lot of calls to city staff, to our customer service. And so what we've been  working on is we've sent out an order to Chico customers. And it's part of our annual outreach.  working on since we were notified of this last week on Thursday was to correct the issue  and get notices back out to those customers that their services have not changed and are not  changing. So on behalf of waste management, we 100% own this issue. This is not how we want to  conduct business with our city partners. And we certainly don't want to cause any more work for  city staff and council members with everything else that's going on. So what we've done starting  on Thursday when we were notified is what we wanted to get to the root cause of it and try to  figure out how many customers were impacted. And so what we've done is we've sent out a postcard,  and that's in process now. The postcard will state simply that the services are not changing.  We made a mistake with that mailer. We've also done out dial calls to every single customer  that did receive the piece of mail that was not correct.  Those were not correct. So we've done a lot of out dial calls to every single customer that did  receive the piece of mail that was not correct. Those were not correct. So we've done a lot of  completed yesterday, yesterday morning. So if however the customer sets up their account with  their communication preferences, that's how they get the got their information. So if they prefer  phone calls, they got a phone call before an email, they got an email. We are also we are also  sending out a press release tomorrow morning with a little more information that will go out first  thing. And what are we doing to ensure this doesn't happen again is that we're putting more  basically quality control measures in place, higher reviews, and we're also sending out a press  release tomorrow morning with a little more information that will go out first thing. And what are we doing to ensure this doesn't happen again is that we're putting more  reviews and additional review processes in place to make sure that everything that we send out to Chico customers is accurate, it's detailed, and it's going to the right folks.  So again, we wanted to apologize for this issue. Again, we, we, it's really unfortunate we started off the year this way.  But we wanted to provide this update tonight and make sure that everybody knew that we're taking every method possible to get the message back out to the customers.  So thank you.  And  yeah, that's all I got. So thank you very much. Appreciate your time.  Thank you, Joe. Our next speaker is Jessica Giannola.  Go ahead, Jessica.  Hi, Council. I just want to say, um, Happy New Year. And it's 2022 new start.  First off, I always encourage  our Council and our city to continue to explore different areas where we can meet our unmet needs in our city with housing deficits and other areas that are consistent, but we do need consistent  goals set towards resolving those. Also,  a lot of people this time of year, they make resolutions and  they typically they want to do better. And that's why they're doing that. They're committing to changing what they did the last year or in the past  and move forward.  But the  moment we put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign down to it, it really put a sign  concerns, then, then they should do it. Hopefully it's not an abuse process like we see sometimes,  but what I would like to see from, from our, our leadership, um, starting local,  cause that's where we are. We're most impacted by our local leadership and the decisions that  you make. So, um, I have seen some, some letters that have gone out to people that are living in  those districts and the letters they're in defense because who wants to be recalled, right? Um, but  the words that are being used against the citizens that are using their voice, they're,  they're, they're unfair and they're, they're inaccurate. They're largely inaccurate because  the words you use are, are saying that people, they want, um, tyranny or they want to have  anarchy or they're extremists. And the people out here that I see, the people who are asking for  change, they care so much for our city and they care about where our funding goes and the narrative  that are spoken and the people who live here and they're asking for help. And, um, I just wish that  if we're always going to have partisan stuff going on here in Chico, it's just going to always exist.  But if we could just make it a commitment, I would do this too, of just being mindful of how we're  speaking about the other people who don't necessarily agree with us or support us,  just showing that level of respect and validation for it.  Not agree with their stance, but not, don't call them tyrannists or they're extremists.  Listen to what it is that they're asking. And there's something to it. There's something that  you can agree on in it. If you would just listen, we all should try listening more to each other.  That's what I hope moving forward. Um, happy new year and I'll see you another time.  Thank you, Jessica. Our next speaker is Lori.  She'll be unmuted. Go ahead, Lori.  Hello council. Happy new year. I am in agreement with Katie Posey that the meeting should be open  to the public. We've checked around to other city councils in the county and we don't see  any closed meetings except Chico. That makes you look like you're up to something when people can't  see your face and be in the same room with you to discuss and look and watch.  And see what's going on. Just because there's an unlawful mandate, which is not a law and the  council decides to go home for their meetings. This is what you were doing a year ago. It doesn't  make you look credible. And that's my comment. Okay. Thank you, Lori. Our last speaker is Carla  Mezzo.  And she'll be unmuted in just a second.  Okay, it's Carla Mezzo there.  Um, she just needs to unmute herself.  Okay, so, Carla, if you could unmute yourself.  And share it.  Can you unmute her?  Let's see.  It won't let me unmute her for privacy reasons.  Okay.  She has to unmute herself.  Okay.  So if we could go ahead and go to Julie Threat while Carla works on hers.  If you could go ahead and unmute Julie Threat.  Julie, you're unmuted.  You need to unmute yourself.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, can you hear me?  Yes.  Now we can.  Okay.  This is crazy.  Now I've got to figure out how to get back to my little Word document.  Hello, council.  So, again, Happy New Year.  I also want to talk about the law enforcement kind of strategy and plan,  but I'm looking at it from after we open up the,  what I call the Chico safe ground site.  It said the BMX site.  I'm sure you're all familiar with the term compassionate enforcement.  As you've been looking around all of these shelter options.  And I think it's really an important opportunity for us to kind of take a  step back and really look at how we're going to manage the illegal  activities that were paused on April 4th of 2020.  We're reactivated on January, 2021.  And you kind of know the rest of the story.  My assumption kind of hearing nothing is that you're having meetings with  the staff.  And with the chief of police chief Madden,  and that there's a plan that's been vetted with the,  with an operational timeline.  It's getting communicated to every department head and with all of the law  enforcement community within the County.  You know,  this has been obviously a really long winding road and with all the  potholes and landslides and tons of money poured into kind of temporary  fixes.  So I'm really hoping and I'm praying and I'm suggesting that this safe  ground space be viewed as like a brand new freeway where we won't have to  fill in the potholes or.  Close,  close down lanes to resurface it.  It's got all the proper turnouts and we won't have traffic jams.  And,  you know,  anytime we've got a brand new freeway,  we've got the appropriate law enforcement strategies.  And I really want to make sure we kind of,  we all as a community take a step back.  You know,  are we going to allow people to drive 10 miles over the speed limit without  doing anything?  Are we going to pull over a beat up old Mazda going a hundred miles per  hour,  but not a brand new Mercedes going a hundred miles an hour.  What if my mom's going 50 miles an hour in a 75 mile an hour zone,  you better be pulling her over.  I'm definitely animal control.  Are we going to ticket a lab that's off leash up at five mile as we would a  pit bull that's off leash at city Plaza.  I say,  yes,  we all need to reset our expectations.  All violations get ticketed,  big or small.  If miss Debbie Preston is jail walking,  chief Madden gives her a ticket.  So again,  I hope that there's a well-defined vetted strategy with key community  members input for camping,  loitering,  drug using littering violations of a certain date.  You give them a date for all of us.  And again,  it's a tough love,  zero tolerance.  We've got,  the one opportunity to reset everything.  This community absolutely cannot afford.  And we're not going to tolerate encampments popping up again on city  hall or lower Bidwell park or wind chime.  That's not the contract we signed up for.  And again,  I am really,  I'm really wanting district seven to know that if there's a tent  popping up at wind chime,  they know what to do.  They call two on one.  Did they use that online reporting form?  If so,  they need to have a box put in there.  So yeah,  I'll leave it there.  And I just heard miss Jessica,  my friend on the line.  And,  you know,  I'm,  I'm,  I was fearful that I'm gonna hear the word criminalizing homelessness,  and that's not the case.  You know,  we're,  we're criminalizing crime.  So we've made an investment 10 times over.  And so it's time to kind of diversify and look at the safer investments,  like a law and order CD.  So thank you for your time.  Next time.  I'm going to talk about engaging our employers for this opportunity and using  the homeless hiring tax credit.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So we're going to try Carla Mezzo one more time to see.  If she can unmute herself.  She has permission to speak.  However,  she just,  there she goes.  Hello.  This is the first time that I've used zoom.  I'm going to try to get used to our new system of communicating with  our city council.  So I apologize.  If I'm not very smooth.  And I just saw the agenda earlier today.  Actually just about an hour,  hour and a half ago.  And I noticed that there was the topic of sex trafficking.  So I'm assuming that there's a concern regarding that in Chico.  I'd like to bring up the fact that there are,  there are no regulatory.  Rules or ordinances in place in the city of Chico for massage therapy  businesses.  As a matter of fact,  any single one of you city council members could go to the business office  right now.  Hey,  about 30 bucks.  I hate to interrupt you,  but if you want to speak on that topic,  we,  we have to hear you.  If you want to speak on that,  that topic,  we have to do it under that topic.  When it comes up,  you can't do it from the floor.  Did you say wait until it comes up on the agenda?  Correct.  Oh,  okay.  Does that,  that'll okay.  Great.  I'll do that.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  But,  but you can finish your time if you have other subjects.  No,  I just wanted to,  uh,  you know,  ask that one of these days,  one of the council members will put the,  that on the agenda,  but I'll do that under sex.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's item 5.4,  uh,  section a,  and we'll have speakers on each of those individual topics.  So you'll be able to talk.  Okay.  Alrighty.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Um,  Carla was our last speaker under business from the floor.  All right.  Thank you very much.  So,  uh,  we will move on here to our,  uh,  public hearings,  which we have none.  And so number five,  moving onto the regular agenda,  5.1 broadband and master plan.  And this is going to be a fun moment to share a piece of news to  share a piece of news to share a piece of news to share a piece of  news to share a piece of news to share a piece of news to share a  piece of news to share a piece of news to share a piece of news to  share a piece of news to share a piece of news to share a piece of  news to share a piece of news to share a piece of news to share a  piece of news to share a piece of news to share a piece of news to  share a piece of news to share a piece of news to share a piece of  news to share a piece of news to share a piece of news to share a piece  of news to share a piece of news to share a piece of news to share a piece  of news to share a piece of news to share a piece of news to share a piece of  This topic here about our broadband master plan, I think is something that can literally  revolutionize the future that we have for our city.  Not for one year, two years, I think potentially up to 50 years.  So just as a little background, our  our  Scott, we we you're you're cutting off a little bit there.  We might have to have this broadband master plan go to your location first.  All right. Looks like we lost him there.  What?  Band utility.  Scott, you want to come in?  Scott, can you hear me OK?  OK, I think we lost him.  All right, why don't we have him log back on?  And in the meantime, Madam Clerk, if it's OK with you, we can move on to item 5.2.  Debi, Debi, Debi, Debi, Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi Debi De Debi De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De  you all right all right go ahead please we created we've worked very hard to create this interim  broadband planet oh we're losing you again just gone  so scott we're having those same problems so um  i think maybe at this point in time we have scott work to get reconnected see if he can strengthen  his connection and maybe move closer to the wi-fi um and why don't we move on to item 5.2 and then  we'll return to item 5.1 uh again if you want to speak on item 5.2 go ahead and put your hand up  when we're done with the report and um so we will hand this over to deputy city manager jennifer  mccarthy  good evening mayor coolidge members of the council jennifer mccarthy deputy city manager  glad i can hear you and you can hear me um i can going to share my screen if i may  just a couple of quick slides for you absolutely all right thank you okay tonight i'm going to  talk to you a little bit about the city of chico's youth well-being program  provide you information on the program and funding recommendations  as a reminder  the program was funded through the american rescue plan or arpa as we like to call it one of the  eligible activities of the american rescue plan was to provide funding to programs that really  address the impacts of covid19 specifically the public health impacts of covid19 to youth  and these would be school-aged youth grades 12 through i mean k through 12.  on august 3rd the city council directed staff to establish the youth well-being program  and allocated a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to award to up to three non-profit  organizations that could provide a variety of different services to school-aged youth  this includes such things as mentoring after school programs recreation programs music or  art therapy or other organizational programs  we developed a scoring system that would look at these applications on a very fair basis  we looked at programs that really  were in place already that have a proven success rate for addressing academic social emotional and  mental health impacts of school-aged children we look to identify the number of students that they  were either currently serving or could potentially serve with these funds and then very important  is the ability to have these organizations continue to offer these services after the  grant funds are gone and finally the staff qualifications and the organizational capacity  on these programs and then we have bonus points and those bonus points were things like for  transportation those organizations that provided meals at least once per day and then programs  that focused on providing services to at-at-risk youth we opened the application process on october  29th held a press conference and the applications began to become accepted we held a workshop on  november 1st walking the community organizations throughout the state to work with these organizations  through the process and how to submit their application electronically.  And on December 2nd, when applications were due, we had seven eligible  applicants with requests that totaled just over $255,000.  We had a scoring team that reviewed all of the applications,  and I can tell you right now, all seven of the applicants were outstanding programs,  but there were four that really raised to the top,  and that included the Boys and Girls Club, the Girls on the Run program,  Salvation Army, and the North State Composite Mountain Bike Team.  In your staff report, you had activity summaries from each one of these organizations  that provide you more details on exactly what they were providing.  When we originally met in August and the program was developed,  the Council recommended that we approve funding for no more than three organizations.  But as I pointed out  previously, there were four organizations that really rose to the top.  And the top three, meaning Boys and Girls Club, Girls on the Run, and Salvation Army,  if their full requests were provided, we would still have leftover funds.  And so with that, we are recommending as staff that we fund the top four organizations,  again, Boys and Girls Club, Girls on the Run, Salvation Army, and the North State Composite  Mountain Bike Team. I can say that all four of these organizations have done an outstanding job,  and we are very proud of them. And we are very proud of them. And we are very proud of them.  And we are very proud of them. And we are very proud of them. And we are really happy to share  this moment with you today, meeting the needs of the youth in our community,  and really helping to address the impacts that COVID-19 have had on them.  So at this point, I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have of me.  And I'd also like to note that there may be organizations that represent those that  applied for funding that are part of this call today, and they might be here to address your  questions as well. All right, any questions for me?  All right, any questions?  Deputy City Manager, Council, I'm just looking through here.  All right. No questions then. Let's move on to speakers. Do we have any speakers on this item?  Anyone wishing to do so, please raise your hand.  Right now we have two. Julie Threatt, if she can unmute herself.  Okay. And Steena will share her timer.  So Julie, can you unmute yourself, please?  Steena, have you granted her permission?  Yes.  Okay. All right. So let's move to Nicole Nava and we'll go back to Julie Threatt.  So Nicole, can you unmute yourself?  I don't see Nicole now.  Okay. There's Nicole. So Nicole, can you...  Thank you.  So it's a significant delay before your screen pops up to unmute, just so you know, for all the speakers.  Okay.  Anyway, good evening again. And the reason I wanted to speak on this topic was a little bit of concern over one of the items.  I just found it a little sad that we could not get the...  Was the left amount, which I believe was $350,000,  to directly to an entity, like to be shared amongst some of the people who put in for it.  Although I must say, I do prefer when it goes to local entities that aren't like more out of our area as well,  because they have other funding streams that they can tap for.  They can tap for youth programs.  But on this particular item, my understanding is that that $350,000 that was remaining of the COVID funds...  And I think that's great.  And hopefully, by the end of the day, we'll be in really good shape.  It just was disappointing to me, given...  And how our current bypass look.  Nicole, we're having some problem with your connection.  Can you hear us?  I think she left.  She may be coming back in.  Okay.  If she comes back in, let's give her a minute and a half or two minutes.  And then let's see if we have another speaker on this topic.  Okay.  So Julie, three, can you...  Yeah.  Can you hear me, Debbie?  Yes, I can hear you now.  Okay, great.  I'm blaming the broadband guy.  Everything went crazy once he got on.  So Jennifer, I just think this is a wonderful program.  And we've been going to the school board meetings specifically to kind of look at the issues that kids are having wearing these masks all day long.  And so if there's anything that, you know, success stories or if they're applying a lot,  some of their programs to specifically talk to the kids or, you know, find out, you know, how things are going, you know, wearing those masks all day long,  that would be kind of learning and lessons that we would love to hear about.  So whether they come back on to a city council meeting and share with the council, that would be great.  Or tag team with the school board and come to one of those meetings.  Because sometimes we see groups come there and kind of show what they've been doing.  So that would be fantastic.  And, you know, I think it's all good.  And, you know, as long as they're...  I think it's kind of going with the flow in terms of, you know, again, managing these kids that are just, you know, really being harmed.  And there's some really dreadful stories coming out.  So I really look forward to seeing what this group can do.  So good job.  Thank you.  Okay.  Our next speaker is Anne Moore.  Anne can unmute herself.  And she's going to give you a few minutes to answer questions.  So if we can move to Kelly Haight.  And if you can unmute yourself, Kelly.  All right.  First-time speaker, can you hear me?  Yes.  Hi.  I won't take too much of your time.  I am the team director for the North State Composite Mountain Bike Team.  And I want to just take a moment to introduce myself.  And I want to thank Jennifer and Angie.  This grant was very organized, really well presented.  It was so helpful.  The rubric was fantastic.  I want to thank the council and the folks who scored the rubrics and for the council for considering approving all four of us in this grant.  We do good things for kids out there on the trails.  And I just can't express my appreciation enough.  That's it.  Thank you.  So Nicole Nava is back.  Can we just give her the rest?  Hi there.  Can you hear me?  Yes.  Why don't we give her just the rest of that remaining time?  It was about two minutes.  Thank you.  So thank you.  I was speaking about a concern I had over the, I believe it was 350,000.  That will be.  We spent on a bike path and I'm all about recreation and health, mental health, physical health for folks.  But it just, again, seems to me like the bike paths are not a real safe place to be on right now.  A lot of people are complaining about the litter, the ability to get through them, feeling unsafe, et cetera, because there's encampments.  And I hate that I have to, like, bring that up and sound like the squeaky wheel all the time on this topic.  But again, we're kind of laying out all these funds.  And then what?  I hope that destruction doesn't happen, such as we saw at Comanche Creek.  So, you know, in the perfect world, it'll be great.  It'll be erected, widened, whatever.  And then we'll all get to enjoy it.  But I would just like to see us really look for opportunities, because I think it's great the people who were given the funds and I'm excited for them.  Maybe we could have even done more for some of those that did receive.  But instead of put such a huge chunk towards something that's primarily in the area benefiting the university again.  So it would be nice to kind of see the focus be on the community at large, the children involved.  I did not see.  Sorry, I'm hearing other people.  Sorry.  So, again, a focus there would be much appreciated.  Maybe if we were able to do what I brought up on the other topic, which is enforce.  People can feel safe on those bike paths.  And I wholly support something like this in that regard.  So I'd love to see kind of a well thought out plan for addressing the safety, lighting, all of that there.  And I'm given to understand that maybe there would be some help for funding of the actual bike path project to make it a fabulous thing.  So good work, everybody.  And thank you for that.  Thank you, Nicole.  And Kelly Haith, I believe.  We are.  Or is it Ann Seymour that.  Trying to think of which one actually.  What was it?  The left on microphone.  Kelly Haith already spoke.  Okay.  So Ann Seymour.  And I just want to let everyone know that regionally,  there are some issues going on.  And I think it's because of Zoom that our wonderful IT staff was checking into it to see what was going on.  And it appears that there's some intermittent service for Zoom at this point, not just with the city of Chico.  Yeah, they're supposedly having technical problems nationwide, I think.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  So we have one last speaker on this, Jeff Void.  Okay.  All right.  So we have a question from the Salvation Army.  Hi, this is Lieutenant Jeff Void of the Salvation Army.  And just a short comment.  I want to say thank you to Jennifer McCarthy and everyone that put together this grant.  I would say the process was very streamlined and effective.  It was very straightforward.  Interacting with you guys has been a real treat.  There are very actually limited grants that we as a Salvation Army in Chico are able to apply for, especially for youth related programs.  And so the opportunity to do this.  Is just a really good opportunity for us to expand our youth program.  So just kudos to you guys for one offering up a grant like this and two for just kind  of streamlining the process and being very communicative during the process.  We appreciate that.  That's all.  Thank you.  We do have Claire Johnson from Girls on the Run.  Hi, everybody.  I just wanted to echo what Kelly and I have said.  And Officer Void just shared about thanking you very much for the opportunity to continue serving our youth.  And backing us up and supporting us in such a monumental way.  I also wanted to say to Julie Threatt, I love the idea of having us be able to come back and share a bit about the impact that this opportunity is going to provide us.  And would very much love to come and share later in the season.  At the end of the season.  And hopefully in the spring.  What the impact is going to be for Girls on the Run and the girls in our community.  So thanks, everybody.  Thanks for the opportunity.  Thank you.  Okay.  I guess we can try Ann Seymour one more time.  And see if she can be unmuted.  I don't know what's going on for her.  So.  Those are the speakers that we have.  All right.  Move to approve, Sean.  Go ahead, Sean.  Did you have something?  I said move to approve.  Thank you, Angie.  I'll second that.  All right.  We have a motion and a second.  Do we have any further discussion?  I just wanted to say a quick thing that I wanted to commend staff on thinking on your feet.  And I believe the intent when we made the motion was that it was three to four people-ish that got beat.  I don't think it was a hard three.  I think the intent behind it was we wanted it to be spread out, but not so spread out that everybody was getting so little they couldn't actually do with it.  So thank you to staff for doing a great job on that and bringing it back to us and being flexible, which government is not always able to do very well.  And that's all I have.  Thank you.  All right.  Mr. Bennett.  Did you have a point as well before we move to vote?  No.  Okay.  You know, I'd also like to thank staff for their hard work on this.  You know, I would say that I believe the new fence there along the railroad track offers not only, you know, recreation improvements, but mass improvements to an issue that's plagued our community for a long time, which is train safety.  And, you know, runs through several of our districts here in Chico.  But I think it's very important that we have a new fence there along the railroad track.  And I think it's very important to our community.  And, you know, everybody knows that's been a longstanding issue and certainly something that I like seeing us make some progress on.  So I know the university is involved in that.  I know UP, the Union Pacific is involved in that as well.  They'll be doing a portion of the fencing along the track there, too.  So I think it's pretty, pretty amazing that we were able to get something like that done and use a portion of these funds, but also include some help from the university and Union Pacific.  As well.  So are there any further comments on this from Council?  All right.  With that, then we'll move to the motion.  And Madam Clerk, if you could take the role.  Councilmember Bennett.  Yes.  Councilmember Brown.  Aye.  Councilmember Morgan.  Yes.  Councilmember O'Brien.  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right.  So at this point in time, is Mr. Dowell back on?  I am here.  Can you hear me?  You are.  All right.  Yes.  Let's hope we can continue to hear you.  So item 5.1, I think there are rumors floating around that you, you know, maybe put some of this forward the way you did so we would believe you about these broadband issues here.  No, no, I'm giving you a bad time.  But why don't you go ahead, Mr. Dowell, and hopefully we'll be able to hear you the whole way through.  Yeah.  I'll just keep it on my voice here.  So I won't give you that added excitement.  But you can call me the, I learned that you can call me the broadband guy from now on.  Yes.  By the broadband guy.  That broadband guy.  That'll work for me.  But anyway, I'm going to be real brief here to the point.  Obviously we need help broadband.  regionally wide citywide and everything so to deal with the digital divide so our city  membership team of several members of our staff went together and worked very hard for the last  seven months eight months working with bruce patterson and the entry point team to come up  with a broadband we're calling it a interim master plan why interim because we believe it's going to  be a living breathing document that will need to come back to you on a reoccurring basis to be  updated but really we're looking at trying to tackle that digital divide reduce the cost of  internet services i personally reduce costs provide reliability as we can see is something  that we really need to strive with because everyone's going to need this service in the  future so with that i'm going to get out of the way and bruce i think is going to need to share  his screen  josh marquis is with us he's our is manager and he's got the answers all technical stuff so i'm  going to get out and bruce has got a short presentation but we want to kind of walk  through and at the end we're hopeful that you will approve the interim plan so bruce with that  it's all yours thanks scott and mayor and council i want to first of all thank you for the  opportunity to present um you know it's really a privilege to be able to represent so much work  that was done and i'm really excited to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be  a volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  I'd like to just share with you to help us move through this. The purpose here is to make you  familiar with the work that was done and how we reached the conclusions we reached so that you  understand the advice contained within the broadband plan. So first of all, what is a  broadband master plan? It is what Scott described. It's a long-term living document that provides  certified strategy to guide broadband investment for the community. It includes typically surveys,  analysis, and recommendations that are specific to the area. So it takes a look at the population,  the economy, the housing, and these other aspects to really come up with a plan that's  unique to the area, and that's the focus of what we did. In terms of the content, three key things.  It contains strategy, it contains goals, and it contains actions to  move the city to those goals. And obviously there's a lot of documentation in there. You  notice there's a number of pages, and that's because it really outlines the critical elements  that were considered in developing the plan. I feel like at this stage, the benefit is to think  for just a moment on why. Why would the city develop a plan? The simple answer is there are  gaps. There are gaps in affordability in Chico,  and there are gaps in the city's development. So I think it's important to think about that.  There are gaps in service availability, meaning that it's not ubiquitous. There are different  pricings and different availabilities in different areas of town based on the infrastructure that's  available. And there is not clear evidence that improvements will be made to achieve ubiquity to  all the residents and businesses of Chico. So it's really about those gaps.  So why are there gaps? That's the other thing we really want to talk about.  What you're really seeing is a shift. It's the shift of a service that has been considered  historically a luxury, a nice-to-have, that is now today necessary or essential. And so with that,  we're relying on primarily monopoly-type infrastructure, which means there's a real  lack of competition to naturally drive, have those market forces naturally drive competition.  Improve service and improve pricing. That just doesn't exist. The cost for someone to come in and  offer a service to help improve the situation is extremely high because they would have to invest  in a completely new infrastructure. And so that allows the incumbents to really enable  disinvestment on their part, meaning that they don't really invest in upgrades and that they can  do minimal service and maximize profit. So before we get into that, I want to talk a little bit about  the public investment. So before we leave this slide, just briefly, one of the things the  committee wanted to focus on is this question, is public investment needed? So we wanted to  introduce that question here because as we talk about that, is public investment going to help  with this? And I would point out just briefly before we leave this slide that even the existing  providers within Chico recognize that they would benefit from public investment. In fact, you will  know that they would benefit from public investment. So we're going to talk a little bit about that.  So we're going to talk a little bit about that. So we're going to talk a little bit about that.  You'll notice statewide that many of the incumbents are asking for public dollars to fill in the gaps,  so to extend their infrastructure or improve their infrastructure to areas, they're asking for public  money. You'll also recall that there are subsidies for service to improve affordability, particularly  with the pandemic, because the pandemic has highlighted that we really need connectivity.  It's turning out to be just like our water or our wastewater system.  We expect to be able to turn it on, get the water we need, and get it at an affordable rate to meet our needs.  And so we're really looking at broadband that way, and we need to treat it that way.  But the delivery models that we use to get it today aren't aligned with that essential  ideology of making it service that's essential and affordable for everyone.  So then what the committee did,  is they focused on that being the case, what would be the strategic priorities and the policy  focus objectives for the plan? So number one, you'll see this carried throughout the report,  the number one goal is to improve affordability, because that is a key gap that we see within Chico.  We saw that highlighted by data we collected that was publicly available, but we also engaged in a  public survey, and that emphasized that affordability is a significant concern.  And it really is a key piece to share, because it really is a key piece to share,  because it really is a key piece to share, because it really is a key piece to share,  because it really is a key piece to share, because it really is a key piece to share,  because it really is a key piece to share, because it really is a key piece to share,  because it really is a key piece to share, because it really is a key piece to share,  because it really is a key piece to share, because it really is a key piece to share,  because it really is a key piece to share, because it really is a key piece to share,  because it really is a key piece to share, because it really is a key piece to share,  because it really is a key piece to share, because it really is a key piece to share,  be to pursue 50-year or better investments. So if we're going to take public dollars and invest it  in a solution, there isn't an interest in subsidies or short-term kicking the can down the road  solutions. We're really talking about longer-term solutions. And those solutions need to be focused  on addressing digital access and equity gaps. That's the focus and these are the priorities  that were identified by the committee. So let's talk about the survey that your residents and  businesses filled out. Here's what we found and we're just hitting some highlights that  that data is more broadly available as you read the plan. Speed was 100% important or very important  to every respondent. So that was at the top of their list. Cost was important or very important  to 98% of the respondents.  So those two things very critical to them. And this last one we thought you would find interesting.  They were asked if they would support a public or city-owned solution that introduced competition  and better pricing. 98% answered either yes or possibly with more information. So vast majorities  in support of that. So as we think about public investment as part of the solution,  we're going to look at the  not only do the incumbents recognize that the private investment is not sufficient, that return  on investment is not sufficient to get them to solve the problem completely, but also your public,  your citizens recognize that they would support the correct public investment in capital infrastructure.  So those were some important findings that came out of the work that we did. We want to talk about  what that public investment might look like. We want to talk about what that public investment might  public dollars and put them into the traditional models, the city would be forced to choose  where to invest into whose infrastructure. So we illustrate here that there's infrastructure for  FedEx, a road that only FedEx can use, and a road that only UPS can use. So the reality is if the  city were to pass on a public investment to a private incumbent, they would in essence choose  a winner or a loser, and that improvement would go to benefit that single provider of the service.  So that is not a path that the public appeared to support or the committee supported. It does not  appear to be the appropriate use for public funds in making a capital investment.  So the recommendation you'll see in the report looks more like this. Public investment in an  open access model. That simply means that the city is not going to be able to invest in a public  infrastructure. So the recommendation you'll see in the report looks more like this. Public  investment in an open access model. That simply means that the city is not going to be able to invest  The city would invest in publicly owned infrastructure that could be used by any service provider,  as illustrated by this picture here. FedEx and UPS use the public road system to deliver their  services, and that enables them to compete and results in far better pricing for that service.  And experience has shown that that same economic principle applies when there is public  infrastructure openly available to private, public, public, public, public, public, public, public, public,  service providers. So that's the recommendation that's made within the broadband plan that we're  presenting to you tonight. That public investment would be made in public infrastructure, and that  public infrastructure would be open to private service providers to compete across that common  infrastructure. So the next steps that are contained within the report are that the city  would codify in ordinance the public infrastructure that is available to private service providers.  And it would pid a permission to share it to a volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer volunteer volunteer volunteer  volunteer  that that infrastructure is to serve the purpose of creating a city network for city businesses,  for public safety, for community anchor institutions, and to create affordable  access for service providers to provide service to businesses and residents in Chico.  So the city would not provide any retail service, but instead provide an infrastructure that would  benefit the community. We've got a little brief map here on this slide that shows three city key  locations that would be connected as part of this pilot project, a pilot project that we want to do  as part of the plan. I didn't, I failed to introduce that correctly. So part of this is once this is  codified in ordinance and fees and rates are established, there would be construction of a  pilot project using rescue plan monies.  For a section of Chico that falls on average below the poverty line. So that's Chapman and Mulberry  area. And that project would connect three key city locations with fiber so that the city could  utilize that for city business, improve their utility infrastructure, and also improve public  health and safety by using that those private links. But it would also serve as the basis to  feed fiber into the city.  And it would also serve to share a share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share  cents a megabit for the service. In other areas that have implemented this model, we've seen that  drop to as low as three cents or less a megabit. So converting from 70 cents to as low as three  cents per megabit. So that's one way to look at it. We believe that those results can be achieved  in Chico. We're confident of that and that this is a fabulous investment in your community because  that connectivity is key to the future education of your children. It's the way you're going to  receive health care as we move forward and it's how you're going to participate in society.  So it plays an ever-increasing role and those that cannot afford it or do not have adequate access  are at a clear disadvantage. So that's the recommendation that comes out of the report  and at this point we're just simply encouraging  the community to take advantage of it.  We're encouraging the council to adopt the master plan which would then set us on this path of being  able to move forward with the next steps. So with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Scott and  I believe we're going to address any questions. Yes, thank you Bruce. So Mr. Mayor, we're open  to any questions that any of the council members might have. All right and I know when we heard  this in and just as good the second time around but we heard it in the finance committee as well.  And went through it and there were some questions at that time and maybe we'll get back to those after we  I'd like to bring back a few of those up just for the public that weren't able to attend the finance meeting.  But do we have any questions from council?  All right and Mr. Dowell, you know could you talk a little bit about the American Rescue Fund plan?  You know a lot of people obviously go, oh you know what this should be put into roads or  you know there's other priorities for the city, things along that line. Can you talk about that a little bit?  Sure. The city has received approximately or will receive approximately 22 million dollars in America Rescue Plan money.  Certain amounts of that have been allocated through the feds specifically for improving broadband  connectivity and tackling the emergency. So we're going to talk about that a little bit.  And it really is a really fun piece to share. And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it really is a really fun piece to share.  And it's been modified down to $4.8 million, and we've had some of it already allocated to us. So that's kind of where we're at. We're to a point where we need to know, is this the way we want to go and get full utilization of those funds. But no general fund dollars are being utilized for this project.  All right. And since we've got you here and you're live, there were also some rumblings I heard in the community about, you know, the city's doing so well financially because of those American Rescue Fund dollars.  And obviously, I know that's not correct, but maybe you can tell us why that is and how those dollars aren't actually put into the general fund.  Right. The American Rescue Plan, if everyone has to really.  I kind of realized those funds were there set aside to help different communities kind of rebuild and recover after COVID.  We thought that it would be a short recovery, but we can see that it has taken time.  So the federal government has allocated for certain purposes.  And so we follow those guidelines.  Now, yes, that helps the city look good short term.  So our cash.  June 30th last year looked better than it ever had because we had received $10 million of American Rescue Plan dollars, which had not been spent, but it's been allocated to be spent.  So, yeah, we do have to dissect those that that they're two separate pots that we really can't rely on using those as long term dollars to allocate for police or for fire or for roads.  That's that they're set aside for specific purposes.  Yeah.  And I guess just the delineation here of the funds between, you know, those funds being set aside for that.  But that's not why the city necessarily has a surplus or did at the last fiscal year moving forward.  Sure, I could address that.  At June 30th of this year, the city did finish the year with a very strong positive fund balance in the general fund.  So there are some.  Those American Rescue Plans are a sub amount of that in our reserves separated out for that purpose.  So it may show that overall our general fund is healthy, but we have it as a restricted portion.  It can only be used for that purpose.  But, you know, on a positive note, we did have our financial statements reviewed and approved by Finance Committee this last month.  And then it was before you earlier tonight to approve the report.  The city is on the healthiest foundation that it has been for several years.  But we could all agree there's greater needs than the revenues that are coming in.  So I'd be very the council being very protective of those funds in a watchful eye has set us into a good financial position to go forward overall for the general fund.  All right.  Thank you.  Mr.  Kiddell, any further questions from Council for Mr.  Dow or Mr.  Patterson?  I do have a quick question, Mr.  Moore.  Go ahead.  So I understand that city is trying to work as an infrastructure provider.  Could you please speak to the reaction from the service providers, from the Internet service providers?  How are they reacting for this plan?  And would they be willing to partner up with infrastructure once the city has it?  So as part of our.  Walk through the last seven months, we have reached out to the service providers and we have shared with them these ideas.  In fact, one of the local service providers sent an email to myself or Josh saying, if this plan goes forward, how can we help?  So they were very excited about it.  Each.  I can't speak for each provider because I don't know what they're thinking other than what the correspondence that we've received.  And so we do look forward to working.  I would.  Was shared earlier by Bruce is a true factor.  We want to work with everyone.  And we're not trying to.  We think long term this will help the providers as well as the city of Chico.  I believe it will help to I just wanted to make sure that we hear what you have heard, because I know I was in a few of those meetings, but we connected initially.  So.  Thank you for that update.  And thank you, Councilman.  Member and and because we appreciate your input.  We also had input from.  Chico Unified School District.  They participated Chico Chamber of Commerce participated.  And so we really were reaching out trying to hear what the needs were and what we can do and by and large, as you can tell with the survey that they were positively received.  Right right.  Mayor, you don't have your mic on.  Right, I don't.  My apologies, my my my first mistake on zoom.  All right.  So.  Thank you very much, everybody.  And then how many speakers do we have.  But we do not have any.  Okay.  All right.  So we'll entertain a motion from Council.  I will make a motion to approve.  I second that.  All right.  We have a motion from Councilmember O'Brien a second from Councilmember Tandon.  Madam Clerk, you can take the roll.  Councilmember Bennett.  Yes.  Councilmember Brown.  Aye.  Councilmember Morgan.  Yes.  Councilmember O'Brien.  Yes.  Councilmember Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carried 7-0.  All right, before we start the next items and just so everybody knows we did have to just because some technical difficulties we started with item 5.2.  Ended up going back to item 5.1 so we have finished both item 5.1 and 5.2.  The next item is 5.3.  And then maybe we can take a break after item 5.3 actually because I think this one will be rather quick.  This was my original request is everybody now knows Chico's 150th birthday celebration is this year.  So happy birthday Chico.  And you know, the original request was for staff to look at something, particularly something that focuses on our  community.  As a community celebration so not so much the city of Chico celebrating itself.  Internally, but, but rather, you know, doing something particularly something that could be cost neutral, or, you know, through  Use of sponsorship funds or community input that staff work to organize some kind of celebration that's community based for  To honor the 150th.  Year Chico.  So that was kind of where I wanted to start the discussion.  I don't know if Council has any questions or any thoughts on this before we head into the speakers.  Andrew Sean.  Yeah, go ahead.  I don't know where that directional go but I think it's something that city staff is overwhelmed with a lot of things.  Some of them we can't talk about right now but  I know that.  the chamber and the DCBA are in flux,  but working with those partners on something as cool as the ice skating  ring for that party in time, I think would be awesome.  I said party, but I don't mean to put words in anybody's mouth.  Yeah, no, I think celebration.  I definitely would agree with you that staff time should be limited.  I know it's fairly, you know,  a lot of our staff are overburdened in that respect.  So I completely agree with that.  So do we have any other council member thoughts before we go to speakers?  All right. Madam clerk, do we have any speakers on this item?  Yes, we have Seth and I don't know his last,  how to say his last name.  Actually, he just disappeared.  If Sina can help him get back.  All right.  Oh, there's Seth.  Seth, can you unmute yourself?  Hello. Thank you. Can you all hear me?  Oh, yes. Thank you.  Okay, great. That was a very interesting discussion.  And actually this is my first time of participating and I think it was very  fruitful. At least I got a lot of useful information.  Living here in the city,  for you know, a couple of years now.  I wanted to find out how many people besides the council is on this Zoom call,  you know, just because I thought the information is very useful.  And so if it's possible,  can I have an idea of the number of people that I just, you know,  besides the council that are just tuning in or listening on the Zoom call?  So Seth, if you had comments on this particular item,  is really what we're looking for at this time.  Each item we take, we look for particular input from the public on that particular item.  We have to limit that to each individual item.  So you do, I think, have a little over two minutes remaining.  This item is the 150th birthday celebration for the city of Chico and discussions about that.  Certainly, if you want to send council a message,  you can do that as well.  Or some of the city staff, city manager,  all those emails are available and we'd be happy to talk with you there.  All right, thank you.  All right, thanks so much.  Okay, and our next speaker is Jessica Giannola.  Hi, council.  So our city, it looks like we're going to celebrate 150 years here soon.  And that is a neat community thing.  It can not only bring the city together for positive shared experience,  which I'm sure we all need,  but this celebration should also be used as important education opportunity.  Together, we are proud of great achievements from Chico.  We have amazing stories of success and creativity.  We have also learned and experienced stories of survival and perseverance that inspire hope.  If the city is going to put forth effort in celebrating our city,  then it is important that we have a community that is able to share the same experiences with the community.  And that we must also own how we got here to begin with.  So we have clear ways of doing better for our residents of this land.  Celebrating the progression of our city since it was established 150 years ago  needs to include recognition for the circumstances  for which it was born on traditional lands and the maturity of people.  For some, the history of our city is more romantic than factual.  And I find that people today really do value truth and honesty as ugly as it can be.  Not everyone knows the complete history  of the land and of Chico.  The people who lived here before us was taken.  Or the complete role of the Bidwells.  Or others that played out during that process.  I had to learn this. It wasn't just something easily accessible.  It's incredibly important that we as a society need to continue to do better once we know better.  The people of our city today do hold a level of responsibility for the injustices and trauma  of the people from generations before us.  And celebrating that without acknowledging the human tragedy of our Indigenous people,  it would be insensitive.  And it would be an insensitive move to make.  And we can avoid it.  It's not always easy to speak up like this.  I can just imagine the faces and thoughts going,  oh my god, she's on this role now.  But it's important that we have these discussions.  We can remain silent, not rock the boat of history,  or make plans to celebrate and say happy birthday.  We can choose to take a harder step and speak up.  We should take cues from the national movement of truth  and recognition of generational trauma  by acknowledging experiences and price paid by people victimized  by human histories,  of power and privilege. Privilege is something that many of us hold, but not everybody has.  And sometimes we get here because we abused our power in that process. This will help our  children, our grandchildren have a better sense of ownership and proud of the changes that they've  made in their lives in 50 years from now when they celebrate 200 years of Chico. So I just hope that  we take that opportunity and do not exclude that bit. If we're celebrating Chico, please just also  include that recognition to people that deserve it. They're here now. We need to set that example  moving forward. Thank you. Okay. She is our last speaker. All right. So, and I would be interested  in council, feel free to weigh in as you see fit. I'd be interested in, in fact, I'll make a motion  for city staff to bring back some outline of, you know, how they can be involved.  In putting forward some type of community event with limited staff time, limited resources  for us to approve as we move forward later in the year.  So that would be my motion. I'll second your motion, but can we put some sort of a  um, our time limit or something on it? While I think it's important, there's a lot,  a lot of other stuff going on right now. Um, maybe this could be done in a side committee and we  could take recommendations to staff. I don't know. I'm just trying to be conscientious of staff's  time. Yeah, absolutely. Um, what, what do you think for number of hours? Mr. Orm?  I think you guys are getting too far in the weeds.  All right. Thoughts, Sean?  Um, I think staff can come out.  Without spending hours and hours, they can, I mean, they've got plenty of time to do this.  Mark or Jen or Angie or anybody could come up with a general outline of how that might look.  And we've got plenty of time. This is long has, like the vice mayor said, this doesn't become  uh, two things. A, a huge priority when we've got a lot of other things going on. And, and B,  some kind of crazy political, let's all show our hands in this side of the city thing. I am more  than confident that we're going to be able to do that. Um, I think that's a good point. Um, I think  that we're going to be able to do that. Um, I think that's a good point. Um, I think  that the Skipper staff can do something like that. Basically, if we put together a committee,  uh, we're going to have 30,000 people giving us their views of what they think the history of  Chico was and the future and how it's all our fault. Yeah, no, I agree. So Mr. Orm,  would you be comfortable with outlining something? Absolutely. Uh, you know, knowing that the 150th,  uh, birthday was coming up, we were already looking at it, evaluating it. So we're happy to put  together a list of potential options, uh, for council to consider. And we'll bring that back  here at a meeting in the near future. All right. Is that just council direction? It doesn't require  a motion. Yeah. Let's just go with that. If everybody's okay with that council member,  O'Brien. I support that, uh, mayor. I think we need to do something. We don't want to overburden  our staff certainly, but I think we come up with something that honors our city's heritage,  celebrate the 150th birthday of this city and do it in a way that's responsible.  All right. Any further council member comment? All right. No, I think you have direction.  All right. And with that, we will take a short 10 minute break or long 10 minute break as you like,  and, uh, we will come back then. So Madam clerk, if you could put up a note.  Okay. And, uh, we, we will join back in 10 minutes. Okay. So 732 will resume.  Okay. Thank you.  Yep.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right. Are we ready?  Shawn is ready.  All right.  I see Alex.  Wait for DePica to come back on here.  Mike, if you can give us a heads up.  Mike, if you can give us a heads up.  And Dale, so we know you're there.  Thank you.  I'm here.  All right, Dale, how about you?  And the PICA.  I'm seeing everybody else.  All right, Dale, are you there?  Yes.  There he is.  All right.  So, and the PICA, how about you?  The PICA, let us know when you're back.  All right, the PICA, are you there?  Are you there?  Okay, I think we have everybody but the PICA.  So,  why don't we go ahead and move forward and hopefully she can join us as she comes back in.  So item 5.4 is the Internal Affairs Committee recommendations and we have a variety of them.  We'll turn it over to Vice Mayor Reynolds at this time and I can just give you each title.  Do you want to, let me ask you this, Vice Mayor, do you want to talk about each one individually  in a particular order or as the order goes?  So, if you have a particular order on the agenda, will that work?  Mayor Coolidge, could I just interject?  Sure, sure.  We have to, we need to take them in the order so that each one has to be handled individually.  Okay.  If that would be okay with the council.  No, I think that's fine.  I was just wondering if she wanted to address all of them.  So we need to address each one individually then.  It needs an individual action on each one.  All right.  We'll have to take speakers on each of those, Andrew.  So, I wouldn't mess it up.  Yeah.  No, I see that.  So, okay.  So, then we'll start with A, the review of rental registry and sex trafficking ordinance.  Go ahead and give us some background here if you would.  Just a little background that was brought forward by a previous council and was talked about.  And we decided not to move forward on that.  The recommendation is to not do that.  I do want to address one of the things that Carla talked about earlier.  Being the.  the massage parlors. That is something that is still going to be talked about. And we can talk  about that when we get down to five, I think it's B or C on code enforcement, because that actually  would need to be taken care of by our Chico municipal codes. And that is something that  will be talked about at a future time. So not that we're not worried about sex trafficking.  It is definitely something that's a concern for a city, but doing a rental registry and all that  right now, that's just, that was the recommendation of the internal affairs.  Okay. Madam Clerk, do we have speakers on this item or are there, well, let's do this first.  Are there any questions for Vice Mayor or any of the other members of the committee?  It's just a point of clarification. This is Alex, that the sex trafficking ordinance  was the massage parlor ordinance. So those two things are one in the same. So it's a little  confusing the way things are worded here, but I'm really glad to hear that that conversation's  continuing.  All right. Good deal. Any further questions? All right. Madam Clerk, moving on to speakers.  Do we have any speakers on this item with their hand raised currently?  No.  All right.  Wait, hold on. I'm sorry. No, we do not.  Okay. So any council action or ready to move on to the next one?  Move to approve.  So,  we just approved the recommendation. Second that?  I'll second that.  All right.  I'll happily give my second over to Council Member O'Brien.  Okay. Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  No.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Council Member Nitin?  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  Yes.  Council Member Nitin?  actually going to be moved to a future internal affairs meeting. We had somebody abstinent and we  are looking at having somebody bring a presentation into us. So once we have all that done and all the  information gathered, then we will bring a recommendation back later. So I just wanted  to update everybody and let them know, let you know, we're still working on it.  Okay. And should we probably still have speakers on that item, Madam Clerk?  You should, if we have any hands up and I do not see any.  All right. So that item will come back.  Okay. We don't need to make a motion to do that or do we?  No, it was just an update because it originated with the council and we're trying to bring back  updates to the council as to where those items go and where they've been.  Yep. Yeah, I believe that was my send, but okay. Moving on to item C, housing committee  recommendations. Vice Mayor?  So we had Mr.  Vig gives us a wonderful update in that internal affairs meeting and the direction for coming  forward and recommendation back was not to pursue inclusionary zoning element that was brought  forward by a previous council as that's already taken care of in our housing update. And if Mr.  Vig has anything to add to that, you can gladly add to that if you'd like.  Not much, just to share that I kind of gave an update that,  most of the recommendations that were provided by the housing committee were being pursued,  acknowledged that we hadn't begun pursuing anything related to inclusionary.  It's a major undertaking, a major capital project, significant staff time and resources.  And then out of that came the internal affairs committee's recommendation that we should not  be pursuing inclusionary zoning at this time. All right. Any questions on this item?  No.  For either.  Vice Mayor Vig or Vice Mayor Reynolds?  All right.  And so on this one we need to.  We need a motion to accept that.  Motion.  Just a quick question. We're taking public comment on all of these items at the end of this review?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  No, we're taking them individually.  Yeah, individually.  Public comment on all the items individually as well?  Yeah.  Okay. I was going to make comments, but I wanted to wait until after public comment if there was public comment.  Yeah, no problem. Do we have any speakers on this item?  I now have one, Jessica Giannola.  Okay.  When you're ready.  I could have it confused, but inclusionary zoning, I believe it had to do with the allowance of certain percentage of lower income units set aside.  And that is something we absolutely need. If I'm wrong, I'm sure you'll correct me.  But that is something that we should always discuss and always keep in the forefront of discussion with our housing code.  Anything that we're doing with housing moving forward, that always has to be at the forefront of our discussions.  And I encourage you to please reconsider if you're deciding not to discuss that this time.  Now is the time. Thank you.  All right.  Any further comments from anyone from the public?  I have one more comment.  I think we have one from Carlin Mezzo.  Okay.  Hello.  I think I have this figured out a little bit better.  But I wanted to comment under the sex trafficking item A.  Is that correct?  Well, we already moved forward on that one, unfortunately.  I didn't hear any request for comment on the first two items that were discussed.  We did.  We didn't have speakers.  Okay.  Would counsel make an exception?  This is a confusing item.  I know that this person has been waiting to speak on that.  Yeah.  I don't have a problem with making the exception.  Why don't we just let her speak?  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Just ask Andrew.  Yes.  Go ahead, Ms. Martin.  Are we going to do that every time somebody wants an exception?  Are we going to do that every time somebody wants an exception?  No.  But I would agree with.  The way that this is framed, it's 5.4% of the time.  Okay.  So, I'm going to ask for a, b, c, d, and e.  If I were looking at this agenda, I would assume it was being taken in aggregate, and  the comment would be on item 5.4.  That's why I'm requesting this allowance.  This person has been waiting for the sex trafficking item.  It was referenced as a code enforcement item.  It was referenced as a sex trafficking item.  It's been very confusing.  I'm asking for a special allowance for this particular person, given those details.  Yeah.  And that's the only reason why I would agree.  This is a very confusing item.  This is an issue.  And I know this person has been waiting to speak on that particular item.  So, because they did, in fact, speak at the beginning and asked to be called on that.  And I should have probably made note of that.  So, all right.  Why don't we go ahead with it.  Three minutes.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Yes.  It's a big concern of mine.  I don't know if many of you know.  You can certainly research it in the newspaper.  But in 2020, we did have a misogyny.  parlor that was shut down on mangrove avenue for sex trafficking there was a ring connected to it  in anderson and and all over and i just hope to emphasize to you how easy it is in the city of  chico to open a massage business you need to have no hours of education you do not need a background  check you do not need to be fingerprinted and you don't have to have any kind of a certificate  i am a massage therapist practicing in the city of chico i'm voluntarily certified with the state  of california i'm fingerprinted background check i have over a thousand hours of education  and in every town that i've worked in um bigs gridley yuba city um  looked into orland red bluff all of those cities require a minimum amount of uh education  background checking fingerprinting to be able to even get a license and so um  mr coolidge if you wanted to you could just go to the building  uh commission right now get yourself a license to open a massage business co-write yourself a  little building on east avenue that's got an apartment attached to it stick up a massage sign  and uh not see anybody for a year if you wanted to and that'd be a really good way for let's just say  Theoretically, you had nefarious friends to be trafficking money through your business, and there's no oversight.  So if any of you are interested in putting that on an agenda, I'd be very happy to serve as a member of an advisory committee for you free of charge.  And thank you very much.  All right, Carla.  And make note that that item will be coming back through the code enforcement aspects in the Internal Affairs Committee, which you can find out about online.  Okay, thank you.  Yes.  She was our only speaker on that.  Okay.  And so the Housing Committee recommendations is still the item that we're on, which is item C.  Council Member Brown, I believe you had some comments.  Yeah, thanks, Mayor Colgen.  Thanks for allowing.  That speaker to speak.  Obviously, at the last meeting, I requested a little bit more conversation on particularly inclusionary zoning, which was an aspect of the Housing Committee recommendations.  And so I'd like to make some comments for the record.  I can see where this is going.  I think it's premature.  I think it's unwise.  I think it's especially unwise, given that we are about to engage in a broader conversation, as discussed last meeting, about a housing element update.  And this.  This item was included as a request in our previous housing element.  And so I think there should be more room for public discourse and conversation about it as a housing tool.  But all local data points to the ongoing stark reality that we are overproducing above moderate income housing to the tune of 166 percent and severely underproducing low income and very low income to the tune of under 3 percent as of 2019.  Those numbers have slightly changed.  They have not changed significantly.  What that tells me is that we've been doing so far certainly isn't working, especially when you compare it to the needs of the people in our community and to that data.  Lack of land has long been the argument for lack of affordable housing.  But we have two major developments coming forward that span a lot of land and special planning areas, Valley's Edge, Barber Yard, and a potential development partnership with CSU Chico on Lost Park.  And no assurance is that those developments will do anything to lessen our affordable housing crisis.  And to me, that's quite a shame.  I'd like to see more of a requirement than a hope for affordable housing.  But at the very least, I think it's prudent that we look at how these developments that I just listed can support best practices and affordable housing development like we did in the past with Merriam Park.  And the way to do that is to implement some kind of affordability requirement, then to support those developments in whatever ways we can to receive tax credits, subsidies, incentives from the city.  I'm no expert on inclusionary zoning.  I don't pretend to be.  But I do see the data.  And I'm certain that we owe it to the next decade of Chicoans to consider how development will or will not affect them or leave them behind, depending on how much money they make.  Relying solely on the state for adequate funding isn't enough.  Relying solely on nonprofits isn't enough.  And relying on land becoming available isn't enough.  History has very clearly demonstrated that.  So I'd hope that we'd consider a more active rather than a passive approach, more robust public discussion, council and community education about.  And really, it really is a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to share a moment to  zoning policy for certain developments,  particularly in special planning areas.  All right, we have a motion.  Do we have a second?  All right, motion fails for lack of a second.  All right, do we have any further discussion  from council or motions?  Any other motions?  I'll move to approve  the Internal Affairs Committee recommendation.  All right, we have a motion.  Do we have a second?  I'll second the motion.  Okay, we have a motion and a second.  Madam Clerk, can you take the roll?  Council Member Bennett?  Yes.  Council Member Brown?  Absolutely not.  Council Member Morgan?  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien?  Yes.  Council Member Tandon?  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge?  Aye.  Carries six one.  All right, moving on to item D,  downtown card room discussion.  Vice Mayor Reynolds?  So we had a current card room holder in,  a license holder within the city of Chico,  wishing to potentially move downtown  and had a proposal of bringing a self voluntary,  a voluntary, a tax or a fee or a community benefit fee  that he wanted to pay by being able to move downtown.  It was discussed in Internal Affairs  that the best way for us to move forward  would be for him to actually apply for the license.  And then Mr. Veague could take it from there  and bring it back to us, and let us know,  if there is a zoning change,  if anything needs to be done,  rather than us putting money out up front to make a change,  let him apply, go through the process.  And if that process goes through and comes back to us,  once he applies, then we can see it as a council in full,  if needed via staff.  So that was the recommendation is just to allow him  to process through and not have us take any action on it.  Can I ask a quick clarifying question, Vice Mayor Reynolds?  Absolutely.  This may be for staff.  Is it standard to,  when a request comes forward that doesn't align with code  for staff to bring a code change potential to the council,  or am I missing a piece here?  I can try to answer that.  So Mr. Scott's requesting,  our code currently doesn't allow card rooms  in the downtown North Zoning District.  And so this was something that was contemplated  three, four years ago.  There wasn't support for it,  for a variety of reasons at that time.  He has requested again,  that council at least consider this.  I think he's trying to get a temperature read  from the city council,  but we don't want the council to presuppose  the determination until it's gone through a full analysis,  gotten a recommendation from all staff  and then the planning commission  and ultimately a decision by council.  So what the IAC did was heard his position  and what he was offering and the recommendation to council now,  is that,  Mr. Scott pursue a code amendment, which is allowed.  It's one of our applications  that the card room would be appropriate with a use permit.  And so that's what he would be pursuing.  So he'd be pursuing a code amendment  that would allow a card room in the downtown North  with a use permit.  He'd be pursuing those simultaneously.  And then the other thing that I think  vice mayor was trying to share was that  he's also making this offer of a revenue generation.  And so the recommendation, which is,  was kind of light in the way that it's phrased for you guys  is to pursue coordination with the city attorney  to determine how best that would be manifested.  So that's the recommendation from the IAC.  And I, that's a reasonable thing that we do allow people  to say, hey, I don't think the code is appropriate  that this use should be allowed.  And that could be analyzed.  And I think the point is it would come at his cost.  He would do the application.  He would submit the fees.  And we'd pursue that.  Oh, that makes sense, Mr. Vig.  Thank you for the clarification.  So, so is it standard for when somebody  pursues a code amendment,  is there a specific process it goes through  to go to legislative bodies?  Yes, it's Title 19 and all changes to Title 19  go to the planning commission first  for a recommendation to city council.  Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Vig.  Very much appreciate it.  Thank you.  All right, further questions?  All right, do we have any speakers on the side?  I have a question about what?  Oh, go ahead, Sean.  Mayor Kulich.  Go ahead.  What if there's multiple,  what if there's multiple applicants?  Right now it's only one, but is there anything,  would we look at each one of them individually  as a use agreement?  Other portions of our code have limitations  on the number of card rooms in the city  and the number of tables.  So, and there's also been a boycott or, you know,  I'm not sure of the proper word.  There are no more allowances for state permits for card rooms.  Mr. Scott happened to have the last one available to him  in our jurisdiction.  So there wouldn't be this outgrowth of card rooms  in the downtown north,  but that would also be analyzed and prepared  for council's consideration.  Perfect, Mr. Vig, thank you.  Okay.  All right, Madam Clerk,  do we have any speakers on this side?  No, we do not.  All right, entertain a motion.  Or do we have any more?  All right, Madam Clerk.  Second.  We have a motion from Council Member Morgan,  a second from Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Madam Clerk.  Mayor Kuhl, that's a good question.  Do we need to make a motion to approve?  I mean, he's got to submit his application,  otherwise we're voting on nothing.  Yeah.  All right.  Do we, the recommendation was to give general direction  for Mr. Scott to pursue the code amendment.  There was no approval of that, what he's pursuing.  Right. Okay.  All right, so we'll stick with the motion in the second  and go from there.  Madam Clerk, can you take the roll?  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Sure.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Aye.  Mayor Coolidge. Aye.  Carries 7-0.  All right, the last item on item 5.4 is E,  pedicab bar pub crawl,  which is quite the tongue twister.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  This is very similar to the last one  and the approach we took at it in IAC.  We would advise Mrs., I can never say her name,  Arianna to pursue the pedicab and go for the code amendment  if that's what she would like to do.  And then we would, I think,  we can deal with it at that time,  not expending any staff time or dollars prematurely.  I have not heard from this particular person  that was interested in doing this in the last,  I don't know, it's been six or eight months or so.  So I don't even know that it's a use  that she is still interested in doing in Chico.  So I just recommend that we do essentially nothing.  Okay.  All right.  Questions, comments?  Any speakers on this item?  No, we do not have any.  All right.  So probably need to do this one  with the motion as well, Madam Clerk.  The recommendation is to direct staff to advise her  that she submit, so yes.  Okay.  So moved on my part.  So do we have a second?  Okay. I'll second that.  All right.  Motion by myself and a second by Council Member Tandon,  if you could take the roll.  Council Member Bennett.  Yes.  Council Member Brown.  Aye.  Council Member Morgan.  Yes.  Council Member O'Brien.  Yes.  Council Member Tandon.  Yes.  Vice Mayor Reynolds.  Yes.  Mayor Coolidge.  Aye.  Carries seven zero.  All right.  Item 5.5 items added to the posting after the agenda.  We do not have any.  Item 6, reports and communications.  The following reports and communication items  are provided for the Council's information.  No action can be taken on the items under this section  unless the Council agrees to include it  on a subsequent agenda.  So item 6.1, it's a verbal report  from City Manager Mark Orme.  Happy New Year.  Happy 2022.  Just wanted to say that city staff  is ready and ramped up for 2022.  We anticipate this is going to be an extremely busy year,  a year of high expectations.  A year of high expectations.  And I think that's what we're going to do.  And we are looking forward  to helping support this city council proceed  on making things happen in a positive effect.  So just wanted to say thank you for the honor  of allowing your city team to support you.  And we look forward to a really wonderful 2022 with that.  That concludes my report.  All right.  Thank you very much, Mr. Orme.  Any Council Member requests item 6.2 pursuant to APMP 1010.  Council Members may verbally request an item  to be agendized at a future meeting.  After stating what the item would be,  a majority vote of the council is needed  in order for staff to agendize.  Council Members may also submit the request in writing.  Any Council Members wishing to make a request?  All right.  Seeing none, we will move on to item 6.3,  which is the 2021 Development Impact Fee Report,  which is information only,  which moves us on to item seven, which is closed session.  Do we have any public comments on closed session?  Any raised hands?  Anyone wishing to speak on closed session?  So this is Debbie, not Stina.  I'm on Stina's computer.  Mine just went dead.  There are no comments from the public on closed session.  All right.  Any Council disqualifications on any of the items  listed on the closed session agenda?  All right.  With that, we will move into closed session.  If Council can make a note,  we will take a five minute recess  before proceeding into closed session.  And correct me if I'm wrong.  Here we have another link  that we have to click on, correct?  That is correct.  There's a separate link for closed session.  All right.  Council, if you can find that link  and we will meet you there in five minutes.  Thank you everyone.  All right. Thank you.
