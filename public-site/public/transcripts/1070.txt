 serving as a business manager currently, I can reassure both the commission and the public that  I've had no active role in developing any of the documents that have been created by the  Environmental Council, and so my fingerprints are not on that document at all. I certainly  have read it now that it's been sent in, but otherwise it was not a participant.  Great, thank you. And how about to my right?  Sure. Also along the same lines, I'm on the board of Butte Environmental Council,  but I was not involved in creating those comments, although I have had some community  member conversations recently, like after the last meeting with our community members who spoke up.  Thank you. And Commissioner Cooper? Okay, and I have none. So we will turn it over.  Marie or Brendan? Marie, thank you.  Good evening.  Chair Scott, Vice Chair Ober, and Planning Commissioners. Again, I'm Marie Demers,  and as you know, we're continuing the discussion of the draft 2022 Housing Element Update of the  General Plan from the June 2nd meeting. The Housing Element project was guided  and facilitated by our consultant Housing Tools, and Sherry Murgato, James Coles,  and Jessica Candela are all here from Housing Tools this evening to provide us with an  introduction and a recap of the process. And Community Development Director Brendan Beegle,  share some recommendations prior to discussions and public content.  And with that, share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share  share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share  share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share  share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share  So this evening what we wanted to start out with is as we considered the  comments and the questions from the Planning Commission at your last meeting  as well as members of the public, we thought it would be beneficial to  briefly revisit the topics of the regional housing needs allocation and  the adequate sites inventory which I will be covering. And then Community  Development Director Brendan Veague will review the themes from the June 2nd  meeting and the staff recommendations regarding some revisions to the housing  program. So on the regional housing needs allocation referred to as the RHNA,  as we discussed to a certain extent this is really the foundation of the housing  element process from HCD's point of view. The purpose of it is to determine the  amount of housing that must be planned for to accommodate future growth  segmented by income levels and this is done between the State Department of  Housing and Community Development and each  regional planning organization and in Butte County that is the Butte County  Association of Governments. So the State and BCAG use a variety of demographic  data to look into the future basically to project what they think future growth  is going to be. Then BCAG coordinates this calculation basically with HCD to  arrive at a final figure and then BCAG is responsible for allocating this  housing need between the cities and the county and BCAG does this in something  called a regional housing  needs allocation plan, a RHNA plan. And if you visited the City of Chico Housing  Element website we actually have that RHNA plan on the website if you would  like to review it. Regarding the adequate sites inventory, so what this is is it's  an exercise to demonstrate that there are an adequate number of appropriately  zoned sites within the city that can accommodate the regional housing needs  allocation and this is a requirement for  every jurisdiction preparing a housing element by HCD that you must go through  this adequate sites inventory. The sites must meet HCD's criteria for size and  development feasibility. HCD issues a multi-page guidance on how to do the  adequate sites inventory and there's a number of criteria that size and  development feasibility are especially important when considering sites. The  included sites must demonstrate that they can feasibly be developed within  the housing element planning period and so for this housing element cycle that's 2022 to 2030.  Inclusion of sites in the adequate sites inventory does not mean that they are required  to be developed with affordable housing. In addition, sites that are not included in the  adequate sites inventory can be developed with affordable housing. The adequate sites inventory  that is included in chapter 5 of the draft housing element does not include any sites  subject to redevelopment. We did not use accessory dwelling units or special planning areas and the  reasons for this is that there were more than enough adequate vacant sites that meet the HCD  criteria without using sites in any of these three categories. If the City were to add sites from  those three categories then HCD requires a very detailed analysis to show the feasibility  of using those sites. With that being said, if affordable housing is developed during this  housing element cycle in one of these three categories, for example someone builds an ADU  with an affordability covenant restricting its rents or if an office building is converted to  housing with an affordability covenant then that project would be counted toward meeting  the City's RHNA in that year's annual progress report.  We also wanted to describe how a fair housing analysis is included in the adequate sites  inventory. So again, this is a requirement of AB 686 and it was informed by guidance from HCD.  An affirmatively furthering fair housing analysis of the adequate sites inventory can be found on  pages 255 to 266 of the draft housing element. The analysis is required to identify, map,  and evaluate sites on specified topics and these topics include concentration by income and race,  ethnicity, and access to areas of opportunity. A summary of conclusions and an approach to  policies and actions is then produced based on these findings. Some of the highlights from this  fair housing analysis of adequate sites inventory. We found that very low and low income sites as  well as moderate and above moderate income sites were not considered as fair housing.  We found that very low and low income sites can be found in at least 10 different census tracks in  the City. We found that sites for all income levels can be found in the north, east, south,  and west areas of the City. The majority of very low and low sites are in close proximity to transit  stops. And then actions 1.1.2, 1.4.1, 1.6.1, and 1.7.1 in the housing program all address balanced  and integrated living. We found that very low and low income sites are in close proximity to transit  stops. And then actions 1.1.2, 1.6.1, and 1.7.1 in the housing program all address balanced  patterns in the City as a result of this analysis.  And just briefly this is a reminder this is the chart that we that we showed at the last  presentation and is in the housing element. This just describes the affordability tiers  for the RHNA, the number of units that you've been allocated, the number of sites that the site  inventory is able to accommodate within each income category, and then the total surplus of  sites that the City has. We found that very low and low income sites are in close proximity to transit  stops. And then actions 1.1.2, 1.6.1, and 1.7.1 in the housing program all address balanced  And I'll turn it over to Brendan.  I'm not picking up the themes.  You're not picking up the themes? Oh, I am. Oh, okay. Sorry about that.  All right. Themes from the June 2nd Planning Commission meeting. And I know that these are  included in your staff report. RHNA Production. Some questions that were asked were how can we,  share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share  How can we encourage affordable housing development  in areas of opportunity with access to good schools,  jobs, parks, and high quality infrastructure?  There were some questions about moderate income housing.  How can we encourage the development of housing  affordable to moderate or middle income households?  And if you look at attachment B of the staff report,  we have a listing of the specific housing element actions  which address all of these things.  And now I'll turn it over to Brendan.  Brendan.  Good evening, Chair, Vice Chair, and Council.  How are you tonight?  I'm just gonna touch on a few of the recommendations  that were included in the staff report,  and then some additional recommendations,  and then provide some context on some of the other  recommendations that we've received.  So again, as a reminder, there are several recommendations  already included in the staff report,  which we've also now put up on the screen.  You may remember, we brought these to the last meeting,  and then we've refined them a little bit.  But again, that we need to carefully review consistency  of the adequate site's inventory with the housing element text  in appendix B.  There was some information that we found that was old drafts.  And so we clarified that we need to look into that.  We also acknowledged from the letter about some of the flood  plains or environmentally sensitive areas or areas that are  irregular parcels that maybe had some development.  And so we are recommending that we remove three sites from the  adequate sites inventory that we think have these constraints.  And we agree to add two new sites that are more appropriate  based on state qualification criteria.  And then we shared the last meeting that we had a new action  to amend the general plan and the municipal code to clarify  that all residential commercial zoning districts within the COS  overlay benefit from higher allowable residential densities,  not just the mixed use designations.  And that's a practice we've had,  but we want to make sure we clarify that and make those  amendments to the code.  So in addition, city staff and housing tools,  our consultant carefully reviewed and considered all the  comments and recommendations received to date.  And we support two additional actions.  We saw a major theme in the comments received related to  increasing densities along corridors and utilizing the  city's already available corridor opportunity overlay.  To capture many of the specific recommendations, I believe a more general  action that captures the specific recommendations would be more  appropriate and therefore recommend the following action.  The new action would read, as part of a future municipal code  update, investigate opportunities to apply the corridor opportunity  site overlay to additional areas and corridors within the city with  an emphasis on transit priority areas and major transit stops.  So again, I think a broader initiative as opposed to the  specificity of the many comments we received would be appropriate,  given that it would be a major work  program, something that would be brought forward to the Planning  Commission in that more workshop framework.  We also saw a number of comments and suggestions related to  short-term rentals and agree the following action would also be  appropriate.  Investigate and monitor trends of short-term rentals in Chico to  ensure they do not substantially inhibit the availability of  housing for local renters or potential home buyers.  So while I believe there are many other recommendations and  suggestions that are excellent, I want to highlight several general  themes for why city staff and housing tools are important.  First, the city's general plan is a framework that supports  This is important.  First, in many cases, there are already goals, policies, and  actions in other portions of the city's general plan related to  the proposed recommendations.  For example, there's an entire policy framework in the  sustainability element of the city's general plan about  reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which was recently  reinforced in the climate action plan update, which was approved  by the city council late last year.  Further, actions that support infill development,  densification, and support for development in the downtown for  promoting greater residential density along the city's major  corridors are found both in the land use and the downtown  elements.  In other cases, there are some recommendations that are simply  inconsistent with the general plan's overarching framework.  So the general plan's introduction addresses three  distinct areas within the city, areas of stability, areas of  potential change, and areas for new growth, while the general plan's underlying  land use theme is a compact urban form.  It also recognizes that not all areas are suited for significant  new growth.  Areas of stability are those parts of the city that are, quote,  not anticipated to change substantially in character, land  use, or development intensity.  These areas of stability include most of the city's existing  residential neighborhoods.  Therefore, recommendations to densify single-family neighborhoods are  inconsistent.  The state has already stepped in with legislation that trumps local  control that promotes accessory dwelling units, and more recently,  Senate Bill 9 that allows duplexes in single-family  residential neighborhoods.  Another theme I want to highlight is that some of the recommendations  have already been implemented.  For example, the proposed new residential housing plan is  a new  The city has already adopted a tiered fee structure that  incentivizes smaller units and ADUs.  Also, the city reduced parking requirements across the board by  20% as part of a comprehensive code update in 2013, which also included further reductions for parking along the corridor opportunity sites.  And the final theme I want to highlight is that there are some recommendations that council has recently shared they have no interest in pursuing, like inclusionary zoning.  At this time, staff and the consultant are available for any questions and the  of the planning commission might want to have.  Great, thank you.  Before we get into questions, I just really want to thank you for Attachment B.  I felt like that was incredibly helpful, especially to navigate the tone of the conversation, but to have the actual actions and impact was really helpful to frame for today.  So thank you, whoever's brilliance was that.  Any questions to my left?  Yes, please.  I'll take this opportunity to announce that I have read all the materials from the last meeting and viewed the tape from it.  So I believe I'm pretty up to speed on what's going on here.  Just one quick question, Brendan.  You mentioned that it appears to staff that there's some redundancy in some of the language or proposed language in some revisions to the housing element  that is, to one extent or another, perhaps already in the general plan.  I guess my question is, is that really a problem?  I mean, if the housing element echoes or reinforces some of the things that the general plan is stating, that isn't necessarily a problem.  It doesn't create a conflict.  It maybe just is a way to say, you know, almost like doubling down on some of those themes maybe.  Yeah, no, I agree with that statement.  But I want to make sure that they...  Ultimately are consistent.  Yeah.  Yeah, there are, in fact, within the general plan margins, there are references to other policies that have similarities within different elements.  As you can imagine, there would be.  Right.  Okay, thank you.  Anything to my right?  I have some questions, but I think I can ask them after the public hearing.  Okay.  Okay.  I think we'll move on to the public.  Okay.  Nicole, how many speaker cards do you have?  We have six speakers tonight.  Okay.  That's more than we had last time.  And then if anybody does want to speak that's here, make sure you get a speaker card in so we can get you in the queue.  And we will do three minutes per speaker.  Nicole, if you could give us our first speaker, and we'll welcome you to the podium.  Our first speaker is Susan, and then it will be Addison.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right. Nice to see you again. My name is Susan Trudy.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  committee for Beck so I'm familiar with all of the work of Beck and was not  involved in the process of creating Beck's response but appreciate what's  done. One of the things that Brendan just said that I think makes it difficult for  people who are wanting to comment on what we see needs to be done is that  maybe some of our recommendations appear in other parts of the general plan or in  some other element and I think that makes it really difficult to know what  you can talk about what you can suggest what possibilities can be available to  us because one of the things that I've been paying attention to lately is the  environmental justice element which is just in process it's just beginning  and I think that's a really important part of what we're doing.  But it will be a part of this general next general plan and so it seems to me  that there are some I guess overlap or maybe repetitions of the two different  elements or they will be as we look at the analysis of it. One of the things  that I think is really important in the new in in that there are seven areas  that  that the.  That the environmental justice and when they talk about environmental they don't  mean just nature environment the whole world in which we live and those elements  are pollution and exposure and air quality food access public facilities  safe and sanitary homes physical activity civil and community engagement  and improvements and programs will address the needs of disadvantaged communities and  so I think I see a lot in.  What that element will be talking about and so I would like it to be clear to us when.  In kind of a mister over what you were saying.  That it's not a problem if there's overlap but it would be good to know when things are consistent or inconsistent with each other I think that some of the things that are in point important housing and.  I'm.  And so both elements will be calling for that and so we need it if we're doubling down on it and it seems like a really important thing we should make sure.  Happens affordable and sustainable housing of course that's the major purpose of what we're doing.  Remediation and education remediation and reduction of.  Pollution.  A lot of the affordable housing right now is in unsafe unclean areas and one of the things that I'm concerned about as we're looking at a new housing element is my time up.  It is okay let me can I finish yes you may okay thank you is that we don't get a wise for people.  Great thank you.  Addison and then who's Addison is up next and then Katie Toma okay thank you.  I have the privilege of representing environmental council and supporting more better housing and walkable communities with good quality public transportation.  The conversation the feedback I've received have been have been really motivating I don't believe that 10 years ago subjects like density and low income housing would have found such broad support.  It's in the shadow of major disasters and the threat of climate change the dismal prospects of our municipal services.  And the desire to see younger generations.  Working class in the aging population.  But as you know as you share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share  not really tell us. There is no cart. There is no horse. We're sitting on our butts on the ground.  We have to acknowledge that the vision we've had for our communities is not being realized.  The policies to restrain change in existing neighborhoods, locking the majority of land  into the areas of stability is working quite well if you consider dirt roads and sewer failure to  be compatible with the neighborhood character. The vision for redevelopment in areas with overbuilt,  underutilized infrastructure miles from downtown has failed, is failing, and it was a mistake  to exclude the better parts of our transit network from the possibility of redevelopment.  It was a mistake to prohibit incremental development of our central neighborhoods  near Bidwell Park and the Esplanade, the public luxuries that make this such a beautiful,  lovable city that more people deserve to have the opportunity to enjoy.  It was a mistake to think that the city could dam and divert investment in new housing from  the areas of natural abundance to the areas we think deserve it more, like the state water  project takes water from the north state to the desert regions of the south. And it was  a mistake to think that the city could dam and divert investment in new housing from  mistake to think we could reconcile a priority for car parking with the vision of having housing  downtown. And we didn't know where this, that this is where we would be over a decade into our  general plan, but we have to take what we know now and adapt. There was no council direction in the  preparation of this housing element. What we have is state law, our general plan goals, policies,  objectives, and leadership of those of you occupying those seats should you choose to accept that  responsibility. Chico is not guaranteed to succeed as a city. The state and federal government will  not solve our housing crisis. What the city can do now is employ better actions to meet our goals.  And that's what we're asking for here tonight. Thank you.  Thank you. Katie and then who's after Katie? Jared Geiser. Okay.  Good evening, Madam Chair, Vice Chair, and Commissioners. My name is Katie Thoma and I'm  the Executive Director of the Chico Builders Association. Let me start off by saying that  thank you for accepting this opportunity. I'm a member of the Chico Builders Association.  My share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share share  my opinion. But I'm here tonight pretty much to reiterate what I said at  your last meeting. We need housing. We need all housing. We appreciate  Commissioner Goldstein's recommendations, but find them incomplete. There's no  mention in meeting the RHNA goals for moderate and above moderate income  households. We notice that the housing element, there were significant  references to housing for very low and low income housing. Many  references were made to government programs and subsidies for the building  of very low and low income housing. There's no mention of programs for those  who build develop for moderate and above moderate income households. We found this  very interesting and quite frankly disingenuous because of the report  figure 30. The RHNA allocation for the 2022-2030 shows the greatest number of  units allocated for moderate and above is for moderate and above moderate  households. They're not  allocated for moderate and above moderate. There are no strategies noted to meet  this allocation. Let me mention again as I did for two weeks ago, the need for  housing for moderate and above moderate households will be higher than the  housing element states due to the fact that the Enloe Medical Center will  be building a new cancer center and we understand that there will be over a  hundred people who will be employed by the cancer center who will be likely  above moderate income. We also are hearing of another less known business  who is expanding and will be providing a good number of high paying jobs who will  have a need for housing. These are folks who are going to need a place to live.  The housing element does not address housing market conditions. The folks who  are going to be develop property and building housing are faced with many  challenges including conforming to state regulation, the ongoing increase in impact of  impact and user fees, high material costs, and a lack of labor. And now the high  cost of capital, just today the Fed raised the interest rate by three quarters of a  percent and we're expecting that rate to go up again another three quarters of a  percent in July. Couldn't there be strategies developed to overcome some of  these challenges? So here's a real-life challenge for you. A builder, a for-profit  builder cannot build a multi-family unit and rent any of those apartments for  less than a thousand dollars. So what are some of the challenges that are going to be  addressed?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Can we ask a question?  Yes, Katie, could you come back up?  I'm curious as director of the Chico Builders Association if there are any  strategies that you see as applicable to especially moderate housing removing barriers to building  that.  For what? I didn't hear the last part.  Sorry. If there are any strategies, actions, things that you might see as good  for removing barriers to building that.  I think the cost of fees is a significant barrier and I wish I had those with me but  the impact fees and the user fees are significant. Now the user fees, that's a cost recovery  so maybe not talk about that so much but the impact fees. So for example, an impact fee,  a transportation fee, the way the municipal code works and I'm really getting into the  weeds here but in the municipal code, the way the municipal code works is that the cost  of fees is a significant barrier. So the municipal code, when that rate is based on the CalTrans  rate, the CalTrans rate, well, that rate went down this year but the builders don't realize  the benefit of that because the municipal code doesn't say if the rate goes down then  their rate is going to go down. And I do want to say that next Tuesday at the council meeting,  the recommendation initially for impact fees was going to be 15.15% for the construction  index which is another factor.  So their recommendation is going to be 8% down from 15. And that's a whole other conversation  but that would be a significant contribution to get more building done for the moderate  and above moderate. And it's very exciting that this less well-known business is expanding  for some, they're really cool jobs and it's clean technology and it's something, it fits  the Chico vibe so we're excited about that.  But they need a place to stay.  Thank you, Katie.  Thank you.  Any other questions?  All right.  Next up is Jared.  And after Jared will be Elizabeth Devereaux.  Okay.  Good evening planning commissioners and staff.  I am here tonight to make a public comment on behalf of Alta Cal Audubon Society, a local  nonprofit here in Chico.  And so we're chiefly concerned with this housing element update in regards to how the implementation  of the plan will impact the bird habitat of this region as well as the community.  As well as climate change and so Alta Cal Audubon supports the recommendations made by the  Butte Environmental Council.  The wildlife habitat surrounding Chico's developed land needs to be protected from urban sprawl.  The diverse grassland, woodland and wetland ecosystems surrounding Chico provide crucial  habitat for a myriad of bird species and provides our community with vital ecosystem services  such as carbon sequestration, flood control, groundwater recharge and aesthetics.  So it is important when planning to meet our community goals that we need to be able to  housing needs to make certain that the planned developments in the daily lives of the future  residents will be climate neutral by 2045 to ensure consistency with the recently updated  climate action plan. For those of you who don't know, the recently updated climate action plan  has a 2045 target of zero metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year per capita.  And the housing element does not adequately consider climate change constraints in the  context of planning for future housing, especially in regards to SBA special planning  area developments, which have significant and unavoidable greenhouse gas emission impacts,  as well as in the inadequacy of goal number nine of the housing element of encouraging energy  efficiency in housing. While that is important, it is completely inadequate to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions from Chico's future housing developments. And so the National Audubon  Society released a report titled Survival by Degrees,  389.  birds on the brink. And this study found that two-thirds of bird species in North America are  in danger of extinction as a result of climate change, but that if we can reduce the global  warming, we can protect 76% of those. So our actions today have a significant impact in  the future of avian species in this country and in the future of human civilization here.  All right, so to meet the housing needs of Chico while protecting bird habitat and staying on track  to reach 2045 climate neutrality targets,  Chico needs to prioritize and scale up smart growth. So that means increasing zoning densities,  building up, not out, utilizing land more efficiently, increasing the density also improves  the efficiency and viability of public transit, thereby reducing gas-powered automobile dependency,  which is all pervasive in Chico, as we all know today. Another thing that can be done would be  allow housing above all commercial land uses in the urban core. So instead of developing these green  sites, that's healthy wildlife habitat, we need to be able to build a green habitat that is more  sustainable. So that's a big part of the plan. And then we need to improve the amount of increased  amount of housing that can be developed in the urban area by allowing commercial mixed use to be  the norm, not the exception. So increasing the mixed use within throughout the city.  In regards to the park opportunity site, I was troubled that the land in between park and  fair street was identified as industrial mixed use rather than residential mixed use. So using land  like that to drastically increase the amount of housing within the urban area would allow Chico to  meet the housing needs.  In a sustainable way.  Great. Thank you. Thanks for your comments.  Elizabeth Devereaux is next and then Jessica Ginola.  Okay. Good evening. I brought along something that we did in the 94 general plan.  A group of artists and architects and landscape architects got together and we, this is 28 years ago,  I think I mentioned that and it's a it's sort of a blueprint for smart growth in underutilized areas  in Chico and this is Park Avenue and 14th and I think one of the things that I was talking to  Brennan Beague about just a little earlier is you know there are the 1200 Park Avenue is a senior  housing and the one across Dannem freeze and Dannem freeze is a $1 billion share share share share share  the street that's going to go in. The only thing that, I mean, I think those are really good first  starts, and I'd like to see more mixed use. In other words, street attraction. And I think there's  nothing on the bottom. And he was saying that if it's affordable, they can't afford to put,  not to have housing in all floors. And I think that we need to find ways of dealing with that.  But, you know, I think basically I agree with Katie Toma about the fact that this is, you know,  300 pages of technical documents. And people like me, even who know something, it's intimidating  to a degree. But I think the bottom line for me is climate change. And that's why smart growth  makes a lot of sense. Because our children are going to inherit an inhabitable world,  if we don't reduce our carbon emissions. And this is a really appealing way of doing it.  It's not reinvent, it's, you know, it's something that has been going on for hundreds of years in  other, well, even in our own United States, but in different areas. And we don't have that here  in Chico. And I feel like this is an alternative, which is exciting. And it's a problem solver.  And it will create more community.  And it will create more safety. It brings more focus to downtown. And it revitalizes the downtown  by not only Park Avenue, but Mangrove. And downtown, I think, needs the same kind of focus  where we bring people to live in the space where the stores are. So I think you were asking last  week, do you need more transit corridors to create this and small electric buses that have  10 or 15-minute headways to create?  But you are asking for $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015  in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit  and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and  $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in  transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and  transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and  $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and $2015 in transit and  our vision looking forward for housing in our area.  I did hear a need for a request for the moderate and above income housing for  people who may be coming to Chico.  And I would hope that we're,  our focus moving forward will be on our existing population and the low  income portion of our population as low incomes,  just defined as a medium income or below.  So at or below and in Chico,  53,000 a year is our medium income.  That's $25 an hour.  I don't know very many people that make 25 an hour and a quarter of our  population is that or below.  So that's a quarter of our population that needs housing that we have not  been providing.  We've had a very low percentage of low income housing being developed and  what is available tends to be in areas of the city that are yes,  near transit,  but they're also in less ideal,  less wanted parts of town that will hold higher risks,  higher environmental risks,  possibly more pollutants in the area,  either environmental from the air or groundwater.  And so having a way that we can address this issue is building more low  income,  allowing for more buildings,  supporting more low income development in all parts of our city.  And just do that in film instead of,  you know,  building up into the foothills.  We should be building defensively.  So as we build farther up into the foothills,  we're also increasing the fire risk for the entire city as we do that.  So building closer and closer to schools,  stores,  transportation,  that's going to help overall.  Everything are the greenhouse,  greenhouse emissions.  I'm just keeping people healthy,  keeping in mind that not everyone has transportation and not everybody can  afford a bus.  So just keeping things more local to their housing.  And we should be,  we should be building that.  I'd like to see,  hopefully our city have more allowance for that multifamily build,  whether single family zoning right now,  address that,  make sure it's multifamily,  three,  three units,  four units,  creating two or three out of one that's existing,  having somewhere we can have even RVs or ADUs,  anything with that creative housing element.  That we need to address our,  our housing crisis that is right now.  Our housing crisis right now is because of a lack of,  of planning and implementation in the past.  And it's just caught up to us.  So moving forward,  we're going to try to mitigate that and provide more for our,  our fellow residents,  our neighbors.  Oh,  let's see that.  Anything else to add there?  I think that's,  that's good.  Yeah.  Um,  just,  just those things that I've went on.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Justice is next.  And then our last speaker chair is Leslie Johnson.  Okay.  Hi everyone.  Uh,  my name is justice Kusumoto and I am a concerned citizen here to,  uh,  reiterate my support of the Butte environmental council's recommendations.  And commissioner Goldstein's recommendations.  Uh,  we have a acute housing shortage here in Chico that will continue to be  exacerbated by future wildfires and surrounding parts of the County.  Uh,  and I believe that the housing element,  while a productive step forward,  uh,  is woefully insufficient,  uh,  to address the housing needs of our city and our region.  I call upon this commission to,  uh,  further up zone,  um,  a number of these sites,  uh,  and to emphasize sites that have high walkability and bike ability scores,  um,  particularly,  uh,  the open field next to the Newman Catholic center as a identified infill  development site.  Um,  I have also would strongly support any other sites in the,  uh,  inventory that have a walk score and a bike score above Chico's,  uh,  median,  uh,  which I believe the Butte environmental council has outlined.  Uh,  it's imperative that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions,  uh,  and that we focus not only on building more affordable housing,  but on walkable,  bikeable transit oriented housing.  I'm particularly,  I'm concerned that none of the quarter opportunity sites,  um,  are,  uh,  nor are in our close to North,  uh,  Bidwell park,  uh,  particularly in some of the higher income neighborhoods,  uh,  that's traditionally have been deeply segregated,  uh,  economically from,  uh,  less,  uh,  lower income parts of the city.  So I,  I call upon the commission to consider these recommendations,  uh,  to reiterate my support for commissioner Goldstein and the BEC recommendations,  but to move further,  to go far ahead of the bar that SB nine and SB 10 have set for,  uh,  planning policy.  Thank you for your time.  Leslie.  Leslie.  I'm going to go to the next speaker.  Chair Scott.  I just got another speaker card.  We'll take it.  Leslie.  Thank you for your letter that you submitted as well.  Oh,  you did receive that.  Thank you.  I was going to mention,  I did send a letter,  but it was,  it was just today.  So it was kind of last minute.  I,  um,  Leslie Johnson,  I represent chat.  Thanks for hearing from us today.  Um,  I do support,  uh,  a lot of the recommendations,  all the recommendations,  recommendations from back and others.  It seems really important that we increase density in the,  um,  the more central areas rather than spread out anymore for the other reasons  that were discussed.  But I wanted to highlight something that hasn't been talked about too much.  And that is another,  um,  aspect of how we can create more affordable housing units.  And that is with attention to,  um,  RVs and travel trailers.  Um,  it would be great to have,  uh,  more,  more zoning or zoning that facilitates opportunities for creating RV parks and,  um,  adjusting the rules as we have them now to allow for longterm occupancy in RV  parks,  at least during this period when we have such housing crunch and we have so  many people that are without any housing at chat.  We're working of course with that,  um,  the unhoused community a lot and trying like crazy to find every kind of way  that people can be housed.  And this really,  really seems like something that comes up a lot.  People will say,  I have an RV,  but I have no place to put it.  I'm going to be homeless.  There was one on the front page of paper today.  Um,  a person in that very situation,  and that's somebody who was a professional.  This is first time she's been homeless and she had a life before this.  And now she's in a situation where all she has left is this RV.  And,  um,  she's been threatened with potentially having an impounded,  potentially being cited.  She's already been cited.  Um,  and she's not the only person that's something that does come up a lot.  So if we had RV parks or even a safe parking area that the city might provide  for the period of this kind of emergency situation where people can park their  travel trailers and RVs,  it's a very inexpensive way to help people because they already have a home.  They're not just coming with nothing but a sleeping bag.  They have a place to live,  but they just need a little bit of help to have some place to put it.  The other aspect of that would be,  um,  allowing RVs in backyards.  We have a system for disaster recovery permitting to keep RVs in backyards.  It was passed off at a campfire,  but it's kind of limited.  If we could just expand that,  um,  that's been a problem for chat because we were using that,  but,  um,  the city kind of set a limit on it and it wasn't saying it wasn't really intended to be used on a larger scale.  It could be though,  and I'm,  I'm proposing that.  We take a look at that disaster recovery permitting.  It was scheduled to just last,  I think five years,  but it could go,  it could be extended to 10 years.  This is to allow an RV to be hooked up to the sewer,  to be hooked up to electricity and people could live there again.  Plenty of people have RVs or could get them.  We could get 10 donated to probably in a month if we just put something out on our,  our website.  So it's,  it is a way for people to get indoors and kind of take care of themselves rather than meet someone else to help them.  They just need that,  that opening and opportunity.  Leslie,  could I have you wrap up your comments?  I think we hit the time limit.  Yeah,  that's it.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  I just got a question.  Is there no availability at the parks for them to park there at night and hook up or during the day?  Trailer parks or trailer parks?  Cause they have RV.  A lot of them have RV spots,  don't they?  Or they do a lot of those.  Um,  they're kind of restrictive on,  um,  what they'll allow in.  They have to be newer and not older and they do charge a fee.  Of course,  some people have the income and some people don't.  Um,  some people might not have the,  um,  credit score that they would want or the income that they would want.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're also limited in a mobile home park.  RVs can be parked longterm,  but in an RV park,  they can only be there for up to 30 days.  They're,  they're seen as a,  as a recreational vehicle,  but in our,  in our community,  in this area,  this time and place,  it's,  they're a great resource for longterm housing.  Well,  hopefully not long,  long term,  but at least for the time being.  Thank you.  Anything else?  And our last speaker is Melody.  Good evening.  My name is Melody Prepstall.  I'm here on behalf of United Way of Northern California.  I wanted to share with you a few things that I have observed.  Um,  we've been very involved with,  uh,  helping with access to housing over the past three,  four years since the campfire essentially.  And,  um,  there's just some pieces that I've been hearing from other speakers that I thought would be worth reiterating.  Um,  one in particular is the fact that we still need that,  um,  housing for low,  moderate income,  um,  households.  We,  we have been providing assistance with getting into places.  So like,  we have the,  we have the financial means to get people into places.  Um,  the places do not exist.  We are helping people move to Paradise.  We're helping people move to Oroville,  helping people move to Magalia.  Even moving into Chico is extremely difficult to find anything.  So even if we are paying their six months of rent deposit,  those sorts of things,  they're still very difficult to find housing.  And so that is,  I think a piece that's really important for people to have in mind.  Um,  and,  and just like Leslie was just talking about with RVs,  that's also another thing that's been a huge challenge.  Um,  again,  after the campfire,  a lot of people found RVs,  were able to find a place to stay.  Um,  and the kind of the special accommodations have not stretched out.  Um,  and so here we are.  Um,  we had North complex fire survivors,  Dixie fire survivors,  all sorts of different,  you know,  we've had a lot,  unfortunately,  a lot of disasters in our area.  A lot of people displaced from their housing,  and so for many,  that's an opportunity.  Um,  we have paid United Way has paid for,  uh,  the fees for people to stay in,  uh,  mobile parks.  And,  and as Leslie said,  a lot of times they have to be a certain age or not,  not any older than a certain age,  have to have certain specific requirements that maybe people can't afford to get.  Um,  and we pay 500,  $1,200 a month for parking in an RV park.  It's not cheap.  So,  um,  it's not an ideal option,  but it certainly,  if there is,  is an affordable place for people to park their car,  their RVs.  Um,  I think that would be really helpful.  The other thing I wanted to share is with the,  um,  with COVID.  Of course,  we know that has been a huge financial strain on,  on everyone in our community.  And we have been providing non congregate shelter for people who are directly impacted by COVID or who,  um,  are very vulnerable to it.  And again,  we have funding for rapid,  rapid rehousing to get people into housing.  Um,  this is federal funds and the housing just is not there.  Um,  so just wanted to kind of put that out there in terms of thinking about housing stock and what's available.  It's not,  unfortunately.  Um,  and I think it's really important to have that in mind.  And I also just want to reiterate kind of the value of that access to,  uh,  transportation access to the downtown corridor area,  because if we're talking about people who have limited,  limited financial means,  the more access they can have to resources,  the better.  Thank you.  That is it.  That is it.  Okay.  We will close the public hearing,  um,  and bring it back to the commission.  They see us on,  right?  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm okay.  Turn it on.  We keep playing with it to try to keep it going.  It doesn't seem to want to sustain.  I just would love everybody to stay till the end.  We've contacted facilities and.  All right.  Any initial thoughts?  Commissioner Wall.  I have one question for staff.  Leslie Johnson brought up a good point about,  uh,  fifth wheel RV trailer parking.  Um,  what is the status within the city now for,  for that kind of parking on a safe space,  safe space or other,  uh,  acreage that can be used temporarily for people in that predicament?  Um,  madam chair and commissioners,  we still do have the disaster recovery permit system in place.  And that was intended to deal with,  uh,  originally the campfire survivors.  And that is still in place.  And,  and,  and,  and on occasion we do get people,  um,  that are,  they're still utilizing that.  We just,  you just saw one,  it's your last meeting for a temporary school,  um,  that went permanent.  Um,  but that was approved under the same system.  And just to provide a little additional context.  So we had that disaster recovery permit program and it was propped up just following the campfire,  right?  We had 20,000 residents overnight within our community,  even with that at the time,  very sympathetic viewpoint.  It was quite controversial.  And of the five to 10,  uh,  DRPs,  um,  several of them were appealed to the city council,  major concerns about changing the integrity of single family neighborhoods.  I just want it to be known it,  it wasn't like a,  a simple effort,  even given the magnitude of the campfire.  So just that context.  Where does a person with their RV go with their booter down at Comanche Creek here when it's their time to be,  uh,  to be moved?  To my question,  my understanding,  um,  I think their first line,  our first line of defense would be our homeless action team.  And they're the people that kind of deal with that.  Um,  Marie may have a better answer on that,  but I,  I,  it's my understanding there is a group of,  of different resource agencies that kind of,  uh,  are assigned to deal with them.  And I believe they can make referrals to,  to our,  um,  our,  um,  um,  housing that the city does provide.  Or,  or try to sort them in different,  based on whatever their needs are.  So,  um,  my understanding is that they're the,  the first line of defense,  so to speak,  that we have in,  in trying to,  uh,  assist those people to the most effective means that we have available.  Commissioner Wall,  it,  it,  it has been quite challenging,  um,  as folks that are,  um,  using their RVs in different locations up at the airport,  out by the Hagelin Business Park,  in Comanche Creek.  They're asked to move,  um,  and then they show up somewhere else.  And so there's been a lot of that going on.  Um,  this has all been in the context of homelessness in,  in,  in just in general.  Um,  the issue has come before council before about creating a place specifically for folks with RVs.  And while there was something near the west side of the airport at one point,  that kind of was shut down.  And council hasn't entertained another option to date,  but it's been before them on several occasions.  There are a lot of things that I want to,  um,  discuss,  but,  but just a couple of quick questions before I think we probably get into,  um,  into some of the meat.  Um,  I also was curious about the RV parking,  um,  simply focusing on that because,  because it's a relatively new,  new topic.  It's not a new concept on new issue,  um,  clearly,  but we have not discussed that as part of the,  um,  housing elements as far as I know.  So,  um,  I think probably,  um,  you've answered this,  but,  um,  is there a place,  uh,  I was trying to find it real quickly.  Is there a place,  um,  in the housing element where something like that could go if commission and ultimately the council,  um,  chose to do that?  Would there be a natural location in the housing element to address the idea of RV parking?  And if it's there already,  I apologize that I missed it.  I,  I would say,  and anybody else can chime in as well,  that,  that wouldn't get to our RHNA number,  which is one of the key emphasis of the housing element.  And as I suggested,  it's more of a policy question as it relates to the city addressing homelessness about whether the city would prop up something like that.  And it's something that's been in front of the,  in front of council before.  So I don't think it places in the housing element myself.  Um,  and,  uh,  I think it would again be something that,  you know,  if the planning commission wanted to send a recommendation in addition to the housing element,  we think you should consider something like doing this.  I think it would be separate from the housing element.  That's my opinion.  Yeah.  I mean,  I think I suspect that with time and energy we could find or,  or even just create,  um,  something new in the housing element.  But,  uh,  I just wasn't sure if it was already there.  Um,  and short of that,  I mean,  several people were talking about that.  So I just wanted to give it,  you know,  acknowledgement that,  that it's something that is on people's mind and that,  uh,  perhaps,  you know,  Brendan's offering a,  uh,  um,  a place to put that,  which would be to,  um,  address the council directly in terms of perhaps extending that specific ordinance,  um,  and finding new ways.  You know,  Larry was talking about,  um,  you know,  where,  where did they,  where did they go?  Not just to some other,  perhaps less than perfectly desirable to them place,  but,  um,  someplace a little more,  you know,  stable,  perhaps including,  you know,  uh,  uh,  um,  a driveway in somebody's backyard.  I was,  I mean,  I'm inable to it.  So I,  I,  all I'm saying is wanting to acknowledge the,  you know,  those comments and,  and say that if there's not a place in the housing element for that to go,  that,  um,  you know,  I certainly would entertain a,  uh,  you know,  support from the planning commission as well as encouragement to people to take  that,  to,  um,  to the council.  One last question on a totally different topic for staff.  Um,  the,  the,  I forget who it was.  Somebody mentioned specifically the,  um,  the vacant site next to the Newman center.  Um,  and I made a note of that because I didn't have time to,  to try to,  to,  you know,  look for that specific,  um,  uh,  parcel.  Is that,  is that already identified?  Um,  and if not,  has there been any analysis of that side?  I know I walk by there every day,  so I know what we're talking about.  And I'm curious whether that's a possibility or not,  since it was brought up.  I'm sorry,  what site?  Uh,  it's a,  there's a lot next to the,  Oh,  yeah,  I heard that.  That's actually included on the inventory as site number 20.  It is.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  And just for reference,  it's part of what the general plan considered a central city opportunity site.  And the description of that area is that there are opportunities for increased density based on where it was located within,  within proximity to the downtown.  So there was already some up zoning done as part of the general plan identified for that site.  I mean,  the,  the challenge often,  as you know,  is not the zoning,  not the allowances that we provided,  not the increased density,  not the reduced parking standards.  It's,  is somebody going to move forward with a project at either a vacant or underdeveloped or just a redevelopment site at period?  I mean,  that's,  that is one of the challenges.  Definitely.  We've talked,  you know,  Katie Toma,  I think articulately talked about how there are dials that can be turned.  She was addressing at one end of the spectrum,  but certainly there are others of those kinds of dials that maybe,  again,  there are big chunks of the housing element to try to address that.  So I appreciate the challenge.  Absolutely.  But that's what this is about.  Seems like this to find those dials.  For now.  Okay.  I think I wanted to offer,  a suggestion and see kind of what the commission thinks about this.  I think we have some one.  I will say I'm very pleased with the public comment today.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Specifically to the Buick Environmental Council.  I imagine a lot of people here today were based on your outreach.  So thank you for that and for getting people in seats today and commenting on this.  I also really want to thank staff.  And thank the consultants.  I think what we came back with just seems,  I think you did a great job to begin with,  but this seems really clear.  It feels like we have meat and direction that we can go forward.  And I just love the ability to be in a meeting where developers in the Butte Environmental Council are agreeing on the same actions.  And I think that's the kind of environment that I appreciate.  About the planning commission.  I was hoping that we can maybe spend some time and I think it might be useful rather than having kind of the overall broad conversation,  but just going kind of point by point on really the five areas that the Environmental Council outlined.  And then the goals that Commissioner Goldstein has and maybe just take initial votes.  And yes,  or no,  because what I'd really like to do is,  and these wouldn't be Nicole,  these wouldn't be votes like for an official record,  but kind of just like a straw poll vote that then would help the overall maker of the motion at the end know what to include that the entire commission could hopefully potentially support.  Does that sound okay?  I think so.  I kind of did have a couple of other questions to step in before we start.  Okay.  I think that's good.  My first question if you're ready.  Okay.  Was pertaining to the conversation on the RVs.  I was wondering,  well, we have other discussion in Goal 8 in Policy 8.1 in our draft housing element of emergency shelters.  So I guess my understanding is that we're not just adding policies and actions that help us meet our RHNA numbers,  but also things that will just help ensure people in our community are housed in general.  So I guess I would support adding some kind of policy or action related to that to under Goal 8.  But I'm curious if staff thinks that that would be,  I guess,  compliant with the goals of the housing element.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What is the question?  It's about RVs?  Yeah.  So say the chat recommendations on RVs and removing barriers to people being able to live in them.  Do you think that any of those could be placed under Goal 8 in our draft housing element?  I guess what I would do is I would just reiterate that this is an issue that's been before council already about,  so I,  under what context,  like within the municipal code,  doing something.  I mean,  I'm not sure I understand what would,  what would we would be doing.  RVs are allowed in RV parks.  There are some temporary requirements where they are allowed in trailer homes.  You heard some of the constraints.  Those constraints aren't city constraints.  Those might be the owner of the,  who runs the RV park or they might by state regulations.  I'm not sure.  Oh, interesting.  So yeah,  part of chat's recommendations were things like allowing RVs beyond 30 days,  in RV parks.  So are you,  you're saying those are not city recommend,  city ordinances that prevent people from staying longer?  No,  I'm saying that they raise a number of factors.  So I didn't say,  I didn't know that you were referring to the 30 day timeframe.  That was just one of the recommendations from chat was to extend that.  And I think Brendan,  really what you were saying to vice chair Ober was that's probably something completely separate from the housing element that we should bring forward.  Well,  a city sanctioned,  Mike's maybe going to share some information about the code section as it relates to RV parks.  Yeah,  I would love to hear more about our code as it pertains to RV parks.  The code treats RV living as a temporary use.  And our,  you know,  one of the things about that disaster recovery ordinance is that it terminates after five years.  There's a hard end date and we're already a little concerned about what to do when we reach that date and people still want to stay in their RV in the backyards.  And as a temporary use,  the question is big,  how does it end?  How does it become no longer a use?  And I don't think that some people are planning on that.  So it's a concern in that regard.  And if you look at the whole housing element,  it talks about trying to get permanent housing in place.  And that's why the,  any RV living in backyard would be a little out of place for it.  We could figure it out.  We could get it in there.  It's not impossible.  It would probably also trigger some sort of code revisions so that we could,  we can rearticulate the code and looking at it as more of a less of a fleeting use and more of a long temporary use,  I guess.  I don't know.  But I mean,  ultimately that would be something that the planning commission could make a recommendation on if they chose to.  It's great to know.  But another question related to that.  So we have like RV parks where people can rent a space.  What's the policy on those?  Those are defined differently.  So I think they're defined as a place where you can stay up to 30 days.  Okay.  And so it would be changing the definition to allow it for longer.  And I don't know if that would blur the lines of a mobile home park,  which has specific definitions under state law and protections under state law.  Interesting.  So that's great to know.  It sounds like we could theoretically direct the city to pursue extending the,  the amount of time somebody could stay at an RV park.  We could definitely take up recommendation.  Okay.  Thank you.  Sure.  Done for now.  Any other questions?  Okay.  So I'll give just kind of an overall bias of where I'm at with regard to some of the language here.  And then I'll just kind of go through it.  And then just so I don't have to say it on every point that we're going through,  but I appreciate the willingness to have a little bit more active and directive language,  but I'd probably err on the side of the tenor of the existing housing element with probably words like explore or investigate,  as opposed to direct.  Okay.  And then I'll just kind of go through some of the things that I think are important to  be able to connect or increase or redevelop.  So as we go through some of these,  I could be amenable to some of these in here if we softened the language.  And I,  that would just be kind of where,  where I would be coming from.  So where do you guys want to start?  Do you want to start with the five Butte Environmental Council?  Sure.  Okay.  So,  let's start with number one,  expand the corridor opportunity site overlay.  I would say I would be more in favor of what Brendan has offered here,  the new action that's in front of us,  but would love to hear kind of where the commission falls.  Maybe,  maybe I'll start down here.  I was reading a comment that was coming in,  what was the question?  I guess just your overall,  and I would just say this isn't an official vote,  but more like a straw poll.  A support of number one,  yes or no.  And then any alternatives if you don't support it.  Sure.  Commissioner Wal.  Oh,  sorry.  Is that what you got?  She's asking about the first poll.  And what do you want to do with number one?  I want to ask you if you want to include that in the housing element or not.  Okay.  Got a no from Commissioner Wal.  Yes.  Okay.  I would be a no,  but I would be in favor of what we have from staff.  I'm a yes.  And I'd be curious to hear again what the direction from recommendation from staff was.  Yeah,  I'm looking for that.  So we have the screen in front of us.  It says,  as part of the future municipal code update,  investigate opportunities to apply the corridor opportunity site overlay to additional areas  and corridors within the city with an emphasis on transit priority areas and major transit  stops.  In essence,  the offer is to look at applying it a lot of other areas.  There's no limitation.  I guess my observation,  if I would have to go back to what you said,  I don't want to go out of order and-  You're fine.  My observation would be,  well,  that would imply maybe that you'd be looking at other areas.  And I appreciate that language.  I truly do.  I just,  I wonder if it,  you know,  it provides a lot of wiggle room,  and which I think can create an environment where nothing could happen.  And so the,  the,  the,  this number one from the Butte Environmental Council,  you know,  is a little bit more focused.  And that's why I would like us to be as focused where we can as possible.  Yeah.  I agree with that.  I do like the specificity of the recommendation from,  from our planning staff.  But I also,  yeah,  I prefer to word things as we're going to do this and get it done.  I could be amenable.  Yeah.  I'm comfortable with the current situation.  Okay.  And really,  again,  all I'm trying to do is kind of get the temperature of the commission.  You can make whatever motions you want at the end.  But I think it just,  for the amount of work that the public has put into doing specific actions,  which we asked for,  and the amount of work that our fellow commissioners have,  I'd like to just get everybody's opinion on them going forward.  Madam,  Madam chair,  just,  just to,  just to remind you to whatever does come back,  we'll come back through the planning commission.  So you'll have another chance to see what we're recommending to do to the quarter opportunity  site zones.  So that's,  it's not like this is the last stand you're going to deal with it.  You're going to have to,  it'll be presented to you later on one way or another.  Okay.  Brendan,  have you ever had time specific?  Yeah.  Like the other goals,  policies,  like the other actions in the housing element,  we would put a timeframe.  To it.  And you know,  we're doing a lot of code updates right now.  Okay.  We could easily commit to something within the next year and a half.  Okay.  So I,  I would say,  well,  we probably have a majority.  Now it sounds like the commission that would be against number one.  I would be in favor of,  of what we have from you with a time,  time specific to just get a little bit more teeth on that.  Of course.  Okay.  Number two,  I'm just going to keep going down the line.  Cause then I can keep it.  Uh,  commissioner wall legalize missing middle housing,  rezone all residential lots within a half a mile of a public transit stop to a minimum  of medium density.  Yes or no?  No.  Yes.  I'd be a no.  Yes.  No.  Okay.  Number three,  increase the minimum and maximum allowable density of all residential and mixed use zoning  designations.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.  Okay.  Identify at least 60% of inventory sites for each income group within the core grid network  or near lower bidwell park.  Rezone as necessary.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.  Okay.  And then eliminate vehicle parking requirements for housing projects in the central city opportunity  sites and reduce parking requirements for housing in the rest of the city.  No.  This is a yes and I would like to offer a comment on it.  I think that this is exactly the kind of actual code change that the housing element ought  to call out to do all of the things that the housing element claims that it's trying to  do and echoes what an awful lot of the people who have done a lot of work in preparation  for tonight and before are asking for, which is to increase the number of housing projects  and to increase core density and to try to make the housing element echo what the general  plan and other work that the city is doing to try to address greenhouse gas emissions  and so by providing housing in places and in providing one piece of, we were talking  about turning dials earlier, one piece of incentive for developers or in a way removing  one disincentive to developers, which is often cited as parking is a thing that prevents  more dense housing.  So I think that this one has teeth, it's focused and it would actually be a way, and I keep  using the metaphor turning dials, really hard to find very many dials these days.  This one is a real dial.  So I'm a strong yes on this one.  I would be a no on the language as it is, but I would support.  But are you exploring overall parking requirements and reviewing those for housing in the rest  of the city?  I'm a yes and I will compromise to do what you think is gonna pass.  I would be a no just based on, I already see what happens with apartments.  I do feel that you can build underneath garages and stuff to help the sprawl of the parking  lot.  So that's a yes.  on that will probably come to our town.  But the reality is everybody has a car.  And right now, if you go to these apartments and places,  there's no parking.  People have to park far away, which is also dangerous  and dark and stuff.  So I would be interested in an option of it,  because I do agree.  But same thing, but not in this verbiage.  OK.  And I'm probably going to fly through these goals,  because the AC is getting to me up here.  I have them up on my screen.  I probably, and I can read, actually,  could staff help me out here?  Who has access to the previous page?  I would love if we could go to the staff report,  and if we could go to attachment C,  just so that the public can see what we're seeing.  I don't think we have it up.  My comment?  Do we?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, OK.  Would you mind if I speak briefly to them?  And then it's kind of poorly assumed  that I would vote yes, because I submitted.  Sure.  Yeah.  I can wait a minute, but while you're doing that.  Let me do it while he's doing it.  Yeah.  So I submitted several recommendations  for updating our actions in the housing element  that I thought would help us be able to remove barriers  to housing construction.  And I'm going to go ahead and do that.  And yeah, so there's a list that we'll see soon.  And of course, I'm amenable to changes on these.  And I noticed that several of them have really similar themes  to what was submitted by other public comment.  So there might be some overlap.  But in general, my goals with these are taking some  of the feedback we got from the public or that I know  from being on the Planning Commission  or attending conferences and things and working that into,  like I said, removing barriers.  Making it more possible to build housing, build it affordably  and house our community.  And cool.  I'm just going to look at this and see  if I have any notes before we do voting on them.  So the first one for a new action  for affirmatively furthering fair housing is  because we have areas of our city  that have really low incomes, areas with really high incomes.  And I think that's a really good point.  I think it would be a smart move for a city to explore how  to make sure that we put our housing  in areas that make sense.  And with the goal three, supporting housing  that is affordable to low-income households,  I had a few recommendations.  And you'll see one of them involves a lot  of really similar themes to what we just talked about  by expanding corridor opportunities.  And I think that's very important.  And I'm glad that it seems like a lot  of us are on the same page.  Redeveloping city-owned parking lots.  There's, let's see, inclusionary zoning is an item that has been  in our housing element.  And it's removed from this one.  I recommend that we continue it.  It had a time limit and that passed without it going  to city council from my understanding.  So I think we should keep that in there.  And under four, there are a bunch more.  I can make comments on these as we go through them if needed.  But another one that I'll mention is under goal six,  I might also at the end want to add something  on historic preservation if there's time.  And under goal nine, one of my, my education is  in climate change and energy.  So I recommended infill development  and incentivizing smaller housing units  as an energy efficiency and climate measure.  So that's the summary.  Great. Thank you, Mike.  I appreciate it.  So if we could, maybe I'll read them out.  And then can I keep you up there?  Is that okay?  It's fine.  Okay. Or maybe you could just have like the, yeah, yeah.  And then I can call you back.  I'm sorry.  Put you on the spot here.  So again, I'm going to go back to the question.  I think I'm going to go back to the question.  So again, kind of the same thing.  Just want to get an idea.  And really what I'm trying to do is see what we have  to get a motion together.  I want to say I'll probably have a lot of no's or want  to soften the language, but that doesn't take away  from my appreciation of you doing this.  And I think you did a really great job.  And I really appreciate your service for doing this.  So I think that's really helpful.  Commissioner Wall, goal, new action for the purpose  of furthering fair housing, ensure enough adequately zoned  sites are available for very low and low income housing located  in areas with high, medium household incomes,  including census block eight,  outside of low opportunity census block,  low density neighborhoods and other areas that are currently  and historically income and race exclusive.  Yes or no?  No. Yes.  It'd be a no?  Yes.  No.  Okay.  And then, go ahead.  Go ahead.  So, goal three, new policy 3.4, increase the number of sites  where low income housing may feasibly be built.  And so under this, there are two actions proposed,  increase the number of sites that can support low income  housing by up zoning vacant parcels  in the city's core neighborhoods.  I think we kind of already hit on this with Beck.  And then, redevelop city owned parking lots  within central city opportunity sites into affordable housing.  And then, there's an action 3.43, develop a range  of mixed income inclusionary zoning.  Yes.  I'd be a no.  You'd be a yes.  Yes.  And again, I'd be amenable to softening things  such as pursuing redeveloping .  I would say I would like to keep with what the staff has  on the corridor opportunity site.  I would say I would like to keep with what the staff has on the corridor opportunity site.  I would say I would like to keep with what the staff has on the corridor opportunity site.  On 3.4.2, I would be willing to explore.  On 3.4.2, I would be willing to explore.  Have we done that before?  Well, I want to provide some context.  As part of the general plan adoption 2011,  there's a downtown element and all the parking lots  within the city will rezone so that they would allow  for residential development, mixed use development  in the future.  Okay.  Currently, the city is exploring parking lot 5  over by Lost Park with Chico State.  And an RFP has already gone out to do a mix of uses,  including affordable housing.  So these are concepts and thoughts that are already  in our general plan and can be pursued.  But we can't just get rid of all the parking in the downtown.  It has to be targeted and thoughtful and considered  in the context of providing parking  for the businesses downtown.  There's a downtown parking access plan.  There's a lot of moving parts.  So I guess what I'm sharing is there already is a notion  and the support for this type of activity.  And the downtown and potential reutilization  of the city's parking lots.  It exists.  So yeah, you can't have this voice that just says do it to all  of them because that's not considering all the other things  that we're trying to juggle.  If I could jump in, I really appreciate that.  So to me, that would suggest that if we added simply pursue  or explore to the first of this,  then now we've brought the housing element  in direct alignment.  And that's what we're trying to do with the general plan.  And I can't see why anybody would vote against that.  So pursue opportunities.  I would look to Bryce actually.  I think she said something about some language that she did.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd be totally open to .  So yeah, pursue or explore.  But then I feel like that's a, sorry, but that's pretty clear.  Quick question on the project you mentioned, Brendan.  I didn't know affordable housing was part  of the Lost Park redevelopment.  Is that?  It's not dictated, but it's offered up as one of the,  you know,  primary objectives.  Potential.  Yeah.  That's part of why I think that a policy  in the housing element on it could be important to ensure  that's on the mind when we're looking at these sites.  The policies in the downtown element regarding affordable  housing were what were used in the RFP to let them know that's  what one of the priorities is.  Okay. So I would support action 3.4.2  with a pursue or explore.  Sounds great.  Commissioner Cooper?  I think it should be the whole housing, not just affordable.  Oh.  It just specifies affordable housing, and that would be it.  I just think it should be .  That's helpful.  I agree.  Okay.  Not just affordable.  I'd agree with that.  Change it.  I had put it under goal three, which is production of housing,  affordable to low-income households.  But this could turn into something under goal four of  construction of a wide range of housing types and be housing in  general hopefully affordable.  But if that's how it could get through our commission, then I'd  .  So something along the lines of we don't need to have action  numbers at this point, but a new action that would something along  the lines of pursues use of city-owned parking lots within  the central city opportunity site.  So something along the lines of that would be to create a  housing that would be in a state with affordable and market rate  housing.  Brilliant.  Yep.  Sounds good.  Okay.  Goal four.  So new action 4.1.2, promote housing construction by reducing  and allowing flexibility in minimum parking requirements.  Okay.  Thank you.  Commissioner Wall?  No.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  No.  Okay.  4.2, promote a mix of dwelling types and sizes throughout the  city and I'll just kind of read these at a high level.  They're behind me and in front of us on the screen.  Implement the quarter opportunity site overlay.  We've already touched that.  on a lot of that. Implement the downtown element policy framework to support higher density mixed  use residential development in downtown. Remove all parking requirements. Explore unbundling  residential parking by requiring downtown residents to purchase their own parking spaces permits.  Continue to implement the traditional neighborhood development regulations found in the city's  municipal code that promote higher density vertical and horizontal mixed use and greater  flexibility in meeting parking requirements. Restructure development fees. Actually, let's  just take those first three because I think first three. 4.2.1. Okay. Yes. No. Yes. Okay. 4.2.2.  No. Yes. No. Yes. No. And then 4.2.3. No.  Yes.  I would be a yes with explore rezoning vacant sites and special planning areas.  Sounds good. I'll accept that.  I'd be no just because we already had that problem with Amber Grove and all of a sudden you put a four-story apartment complex in a suburban single family.  What was the problem with Amber Grove?  Sorry, I'm off topic.  It was a previous planning commission, I guess, the three, four-story building and then into the Amber Grove neighborhood and I guess that was not so.  Is there a traditional neighborhood development there?  Yeah, I think that was the problem. Yeah.  Let's go to 4.2.4. Restructure development fees to be based on square footage instead of per unit to incentivize development.  A mix of housing sizes including smaller naturally affordable.  But any shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable shareable share  It is a parallel code within the city's municipal code,  and somebody with a special planning area could make that choice to utilize it.  Okay.  So we could just have that continue to implement?  I'm just saying currently it's available to people to utilize.  They would have to rezone their property as part of the master planning of it.  What would be the cost of doing that?  What's that?  What would be the cost of doing that financially?  Like I'm saying, it would be negligible given that they're going to be doing general plan amendments,  rezones already.  They would also be doing the EIR.  It's the large areas like Valley's Edge, Barber Yard.  Anyway, just pointing out that that's something that's available to folks if they choose to.  Okay.  I would also add, if I may, that vacant sites,  there's something in the T&D code that specifies that it can be applied to sites 28,  or larger, or with careful study, smaller areas,  and that could be changed or recommended to be changed to allow it to be applied to smaller sites  without in-depth analysis, you know, without that barrier to jump over.  And then there's another variant of that might be that to explore allowing parallel code application  in certain areas so that it could be the conventional code or it could be the T&D code.  Choose your adventure when you want to design a project.  I love that one.  Choose your adventure.  Okay.  424, Commissioner Cooper.  That's already happening, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  4.2.5, increase R2 density back to what was previously allowed  to promote moderate density and moderate income housing.  I think I'll take these as a bunch.  Increase minimum and maximum density of R1, R2, R3, and R4.  Allow.  Missing middle housing types including flexes, bungalow courts, and shop houses,  and all existing residential zoning codes, and pursue form-based coding for future zoning updates.  Commissioner Wall.  No.  Commissioner Ober?  Yes.  I'd be a no.  Yes.  No.  Okay.  Goal five.  So modify action 5.1.4.  Promote development of single room occupancy,  or other small unit developments by removing or reducing parking requirements,  and lowering development impact fees.  Support the conversion of motels, hotels which are vacant or underutilized,  and assist in identifying potential funding resources.  A question for staff on this.  Would this qualify as permanent housing?  An SRO would definitely.  Okay.  And there's already reductions in parking.  Are there any other parking available to folks who develop those?  Okay.  And then depending on the size of the units, you know,  because of the tiered fee structure, you know, that would be lower depending.  Okay.  SROs are typically just one room, so.  Can I ask a question for, at least for my knowledge,  what's the fee structure update going to entail and maybe look like for SROs  or other maybe smaller units?  And also what are the current parking or parking limits?  Are there any requirements for SROs?  The current fee structure is based on bedrooms and bathrooms.  I'm not sure what the one moving forward is planning on doing.  It's coming out of the engineering department,  so I haven't been involved to date.  Interesting.  Commissioner Wolff?  No.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I would be a yes if we took care  of eliminating the parking.  I think that's almost as far as those there.  You have a shelter of options.  But I do think there should be options for seniors and teens and disability.  That wasn't part of my modification.  Yeah, that's already in there.  The goal five is already in there.  It would just be the 5.1.4.  Oh, sorry.  Tony?  Yes.  Just to clarify on my no vote.  In my neighborhood, there are several of these.  And if they didn't have parking for their tenants or their users,  they would be parking in neighbors' lots across the alley, whatever.  It would be an untenable situation to put the homeowner in having to play referee  for his tenant and the neighbor across the alley or down the street.  I can't possibly go with that.  I think that's fair.  Thank you.  This part, yeah.  OK. Changes to goal six.  So it would be.  A new action study impacts of short-term rentals on existing neighborhoods  and potential displacement.  And staff already gave us a recommendation  that we could cross-compare perhaps.  Commissioner Wal?  No. Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Is that to go with the staff version or to go with that version?  Good question.  Oh, sorry.  OK.  I guess that could be a later thing.  Or we can decide now.  Are we doing a .  I would say I like the staff version just because it also has monitored trends.  So I would say I would go along with the staff version, which I think actually goes farther  than Commissioner Goldstein's.  That's great.  Can we flip back to mine?  I think I agree with you.  Yeah.  I'm good with that.  I'm good with the staff version.  We tried to replicate it with our work.  Great.  Nice.  Which one?  Mike, could you flip back to the staff one?  Sorry.  Oh, we're doing it.  OK.  Yeah.  I'm good with that.  OK.  6.5.  Implement a rental registry to ensure code compliance,  fair business practices, and fair share of taxes  to local government.  OK.  And then work with code enforcement  to implement a rental registry.  Does staff have any comments on this?  This was, again, something that was before council  that they chose not to pursue.  Thank you.  My question is why?  Oh, well, so this was discussed in the Internal Affairs Committee  about two years ago, and I was part of some of those conversations.  Basically, in part has to do with price gouging.  And it's harder for a government, whether that's the city or county,  to enforce fair treatment of renters, especially  after a natural disaster like the Camp Fire that  led to spikes in prices if we have no real tracking  of our rental units.  And we have other businesses be registered  so that we know what's going on and making sure  that they have fair business practices.  So I support a rental registry.  I support a rental registry to ensure that we can have people  comply with our local ordinances and codes,  whether those are emergency price gouging ordinances  or ongoing ordinances and codes.  OK, I'll say no.  I don't think most renters want to be on another list.  And another list is something somebody within the city  has to update and maintain and call around to get new input  to update it.  So it's exercising more work and not needed.  No.  I think probably a lot of renters  are interested in doing whatever is possible to make renting  affordable.  So yes, I'm definitely yes on this.  I'd say no.  Yes.  And I would say no.  And I think this would actually raise prices on rentals  and personal.  Goal nine.  So we have a new policy and then two new actions proposed.  The new policy would be promote construction  of naturally energy efficient building types,  including attached housing, infill, and smaller units.  The new actions would be incentivize infill development,  multifamily housing, and small units through the actions  outlined in policy 4.2.  And then include supporting infill housing as a climate  policy and city plans and documents.  This would be a no also.  All of this stuff is outlined, listed, or put  in something else.  So this would be a duplication of the policy.  Lots of other things.  I would be a yes.  I like continuing to affirm.  This is our direction.  Yes.  Can I ask what a naturally energy efficient building is?  Sure.  The way that I meant that anyway is a smaller housing unit  takes less energy to heat or to power the things in it.  That would be great.  I didn't go that far.  But if you supported that, I'd love that.  So it's already in our policy list.  So I just continue.  Continue with this.  OK.  So we have these other recommendations on the arena  and the resource inventory.  Yes, Commissioner Goldstein, do you  feel like these need to be in the housing element?  Do you want us to?  Let's see.  OK.  OK.  I mean, ideally, I guess I didn't know quite  where to try to apply them.  Actions are a little more obvious for me  to try to make recommendations on.  These are all things that I would like to see.  But I wasn't quite sure how we're applying these, I guess.  I really like bullet point three on that mid-cycle review  of the housing element.  Brendan, is there anything in the housing element that's,  that says we're going to review the housing element?  Or is that just part of the general plan review that we do?  We provide a report every year on the status both to the HCD  as well as the city council.  So perhaps we could just, right now you guys can request  that we provide it to the planning commission as well.  OK.  I mean, it doesn't need to be a policy in action.  Does that include all the?  I can add to that too.  If action 4.1.1 is not in the planning commission,  it is an action to follow state mandated no net loss law  to ensure that the progress towards RHNA  is annually tracked and updated.  So there's the housing element update  as well as the action 4.1.1 to track progress  in meeting RHNA and the status of the site's inventory.  OK.  Great to know.  We would love that.  Yeah. Thank you.  Please.  And then I think I'm trying to get one that we can all agree on.  And Commissioner Wall, I'm hoping we can agree  on this chapter number to the page footers.  Do you think you could be a yes on that one?  No.  I'm a yes.  I'm a yes.  Yeah.  Adding chapter numbers to the page footers?  Yeah.  Just a format.  Yeah.  OK.  Cool.  Any of these other bullets that you want to?  I did have a question on the ones we were looking at.  When you have a chance, if you can scroll back up.  Thanks.  When we were talking about the mid-cycle review,  are the things that I mentioned as suggestions included  in that?  Sorry.  Sorry for my lack of knowledge, such as adjustments or rezones,  things like that.  If we find that we're not meeting our goals  in these annual reviews, is there an opportunity for that?  There would be a requirement for some rezoning  if we dropped below our, what is it, no net loss.  OK.  That's just a requirement from HCD.  We already have density bonuses.  We have a whole section in our municipal code  that for affordable housing.  Yeah.  And as far as I'm concerned, we do have streamlined processes  already.  And I do know that we take great pride, especially  as it relates to affordable housing projects,  to moving them through.  I've shared with this group, I believe,  we got every department involved to take advantage  of the money that recently came available through the disaster  recovery funding that we received.  We were the first in the state to get the program up  and running in the first jurisdiction.  We ran multiple projects.  We ran multiple projects through the ARHPB.  Again, we got 1,400 approximately units coming on board,  hopefully within the next couple of years.  Great.  Great.  Great work, staff.  Thank you.  And then is there anything else?  I know we had talked about disaster recovery.  Staff thinks we have that hit in the housing element.  Yes, no?  What was the question?  Disaster recovery permitting in RVs, allowing RVs.  I mean, again, I don't believe we have a disaster recovery  permit program right now.  Again, it was created following the Camp Fire.  It's due to sunset.  And it has its limitations as a tool.  It has a lot of controversy, I believe, associated with it.  As I mentioned, the many appeals.  Again, just having people have the ability  to put RVs and trailers in the backyards  and single-family neighborhoods.  And that became evident through that process.  So again, it's up to you.  It's up to you to choose what you want to recommend.  Can I ask, you know, typically the commission  is not directing our agendas.  That's really something that staff does or that comes by us  by way of applications that are pulled.  Would this be something that we could initiate a review  of prior to it sunsetting?  Or would that be more on the council level?  It would be great to be able  to have a thoughtful community conversation on this  without the pressure of a deadline.  And so if we talked about it even six months before it was  to sunset and really were able to get the community outreach  and workshops on it separate of the housing element.  My understanding is it's going to go back to internal affairs.  So it already has like a place it's going to land.  And then we can go back to the housing element.  I could check into that.  Again, it's the disaster recovery permit.  It was honestly staff driven and following the campfire.  So it's related to folks who were in immediate need following  the campfire if there was some desire  to create some new program.  I think we, most of the audience here would agree that we're  in a climate change disaster and a housing crisis disaster.  So kind of what would we have to do?  We're not there as far as tools to call it a disaster.  I guess it would be something else.  Because again, the language in the ordinance speaks  to its purpose and intent.  And it was related to the campfire.  Okay.  So I guess a recommendation to look at the fact  that we have another disaster upon us.  And is there a way to utilize a similar program for that purpose?  Just a thought.  And I think that for the commission and maybe for staff also,  there is another way of thinking about disaster though.  And that is that if we recognize that we're  in a long-term climate, and I mean that not climate,  but the climate of ongoing and predictable disasters,  then having a plan to do that,  and having policies, and this is a bigger topic perhaps  than this one specific item, but we can make this  about where do you park RVs.  And I think that would be a good conversation to have.  Because I think it's more likely that we're going  to have displaced people on a semi-regular basis.  And so that to wait until that happens and, you know,  enact some sort of an emergency, you know, measure to allow  for parking in places or to allow for camping  in places or something like that.  But to recognize that we're just in that environment now  for the foreseeable future.  And to put policies in place that are already there  so that when the thing that we very unfortunately think is  likely to happen happens, we already have the plan in place.  So things like having ordinances or having, you know,  a section in policy eight that addresses where people park.  And I just, I don't know whether it would go into eight.  I think, Jay.  I think it's a good question.  But what I'm saying is that I think  that pre-planning would be a part of in terms  of disaster, quote unquote, is what the new reality.  I would agree with you that a bigger discussion  about where is an appropriate location for RVs  on a longer-term basis is better than trying  to continue the disaster recovery permit program  where they were being placed in single-family neighborhoods  that just was not working.  And I think I'm saying, too, I don't think it belongs  in the housing element.  But I'd love to capture what we have here tonight and have  that conversation at another time.  I really appreciate Leslie's comments on that.  And Melody, honestly, I think opening the public hearing again  and continuing this meeting was worth it just to have you here  and your comments that having the fact  that there is funding available and we just don't have  the housing, I think that's something that's very direct  and very useful.  And I think that's something that's very poignant for us.  So thank you.  Anything else?  So to clarify, are we looking at including any  of the recommendations from CHAT or are we just moving  into a further discussion?  Great. Let's do what we just did and then we can get the  temperature and then whatever motion wants to come,  that motion can come.  So we did get a letter from CHAT.  All of us had it sitting there.  So we're going to get it sitting at our seat.  Sorry for scattering everything on your desk.  And I'll read them out loud for the audience.  Unless Mike is magic.  I don't know if you'd have this.  It came in last minute.  I don't, do I?  We will not have it on there.  Yeah, okay.  So they are expand the disaster  recovery permitting process to allow  for occupied travel trailers to be placed in backyards  and connected to sewer and electricity service for up  to 10 years without limiting the availability of this provision  to fire survivors only.  Relax zoning and permitting to allow for ease  of creating RV parks and suitable locations  within the city limits of Chico.  Allow for extended residency in RV parks rather  than limiting occupancy  in RV parks to 30 days just as exists in mobile home parks.  Provide a location on public land for parking of RVs  and travel trailers with basic amenities such as restrooms  and garbage containers.  Commissioner Wald?  I haven't found what we're looking at yet.  Okay. Do you want my copy?  Show me what you're looking at.  You can ask a question about is,  what is the city policy that could only stay for 30 days  in mobile home parks or that each park has its own?  Yeah, I, Mike, Mike, do you mind if you,  you're sitting off the top of your head, Mike.  Yeah, mobile home parks are for long-term stays.  RV parks are for shorter-term stays.  I can read the definition if the commission would like that.  Budget, so it is 30, that's loud.  So it's 30 days in the city limits per the city,  not per the most, per the RV park, correct?  Yeah. I'm almost there.  Yes. The definition of RV parks specifies  that it's for less than 30 days.  Perfect.  What you got for me?  Which one do you want?  I'm on all the, on the second page.  Okay.  All the bold on the second page,  that goes on to the third page.  Well, no.  Yes.  No?  Yes.  So we're doing the expanded to that?  And all of the ones that go with it?  That's it.  We're doing them all.  Okay. All right.  I think we hit everything.  Okay.  We didn't do Lindsay's comments.  We didn't do Lindsay's.  Okay. We have an email from Lindsay, Commissioner Pullen.  Lindsay's first comment.  Lindsay's are, and let me read them.  When providing annual updates in addition to including the number  of units that have pulled permits,  also include the number of units currently in construction  and the number of units that have received certificate  of occupancy.  I would say this isn't part of the housing element,  but would be something, Bruce,  that maybe we could add to our reports?  That's the annual performance report  and you'll be copied on that.  Okay. And then form an ad hoc steering committee comprised  of subject matter expert volunteers  to oversee the progression of the housing element  and strategize additional ways  to achieve the performance of the housing element.  to achieve the assigned arena projections,  steering committee to include 8 to 12 individuals specializing  in land acquisition entitlements,  financing real estate permitting, et cetera,  committee to meet as needed to provide support and guidance  to achieving housing goal needs.  Is there anywhere in the housing element that would fit?  We have no staffing or capacity to manage a steering committee.  And again, the information that we provide  is provided to the city council and the planning commission.  Those are the entities that have the responsibility  for these types of activities.  Let's still vote on it.  Yes. Yes on one, unless it's already covered elsewhere.  And no on two.  Okay.  Yeah. Yes on one.  Yeah, I guess I would wonder kind of who's auspices.  I mean, I think it's a good question.  You know, people are asking us, you know,  where do those appointments come from?  And it starts to get problematic.  So I guess I would support that.  Okay. I would, I don't think we need to add number one.  I think, Bruce, you got that.  So I'd be no on both of those.  I would love to see some kind of committee,  especially so that there's people informing the next  housing element.  But maybe it could actually be a committee  of the planning commission.  Or.  Or something of that form.  So I'd love to see two approved in some way.  I don't know if as it's written right now it's feasible.  But I guess my vote is yes or a modification.  I actually agree.  I think it's a good idea to have someone to do this.  But I agree it's also hard to manage.  And it's probably something more from the council that needs  to appoint this.  I would be on it.  I would be on it.  And I think it's a good idea.  And I think it's a good idea.  It would be great.  But again, I just don't think it's our position to start this.  My hope would be that staff and the community  and the council would see that commission's a pretty good  working group that can get a lot of things done.  So maybe this is something that we could do a little bit more  regularly and be proactive on.  It's just my thought.  All right.  I think that's it.  I think that's all I'd like to go through as far as the public  comments and what was submitted to us.  And I would say if anybody wanted to offer a motion or if we  want to, I would, I think I'd like to see if we could get a  motion first and then have discussion on that motion.  Yes.  Can I throw another idea that I had after I submitted my long  statement?  Sure, yes.  I was wondering if historic preservation fits into the  housing element or if that would be reduced to a public motion?  Is it redundant of other plans and documents?  The entire element related to historic preservation.  Okay.  So I should read that before I start suggesting things.  Does it sound like this would already be in there,  partnering with the Chico Heritage Association and Chico  State University to update the historic resources inventory and  educate owners of historic homes about historic preservation  methods and Mills Act tax credits.  Is that it?  already in there? Yeah, I think you need to read the cultural resources and historic  preservation element number 11 in the general plan. There's that and lots more.  Okay. Marie,  it looked sort of like you might have had an answer, but you might have just been...never mind.  It looked like you might have had something  to say that I might have been interpreting. Never mind.  No, I was just going to say that it was elsewhere. Okay.  Bob left us. That's sad. We talked about historic preservation  and he was not here. Okay.  If we could get a motion or discussion, but preferably  a motion.  Are you taking good notes?  Well, I thought I was, but I'm struggling  to now reassemble everything. I kind of created a jumble here.  The gist of the motion that I think you're looking for  while I'm tempted to make a motion to  approve, and I was also looking for the  language that staff was looking for.  I was going to say, to help you perhaps adopt the resolution as outlined in the staff  report recommending that the council determine  that adoption of the draft housing element is exempt from environmental review pursuant to the  second amendment. If you could just say that. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point.  But any kind of any kind of they hold a public hearing to consider and adopt the draft housing element and authorize the middle of the draft housing  any kind of  any kind of  any kind of  any kind of  any kind of  any kind of element to the California Department of Housing and Community Development with the following additional recommendations outlined in the staff report as well as the recommendations provided at the meeting tonight related to   additional updates to the corridor opportunity site overlay as well as a new action to, as also presented  as also presented regarding short-term rentals.  And then, this is the kicker, I think,  and then also to add the actions identified by the Planning Commission  where the straw poll voted there was support  by a majority of the present Planning Commissioners.  Thank you.  That was brilliantly done.  Yes, the motion I actually would like to make is all of that  and adopt all of Commissioner Goldstein's recommendations  and all of the Butte Environmental Council recommendations,  but I appreciate the process that we just went through.  I recognize that the votes aren't there to carry that motion,  so I just want to be on the record as saying that I wish we would have left in  at least a majority, if not all, of the recommendations that were presented to us  that were, I believe, very thoughtful and articulate and spot on  in terms of policy.  Can I ask you to do something then?  Sure.  Because I would love to get that in the record.  Can I ask you to make that motion, and then let's take an official vote,  and then, yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you, Tammy.  I would love to make that motion.  And I don't think that's disrespectful to the process or what we did.  I think that's really the conscious of where you're leaning,  and I'd love to do that.  I appreciate that, Tammy.  Thank you for that opportunity.  So I will make that motion.  So the language in the staff report with all the preamble that Brenda,  just provided, which provides instructions for the process moving forward to council,  et cetera, with the addition of all of the recommended,  all the recommendations made by Commissioner Goldstein for changes to the goals  with new actions, as well as the five items presented by the Butte Environmental Council,  and to make those also part of the housing element,  codified by goals and policies.  Okay. So let me see if I can do this for Nicole,  who's furiously taking notes over there.  So we have a motion from Vice Chair Ober to adopt a resolution recommending  that the city council determine that adoption  of the draft housing element is exempt from environmental review pursuant  to section 15061B3 of the California Involvement Act,  and that the city council should consider the proposed  and proposed environmental quality act guidelines.  Oh, am I on the wrong one?  Hold on.  I don't want to mess it up.  Thank you.  What would I do without mic?  With the following additional recommendations, direct city staff  and the consultant to carefully review the consistency  of the application.  The first is to remove three sites from the adequate sites inventory,  remove three sites from the adequate sites inventory,  add a new action to the housing element directing the amendment of table LU-2.  Can you go down?  Jumping.  The new action that is part of a future municipal code update  to invest the opportunities  to improve the housing element,  the new action that is part of a future municipal code update  The second is to apply the corridor opportunity site overlay  to additional areas and corridors within the city,  investigate and monitor trends of short-term rentals,  and then every single policy that was on attachment C,  and then the additional five policies that are in the Butte Environmental Council letter.  Thank you.  Is there a second?  I'll second.  Okay.  So we have a motion by Vice Chair Ober and a second by Commissioner  by Commissioner  Goldstein.  All in favor signify by saying aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  Aye.  So no.  So that motion fails.  Two, three with two absent.  And now will we consider any substitute motions?  I'll make one.  Okay.  I'll move that the commission adopt a resolution recommending city council determine the  ability to implement the proposed !  The adoption of the draft housing element is exempt from environmental  resute pursuant to section 15061  of the California  Environmental Quality Act guidelines  for the public hearing to consider and adopt  draft element  housing element  and authorize the middle of the housing element  to the California Department of Housing and Community Development  attachment to the June 2, 2022  staff report  with the following additional recommended  copy paragraph A, B, and C  into the draft housing element  and add paragraph 1  from Commissioner  Poland's  memo  and the  voice  the voice  vote items  that passed  in the commission  included into this recommendation.  I might cry.  Yeah, that gets it. Is there a second?  I'll second that.  As well as those other actions.  As well as these actions too,  the city actions.  He said voice vote.  I think we got those. Yeah.  I do want to say while we're  here at this point that I  greatly appreciate what staff has done  in this. They've done a masterful job  in putting together something  that Brendan V.  called a mosaic  or  a framework for this.  Now this is not a hard cast  and stone document. This is a  guide, a guideline, a road map  if you will. It's not some place  where we sit around for the next six months and  rearrange the chairs on the deck of the ship.  It's a  very loosely structured thing  that allows for things to happen like  COVID, like fires, like floods,  like whatever may come  up. Those things belong in a disaster  recovery plan. The stuff that we're  putting in here is a guideline for  the housing in Chico for the next  eight years. And I think  there will be plenty of opportunity  to get changes to it,  to add to it, to change, to  subtract from it, and to make  it work for the next eight years without  saddling staff with a  whole bunch more work.  And that we don't need to do. They're  already busy. They have many other things to do  as well. And so that concludes  my sermon.  Sorry, I'm really  overwhelmed.  I just did not think we could get  a unanimous vote on this. So thank you  for your time. Thank you. Any other comments?  Question for staff.  Or Nicole, maybe.  Do you have a record  of all of those, you know,  voice votes on each of  the attachments?  I think Mike  She does and we'll assist  and we will also go back to the tape if we need to.  Great. Thank you. Just clarifying that.  And then Mike highlighted them as we were going through.  If I may, the one  I wasn't so clear on, this was all passes  one bundle, just to clarify the name? Yes.  Okay. I think we have them all highlighted on this page.  Okay. Wonderful. Thank you.  Thank you.  So with that, I'm going to refrain from  repeating the motion, but  hoping everybody in the audience got  that.  All in favor signify by saying aye.  Aye.  Any opposed?  So that motion carries 5-0  with two absent. Thank you.  We will move on to  next item of the agenda.  Reports and communications?  None, Madam Chair. Just to remind you,  you have a big hearing coming up at your  next meeting, which will be July 21st.  Okay. So that's  a hotel proposal  and we expect to have a full house.  Any chance that the City Clerk's office  would consider  lifting the drinks and snacks  prohibition for  the Commission during that meeting?  I don't, I've asked before.  Okay. All right. They were pretty, after they  redid the chambers, they were pretty sensitive.  All right. So  we will adjourn to the meeting of the  21st because  the meeting of Thursday, July 7th  is canceled. Thank you.  We did it.  Good job, team. Good job, team.  Thank you.
